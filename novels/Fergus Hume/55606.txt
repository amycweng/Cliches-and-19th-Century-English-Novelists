in the first year of the present century two gentlemen were seated on the terrace of the mansion known as royabay a small rosewood table was placed between the deep armchairs and thereon appeared wine coffee and a box of cigars the young host smoked a briar and sipped coffee but his guest very wisely devoted himself to superlative port and a fragrant cigar major tidman was a battered old soldier of fortune who appreciated good quarters and made the most of civilised luxuries when other people paid for them he had done full justice to a dinner admirably cooked and served while ainsleigh the master of the feast had merely trifled with his food now the wary tidman gave himself up to the perfect enjoyment of wine cigar and the quiet evening while his host restlessly changed his position a dozen times in ten minutes and gloomed misanthropically at the beautiful surroundings and these were very beautiful from the mossgrown terrace shallow steps descended to smooth lawns and rainbowhued flowerbeds and solemn pines girdled the open space wherein the house was set and under the radiance of a saffron coloured sky stood the house grey with centuries of wind and weather bleaching sun and drenching rains with its tudor battlements casements diamondpaned and low oriel windows half obliterated escutcheons its drapery of green ivy and heavy ironclamped doors it looked venerable picturesque and peaceful tennyson sang in the palace of art of just such a quiet english home the haunt of ancient peace on the left the circle of trees receded to reveal the majestic ruins of an abbey which had supplied the stones used to construct the mansion built by the weak but pious henry iii the normanfrench name boyabbaye kings abbey still designated the house of the courtier who had obtained the monastery from another henry less pious and more prone to destroy than to build the country folk had corrupted the name to royabay and its significance was almost lost but the owner of this fair domain knew its meaning and loved the ancient place which had been in the ainsleigh family for over three hundred years and he loved it the more as there was a possibility of its passing away from him altogether rupert was the last of the old line poor in relations and poorer still in money till the reign of george the first the ainsleighs had been rich and famous but from the time of the hanovarian advent their fortunes declined charles ainsleigh had thrown in his lot with the unlucky stewarts and paid for his loyalty so largely as to cripple those who succeeded him augustus the regency buck wasted still further the diminished property he inherited and a victorian ainsleigh proved to be just such another spendthrift followed this wastrel gilbert more thrifty who strove but vainly to restore the waning fortunes of his race his son markham endeavouring to acquire wealth for the same purpose went to the far east but he died in chinamurdered according to family traditionand on hearing the news his widow sickened and died leaving an only child to battle with the ancestral curse for a curse there was as dire as that which overshadowed the house of atreus and the superstitious believedand with much reasonthat young rupert as one of the ainsleighs had to bear the burden of the terrible anathema major tidman knew all these things very well but being modern and sceptical and grossly material he discredited such occult influence expressing his scornful surprise that rupert should trouble his head about such fantasies he delivered his opinion in the loud free dictatorial speech which was characteristic of the bluff soldier bunkum said the major sipping his wine with relish because an old monk driven to his last fortifications curses those who burnt him you believe that his jabber has an effect on the ainsleighs they have been very unlucky since said rupert gloomily not a bit of itnot a bit the curse of abbot raoul didnt begin to workif work it did which i for one dont believeuntil many a long day after this place came to your family i was born in this neighbourhood sixty and more years ago added the major and i know the history of your family the ainsleighs were lucky enough till annes reign till the first georges reign corrected the young man so far as money goes that is but not one of them died in his bed plenty have died in their beds since but have lost all their money retorted rupert its better to lose money than life said tidman evasively im not so certain of that major but you should talk with mrs pettley about abbot raouls curse she believes in it and you ainsleigh rupert shrugged his shoulders we certainly seem to be most unlucky said he declining to commit himself to an opinion want of brains snapped the major who was one of those men who have a reason for everything your people wasted their money and refused to soil their hands with trade such pigheadedness brings about misfortune without the aid of a silly old fools curse i dont think abbot raoul was a fool protested the host mildly on the contrary he is said to have been a learned and clever man aymas ainsleigh received the abbey from henry viii and burnt abbot raoul in his own cloisters he nodded towards the ruins you can see the blackened square of grass yonder as a proof of the curse herbage will not grow there and never will till the curse be lifted huh said the major with supreme contempt any chance of that rupert smiled a chance that will never occur i fear the curse or prophecy or whatever you like to call it i call it rubbish interpolated the sceptic well doubting thomas it runs like thisrude enough verse as you will see but you cant expect a doomed man to be particular as to literary style and rupert recited slowly my curse from the tyrants will never depart for a sword in the hands of the angel flashes till ainsleigh poor weds the poor maid of his heart and gold be brought forth from the holy ashes i spare you the ancient pronunciation major tidman filled another glass with wine and laughed scornfully i expect the old monk made up the second line to rhyme with ashes he said expanding his broad chest ive heard that rubbishy poetry before but havent the ainsleighs always married poor girls some did but then they had money it must be a poor ainsleigh to wed a poor girl to fulfil the third line my father and grandfather were both poor but they married rich brides and what became of the cash it wenti dont know howbut it went gold turns to dry leaves in the hands of fools said tidman sagely theres some sense in the old fairy tales but the fourth line how can you get gold from ashes young ainsleigh rose and began to pace the terrace im sure i dont know he said thats the curse if i marry miss rayner i certainly fulfil the third line she is poor and i am a pauper perhaps when the enigma of the third line is solved by such a marriage the fourth line will be made clear i shouldnt hang on to that poetry if i were you ainsleigh let some one else solve the third line and the fourth also if he likes my advice to you is to marry a dollar heiress rupert looked savage i love miss rayner and i marry her or no one tidman selected another cigar carefully i think you are wrong said he decisively you have only a small income its true but you have this grand old place a fine old name and you aint badlooking i guess miss jonathan of nyrk would just jump at you i love olivia rayner repeated ainsleigh doggedly but the obstacles my dear don quixote argued the major lighting the cigar you are poor and she at the most will inherit only a few hundreds a year from that aunt of hers and that mass of granite miss wharf dont like you nor does her companion the pewsey cat why do you call her a catthe harmless creature because she is a cat said tidman sturdily shed scratch if she got a chance for all her velvet paws but she hates you as old miss wharf does then theres lady jabe oh heavens said rupert and made a wry face you may well say that shes a bullying amazon of uncertain age but shell do her best to catch olivia for her nephew chris walker oh hes a nice enough fellow said rupert still pacing the terrace ive got nothing to say against him except that hed better keep out of my way and after all olivia would never marry a clerk in a tea merchants firm but hes nephew to lady jabe what of that shes only the widow of a knight and hasnt a penny to leave him why should she want him to marry olivia because miss wharf will leave olivia five hundred a year lady jabe will then live on the young couple and see here ainsleigh if you marry olivia with that income you wont be taking to wife the poor girl mentioned in the curse oh hang the curse said rupert crossly by all means said tidman serenely you didnt bring me here to talk of that did you no i want to ask your advice ive given itunasked marry a dollarheiress and let old jabe make olivia her nieceinlaw by doing so you will be released from your pecuniary difficulties and will also escape the hatred of miss wharf and that pewsey cat who both hate you i wonder why they do hum said tidman discreetly he knew pretty well why miss wharf hated his host but he was too wise to speak something to do with a love affair whats that got to do with me ask me another replied major tidman vulgarly for he was not going to tell a fiery young man like rupert that markham ainsleigh ruperts father was mixed up in the romance and i wish you would sit down he went on irritably youre walking like a cat on hot bricks whats the matter with you whats the matter echoed ainsleigh returning to the armchair i asked you here to tell you wait till i have another glass now fire ahead but rupert did not accept the invitation immediately he looked at the lovely scene spread out before him and up to the sky which was now of a pale primrose colour there was a poetic vein in young ainsleigh but troubles from his earliest childhood had stultified it considerably ever since he left college had he battled to keep the old place but now it seemed as if all his trouble had been in vain he explained his circumstances to the major and that astute warrior listened to a long tale of mortgages threatened to be foreclosed of the sale of old and valuable furniture and of the disposal of family jewels but this last mortgage will finish me said rupert in conclusion i cant raise the money to pay it off miss wharf will foreclose and then all the creditors will come down on me the deluge will come in spite of all i can do major tidman stared do you mean to say that miss wharf she holds the mortgage and she hates you said tidman his eyes bulging huh this is a nice kettle of fish rupert threw himself back in the deep chair with an angry look he was a tall finely built young man of twentyfive of saxon fairness with clear blue eyes and a skin tanned by an outdoor life in spite of his poverty and perhaps because of it he was accurately dressed by a crack london tailor and looked singularly handsome in his wellfitting evening suit pulling his welltrimmed fair moustache he eyed the tips of his neat patent leather shoes gloomily and waited to hear what the major had to say that warrior ruminated and puffed himself out like the frog in the fable tidman was thickset and stout baldheaded and plethoric he had a long grey moustache which he tugged at viciously and on the whole looked a comfortable old gentleman peaceful enough when let alone but his face was that of a fighter and his grey eyes were hot and angry all over the world had the major fought and his rank had been gained in south america with enough to live on he had returned to the cot where he was born and was passing his declining days very pleasantly having known rupert for many years and ruperts father before him he usually gave his advice when it was asked for and knew more about the young mans affairs than anyone else did but the extent of the ruin as revealed by the late explanation amazed him whats to be done he asked thats what i wish you to suggest said rupert grimly things are coming to a climax and perhaps when the last ainsleigh is driven from home abbot raoul will rest quiet in his grave his ghost walks you know ask mrs pettley shes seen it or him stuffstuffstuff grumbled the major staring let the ghost and the curse and all that rubbish alone whats to be done well said the young man meditatively either i must sell up and clear out to seek my fortune leaving olivia to marry young walker or or what asked tidman seeing rupert hesitating for answer ainsleigh took a pocketbook from the lower ledge of the table and produced therefrom a slip of printed paper i cut that out of the daily telegraph said he handing it to the major what do you make of it tidman mounted a gold pincenez and read aloud as follows the jade fan of mandarin lokeong with the four and half beads and the yellow cord wealth and long life to the holder who gives it to hwei but death and the doom of the god kwangho to that one who refuses address kansu at the josshouse of the five thousand blessings perry street whitechapel a mixture of the far east and the near west isnt it asked rupert when the major laid down the slip and stared lokeong said tidman searching his memory wasnt that the man your father knew the same that is why i cut out the slip and why i asked you to see me you remember my fathers expedition to china of course he went there twenty years ago when you were five years of age i was home at the timeit was just before i went to fight in that janjalla republic war in south america i wanted your father to come with me and see if he couldnt make money but he was bent on china well said rupert i understood he knew of a goldmine there yes on the hwei river major tidman snatched the slip of print and read the lines again and heres the name hweithats strange but whats stranger still said rupert bending forward is that i looked up some papers of my father and learn that the hwei river is in the kansu province address kansu murmured tidman staring harder than ever yes it seems as though this had something to do with your father it must have something to do with him insisted rupert my father found that goldmine near the hwei river in the kansu province and lokeong was the boxer leader who protected my father from the enmity of the chinese i believe he sent my fathers papers to englandat least so dr forge says forge cried tidman rising quite so he was with your father why not see him and ask questions ill do so perhaps he may tell me something about this fan what if he does i might find it and if you do asked the major his eyes protruding rupert sprang to his feet and took up the slip wealth and long life to the holder who gives it to hwei he read then replaced the slip in his pocketbook why shouldnt i find that fan and get enough money to pay off miss wharf and others and keep royabay but its such a mad idea i dont see it if it hadnt to do with my father it would be said ainsleigh lighting his pipe but my father knew lokeong and by the names hwei and kansu it seems as though the locality of the goldmine had something to do with the matter ill see old forge and try to find this fan oh said tidman a light breaking on him you think lokeong may have given the fan to your father yes and forge may know what luggage and papers were sent home at the time my father died was murdered you mean we cant be sure of that said rupert his face flushing but ill find that out and get hold of the fan also its my chance to make money and i believe providence has opened this way to me chapter ii dr forge royabay was distant five miles from marport a rising watering place on the essex coast in fact so large was the town and so many the visitors that it might be said to be quite risen though the inhabitants insisted that it had not yet attained the height it yet would reach but be this as it may marport was popular and fashionable and many retired gentlepeople lived in spacious houses along the cliffs and in the suburbs the ancient town which lay in a hollow was left to holiday trippers and these came in shoals during the summer months there was the usual pier the kursaal the theatre many bathing machines and many boarding housesin fact the usual sort of things which go to make up a popular wateringplace and the town had been in existencethe new part at all eventsfor only fifteen years like jonahs gourd it had sprung up in a night but it certainly showed no signs of withering in fact its attractions increased yearly major tidman was a wise man and had not travelled over the world with his eyes shut he had seen colonial towns spring up and fade away and knew how the value of land increases thus when he returned to his own country with a certain sum of money he expended the same in buying land and in building thereon this policy produced a lot of money with which the major bought more land and more houses now he possessed an avenue of desirable villa residences in the suburbs which brought him in a good income and which by reason of their situation were never empty the major did not live here himself he was a bachelor and fond of company therefore he took up his quarters in the bristol hotel the most fashionable in marport as he had shares in the company which built it he managed to obtain his rooms at a comparatively moderate rate here he lived all the year round save when he took a trip to the continent and as the bristol was always full of people the major did not lack company as he was a goodhumoured little man with plenty of small talk and a fund of outoftheway information he soon became immensely popular in this way the crafty major had all the comforts of home and the delights of society without bearing the burden of an establishment of his own his sole attendant was a weatherbeaten oneeyed man who acted as his valet and who knew how to hold his tongue sometimes the major would walk up town and inspect his property with great pride it was balm to his proud heart to walk up and down the spacious avenue and survey the red brick villas smiling amidst trim gardens tidmans birth was humblehis father had been a small tenant farmer of the ainsleighsand he had started life without even the proverbial shilling for many years he was absent from his native land and returned to find fortune waiting for him on the door step to be sure he brought a nestegg home with him nevertheless but for his astuteness in buying land and in building he would not have acquired such a good income so the major had some cause for self congratulation when he paced up and down tidmans avenue two days after his dinner with rupert ainsleigh the major spick and span as usualhe always looked as though he had stepped out of a bandboxwas strutting up the avenue half way along he came face to face with a withered little woman who looked like the bad fairy of the old nursery tales she wore a poke bonnet a black dress and strange to say a scarlet shawl her age might have been about fiftyfive but she looked even older with her dress picked up and holding a flower in her hand she came mincing along smiling at the world with a puckered face and out of a pair of very black and brilliant eyes she looked a quaint oldfashioned gentlewoman of the sort likely to possess a good income for it seemed that no pauper would have dared to dress in so shabby and oldfashioned a manner consequently it was strange that the gallant major should have showed a disposition to turn tail when he set eyes on her she might indeed have been the veritable witch she looked so pale turned major tidmans ruddy face but the old dame was not going to let him escape in this way oh good morning she said in a sharp voice like a saw how well you are looking dear major tidmanreally so very well i never saw you look younger the rose in your buttonhole is not more blooming how do you keep your youth so i remember you but the major cut her short he had enough of flattering words which he guessed she did not mean and didnt want her to remember anything for he knew her memory extended disagreeably to the time when he had been a poor and humble nobody im in a hurry miss pewsey he said twirling his stick goodmorning maammorning if youre going to see dr forge said miss pewsey her black eyes glittering like jet ive just come from his house he is engaged i can wait i suppose miss pewsey said tidman bristling that is supposing i am calling on the doctor then you really are not on account of your health im sure i do hope you arent ill dear major we all look forward to you shining at the ball which is to take place at the hotel bristol i may be there miss pewsey i may be therein fact the major flourished his stick again i am one of the stewards miss pewsey clapped together a pair of small claws encased in shabby cotton gloves there she cried in a shriller voice than ever i knew it i said so to my sophia of course you know i always call dear miss wharf my sophia we have been friends for yearsoh yes for years we grew on one stem and youll excuse me maam oh yesi know you are so busy but i was saying that you can give me a ticket for my nephew mr burgh the tickets are for sale at the hotel said tidman gruffly yes but my poor nephew is poor he also has come from foreign parts major as you did and just as poor you must give him a ticketoh really you must miss pewsey spoke with an emphasis on every other word and between her teeth as though she was trying to prevent the speech escaping too rapidly now major she coaxed ill see maamill see oh i knew you would she clasped her hands again come and see my sophiadear miss wharf and then you can give clarencethats my nephews name sweet isnt ityou can give him the ticket but dont bring him added miss pewsey jerking her old head backward in the direction of dr forges residence hes there who is there maam demanded the major with a start why that horrid mr ainsleigh and miss pewsey got no further the major uttered something naughty under his breath and taking off his hat with a flourish bowed his way along the road pursued by the shrill injunctions of the lady not to forget the ticket tidman walked more rapidly and less jauntily than usual and stopped at dr forges gate to wipe his red face which had now assumed its normal colour by george said the old soldier that woman will marry me if i dont take care she aint safeshe shouldnt be allowed out pewseya cata cati always said so lavinia pewsey cat to benjamin tidman gentleman not if i know itughugh and he walked up the steps to ring the bell while waiting his thoughts went from miss pewsey to rupert i thought he had gone to town about that fan business said the major fretting whats he doing calling on forge without telling me and tidman seemed very much annoyed that rupert should have taken such a liberty true enough he found young ainsleigh sitting with dr forge the doctor was a tall lean man with sad eyes and a stiff manner he was dressed in a loose white flannel suit in a most unprofessional way but everyone knew that forge had money and did not practise save when the fancy took him with his watchful grey eyes and sad face and lantern jaws forge was not a prepossessing object or a medical attendant to be desired also his hands had a clawlike look which added to his thin hooked nose made him look like a hawk he spoke very little though and what he did say was to the point but he was not popular like the major a greater contrast than this mummy and handsome young ainsleigh can scarcely be imagined the major came puffing into the room and looked around it was a small apartment furnished with chinese curiosities ricepaper painted in the conventional chinese fashion adorned the walls a manytasseled lantern gay with colour dangled from the roof and in each corner of the room a fat mandarin squatted on a pedestal the furniture was of bamboo and straw matting covered the floor a bookcase filled with medical volumes looked somewhat out of place in this eastern room as did the doctors writing table a large one covered with papers and books and strange looking chinese scrips the room was as queer as its owner and the atmosphere had that indescribable eastern smell which the major remembered to have sniffed up at canton under disagreeable circumstances perhaps it was the revival of an unpleasant memory that made him sit down so suddenly or it might have been the cold grey stony eyes of forge well major said rupert who looked handsome and gay in flannels and who seemed to have lost his melancholy looks who would have thought of seeing you here i came to ask forge to keep the exterior of his house a little more tidy said the major with dignity the steps have not been cleaned this morning and there is straw in the garden while the shrubs and flowers are dying for want of water forge shrugged his thin shoulders and nodded towards some eggshell china cups and a quaint looking teapot but he did not speak no replied the major to the silent invitation i never drink tea in the afternoon or at any time said forge in a melancholy way i know you of old ainsleigh take another cup not in the chinese fashion said rupert smiling you drink it too hot for my taste and i like milk and sugar but now ive told you about the fan ill leave you to chat with tidman the fan said tidman sitting up as straight as his stoutness would let him ah yesi forgot about that well well echoed rupert lighting a cigarette i called at the joss house in perry street whitechapel and a nice sort of den it is a chinaman heard my explanation about my fathers connection with lokeong and then told me that the fan had been stolen from that gentleman who is now a mandarin lokeong was well on the way to the highest post when i saw him last said forge preparing a roll of tobacco he was much in favour at the court but i thought he was a boxer said tidman and surely oh he gave up the boxers and curried favour with the dowager empress that was seven years ago when i was last in china i met you there tidman again the disagreeable recollection of canton crossed the majors memory and he nodded what about the fan he asked rupert again its of great value said ainsleigh at least this chinaman told me so lokeong is now a mandarin and is high in favour with the dowager empress and consequently is hated by the emperor murmured forge i dont know doctor im not up in chinese politics however the fan was lost by lokeong some years ago and being a sacred fan he wants it back this chinaman tungyu oh said the major then you didnt see hwei or kansu those are names of a river and a province said the doctor i know snapped tidman but they were in the advertisement tungyu explained that they were used only for the purpose of advertisement said rupert but to make a long story short i told him that i had seen the fan you saw the fan asked tidman directing a side look at forge a dreama dream said the doctor no insisted the young man i feel sure i have seen that fan i cant think where perhaps it is amongst my fathers effects sent from china by lokeong years ago twenty years ago said dr forge and lokeong would hardly send his own fan i remember the things coming i came home immediately before a chinaman brought your fathers papers and luggage to royabay he left them with your mother and went away were you not with my father when he died asked rupert i always understood you were no i was at pekin at the time your father and i were working the mine together and i went about some imperial concessions while there i heard that your father was dead was he murdered asked rupert earnestly i really cant say lokeong said that he died of dysentery but he was always a liar he wouldnt be so high in favour with the court if he wasnt lying is a fine art in the far east and yesyes said tidman impatiently but what has all this to do with the fan i think its all of a piece myself said rupert and i intend to get to the bottom of it i have seen that fan somewherebut i cant thinki cant he reflected and shook his head no but i have seen it doctor so its no use your shrugging your shoulders i want to find it and get that five thousand pounds what cried the major leaping up on his stout little legs lokeong is willing to give five thousand pounds for the return of his fan said ainsleigh who had walked to the door and i intend to earn it against my advice said forge looking up oddly rupert laughed oh you are afraid he said smiling of you not of myself i know what the chinese are and have studied the race for years i know how to deal with them but you will get into trouble if you meddle with this fan business and so i say cried tidman emphatically why what do you know of the chinese major asked rupert more than i like to think of said the little man wiping his bald head i went out to china for a trip seven years ago and met with an adventure in cantonugh what sort of an adventure ugh grunted the major again dont talk about it it makes me cold to think of it the chinese are demons forge got me out of the trouble and i left china never to set foot in it again i hope ainsleigh if you want that curse of yours to be realised meddle with the fan but if you want to keep your life and your skin leave the matter alone im going to get that five thousand pounds said rupert obstinately as soon as i can recollect where i saw that fan the memory will come back to me i am sure it will doctor you wont help me no said forge decisively i advise you to leave the matter alone in that case i must search it out myself goodday and ainsleigh strolled out of the room lightheartedly enough as he whistled a gay tune major tidman looked grimly at the closed door and then still more grimly at the doctor who was paring his nails our young friend is ambitious he said forge laughed gently you can hardly blame him he wants to marry miss rayner and save his ancestral home so i am quite sure he will search for the fan he wont find it then said the major petulantly wont he questioned forge sweetly well perhaps not by the way you want to see me major mrs bressy tells me you called at least twice yesterday yes she didnt know when you would be back i never tell her i like to take the old lady unawares she is a dickens character with a fondness for drink and for taking things which dont belong to her i always go away and come back unexpectedly yesterday i was in paris now i am at marport well the major had contained himself with difficulty all this time and had grown very red in the face the colour changed to a lively purple as he burst out see here forge whats the use of talking to me in this way you have that fan have i said forge smiling gently yes you know well enough that the very fanthe jade fan with the five beads was the cause of my getting into trouble in canton you got me out of the trouble and you asked me to give you the fan when i thanked you and you refused said forge still smiling well i did at first said tidman sulkily i risked my life over the beastly thing and forge raised a thin hand spare yourself the recital i know well then went on tidman excitedly you asked again for it when you came home and i gave it to you ainsleigh is quite right he did see the fan i showed it to him one day before you arrived i see he has forgotten but any stray thought may revive his memory i dont want him to have the fan why not asked forge shutting his knife with a click because i want the five thousand pounds for myself im not so well off as people think and i want you forget said forge gently you gave me the fan and have you got it i have he nodded towards a cabinet of chinese work adorned with quaint figures its in there give it to me back no i think ill keep it what do you want to do with it asked tidman angrily forge rose and looked stern i want to keep it from lokeong he said savagely theres some secret connected with that fan i cant understand what the secret is or what the fan has to do with it but it means life and death to this mandarin hed give ten thousandtwenty thousand to get that fan back but he shant oh groaned the major why did i give it to you to think that such a lot of money should go begging if i had only known what the fan was worth you knew nothing about it save as a curiosity how do you know demanded the major forge who had turned towards the cabinet wheeled round and looked more like a hawk than ever as he pounced on the stout man what do you know and he clawed tidmans plump shoulders let me go confound you blustered the major what do you mean by assaulting a gentleman a gentleman forge suddenly released the major and laughed softly does benjamin tidman old farmer tidmans son call himself so why i remember you yes i know you do and so does that infernal pewsey cat forge suddenly became attentive miss pewsey if you please she is my friend i may forge halted and swallowed something i may even marry her some day what shouted tidman backing to the wall that oldold gently my good benjamin gently butbut youre not a marrying man we never know what we are till we die said forge turning again towards the black cabinet but you neednt mention what i have said if you do forge snarled like an angry cat and shot one glance from his gray eyes that made tidman shiver then he resumed his gentle tone about this fan ill make a bargain with you whats that asked the major avariciously ill show you the fan and if you can guess its secret ill let you give it to this tungyu or hwei or kansu or whatever he likes to call himself but you dont want lokeong to have the fan said the major doubtfully forge opened the cabinet slowly so long as i learn the secret he can have the fan i want to ruin him hes a devil andah he started back the fanthe fan what is it asked tidman craning over forges shoulder at an empty drawer where is the fan lost cried forge furiously and looked like a dangerous grey rat five thousand pounds gone moaned the major my life you foolmy life cried the doctor it is at stake chapter iii miss wharf at home the best houses in marport were situated on the cliffs they stood a considerable way back and had small plots of ground before them cultivated or not according to the taste of those who owned them some of these gardens were brilliant with flowers others had nothing but shrubs in them presenting rather a sombre appearance and a few were bare sunburnt grass plots with no adornment whatsoever a broad road divided the gardens from the grassy undulations of the cliffs and along this thoroughfare rolled carriages bicycles and motorcars all day during the season then came the grass on the clifftops which stretched for a long distance and which was dotted with shelters for nervous invalids at one end there was a round bandstand where redcoated musicians played lively airs from the latest musical comedy round the stand were rows of chairs hired out at twopence an afternoon and indeed all over the lawns seats of various kinds were scattered at the end of the grass the cliffs sloped gradually and were intersected with winding paths which led downward to the asphalt esplanade which ran along the waters edge when the tide was high and beside evilsmelling mud when the tide was out and on what was known as the beacha somewhat gritty strandwere many bathing machines such was the general appearance of marport which the essex people looked on as a kind of brighton only much better miss sophia wharf owned a cosy little house at the far end of the cliffs and just at the point where marport begins to melt into the country it was a modern house comfortably furnished and brilliant with electric lights the garden in front of it was well taken care of there were scarlet and white shades to the windows and flower boxes filled with blossoms on the sills everyone who passed remarked on the beauty of the house and miss wharf was always pleased when she heard them envy her possessions she liked to possess a naboths vineyard of her own and appreciated it the more when others would have liked to take it she had an income of one thousand a year and therefore could live very comfortably the house ivy lodge was its highly original name was her own bought in the days when marport was nothing but a fishing village she knew everyone in the neighbourhood was a staunch friend to the vicar who was high church and quite after her own heart in the use of banners incense candles and sidealtars and on the whole was one of the leading ladies of the place she had the reputation of being charitable but this was owing to miss pewsey who constantly trumpeted the bestowal of any stray shilling being by her patroness miss wharf was a lady of good family but had quarrelled with her relatives she was a tall cold blonde woman who had once been handsome and still retained a certain portion of good looks in spite of her forty and more years she lived with her niece olivia the child of a sister long since dead and with miss pewsey to whom she gave a home as a companion but miss wharf well knew that lavinia pewsey was worth her weight in gold owing to the way she praised up her good kind devoted loving sweet friend the adjectives are miss pewseys own but some people said that sophia wharf did not deserve to have them attached to her the lady had her enemies and these openly declared as the major had done that she was a mass of granite other people less prejudiced urged that miss wharf looked after olivia who was a penniless orphan to which the grumblers retorted that miss wharf liked someone to vent her temper on and that the poor girl being too pretty did duty as a whipping boy this was possibly true for olivia and her aunt did not get on well together in her own way the girl looked as cold as miss wharf but this coldness was merely a mask to hide a warm and loving nature while miss wharf was an iceberg through and through however on the whole sophia wharf was well liked and took care to make the most of her looks and her moderate income and her reputation as a charitable lady and miss pewsey was the showwoman who displayed her patronesss points to their best advantage the drawingroom of ivy lodge was a flimsy pretty feminine room furnished in a gimcrack fashion of the high art style the floor was waxed and covered with persian praying mats the chairs were gilt and had spindle legs the settee was empire the piano was encased in green wood and adorned with much brass the sofa was louis quinze and covered with brocade and there were many tables of rosewood dainty and light heaped high with useless nickknacks the walls of pale green were adorned with watercolour pictures and many mirrors draped with liberty silk everywhere were large bowls of flowers miniatures of miss wharf at various times of her life curiosities from china and japan and the near east and all sorts of odds and ends which miss wharf had collected on her travels not that she had been to the east for the evidences of civilisation in those lands came from dr forge and major tidman but miss wharf had explored germany switzerland and italy and consequently had brought home cuckooclocks quaint carvings pictures of the madonna etruscan idols and such like things with which every tourist loads himself or herself the result was that the drawingroom looked like a curiosity shop but it was considered to be one of the prettiest drawingrooms in essex miss wharf looked too large and too substantial for the frail furniture of the room she had a double chin and was certainly very stout very wisely she had a special armchair placed in the windowfrom which she could see all that was going onand here she sat working most of the day she was great on doing fancy articles for bazaars and silk ties for such gentlemen as she admired for miss wharf old maid as she was liked male society the major was her great admirer so was young walker lady jabes nephew sophia was not very sure of this last gentleman as she shrewdly suspectedprompted by miss pewseythat he admired olivia rupert also admired olivia and wanted to marry her a proceeding which miss wharf objected to miss pewsey supported her in this for both women were envious of the youth which had passed from them for ever but miss wharf had also another reason which miss pewsey knew but of which olivia was ignorant hitherto sophia had kept it from the girl but this afternoon in a fit of rage she let it out the explosion did not come at once for lady jabe was in the room drinking tea and miss pewsey was flitting about filling odd vases with flowers olivia sat on the settee very straight and very cold looking dark and handsome and altogether too splendid a woman for her aunt to tolerate cant you do something said miss wharf turning her jealous eyes on the girl i should think you must be tired twiddling your thumbs all day ill do whatever you wish me to do said olivia coldly then help lavinia with the flowers olivia rose to do so but miss pewsey refused her assistance in a shrill speech spoken as usual between her teeth and with an emphasis on every other word oh no dear dear sophia cried miss pewsey i have just finished and i may say that my eye for colour is better than oliviasyou dont mind my saying so darling she added to the girl not at all replied miss rayner who detested the sycophant i never give the matter a thought you should think said lady jabe joining in heavily she was a tall masculinelooking woman with grey hair and bushy grey eyebrows and with an expression of face that suggested she should have worn a wig and sat on the bench she dressed in rather a manly way and far too young for her fifty years on the present occasion she wore a yachtingcap a shirt with a standup all round collar and a neat bow a leather belt and a bicycling skirt of blue serge her boots and shoes were of tanned brown leather and she carried a bamboo cane instead of a sunshade no one could have been more gentlemanly you should think added she once more for instance you should think of marriage miss wharf drew herself up in her cold way i fancy that olivia few brains as she has is yet wise enough not to think of marriage at twenty it would not be much good if i did said olivia calmly i have no money and young men want a rich wife not all said lady jabe theres chris chris is out of the question said miss rayner quickly and pray why is he asked sophia in arms at once she never liked olivia to have an opinion of her own because i dont love him but chris loves you said lady jabe and really hes getting a very good salary in that teamerchants office chris as you are aware olivia is foreign corresponding clerk to kumgum li co he knows chinese finished lady jabe with tremendous emphasis oh miss pewsey threw up her claws how delicious to be made love to in chinese i must really ask mr walker what is the chinese for i love you olivia prefers to hear it in english said miss wharf spitefully quite so aunt retorted her niece her colour rising but dont you think we might change the subject it really isnt very interesting but indeed i think it is said lady jabe smartly i come here to plead the cause of poor chris his heart is breaking your aunt is willing to but i am not said miss rayner quickly so please let us say no more about the matter mr walker can marry lotty dean but shes a grocers daughter said lady jabe who was herself the widow of an oilmerchant and remember my title lotty isnt going to marry you lady jabe nor chris if i can help it said the other grimly miss wharf was just about to crush olivia with a particularly disagreeable remark when the door opened and two gentlemen entered one was christopher walker a slim boyishlooking young fellow in that callow stage of manhood which sees beauty in every woman the other who followed was miss pewseys nephew there was nothing immature about him although he was but twenty eight years of age clarence burgh was tall thin dark and had the appearance of a swashbuckler as he swaggered into the room his black eyes snapped with an unholy light and his speech smacked too much of the lands at the back of beyond where he had passed the most part of his life he was an expert rider and daily rode a bucking squealing kicking stallion up and down the road or took long gallops into the country to reduce the fire of the unruly beast burgh was bad all through daring free bold and had a good deal of the untamed savage about him but he was emphatically a man and it was this virile atmosphere about him which caused his withered aunt to adore him and indeed miss wharf admired him also as did many of the women in marport clarence looked like a buccaneer who would carry a woman off and knock her down if she objected to his lovemaking women like that sort of dominating lord of the world and accordingly mr burgh had nothing to complain of so far as feminine admiration went during his sojourn in marport but he had set his affections on olivia and hitherto she had shrunk from him all the same brute as he was she admired him more than she did effeminate chris walker who smacked of the city and of a featherbedfourmealsaday existence oh squeaked miss pewsey flying to the hero and clasping him round the neck how very very sweet of you to come hadnt anything else to do said clarence gracefully casting himself into a chair all his movements were graceful like those of a panther how are you miss wharfmiss raynerlady jabe i guess you all look like a garden of spring flowers this day but flowers we may not pluck sighed chris prettily burgh looked at him with contempt i reckon a man can pick what he has a mind to said he drily and then shifted his gaze to see how olivia took this speech to his secret annoyance she did not let on she heard him will you have some tea mr burgh asked miss wharf thanks it seems to be the sort of thing one must drink here you drank it in china didnt you asked lady jabe burgh turned quickly who told you i had been in china he asked my nephew chris he heard you talking chinese to someone the dark young man looked distinctly annoyed when was that he asked chris two weeks ago replied the other you were standing at the corner of the mansion house talking to a chinaman i only caught a word or two in passing and i guess you didnt understand said clarence derisively there you are wrong i am in a chinese firm and know the language as a matter of fact i write their foreign letters for them the deuce you do murmured burgh looking rather disturbed but he said no more on the subject and merely enquired if the ladies were prepared for the ball at the bristol which was to take place in six days i hear its going to be a bully affair oh charmingcharming said miss pewsey major tidman is one of the stewards i asked him for a ticket for you clarence dear ill go if miss rayner will dance with me i dont know that i am going myself said olivia quietly nonsense said her aunt sharply of course you are going everyone is goingthe best ball of the season even poor little me said miss pewsey with her elderly head on one side huh said the irreverent clarence aint you past hoppin aunt i can look on and admire the younger generation dear it will be a splendid ball prattled chris sipping his tea and devouring very crumbly cake the glorious golfers are going to spend a lot of money in decorating the rooms i met mr ainsleigh he is goinga rare thing for him he goes nowhere as a rule miss wharf glanced sharply at her niece but beyond a faint flush she could detect no sign of emotion people who are as poor as young ainsleigh cant afford to go out she said deliberately i think the wisest thing that young man could do would be to marry a rich girl and she again looked at olivia he is certainly very handsome said lady jabe pensively very much like his mother she was a finelooking woman one of the vanes of heathersham i remember her said miss wharf her colour rising and i never thought she was goodlooking myself not to compare to you dear said the sycophant but this time miss pewsey made a mistake the remark did not seem to please miss wharf i dont care for comparisons she said sharply its bad taste to make them i like mr ainsleigh but i dont approve of his idling he has never been brought up to do anything said lady jabe then he ought to turn his hands to making money in some way that place is mortgaged and at any time may be sold then he wont have a roof over his head i have never met ainsleigh said burgh musingly i guess id like to have a jaw along o him wasnt his father murdered in china miss wharf became suddenly pale it is said that he was but i dont believe it then hes alive said clarence pertinaciously and looking at her no hes dead but he died of dysentery according to dr forge who was with him when he diedsomewhere in the north i believe burgh evidently stored this in his memory and looked keenly at the woman whose bosom rose and fell and whose colour came and went under his steady gaze miss pewsey saw that the persistent look was annoying her patroness and touched her nephews arm gently the touch recalled burgh to his senses and he looked away this time his eyes rested on olivia her colour was high and apparently she had been listening with interest to the conversation huh thought the swashbuckler and it was about young ainsleigh and he stored this in his memory also to make a sensation which he dearly loved to do chris walker announced that he would bring a distinguished visitor to the ball of the glorious golfers hes a chinaman said he pompously and was mixed up in the boxer rebellion none of the ladies seemed impressed as none of them knew anything about the boxers or their rebellion but burgh looked up who is he anyhow he demanded compressing his lips a chinese gentleman called tungyu what a very extraordinary name said miss pewsey and suddenly began to take a deep interest in matters chinese while she chatted with chris who was willing to afford her all information burgh folded his arms and leaned back apparently thinking deeply his face was not pleasant to behold olivia saw the evil look and shivered then she rose and was about to steal from the room when her aunt called to her sharply dont go olivia i want to speak with you and i want to take my usual walk said lady jabe rising and settling her collar chris a tap on the shoulder brought the slim young man to his feet and giving his arm to his masculine aunt the two departed burgh rose also i guess ill make tracks also he said smartly walker you and i can have a yarn together later miss pewsey followed her nephew to the door do you wish to ask young mr walker more about tungyu she asked clarence wheeled round quickly what do you know of him aunt its such a strange name simpered miss pewsey looking very innocent and i am interested in china you were out there a long time clarence amongst other places yes i hung round a bit then you must tell me all about the natives said miss pewsey i want to know of their robes and their fans and fans said burgh starting but miss pewsey with an artificial laugh flitted back into the room leaving him uneasy and nonplussed he walked away frowning darkly olivia would have walked away also frowning as she was indignant at the way in which her aunt had spoken of rupert but miss wharf gave her no chance of leaving the room or the house olivia had never seen her aunt so pale or upset she looked as white as chalk and controlled her emotion with difficulty lavinia pewsey glanced at the two guessed there was about to be a row and glided away she always kept out of trouble now said miss wharf when they were alone i want an explanation chapter iv ruperts secret olivia was astonished to see the emotion of her aunt for as a rule miss wharf was cold and selfcontained the two had never got on well together and the elder woman was undeniably jealous of the youth and superior good looks of the younger but as olivia owed bed and board to her aunt she always behaved as well as possible to one who was very trying in many ways it is only just to say that miss pewsey made matters much worse by talebearing and probably had she been out of the house miss wharf and her niece might have got on better but they could never have been congenial companions the difference between their natures was too great yes said miss wharf throwing herself back in her seat and feeling irritated by the silence of olivia i want an explanation what about asked the girl seating herself opposite and folding her hands which miss wharf noticed with bitterness were more slender and delicate that her own you know well enough if its about rupert there snapped the aunt i knew you would guess yes it is about young ainsleigh and how dare you call him rupert because i love him said olivia firmly and looked directly into the cold blue eyes of her aunt then you must put this love out of your head you shall never marry himnevernevernever if i choose and i do choose said olivia calmly but with a fine colour i shall certainly marry him i am of age yes and a pauper rupert would not marry me for my money he is wise for you have none it is kind of you to speak to me in this way said olivia to remind me of obligations i am aware that my parents died poor and left me a penniless orphan i am aware that you took me in and educated me and and acted like a mother to you said miss wharf vehemently no you never acted like a mother with you i have had a most unhappy life olivia the elder woman started furiously from her chair how dare you say that have i grudged you clothes or food did i not send you to a firstclass school and so far as material things are concerned you have done everything aunt sophia and i thank you for what you have done a fine way you have of showing it scoffed miss wharf but a mother you have never been went on olivia calmly you have never given me a kind word you speak to me before visitors as you should not do you make me slave for you and run messages and talk of me to others as though i were a servant what love have you ever shown me demanded olivia starting up in her turn and also becoming excited i long for love my heart yearns for it i would like to be a daughter to you but always you have kept me at arms length aunt sophia let me go i can earn my bread as a governess or as a typist it will be better for us both no said aunt sophia looking as hard as stone i shall not let you go if you have any gratitude in you you will remain and help me to manage the house you have miss pewsey she is not a relative you are and so you treat me worse than you do her well aunt sophia i am not ungrateful though you seem to think i am i shall stop with you i only ask for a little more consideration i give you every consideration as for love i cannot give it to you or to anyone i gave all the love my nature was capable of feeling to markham ainsleigh and he rejected my love yes you may look astonished but it was this mans father who broke my heart and that is why you dont want rupert to marry me that is the reason said miss wharf sitting down and growing more her calm stony self i was almost engaged to markham ainsleigh but he saw violet vane and fell in love with her he left me and made her his wife can you wonder that i hate the son of the woman who stole my love away from me rupert is the son of the man you loved and of the man who cheated me look at my lonely life at my starved heart i hate the ainsleighstheres only one left but i hate him and when i heard markham was murdered in china i was gladyes very glad what an unforgiving nature you have i have every right to be unforgiving markham ruined my life and do you think ill let you marry rupertthe son of that woman no marry him and i leave what money i have to miss pewsey you can if you like aunt sophia i dont want your money reflect said miss wharf violently i have a thousand a year half of that goes to a distant relative and the remainder you shall have if you will give this man up five hundred a year is not to be thrown away i cannot give rupert up said olivia firmly think girl pleaded miss wharf her face becoming red and wrinkled with the violence of her passion there are other men who love you young walker would make you a good husband and lady jabe is most anxious for the match i like chris said olivia and i have known him all my life but i cant marry him i want a master when i marry then take clarence burgh said miss wharf he will be your master no hes a brute hes a manmuch more of a man than rupert ainsleigh i deny that said olivia fiercely he is clarence has been all over the world he has fought everywhere so has major tidman do you advise me to marry him he would make you a better husband than rupert old as he is that young ainsleigh is a dreamer he is on the point of losing his estates yet he sits at royabay doing nothing he intends to do something and save the estates never he is not the sort of man to work olivia if you will take chris walker or clarence burgh for your husband i shall leave you five hundred a year if you refuse i give you nothing i prefer nothingand rupert then you shall not have him ill ruin him first olivia started you cant ruin him you talk wildly oh do i sneered miss wharf that shows you know little of me or of my business listen i bought up a mortgage on the royabay estate it cost me money which i could ill afford to pay away but i bought it so as to ruin the son of that woman vane who took markham from me i always intended to buy the estate or at least to drive rupert from the place but if you will give him up i shall forego my revenge now what do you say nothing faltered olivia who had turned very pale i dont know what to say will you give the man up i wont see him if that will please you no it doesnt please me you must give him up and engage yourself to mr walker or to mr burgh i cannoti cannot said poor olivia miss wharf stamped her foot and bit her lip you are as obstinate as your mother was before you she said savagely i shall give you one month to make up your mind and that is very generous of me if you surrender rupert and choose one of the other two i will not foreclose the mortgage and will leave you five hundred a year when can you foreclose asked olivia anxiously by the end of the year so it rests with you if rupert ainsleigh leaves his home in six months or keeps it now you can go olivia rayner was not a girl who would stand dictation but for some reason or another she meekly bowed her head and went out leaving miss wharf to calm down over her needlework the girl went to her own room and lay down to think over the situation what she thought or what plan she conceived it is difficult to say but she came down to dinner quite composed her aunt looked at her sharply and miss pewsey with suspicion but neither of them made any remark bearing on the storm on the contrary miss wharf chatted about the ball and talked of her dress and even advised olivia about her costume you will look very well in white said miss wharf but not so lovely as my sophia in pale blue said miss pewsey with her usual emphasis i know you will be the belle of the ball darling sophia i have been the belle of several balls in my time said miss wharf goodhumouredly and will be still purred miss pewsey like the cat she was my dear nephew said you were a rattling fine woman it sounds like one of mr burghs speeches said olivia with great contempt she knew that the buccaneer loved her and therefore disliked him the more oh olivia how can you cried the little old maid throwing up her hands when poor dear darling clarence worships the ground you walk on hes got money too and wants a wife let him marry lotty dean then that retired grocers daughter cried miss pewsey drawing herself up no indeed i may be poor but i am of gentle blood olivia the pewseys have been in essex for generations my papa was rich and could afford to send me to a fashionable school when i met my own sophia but poor sweet papa lost his money and thenoh dear me miss pewsey squeezed out a tear what sad times i have had youre all right now lavinia said miss wharf stolidly eating fruit and sipping port wine yes dearest sophia thanks to your large and generous heart i have no one in the world but you and clarence he is the son of my only sister and has travelled in china said olivia miss pewsey narrowed her eyes and looked as though about to scratch in china of course but why do you make that remark olivia the girl shrugged her shoulders i observed that mr burgh has not very pleasant recollections of china she said deliberately he was not pleased to find that mr walker could talk the language and he was uncomfortable when the name tungyu was mentioned miss pewsey bit her lip do you know anything of tungyu no why should i all i know is that chris walker says he will bring the man down here for the ball the little old maid looked hard at the girl but olivia bore her scrutiny composedly she wondered why miss pewsey stared so hard and laid such emphasis on the chinese name but the matter slipped from her mind when she retired to her room she would have wondered still more had she known that miss pewsey came up the stairs and listened at the door of the bedroom olivia had arranged to meet rupert near the bandstand as their meetings were secret because of miss wharfs dislike certainly the young man had come to the house and miss wharf had received him with cold dignity but when he showed a marked preference for olivias company she gave him to understand that she did not approve henceforth rupert stopped away from ivy lodge and met olivia at intervals near the bandstand so olivia putting on a dark dress and a veil slipped out of the house and took her way along the brilliantly lighted front she had often gone before and always had left her aunt and miss pewsey sitting in the drawingroom miss wharf working and the companion reading the newspaper miss wharf never by any chance looked at a newspaper herself but left it to miss pewsey to cull the choice news for her delectation so olivia feeling quite safe stepped lightly along to where the crowd gathered round the stand it was a perfect night and very warm therefore many people were seated in the chairs and strolling across the grass olivia went to a certain corner and as she expected found her lover he was not in eveningdress but for the sake of the meeting had assumed a dark serge suit as she advanced he recognised her and came forward taking off his hat then he gave her his arm and the two strolled to the far end of the green where they sat down under the fence which was round the flagstaff there removed from everyone they could talk in moderately loud tones my darling said rupert possessing himself of olivias hand i thought you would not come you were late i could not get away before miss pewsey watches me like a cat does a mouse and with the same disposition to pounce i expect shes a detestable woman said rupert angrily why cant she leave you alone i dont know rupert she wants me to marry her nephew what that bounder who rides so furiously cried rupert fiercely you dont mean to say that he dares not in words but he looksoh olivia shivered you know the sort of look a man like that gives you ill twist his neck if he insults you then miss pewsey would complain to my aunt and i should get into trouble oh rupert she said softly i am so afraid of that man nonsense noof everything i can keep mr burgh off who is he asked rupert jealously miss pewseys nephew i can manage him bold as he is but it is you i am afraid of listen and olivia told the young man what she had learned from miss wharf that afternoon she can ruin you said the poor girl almost crying and she will if she learns the truth rupert pressed the hand he held why not tell her the truth he said im willing to face poverty if you are rupert are you mad if aunt sophia learned that we were marriedhark what was that and olivia rose and nervously peered into the shadows i thought i heard a noise its nothing only some rats in the long grass within the fence no ones about theyre all over at the band but about our marriage olivia miss wharf must learn sooner or later yes but you know i asked you to keep it quiet that i might not have trouble with her it was selfish of me for it would have been braver of me to have faced her anger and then have told all the world that we were married at that registry office but im glad now i didnt she would have ruined you she cant do anything till the end of the year but why didnt you tell me she held this mortgage well i thought that before the end of the year i might manage to pay it and the other mortgages off then we could announce that we were married and live at royabay on what small income i have i dont mind about the income said mrs ainsleigh for that olivia secretly was id live on a shilling a day with you darling but aunt threatens if i marry you to cut me out of her will she would do so at once if she knew the truth and leave the money to miss pewsey let her i daresay that old maid has schemed for it shes a wicked old woman that and worthy of her bounder of a nephew never mind about the money or the mortgage let us announce the marriage i dont like the position you occupy it is not fit that my wife should be exposed to the attentions of a cad like this burgh wait till the end of the year said olivia feverishly then you may be able to get money to put things straight it is best to keep the matter quiet now oh how i wish we had money rupert i may be able to make it out of the fan what fan asked olivia looking at him rupert laughed i forgot you dont know he took the slip of paper from his pocketbook and lighting a match he read the description of the fan i went up to the place he continued dropping the lucifer and saw a chinaman tungyu what said olivia starting why that is the man mr walker is going to bring to the ball hes a clerk in the firm of kumgumli and company thats strange i thought he was the keeper of the joss house in perry street whitechapel humph does walker know of the fan i dont know but he knows this tungyu and i think so does mr burgh he seemed much annoyed when he heard the name what about i cant say and rupert mr burgh speaks chinese he must be very clever then for i hear it is a most awful language to get hold of was burgh ever in china yes he brought the fan from that place fan rupert turned round sharply what fan the one you talk about said olivia innocently i recognised it at once from the description you read just now are you sure said rupert much excited for he never expected to hear of the missing fan from olivia of all people quite surepositive the fan is painted green on one side and the sticks on the other are overlaid with thin jade so i suppose it gets its name from the mineral then it has a cord of yellow silk with four beads and half a bead and it is the same where did burgh get it i dont know he says he brought it from china and offered it to me i refused it i should think so said ainsleigh fuming well then he gave it to my aunt and has miss wharf got it now i think so but i have not seen it lately i expect if she has she will use it at the ball and tungyu who advertises is coming to the ball mused rupert there doesnt seem much chance for me i expect your aunt will make the money after all it wont be much who would give a large sum for that fan tungyu will he is ready to give five thousand pounds oh said olivia with real regret and i refused it im glad you did cried rupert angrily i would rather everything went than that you should accept presents from that bounder well i fear my chance is gone olivia im ruined dearest i will face the ruin with you and in the shadows they kissed chapter v concerning the fan rupert returned to royabay in rather a melancholy frame of mind he found himself in a very difficult situation and there did not seem to be any chance of his extricating himself therefrom now that miss wharf possessed the fan it was strange that she should have received it from clarence burgh and rupert wondered how that dashing young gentleman became its owner however there was little use speculating on this miss wharf had the fan and probably she would keep it unless the large sum of money offered by tungyu tempted her to do business ainsleigh wondered also if the old maid had read the papers and if she had seen the advertisement but what does it matter to me said rupert as he turned up the avenue i wont get the money and miss wharf will see me hanged first before she will let me make such a sum while i am poor she holds me in her clutches and thinks by means of that mortgage to prevent my marriage with olivia what would she say if she knew that we were already married i was wrong to consent to keep the affair secret even though olivia wished it in any case miss wharf can do nothing till the end of the year and the truth is bound to come to her ears sooner or later then she will strike and spare not i believe thats the motto of the wharfs and it fits her spiteful temper excellently then rupert went on to reflect on what olivia had told him of aunt sophias romance with markham ainsleigh the young man had never heard of it before as he knew little of his father who had gone to china a few years after his heir was born in fact markham only waited till there was a male ainsleigh to carry on the succession and to inherit what remained of the estates and then steamed to the far east to seek fortune but fortune had proved unkind and the poor man had diedwhether of dysentery or by violence it is difficult to say some people said one thing and some another but even rupert did not know the truth dr forge who had worked the mine in the kansu province along with markham knew the absolute truth and he ascribed the death to dysentery so rupert for the time being at all events was willing to accept this explanation he had no reason to doubt the loyalty of theophilus forge who had been a college chum of his fathers thinking in this way and considering whether it would not be advisable to proclaim his marriage so as to release his wife from the odious attentions of clarence burgh the young man arrived at the house he was met in the hall by mrs petley who announced that major tidman was waiting to see her young master rupert nodded in an absentminded way and was going to the library where the major was kicking his heels when mrs petley caught him by the arm its walking again said mrs petley whose fat face was pale and say what you like master rupert trouble is coming she was a stout old dame with a red face suggestive of drink a most unfair thing to be said of her as she drank nothing stronger than gin and water one tumbler a night before retiring but mrs petley had been a cook in her early days later on she assumed the position ruperts nurse and finally having married petley the butler she became housekeeper of royabay she was a common vulgar old woman but loyal to the core and adored rupert when he had to dismiss the greater part of his servants he retained john petley and john petleys wife who continued to serve him faithfully and always hoped for better days mrs petley being intensely superstitious was always influenced by the appearance of abbot raoul whose walking was supposed to predict bad luck to the ainsleighs if the ghost did not appear mrs petley was happy but when it did she always prognosticated evil and it must be admitted that rupert usually had more trouble with his creditors when abbot raoul did visit his old haunts he seemed to be a most malignant spirit but rupert as an educated man was not going to admit occult influence nonsense mrs petley said he shaking her off so far as trouble is concerned abbot raoul might remain visible for ever am i ever out of trouble no that you aint worse luck but this walking means something extra special as i said to john where did you see the old beast i mean abbot raoul of course mrs petley started hush deary she whispered looking round in a fearful manner dont speak evil of speerits it may be round and you might anger it i saw it in the cloisters near the place asked rupert aye standing on the black square where its mortal body was burnt poor soul it was pinting to a tree to what treethere are plenty in the cloisters to the copper beech as you might say master rupert and angry enough he looked i nearly fainted you should be used to the ghost by this time mrs petley ghosts is things custom wont help you with said mrs petley mysteriously they freeze your blood every time just as i was thinking of a good scream and a faint it vanished into thin air like the witches in macbeth said rupert lightly well it doesnt need abbot raoul to come and tell me trouble is near im likely to have a good deal by the end of the year oh master rupert what is it gasped the old woman nothing i can tell you at present said ainsleigh carelessly i have a good mind to seek abbot raoul myself and see if he cant help me but im not psychic as you are mrs petley i see nothing and a good thing too said the excook solemnly if i spoke to you it would be to make matters worse though worse they cant be oh yes they can said rupert grimly i may have to leave never cried mrs petley smiting her fat hands together royabay can never do without an ainsleigh within its walls it will have to content itself with abbot raoul and i hope hell jolly well frighten the creditors drat them said mrs petley vigorously but master rupert why did it pint to the copper beech i cant say ask it when next you see it but i must go to major tidman hell be angry if i keep him mrs petley tossed her head and snorted the idear of old farmer tidmans son being angry with the likes of you master rupert i mind him when he was a brat of a lad and yesyesbut i must go said ainsleigh rather impatiently and left mrs petley talking to the air major tidman whose ears must have burnt at the thoughts which occupied mrs petleys brain was seated in the most comfortable armchair he could find and smoked a good cigar he had a bottle of port and a glass before him and apparently had made himself at home while waiting hope you dont mind my making free with the winelist said tidman who looked rather uneasy as he rose ive waited two hours what about said rupert throwing his cap down and sinking wearily into a near chair anything wrong i am said the major all wrong my dear boy you see in me a beast and a false friend indeed how do you make that out i have been concealing things from you said the major ruefully and all to make money im really getting avaricious ainsleigh added the major desperately and its spoiling my character well said rupert filling his pipe and wondering what this outburst meant byron says that avarice is a fine old gentlemanly vice if you have only that fault to blame yourself for you are very lucky but i should have told you about the fan rupert blew out the match he had just lighted and sat up whats that about the fan he asked sharply i know something about it said tidman fortifying his courage with a glass of wine and i should have spoken the other evening after dinner when you read that advertisement but i thought id get the fan myself and secure the five thousand poundsthough to be sure i didnt know what that tungyu would pay for it at the time no said rupert drily i told you that later well major you havent treated me quite on the square but i forgive you i expect neither of us will make money out of that fan no said tidman still more ruefully forge has lost it rupert looked puzzled forge what do you mean oh this is part of my confession of trickery said the major rubbing his bald head you see ainsleigh i held my tongue when you read out about the fan but i knew where it was all the time and where was it asked the young man staring forge has itor rather forge had it said the major and he related his interview with the doctor when rupert had departed so you see added the major sadly im punished for my wrongdoing im very sorry as i like you ainsleigh and after all id be glad to see you make the money though im not so well off myself as people think and five thousand pounds would help me a lot however i hope you will think i have made amends for my momentary lapse from squareness by thus confessing oh thats all right tidman but treat me openly for the future how did you know that forge had had the fan rupert did not tell what he had heard from olivia for the moment he first wished to hear all that the major had to say tidman had certainly acted wrongly as he should not have taken advantage of ruperts confidence but now he apparently wished to behave properly and ainsleigh put the majors temporary deceit out of his mind i gave forge the fan blurted out the major the deuce you did said ainsleigh looking puzzled and where did you get it in canton seven years ago confessed tidman i was travelling there for my health and i had an adventure what was that but tidman did not seem inclined to speak out ill tell you on another occasion he said with a shudder it was not a very pleasant adventure and forge who was in canton at the time got me out of it i stuck to the fan though oh so the fan was the cause of the adventure partly admitted tidman reluctantly ill tell you later as i say he wiped his forehead i cant tell you now its too awful i got the fan though and forge took a fancy to it he asked me for it in canton and i refused he asked again in england and i gave it to him hes had it all these seven years locked up in that black japan cabinet with the gold figures i know its in that chinese room of his well after you went away the other day i asked him to give me the fan back as i wanted to get the money from tungyu forge refused as he said the fan has something to do with a secret whose secret lokeongs secret he is the real owner of the fan you know forge seems to hate lokeong and said the fan would get him into trouble but howhow asked ainsleigh impatiently the major wiped his face again i dont knowi cant say but forge said there was a secret connected with the fan you said that before cried rupert becoming exasperated i dont know what i am saying and thats the truth stammered tidman becoming hotter and redder but forge said if i found the secret he would give me the fan he then opened the cabinet and found that the fan was gone what did he say he turned as white as a sheet and said that his life was at stake rupert rose to pace the room the mystery of the fan piqued him i wonder what he meant by that he asked himself something horrid if it has to do with the chinese said the major you have no idea what brutes they are but forge thought that mrs bressy the old woman who looks after him might have sneaked the fan as she is fond of taking things and pawning them but she swore she had never set eyes on it wasnt the cabinet locked yes thats the strange part and forge has the key on his watchchain the lock wasnt broken and no other key would fit it so how it was opened is a mystery but the fans gone quite so said rupert facing the major sharply and miss wharf has the very fan you speak of tidman fell back in his chair and gasped till he was purple in the face whaat he drawled out sophia wharf yes olivia told me when i explained how i wished to find the fan and make money it seems that young burgh a detestable young cad snapped tidman i agree with you he dares to admire myto admire olivia said rupert nearly letting his secret slip out and to gain her good graces he offered her this fan she refused and he then presented it to miss wharf who took it and who has it now oh groaned the major and its worth five thousand what luck some people have rupert shrugged his shoulders the luck will not come our way he replied carelessly and to tell you the truth i dont much care i expect miss wharf will sell the fan to tungyu but she doesnt know about his wishing to buy it she may have seen the advertisement and you know tungyu is coming to the ball at the bristol major tidman rose like a jackinthebox who says so he asked young walker tungyu is not the keeper of the whitechapel josshouse as i thought he is a clerk in the firm of kumgumli chris walker also works for them interpolated the major certainly and he is bringing tungyu to the ball i dont know why and i dont much care added ainsleigh somewhat crossly i am about tired of this fan business what will you do major tidman buttoned his coat im going straight to forge he said and i shall tell him that young burgh had the fan i know how he got it do you indeed said rupert yawning yes miss pewsey stole it from the cabinet nonsense why should she do that because shes always about forges house he told me that he might marry herugh the major sneered fancy marrying that old cat different people have different tastes said ainsleigh coolly but if forge is going to marry miss pewsey all the more reason she should not steal the fan but she did insisted the major im sure she stole it and gave it to that scamp of a nephew so that he might gain miss rayners goodwill you see miss pewsey would like to see burgh married to olivia as shemiss pewsey i meancould then finger the five hundred a year miss wharf will leave her niece he had better be certain that olivia will inherit the money first said rupert grimly thinking of the secret marriage and miss pewsey hates olivia she hates everyone said tidman shrugging his plump shoulders but she hasnt a penny to bless herself with and when miss wharf dies she will be cast on the world even five hundred a year is a consideration to her and if her nephew can secure that by marrying olivia why all the better for miss pewsey but rupert shook his head if miss pewsey had that scheme in her head she would be more friendly with olivia he said and she can set her mind at rest burgh will not marry olivia hes a dangerous rival ainsleigh pooh i can manage that young man and half a dozen like him you dont think id give up the girl i love to anyone tidman no said the major looking at the frank brave face of his host but burgh is unscrupulous and will make mischief however perhaps forge will deal with him for this fan business when forge learns that miss pewsey has stolen his fan he wont marry her ill have the satisfaction of spoiling her plans at all events she seems to have a great many plans according to you yawned ainsleigh but frankly i think you have found a mares nest i dont believe anything will come of the matter its moonshine tidman marched to the door well see said he determinedly i believe trouble is coming to you through young burgh and he departed rupert left alone lighted his pipe and thought of mrs petleys fancy concerning the ghost if this is the trouble said he to himself i dont mind burgh wont get olivia unless over my dead body as to this fanpah but he little knew what disasters the fan would bring to him abbot raouls ghost was not walking for nothing chapter vi burghs story next morning major tidman was seated in his wellfurnished room in the bristol hotel from the window he commanded a fine view of the mouth of the thames of the pier and of the picturesque lower town but the view did not gain the attention of the major worthy as it was of his notice he seated himself at the table which was spread for breakfast and proceeded to make a good meal perhaps he did not eat so well as usual for the major was worried as was evident from the cross expression of his face on the previous night he had gone to see forge and had told him how miss wharf became possessed of the fan the doctor had listened to him quietly but had refrained from making any observation even when tidman reminded him of his remark as to his life being at stake the interview had on the whole been unsatisfactory and tidman was not at all pleased he wished to learn the truth about the fan theres some secret connected with it muttered the major while he devoured buttered eggs rapidly and that secret means a lot of money five thousand pounds is worth having i could buy that plot of waste land near the church and build an hotel there i believe it would pay then theres forges life which as he says hangs on the fan though in what way i cant find out if i got the fan i might be able to get something out of him i would make forge and tungyu bid against one another and perhaps id get even more than is offered ainsleigh cant say anything against me now as i am acting quite square and above board hes got no enterprise thought the little man with some scorn or hed get olivia to take the fan from her aunt and make the money out of it but if he wont i will so ill see miss wharf today and try what i can do i daresay id get it from her for a five pound notethat is if she hasnt seen the advertisement shes keen after money tooas keen as i am humph added tidman filling himself a second cup of coffee i wonder why tungyu was such a fool as to tell ainsleigh he was willing to give five thousand anyone not knowing the value of the fan would get it cheap theres a mystery about it and the mystery means money i must get to the bottom of the affair forge is no good as he is holding his tongue even when i told him that miss pewsey stole it he did not seem to mind but hell never marry her after this so ive spoilt her chance of marriage the cat though why forge should marry an old fiend who is eighty if shes an hour i cant make out but forge was always secretive ended the major in disgust and reached for the patdefoigras his meal was interrupted by a smart young waiter who intimated that a lady and gentleman wished to see the major tidman was rather surprised at a call being paid at ten oclock in the morning but he was still more surprised when at the heels of the waiter appeared miss pewsey and dr forge the latter looked much his usual self hungry dismal and like a bird of prey but miss pewsey had a colour in her cheeks and a fire in her black eyes which made her look younger it seemed that her errand was not a peaceful one to what am i indebted began the courtly major when the little old maid cut him short with vinegary politeness indebted she said standing very straight and stiff and quite ignoring the chair placed for her oh indeedhow very polite we are judas she snapped out the word with flaming eyes oh judas really miss pewsey youd like to see me in the dock would you cried miss pewsey tossing her head and trembling with wrath im a thief am ioh you military fat judas did you come here to insult me asked tidman growing purple if you put it in that way i did sniffed the lady and also to ask plainly what you meant by stating to my promised husband here that i stole a fan from his cabinet tidman changed from purple to scarlet he had not reckoned on the doctor speaking to miss pewsey and he turned a look of reproach on his friend the doctor immediately took up the challenge i see you think i have been too free with my tongue said he deliberately it is not my custom as you know but i told you major that i was engaged to miss pewsey and i thought it only right that she should know the aspersions you have cast on her character a character cried the lady which has stood the test of years and which stands deservedly high i am a pewsey of essex she added as though the whole county belonged to her and never before have i been accused of thievingjudas she shot out the name again and the major quailed he saw that he was in the wrong owing to forges betrayal and had to make the best of it i am extremely sorry he said apologetically quite a mistake oh indeed a jury will give their opinion on that sniffed the maiden no no i beg of you the damages will be laid at five thousand pounds the price of the fan said tidman starting what do you mean by that asked miss pewsey her eyes glittering i mean just nothing oh yes you do make a clean breast of it benjamin tidman oh to think that the son of a farmer who was almost a labourer should dare to speak evil of a pewsey of essex but the lawthe law said the irate lady shaking a thin finger and five thousand pounds get it out of the fan is it worth that asked forge coldly you heard what young ainsleigh said answered tidman as coldly yes i remember but we have not come about the price but about your libel on this lady i apologise said tidman seeing nothing else was to be done apology isnt money snapped miss pewsey oh if you want money again i refer you to the fan the major was getting angry he didnt very much care if miss pewsey did bring an action at the moment though with saner thoughts he would have been horrified at the idea i apologise said he again but i was misled by dr forge how were you misled by me demanded forge impassively you said you had the fan in your cabinet and that it had been stolen mrs bressy swore she did not take it and i thought that i was the thief cried miss pewsey shrilly oh how clever of youhow very very clever you thought that i got the key from the watchchain of dr forge where he always carries it to open the cabinet and steal a fan i knew nothing about it i never even knew of the existence of the fanthere judas snapped the lady once more then i was mistaken and dr forge was mistaken also i confess that i did make a mistake said the doctor with a sad face but that does not excuse your libelling the lady i hope to call my wife my memory is not so good as it was and i fear that the drugs i take to induce sleep have impaired what memory i have left i suffer from neuralgia added the doctor turning to miss pewsey and in china i contracted the habit of opium smoking so marriage will put that right said the lady patting his hand i do not expect a perfect husband i never knew you expected a husband at all said tidman injudiciously ho cried miss pewsey drawing herself up she had been standing all the time another libel i call dr forge to witness it i really think tidman youd better hold your tongue said the doctor gently but i must explain that i quite forgot that i had parted with the fan yes i received it from you seven years ago when i brought you home after that adventure in canton two years later i returned to china to see lokeong on business and i took the fan with me he received it no said the major shaking his bald head i cant believe that forge you declared that you hated lokeong and that the fan would harm you and him also i do hate the man cried forge looking more like a bird of prey than ever but i got a concession about a gold mine by giving back the fan i wanted the money more than lokeongs life as to my own life it was in danger from the enemies of the mandarin who want the fan to ruin him that was why i spoke as i did are you satisfied not quite said tidman who was puzzled how did the fan come to england again my nephew mr burgh will tell you that said miss pewsey when he has administered the beating i have asked him to inflict beating shouted the major snatching a knife from the breakfast table let that young whelp dare to hint such a thing and ill kick him round marport clarence is not the man to be kicked nor am i the man to be beaten i have apologised and that is quite enough if you are not satisfied miss pewsey you can bring your action and ill defend it beating indeed snorted tidman id like to see anyone who would dare to lay a hand on me and he looked very fierce as he spoke very good said miss pewsey in a stately manner if you will tell me all about the fan i shall ask clarence to spare you the beating clarence can go to the major mentioned a place which made miss pewsey shriek and clap her fingers to her ears i am not the least afraid of that cad and bounderthatthat libel again major tidman poohpooh said forge rising let us go lavinia not till i hear about the fan for the sake of my dear sophia who has the fan i want to hear all i know is that the fan was advertised for i saw the advertisement said miss pewsey but i said nothing to dear sophia although i recognized the fan from the description in the newspaper she never looks at the papers and trusts to me to tell her the news so you kept from her a piece of news out of which she could make five thousand pounds really and truly said miss pewsey clutching her bag convulsively and with glittering eyes who says sowho pays itwho one question at a time interrupted tidman now quite master of himself tungyu the man ainsleigh saw at the joss house in perry street whitechapel offered five thousand pounds for the return of the fan ainsleigh saw the advertisement and i know how he came to inquire about the fan said miss pewsey dr forge told me but i did not know the amount offered will you tell miss wharf now no said miss pewsey very decisively nor will any one else my sophias health is delicate and if she had a shock like that inflicted on her she would die what the offer of five thousand pounds the chance of being killed said miss pewsey but i will leave my nephew mr burgh to explain that major tidman i accept your apology for thinking me abut no cried the lady i cant bring myself to pronounce the nasty word i am a pewsey of essex all is said in that i think good morning major my abstinence from bringing an action lies in the fact that you will refrain from unsettling my sophias mind by telling about the fan goodmorning my theophilus will we not go before the major could recover from the bewilderment into which he was thrown by this torrent of words miss pewsey taking the arm of the melancholy doctor had left the room when alone tidman scratched his chin and swore theres something in this he soliloquised i believe the old woman wants to get the money herself by george ill keep my eyes on her and the major shook his fist at the door through which the fairy form of miss pewsey had just vanished later in the day tidman dressed to perfection walked up the town twirling his stick and beaming on every pretty woman he came across the stout old boy was not at all appalled by the threat of miss pewsey regarding her buccaneering nephews attentions when he saw the gentleman in question bearing down on him he simply stopped and grasped his stick more firmly if there was to be a fight the major resolved to have the first blow but burgh did not seem ready to make a dash he sauntered up to tidman and looked at him smilingly well met old pard said he in his slangy fashion my name to you is major tidman said the old fellow coolly i guess i know that much cant we go a stretch along the lower part of the town if theres any row to come off said the major keeping a wary eye on the young man i prefer it to take place here on guard siron guard clarence shrugged his shoulders and produced a cigarette oh thats all right said he striking a match i guess my old aunts been at you im not going in for any rownot me just as well for you said the major sharply how dare you threaten me youyou now i ask you said clarence if i have threatened you go slow i guess the old girls been piling on the agony shes got old forge to fight her battles when i make trouble added clarence musingly it will be for a pretty girl like olivia you can have your desire for a row by telling that to young ainsleigh huh said burgh with contempt i guess id lay him out pretty smart i tell you major im dead gone on that girl but she treats me like a lump of mud and quite right too said tidman coolly you arent worthy of her now ainsleigh is clarence pitched away his cigarette with an irritable gesture dont get me riz said he darkly or ill make the hair fly with ainsleigh pooh hes quite able to look after himself can he shoot demanded the buccaneer yes and use his fists and fence and lay you out properly confound you sir dont you think ive travelled also ive been in the naked lands in my time and have seen your sort growing on the banana plants youre the sort to get lynched oh tie it up said burgh with sudden anger for these remarks were not to his mind i want to tell you about the fan why do you want to talk of that asked tidman with suspicion i dont care a straw for the fan oh i reckon you do major but youre well out of it if youd kept that fan there would have been troubleyes you may look but if youd held on to that article youd have been a corpse by now tidman sneered not at all terrified by these vague threats what do you mean by this drivel lets come to anchor here said clarence pulling up beside a seat in a secluded part near the old town beach ill spin the yarn about the fan said the major sitting promptly i confess i am curious to know how it came to england again after forge took it again to the far east didnt he give it to lokeong so he says said clarence with a sidelong look at his companion i dont know myself all i know is that i got it from a pirate from a pirate thats so i was in chinese waters a year or so ago and i reckon pirates swarm in those parts tidman shivered yes he admitted i had an adventure myself in canton with a pirate of sorts old forge told me something about it said clarence lighting a fresh cigarette but my yarns different i was out with some of the boys in chinese water and a pirate tried to board us we were down borneo way looking out for a ruby mine said to be in those parts my palsthere were two of them and myself engineering the jobhired a boat and cut across to borneo the pirates tried to slit our throats and our chinese crew tried to help them but we used our winchesters and six shooters freely and shot a heap the pirates cleared off and we brought our barky into port safe enough but about the fan im coming to that the boss pirate was shot by mea big six foot northern chinee got up to kill like a tin god he had this jade fan and directed operations with it when his pals cleared i found him as dead as a coffin and nailed the fan it was pretty enough but didnt appeal to me much i clapped it away in my box and when i reached england i offered it to aunt lavinia she wants me to marry miss rayner and said i should offer it to her and cut out that aristocratic ainsleigh chap oliviaripping name aint itwell she didnt catch on so i thought id gain the goodwill of old miss wharf and passed it along to her the major listened in silence to this story which seemed reasonable enough strange it should have come back to england and to a small place like this where forge had it he mused a coincidence i suppose by the way did you see the advertisement he asked you bet i did and it made me sick to think id parted with the fan leastways it made me sick till i saw hwei you mean tungyu no i dont i mean the chinee as calls himself hwei who put that advertisement in every newspaper in london and the united kingdom what in everyone said the major must have cost a heap you bet major well i struck hwei thats the name of a river man maybe but its what this celestial calls himself i struck him near the mansion house and knew him of old in pekin i reckon where we chinchined over some contraband biznai i spoke to him in chinesei know enough to get along onand he told me he had come to this country about lokeongs fan i never said id got it though by that time id seen the advertisement i know chinamen too well to give myself away in that fashion i pumped him and learned that hwei intended to scrag the chap who held the fan so i concluded to lie low but he offered wealth to whomsoever gave it up maybe i dont know exactly how the thing figures out i guess hwei does the killing and tungyu the rewarding but you can take it from me major that unless miss wharf gets rid of that fan shell have her throat cut so i guess you must be glad you didnt handle the biznai and clarence puffed a serene cloud of smoke its more of a mystery than ever said the major and so it was chapter vii the warning the idea that the end of the year would see him ruined and homeless was terrible to rupert even if his home had been an ordinary house he would have been anxious but when he thought of the venerable mansion of the few acres remaining of the once vast ainsleigh estates of the ruins of the abbey which he loved his heart was wrung with anguish how could he let these things depart from him for ever yet he saw no way out of the matter although he had frequent consultations with his lawyers one day shortly before the ball at the bristol he returned from town with a melancholy face old petley ventured to follow his young master into the library and found him with his face covered with his hands in deep despair dont take on so master rupert said the old butler gently things have not yet come to the worst they are about as bad as they can be john replied ainsleigh i have seen mr thorp it will take thirty thousand pounds to put matters right and where am i to get it oh the young man started up and walked to and fro why didnt i go into the law or take to some profession where i might make money forge was my guardian he should have seen to it master rupert said the old butler do you think that gentleman is your friend what makes you think he isnt john petley pinched his chin between a shaky finger and thumb he dont seem like a friend said he in his quavering voice he didnt tell you or me master rupert how bad things were when you was at college he should have told you and then you might have learned some way of getting money my father trusted him john he was appointed my guardian by the will my father made before he left for china and dr forge went with the master to china said the old man how did the master die of dysentery so dr forge says and others say he was murdered who says so john well sir that mandarin gentleman sent your fathers papers and luggage back here when your mother was alive a chinaman brought the things he hinted that all was not right and afterwards the mistress died she believed your father was murdered rupert looked pensive he had heard something of this but the story had been so vague and was so vague as john told it that he did not believe in it much does dr forge know the truth he asked he ought to sir dr forge came from china with a report of this gold mine up in kansu and your father was all on fire to go there and make money the mistress implored him not to go but he would he went with dr forge and never returned the doctor i know says that the master died of dysentery when the doctor himself was at pekin but i never liked that forge cried the old servant vehemently and i believe theres something black about the business but why should forge be an enemy of my fathers ah sir petley shook his old head i cant rightly say those two were at college together and fast friends but i never liked forge no sir not if i was killed for it would i ever like that gentleman though its not for a person in my position to speak so i asked the doctor again and again to let me know how bad things were when you were at school master rupert but he told me to mind my own business as if it wasnt my business to see after the family id been bred up in since fifteen years of age ill have a talk with dr forge said rupert after a pause if there is any question of my father having been murdered ill see if he knows he turned and looked on the old man quickly you dont suppose john that if there was a murder he no no cried petley hurriedly i dont say he had to do with it but that mandarin lokeong why forge hates him so he says but this mandarin as ive heard from the major is high in favour with the chinamans court if the doctor was his enemy he could not go so often to china as he does and since your fathers death fifteen years ago hes been back several times well ill speak to him john and about the money sir rupert sat down again i dont know what to do he groaned i can manage to stave off many of the creditors but if miss wharf forecloses the mortgage at christmas everyone will come down with a rush and ill have to give up royabay to the creditors neverneverthat will never be said john fiercely why the place has been under the ainsleighs for over three hundred years i dont think that matters to the creditors said rupert wincing if i could only raise this thirtythousand and get the land clear i would be able to live fairly well there wouldnt be much still i could keep the abbey and we could live quietly we sir asked the old man raising his head rupert flushed seeing he had made a slip he did not want to tell the old man that he was married as he was fearful lest the news should come to miss wharfs ears and render his wifes position with that lady unbearable i might get married you know he said in an evasive way lord sir cried petley in terror whatever you do dont cumber yourself with a wife till you put things straight heaven only knows how i am to put them straight sighed rupert i say john send me in some tea im quite weary thorp is coming to see me next week and well have a talk with dr forge i hope said old john as he withdrew ainsleigh frowned when the door closed petley certainly seemed possessed by the idea that forge was an enemy of the ainsleighs yet rupert could think of no reason why he should be he had been an excellent guardian to the boy and if he had not told him the full extent of the ruin till it was too late to prevent it he might have done so out of pity so that the lads young years might be unclouded still it would have been better had he been less tender of my feelings and more considerate for my position thought rupert as he paced the long room while he was sadly looking out of the window and thinking of the wrench it would be to leave the old place he saw a tall woman walking up the avenue the eyes of love are keen and rupert with a thrill of joy recognised the stately gait of olivia with an ejaculation of delight he ran out nearly upsetting mrs petley who was coming into the library with a dainty tea disregarding her exclamation of astonishment rupert sprang out of the door and down the steps he met olivia half way near the ruins of the abbey my dearest he said stretching out both hands how good of you to come olivia who looked pale allowed him to take her hands passively i want to speak to you she said quickly come into the abbey and she drew him towards the ruins no no said her husband enter your own house and have a cup of tea it is just ready and will do you good not just now rupert she replied laying a detaining hand on his arm i can wait only for a quarter of an hour i must get back rupert grumbled at the short time but resolved to make the most of it he walked with her into the cloisters these were small but the ruins were very beautiful rows of delicately carved pillars surrounded a grassy sward at the far end were the ruins of the church stretching into the pines the roofless fane looked venerable even in the bright sunshine the walls were overgrown with ivy and some of the images over the door still remained though much defaced by time the windows were without the painted glass which had once filled them but were rich with elaborate stone work this was especially fine in the round window over the altar as in the cloisters the body of the church was overgrown with grass and some of the pillars had fallen the lovers did not venture into the ruined church itself but walked round the pavement of the cloisters under the arches doubtless in days of old many a venerable father walked on that paved way but the monks were gone the shrine was in ruins and these lovers of a younger generation paced the quiet cloisters talking of love my darling said the young husband fondly how pale you are i hope nothing is wrong my aunt is ill oh its nothingonly a feverish cold she hopes to be well enough to attend the ball tomorrow night i did not hear of it said rupert though tidman generally tells me the news i have been in london for the last few days so i see said olivia and glanced at her fair stalwart husband in his frock coat and smart bond street kit how well you look rupert appreciated the compliment and taking her hands kissed both several times olivia bent forward and pressed a kiss on his smooth hair then she withdrew her hands we must talk sense she said severely oh said rupert making a wry face not about your aunt yes i cant understand her she has shut herself up in her room and refuses to see me she will admit no one but miss pewsey ainsleigh shrugged his shoulders what does it matter he said you know miss wharf never liked you you are much too handsome my own and that is the reason also for miss pewseys dislike oh miss pewsey is more amiable said olivia indeed i never knew her to be so amiable she is always chatting to me at such times as she can be spared from my aunts room well what is worrying you this exclusion from aunt sophias room said olivia with tears of vexation in her dark eyes i am her only relativeor at all events i am her nearest it seems hard that she should exclude me and admit miss pewsey who is only a paid companion i dont think it matters a bit said rupert hasnt your aunt seen anyone lately noyes by the way she has seen her lawyer several times i expect she is altering her will olivia laughed she threatens to do so in favour of miss pewsey unless by the end of the month i give you up and engage myself either to mr walker or to mr burgh rupert grew very angry what a detestable woman he exclaimed i beg your pardon dear i forgot shes your aunt but what right has she to order you about like this you are of age and i am married though she doesnt know it but ill tell you the real reason i am vexed i cant see my aunt cant we sit down over there said ainsleigh pointing to a secluded seat it was placed at the far end of the cloisters under a large oak there were four oaks here or to be more correct three oaks and the stump of one that was destroyed by lightning when i was born said rupert seeing olivias eyes fixed on this mrs petley saw in it an omen that i would be unlucky but am i and he fell to kissing his wifes hands again really rupert you must be more sensible she said in pretended vexation what a pretty tree that copperbeech is yes but do you see the blackened square it is not so very black said mrs ainsleigh pausing to dig the point of her umbrella into the ground theres hardly any grass on it and the earth is dark and hard curious it should be so seeing the grass is thick and green all round i suppose this is where abbot raoul was burnt yes ive told you the story and shown you the spot many times said rupert slipping his arm round her waist dearest she whispered i was too much in love to hear what you said on that point and remember all my visits to the abbey have been secret ones my aunt would be furious did she know that i had been here and i often wonder that pewsey who is always watching me has not followed me here if she does ill duck her in the pond for a witch said rupert and drew his wife to the seat under the oak well go on about my aunt oh its what major tidman told me hes been trying to see aunt sophia also have you heard what mr burgh told the major about that horrid fan no you forget i have just returned from town what is it olivia related to rupert the story which clarence had told the major so you see she ended this man hwei wants to kill any one who has the fan and tungyu desires to reward the person who brings it back it seems contradictory said ainsleigh thoughtfully and if hwei put in the advertisement it is strange that tungyu should have received me in the josshouse mentioned in the paper well well said olivia rather vexed cant you see i want my aunt to know that she is in danger and get rid of that horrid fan pooh said her husband laughing theres no danger hwei cant kill an old lady like that for the sake of a fan she would probably sell for five shillings she wouldnt said olivia with conviction aunt sophia has taken quite a fancy to that fan but she ought to be told how dangerous it is rupert or how lucky said ainsleigh let her sell the fan to tungyu for five thousand pounds and then she can let hwei kill tungyu but would he do so i cant say on the face of it it looks as though these two were working against one another seeing they propose to reward the owner of the fan in such different ways yet hwei according to burgh put the advertisement in and tungyu received me i dont understand well dont you think i should tell the whole story to my aunt yes go in and see her miss pewsey wont let me and my aunt refuses to admit me i sent in a note the other day saying that i wished to speak very particularly and she sent out another note to say that she would not see anyone till she was well the note was kind enough in aunt sophias cold way but you see yes yes well then let tidman see her rupert how annoying you are she wont see anyone but miss miss pewsey well then tell her the story and she can repeat it to your aunt though by the way added ainsleigh burgh may have told miss pewsey about it already yes said olivia her face brightening and rising to go away but ill ask miss pewsey to tell aunt sophia herself as they walked towards the ruined entrance mrs petleys bulky form appeared in the archway she threw up her hands sakes alive master rupert come off abbot raouls burningplace ainsleigh who was standing on the square of blackened ground obeyed at once and drew olivia away also i forgot he murmured forgot what asked olivia why miss said the old housekeeper dont you know its said that if an ainsleigh stands there some trouble will befall him before the years end youre not an ainsleigh miss but master rupertwell thereoh sir how can you be so foolish the teas ready sir and mrs petley with this prosaic ending trotted away she doesnt know that you are an ainsleigh said rupert kissing his wife pah dont think of that foolish superstition come to no rupert said olivia planting herself firmly against the wall you know i said a quarter of an hour its half an hour we have been talking i must get back the young husband urged implored scolded cajoled but all to no effect olivia made up her mind to go and go she did rupert escorting her to the gates you are very unkind he said i am very sensible she replied i dont want to disturb my new relations with miss pewsey she has such power over my aunt that it is necessary i should keep on good terms with her now rupert you must not come any further just along the road certainly not all the gossips of marport would talk goodbye i wont be kissed again someone may be looking ainsleigh muttered a blessing on anyone who might be about and shook hands with his wife just as though they were strangers then he remained at the gate till she turned the corner there she looked back and rupert threw her a kiss olivia shook a furious sunshade at him for the indiscretion the silly boy she said to herself as she went along if anyone saw him there would be a fine story all over marport chapter viii the beginning of the ball so this was the position of affairs immediately before the ball given by the glorious golfers at the bristol hotel miss wharf possessed the fan and two chinamen were searching for it hwei intended to secure it by murder and tungyu by the milder means of honourable purchase but why the two with such contradictory intentions should work in unison as appeared from the advertisement rupert could not understand however he had so much trouble himself that he dismissed the matter from his mind there was little chance of his benefiting by money from the one chinaman or of being murdered by the other and he presumed that olivia would instruct miss pewsey to tell miss wharf about the fan even if she did not see her personally and while miss wharf was ill and safe in her house hwei could not get at her in any way moreover as burgh in his interview with hwei near the mansion house had held his tongue the man would not know where the fan was the ball was the best of the marport season as the glorious golfers were a body of young men with plenty of money and a great love of amusement the vast apartments of the bristol were thrown open and decked with flowers an irish bandthe paddieswas engaged from london and many people came down from the great city to be present it was a perfect night when the ball was held and the terrace on the first floor of the hotel or to speak more properly the balcony was thronged with people it looked very pretty as it was filled with tropical ferns and plants and trees illuminated with chinese lanterns and made comfortable with numerous arm chairs and plenty of small marbletopped tables between the dances people finding the rooms too warm came out to walk in the night air there was no moon but the night was starry and warm and a soft luminous light was reflected on sea and land standing under the great ferntrees and amidst the fairy lights the guests could survey with pleasure the vast waste of water stretching towards the clear horizon and see the long pier glittering with innumerable lights needless to say the terrace was much frequented by amorous couples within the ballroom gay with flowers and draperies with a waxed floor and many electric light in coloured globes looked very pretty the band was hidden behind a lofty floral screen and played the latest seductive waltzes interspersed with inspiriting barndances and quaint cakewalks the women were lovely and the dresses perfect so the young men enjoyed themselves not a little rupert was present looking handsome in his evening dress but rather flushed and anxious he was not sure if miss wharf would come in which case olivia would not be present and if the old maid did recover sufficiently to make her appearance she would perhaps refuse to allow him to dance with the girl however miss wharf did appear though at a somewhat late hour she was gowned in pale blue and looked very handsome if somewhat stout olivias dark beauty revealed itself in a primrosehued dress and miss pewsey looked more like a witch than ever in a black frock glittering with jet this was the gift of miss wharf as poor miss pewsey would never have been able to indulge in such extravagance at the back and in attendance on the ivy lodge party were clarence burgh and dr forge the buccaneer looked picturesque and dashing as usual and was dressed very quietly for one of his flamboyant tastes though he showed to disadvantage beside the perfection of ruperts garb forge wore a suit which might have been made for his grandfather and which fitted his lank form ill the doctor looked less his cool self than was usually the case his parchment face was flushed and his melancholy eyes glittered as they roved round the brilliant room rupert wondered if he was looking for tungyu and glanced round the room himself to see if the chinaman had arrived in chris walkers company but he could not perceive him putting his fortune to the test and having come to no open rupture with the lady rupert boldly walked up to miss wharf and offered his hand she gave him rather a peculiar look and coloured a little but to his secret satisfaction she received him very kindly olivia took her husbands greeting with a quiet smile rather cold as she knew well miss pewsey was watching her face as to that lady she hovered round the group like an ugly old fairy about to weave the spell and where is the major asked miss pewsey in her emphatic way surely he is present on this occasion i am sorry to say that the major is laid up with a bad cold said rupert i have just been to see him he is not coming a cold spoils his beauty tittered miss pewsey dear me how very vain that man is a cold has not spoilt miss wharfs beauty at all events said ainsleigh seeing his way to a compliment i never saw you look so well he added with a bow thanks to lavinias nursing laughed the lady olivia can you keep still while that delicious music is playing im sure mr burgh i think miss rayner is engaged to me put in rupert promptly miss wharf tapped him on the shoulder with the very fan about which there had been so much talk no i cant spare you she said amiably i want to chat with you olivia the girl exchanged a look with her husband and saw that his eyes were fastened on the fan resolved to give him a chance of talking to her aunt about it she moved away on the arm of the buccaneer to join in the whirling throng forge offered his arm to miss pewsey not to dance but to escort her on to the terrace and so it came about that aunt sophia and rupert were left alone in a quiet corner of the room miss wharf cast a side glance at the young man and seeing how handsome and gay he was she heaved a sigh perhaps she was thinking of his father whom she had loved dearly but if so the emotion was only momentary for she compressed her lips and drew herself up stiffly mr ainsleigh she said you never come to see me now how is that i thought you did not wish to see me said rupert frankly oh yes i do your father was an old friend of mine and for his sake i wish to be kind to you rupert saw that she was unaware that he had met olivia secretly and had heard the story of the early romance it was not wise he thought to bring up the subject so he met her on her own ground you can be very kind to me if you wish he said casting a significant glance on olivia who floated past with burgh miss wharf followed his gaze and frowned shaking her head no she said severely you must give up the idea of marrying olivia i cant do that replied rupert thinking of his secret marriage and i dont see why you should refuse to let me love her i cant prevent that snapped miss wharf love her as much as you choose but as another mans wife and again she looked oddly at rupert who wondered what she meant what an immoral remark he said perhaps you will explain mr ainsliegh i will be frank with you said the lady calmly you have no money and are liable to lose royabay i hold a mortgage it is true and by the end of the year i can foreclose but that i shall not do if you give up olivia if i foreclose you know well enough that your other creditors will come down on you and you will lose all i hold the scales added she significantly i see that well enough miss wharf but many things may happen before the end of the year you mean that you will get the money to pay me and others i might even mean that answered rupert coolly and if i am a bad match i dont think mr burgh is a better i have at least a position and a clean name what do you know about clarence burgh she asked quickly nothing save that he is an adventurer miss wharf he comes from nowhere and swaggers about marport as if it belonged to him he has no recognised position and he is not a gentleman oh but he is and i want him to marry olivia and thus you would condemn olivia to misery she loves me a girls love said miss wharf coolly shell soon get over that mr burgh is lavinias nephew and i have promised lavinia that olivia shall be his wife why in heavens name asked rupert angrily he has no money oh yes he has and may have a chance of getting more lavinia has been a good friend to me for years and yearsall my life in fact mr ainsleigh i owe much to her and i intend to repay her her heart is set on this match and olivia must marry clarence olivia shall not olivia shall i set my will against yours mr ainsleigh youll find my will is stronger said rupert coolly miss wharf gave a short laugh try she said curtly then her hard eyes softened and her cold manner grew warmer dont let us quarrel she said gently i wish you well and would give you anything save olivia which is the only thing i want how rude of you to call olivia a thing said the woman lightly you may make up your mind that if you marry her i shall leave my money to miss pewsey do so i dont want your money five hundred a year is not enough sneered miss wharf but i may have more what do you say to five thousand oh interrupted rupert coolly so olivia has told you about the fanor perhaps miss pewsey it was olivia i believe clarence burgh told her this fan miss wharf unfurled the article means five thousand pounds or a cut throat said rupert quickly pah how foolish you are as though such a thing could happen in england were we in china i admit that i should be afraid to keep this fan but as it is i am perfectly safe see here mr ainsleigh she added bending towards him if you will give up olivia i will give you this fan and you can get the money to pay off your creditors no said rupert at once i need thirty thousand not five and even if you were to give me the thirty thousand i need i would not sell olivia for that sum look at the fan first said miss wharf and gave it to him ruperts nerves thrilled as he took the dainty trifle in his hand so much had been said about it so much hung on it of the meaning of which he was ignorant that he could not look at it without feeling the drama it represented balzacs remark about killing a mandarin in china to obtain a fortune occurred to his mind this fan dainty and fragile might cost the life of such a mandarin it all depended into whose hands it fell the fan was exactly as the advertisement described on one side the pale green sticks were enamelled and smooth on the other thin slivers of jade covered the wood and were inscribed in quaint chinese characters in gold the handle was of gold and therefrom hung a thick cord of yellow silk with four beads and half a bead thereon three beads and the half one were of jade but the remaining ball was of jasper what these might mean rupert could not understand but apparently they were connected with the secret of the fan whatever that might be certainly whatever its significance the secret dealt with the life of lokeong with the life of dr forge and with the life of miss wharf seeing she now possessed the article all the time rupert furled and unfurled the fan admiring its beauty she kept her cold eyes on him think she whispered five thousand pounds may gain you a few months respiteyou may be able to save the abbey rupert shook his head if i lose olivia i dont care about keeping royabay it can be sold up and ill go abroad to the colonies to work for my living without olivia no with olivia nothing will buy her from me miss wharf finding all her arts fail snatched the fan from him and bit her lip her eyes flashed and she seemed on the point of making some remark but refrained very good mr ainsleigh said she ill see what i can do with olivia you have ruined her what do you mean by that miss wharf youll find out my friend she replied clenching the fan fiercely oh i am not so blind or so ignorant as you think me ainsleigh turned crimson he wondered if by any chance she had heard of the marriage and it was on the tip of his tongue to put a leading question to miss wharf when chris walker came up he was not alone with him was a small chinaman with the impassive face of the celestial tungyuas rupert guessed he waswore a gorgeous yellow gown with a kind of blue silk blouse over it his feet were encased in thick chinese shoes wonderfully embroidered and his pigtail was down several ladies cast avaricious looks at these gorgeous vestments and especially at the blouse which was heavy with dragons woven in gold thread in his thin yellow hand with long fingernails tungyu held a small ivory fan and he stood impassively before miss wharf not even casting a look at the fan in her hand which he was prepared to buy at such a large price this is mr tungyu said chris boyishly he wants to meet you miss wharf he admires english ladies i fear i cant speak his language chris he can speak ours to perfection said walker tungyu bowed politely and spoke in admirably chosen english i was at cambridge he said calmly and i know of your western culture if you will permit me madam he took a seat beside miss wharf chris seeing his friend well established looked around where is miss rayner he asked oh there she isthe dance is over and so it was the dancers were streaming out on to the balcony and the room was almost empty burgh with olivia on his arm came towards miss wharf and chris hurried forward to ask miss rayner for a dance but quick as he was rupert was quicker he had seen his wife dance with one admirer and was not going to let her dance with another miss rayner is engaged to me he said and offered his arm with a defiant look at burgh to whom he had not been introduced burgh showed no disposition to let olivia go and scowled but his eye fell on the chinaman seated by miss wharf and he suddenly moved away it seemed to rupert that the buccaneer was afraid chris remained to protest but ainsleigh ended the matter by abruptly taking olivia out of the room miss wharf frowned when she saw them depart and opened her mouth as though to call olivia back but on second thoughts she contented herself with another frown and then turned to speak to tungyu i have heard of you she said from my friend mr walker said the polite chinaman oh yes and from someone else through a third party i heard of your advertisement what advertisement asked tungyu about this fan and miss wharf waved it under tungyus narrow eyes which did not change their expression of indifference i do not understand madam the lady looked astonished why didnt you advertise for the fan tungyu permitted himself to smile who told you i did he asked mr ainsleigh who left just now told a friend of mine who told me said miss wharf i understood you wished to possess this fan no said tungyu indifferently the advertisement was placed in the paper by a compatriot of mine called hwei he asked me to see anyone who called about it as he was engaged i saw mr ainsleigh and told him what he told your friend you must apply to hwei and have my life taken said miss wharf with a shudder this time the chinaman was not able to suppress a start i do not quite understand madam he reflected oh yes you do mr tungyu hwei would murder me to get this fan i prefer to sell it to you for five thousand pounds the chinamans face became impassive again though his eyes looked surprised i assure you this is quite wrong madam my friend hwei wants the fan because it belongs to a mandarin who received it as a gift from his dead wife so dearly does this mandarin prize it that he is willing to buy it at any price even five thousand pounds i believe so this mandarin is rich he turned his narrow eyes again on the lady did the person who said that hwei would go as far as crime tell you the mandarins name no who is the mandarin i fear i cannot tell you madam hwei did not tell me if you like i will bring him to you miss wharf hesitated her avarice was aroused by the hope of getting rid of a trifle for five thousand pounds but she did not wish to risk herself alone with a bloodthirsty celestial if you will come also she said hesitating tungyu reflected madam i will be plain with you he said gravely as i am here i can act on behalf of my friend hweibut tomorrow miss wharf tendered the fan why not take it tonight and give me a cheque she said quickly tomorrow replied the chinaman rising and bowing politely i will call on you if you will permit me mr walker will show me the way i will then arrange to buy the fan at a price to which you will not object meanwhile he bowed again and gravely departed miss wharf rather annoyed and surprised by this behaviour looked round for miss pewsey to whom she was accustomed to tell everything the little woman appeared at that moment pushing her way through the crowd in a state of excitement oh sophia she said throwing herself down oh sophia whats the matter asked miss wharf coldly i might ask you said miss pewsey parrying the question you look so upset my sophia it is with pleasure then said the old maid dryly i have arranged to sell this fan tomorrow for five thousand pounds oh miss pewsey clasped her hand what joy you will be able to add to your income but sophia i really cant keep it any longer that major tidman well what about him mr ainsleigh said he had a cold and was confined to his room i went up to see as i dont trust that major a bit hes so wicked i went to his room and peeped in sophia added miss pewsey in a tragic manner he is not therethe room is empty chapter ix the end of the ball miss wharf looked at her excited little friend with an indulgent smile really i dont see why you should trouble she said with a smile let the major do what he likes hes up to some mischief persisted the old maid and id like to find out what it is he is supposed to be keeping his room because of a cold and i find he is not in people with colds added the lady impressively do not go into the night air how do you know major tidman has because he would be at the ball were he in the hotel i shall ask clarence to see what he is doing why asked miss wharf puzzled becauseoh just because replied miss pewsey tossing her head in a sharp way like the red queen in alices adventures but the fan dearest sophiacant i take charge of it miss wharf grasped the fan tighter no certainly not it is worth five thousand pounds and perhaps more said miss pewsey remember dearest sophia that is the sum offered but you might ask more it is very important that this mandarin should get the fan back dr forge told me why is it important theophilus didnt tell me that but he said that this mandarini quite forget his queer namewould give even more than five thousand to get it back his emissary didnt seem very anxious to buy oh that is craft rejoined miss pewsey tossing her head the chinese are very double theophilus says i dont think so lavinia i would have sold this fan for a few pounds had i not known such a large sum was offered tungyu is not a good business man or else the mandarin must be a millionaire he ishe is i wish you would let me conduct the business and do let me take the fan no i shall keep it sophia said miss pewsey solemnly that is dangerous rupert ainsleigh hates you and needs money he might kill you to get that fan and sell it for five nonsense i cannot be murdered in a house full of people like this i know another chinaman hints at murderyou told me so olivia told me to tell you put in the little woman quickly well hwei isnt here and ill sell the fan to tungyu tomorrow miss pewsey would have said more but at this moment dr forge approached with a crooked elbow and a dreary smile allow me to take you into supper miss wharf certainly she rose and took the arm i am really hungry lavinia i shall look for clarence i must find out what has become of major tidman and the old maid hurried away while the doctor escorted miss wharf to the supperroom clarence was not drinking at the buffet though his aunt went there to find him as the most likely place nor was he in the ballroom although a new dance had begun she could not see him in the cardroom but finally ran him to earth on the terrace where he was leaning against a treefern with folded arms and with his wicked black eyes fixed on a couple some distance away miss pewsey followed his gaze and her eyes also flashed for she beheld rupert talking with olivia both their heads were bent and they conversed earnestly the little woman hated olivia and detested rupert so the sight was gall and wormwood to her why dont you ask her to dance she demanded touching her nephews arm because there would only be a row he rejoined sullenly i feel inclined to spoil that chaps looks i can tell you do you really love the girl so yes i do id give anything to marry her and i shall too theres not the slightest chance ainsleigh will not surrender her i can tell you then why did you make me waste that fan you didnt waste it on her said miss pewsey coldly she refused to take it like a fool and now sophia has it there is no chance of getting it back had i known the fan was of such value you wouldnt have caught me advising you to part with it if you knew what this hwei said why didnt you tell me the fan was valuable i did not see hwei until i had parted with the fan said clarence crossly and we can do nothing now you are not so bold as major tidman she whispered whats that asked the buccaneer sharply hes not in his room rejoined miss pewsey in a low voice he pretends illness to carry out his plan to get the fan how do you know that because tungyu is in the hotel the major will try and get the fan to sell it to him in that case he would have come to the ball and have seen miss wharf to get it from her no he has some other plan what it is i dont know but i wish you would look round for him clarence and watch him bah its all stuff burgh turned to look at the sea and the pier and the luminous night im getting sick of this business he went on discontentedly and but for the chance of gaining olivia i would bunk out on the long trail theres a barky out there he continued pointing to the right of the pier yonderthe one with the green light i saw her anchor early in the afternoona kind of gentlemans yacht i fancy shed just do for me id like to take a boat and pull out to her and then get up steam for the south seas theres a clear path leads there down channel and he stared at the flickering green light which winked amongst many red ones youll never get olivia said miss pewsey in a sharp tense voice and you can go away as soon as you like meantime look for major tidman and tell him i want him clarence lazily stretched himself and moved off along the balcony at the end there was a flight of shallow steps leading down to an iron gate which was open thence one could pass to the esplanade and the beach if so inclined but the guests kept to the populous end of the balcony where the lights clustered near the stairs there were hardly any lamps and a screen of flowers curtained it off from the rest of the hotel clarence passed through this floral arch and miss pewsey lost sight of him her eyes turned to the couple she hated and she carelessly moved near them no one noted her as the balcony was not so full and she sat down behind a fern where she could hear without being seen by the two she was spying on their voices were low but hate sharpened miss pewseys ears and she listened intently my aunt is much more amiable tonight olivia was saying i suppose the chance of making five thousand pounds has appealed to her she gave me the chance of making it provided i gave you up said rupert and she lost her temper with me because i declined will you never be friends with her i fear not while miss pewsey is in the way said rupert olivia it is that woman who makes all the mischief i think it is replied the girl with a weary smile but she seems to have a kind of hypnotic power over my aunt what do you mean aunt sophia has bad headaches and miss pewsey sometimes hypnotises her to send away the pain miss wharf is foolish to allow her to do such a thing that little woman is no more to be trusted than her scamp of a nephew is well it doesnt matter said olivia feeling in her pocket i want to talk about ourselves see rupert you wanted a silk tie the other day i have knitted you onered and yellow rupert took the tie and admired it in the lamp light he would have kissed olivias hand after a few words of warm thanks but she prevented him someone might see and tell aunt sophia she said hurriedly i should have given it to you the other day when i called at the abbey but i forgot so i decided to give it to you tonight its rather awkward your having it now give it to me again no ill put it in my overcoat in the cloak room said rupert rising but i must take you back to miss wharf or she will be angry i wish this deception was at an end and i could be with you altogether said olivia rising with a sigh it was at this moment that miss pewsey chose to come forward she was furious at the way in which the couple spoke of her but long habit enabled her to smooth her face to a treacherous smile oh dear olivia she said i have been looking for you everywhere does my aunt want me asked the girl calmly no she is in the supperroom with mr forge but mr walker i dont want him said miss rayner quickly and with a change of voice yesyes said rupert in a low voice go with her and dance with walker it will prevent miss wharf being cross very well rejoined olivia quietly then turned to miss pewsey who smiled like a grotesque image let us go to the ballroom wont mr ainsleigh escort us asked the old maid blandly rupert bowed and smothering his feelings which always revolted at the sight of the woman he walked beside the two to the ballroom miss pewsey took olivias arm and chattered effusively all the time at the door they met chris walker who hurried up at once and asked for a dance leaving the two ladies with him rupert went towards the cloak room here to his surprise he saw major tidman clothed in a heavy fur coat talking to tungyu tidman looked white and uneasy but the chinaman still preserved his impassive face rupert took no notice but simply nodded to the major as he passed pulling out the yellow and red tie as he did so tidman changed colour apparently not pleased at being found talking to tungyu and laughed uneasily thats a bright piece of goods ainsleigh its a present said rupert thrusting the tie into the pocket of his over coat i should think it would match your friends dress hush said tidman quietly he speaks english he will hear then he added aloud let me introduce you to mr ainsleigh tungyu the chinaman turned and looked impassive enough but his eyes had an enquiring look in their black depths tungyu and i met in canton where we had an adventure said the major with a titter about that famous fan asked rupert smiling tungyu started and looked quickly at tidman who was again pale i dont remember about the fan said tungyu did our friend find it in canton no no i never did said tidman hurriedlythat is forge found the fan and gave it to miss wharf quite so replied tungyu blandly i see her tomorrow about the matter then he bowed to rupert and moved away slowly i thought you had a bad cold said rupert to tidman who was looking after the chinaman with a scared expression yesyesbut that is better now said the major hurriedly so miss wharf is here and has the fan yes she offered to give it to me if i surrendered olivia refuserefuse cried tidman hurriedly he approached his lips to ainsleighs ears there is death in the air tonight tidman cried ainsleigh starting away and staring yesyessay nothing i wish you hadnt mentioned about my having the fan tungyu never knewbut it cant be helped ainsleigh is there another chinaman here tonight i have seen none do you expect hwei if so we had better warn miss wharf she has the fan and no nosay nothing dont touch the accursed thing how do you know it is accursed i knew in canton and in a very unpleasant way but ill tell you my adventure tomorrowyes i willif nothing happens tonight rupert stared still harder what can happen tonight man alive nothingnothing said the major hurriedly ill get back to my roomyou neednt say you have seen me i just the man i want cried a bold free voice and burghs slim hand fell on the majors shoulder miss pewsey asks for you for me any more trouble i guess not she wants to fuss round about your cold heaping coals of fires the english of it let her leave me alone said the major petulantly im quite well i am going back to my room and with a nod to rupert he marched out burgh looked after him with a smile and a shrug then he turned to rupert who was moving towards the door can i speak with you he asked with a frown not here mr burgh cried ainsleigh this is not the place for a quarrel and why not cried the other advancing with clenched fists i keep your distance said ainsleigh sharply starting back on his guard the attendant is looking on and he pointed to the man behind the counter who attended to the hats and cloaks burgh tossed him a shilling go and get a drink he ordered stop where you are commanded rupert or ill report you but the man who was a dissipatedlooking waiter pretended not to hear this last remark and disappeared from behind the counter the two men were alone and burgh spoke first i guess im going to lay you out said he on account of stop said rupert mention no names ill mention what i like and olivia ainsleigh let drive before he could finish the word and in a second burgh was sprawling on the floor he rose with an oath and slipped round his right hand you draw a revolver and ill break your neck panted rupert you bully what do you mean by burgh drew his hand awayperhaps he was afraid a shot would bring in others to see the fray but he dashed again at the young man a short struggle ensued which ended in burgh being thrown again then rupert disinclined for a vulgar row walked away he stopped at the door to give his antagonist a bit of advice you touch me again he said and ill hand you over to the police after giving you a good thrashing its what a bully like you deserves and if you dare to speak to miss rayner ill make marport too hot to hold you when rupert vanished burgh raised himself slowly and with an evil smile perhaps the place will be too hot for you my fine gentleman he said savagely and began to think meanwhile rupert went to the ballroom and saw that olivia was dancing with dr forge chris walker told him that miss wharf had gone on to the balcony for the fresh air miss pewsey was not to be seen or rupert would have told her to look after her disreputable relative in the cloakroom the young man thought he would go up to the majors room and have a smoke when he felt a light touch on his shoulder there stood tungyu excuse me sir said the chinaman in his excellent english i am your friend major tidman and dr forge are your enemies and you have a third enemy in that young man burgh but how do you know began rupert tungyu bent forward and whispered i know how your father died he said softly and before rupert could detain him he vanished but ainsleigh waited but for a moment the speech was so surprising that he determined to learn more at once he ran after the chinaman but could not see him in spite of his noticeable clothes he was swallowed up in the crowd and rupert plunged into the gay throng determined to find the man who could solve the mystery of markham ainsleighs death the night wore on and the fun became fast and furious towards twelve the guests began to depart but many choice spirits declared they would keep the ball rolling till dawn one of these was chris walker who had imbibed more champagne than was good for him while he talked excitedly miss pewsey came to him hastily where is my dear sophia she asked i cant find her and with her delicate health it is time she was home in bed i have not seen her have you dr forge the lean doctor shook his head i have been in the card room for the last hour he said and as miss wharfs doctor i assuredly say she should go home theres midnight and as he spoke the strokes boomed from a tall clock in the hall clarence have you seen her asked miss pewsey of the buccaneer who had olivia on his arm no ive just been waltzing with miss rayner then you mr ainsleigh i have been smoking on the balcony said rupert who looked tired oh dear me said miss pewsey wringing her hands i wonder if dear sophia has gone to see major tidman she is so kindhearted and he is illat least he says he is did he tell you clarence i saw him only for a minute and he went back to his room i guess then sophia must have gone there cried miss pewsey and hurried away olivia followed with forge as she thought also that her aunt ought to go home and clarences attentions were becoming so embarrassing that she feared there would be trouble with rupert but soon miss pewsey appeared again and said that miss wharf was not in the majors room nor was the major there taking olivia and clarence and forge she went to search for the missing lady rupert lingered behind as he did not wish to come into contact with the buccaneer the hunt proceeded for some time and every room in the hotel was searched but miss wharf could not be found finally everyonefor many of the guests were hunting by this time went out on the balcony miss wharf was not there oh dear me cried miss pewsey wherever can she be the balcony was searched from end to end then one of the guests more venturesome descended the steps he gave a cry of horror bring a light he cried lights were brought and everyone rushed after them half way down the steps lay miss wharfdeadstrangled and round her throat tightly bound was a yellow and red silk tie chapter x a mysterious case the murder of miss sophia wharf at the bristol hotel ball made a great sensation she had been wellknown in marport and her many friends were enormously excited that each and everyone of them had been acquainted with a person who had beenas one of them put itdone to death also the circumstances of the murder were most extraordinary it seemed almost incredible that a popular lady should be murdered in so public a place though many said that the safety of the assassin lay in the very fact that he had chosen to commit his crime a few yards away from a spot where many people were congregated but who had killed miss wharf and why she was killed in so brutal a manner no one could understand when the local police heard of the assassination an inspector with two subordinates took possession of the hotel and obtained from the manager a list of the guests present at the ball as these amounted to something like two hundred it seemed like looking for a needle in a haystack to search for the criminal amongst them and many of them did not know miss wharf even by sight so it was certain that the task of identifying the assassin would be one of enormous difficulty and the question was asked on all hands what had taken the deceased lady down the littlefrequented steps the fan was missingmiss pewsey noticed that when she bent over the dead but the story of the fan was not yet public property according to custom the local police communicated with the treasury who placed the case in the hands of the criminal investigation department and thus it came about that a plain clothes officerin other words a detectivewas sent down to marport this individual was called rogers and after paying a visit to the superintendent of the marport police office he went to ivy lodge here everything was gloomy and silent the body of the unfortunate woman had been brought home and was laid out for burial dr forge who with others had been on the spot at the time of the discovery examined the corpse and asserted that the miserable woman must have been murdered just an hour or half an hour previous as midnight was chiming shortly before the discovery of the crime it can be safely declaredand dr forge did declare thisthat miss wharf was strangled between eleven and twelve when the corpse was found it was yet warm clarence haunted the lodge and talked with his aunt but olivia kept to her own room tungyu did it of course said mr burgh decisively i reckon he came down to get that fan and grudged giving so much cash for it i surmise that he lured the old girl to those steps and then slipped the silk string round her neck the silk tie said miss pewsey whose eyes were very black and glittering though red round the rims from weeping how do you know its a tie asked clarence with a start i know replied his aunt tightening her thin lips and i know to whom the tie belongs but you say that tungyu who else could have scragged the old girl aunt lavinia the fans goneleastways i didnt see it when we spotted the deader miss pewsey nodded yes the fan is gone she assented but if tungyu murdered dearest sophia he can easily be arrested oh i guess not replied mr burgh easily tungyus no slouch you bet and didnt intend to lose his prize the fan inquired miss pewsey just so the fan replied clarence imperturbably and hes on his way to china by this time clarence miss pewsey rose much excited then calmed down i do not agree with you said she firmly tungyu is innocent ill lay a couple of dollars he isnt aunt lavinia do you remember that yacht i pointed out to you last night well twas a steam deepsea barky two hundred tons lloyds measurement i reckonquite heavy enough to cut round the cape into chinese waters well she arrived in the afternoon yesterday and after midnight she lighted out but how do you know tungyu was on board well i only size that up said clarence musingly but it looks to me as though hed engineered the job twould be easy i guess for him to have had a boat waiting for him after hed killed the old girl and annexed the fan he could dance down those steps like a two year old and pick up the boat on the beach course its all my fancy added burgh modestly but i guess im right i guess youre not snapped miss pewsey in rather an unladylike manner and she rose to shake out her skirts i know who killed dearest sophia she added wagging a lean finger at her nephew i know who possessed the tie and i shall hand that man who the dickens is he anyhow rupert ainsleigh replied miss pewsey with a grim smile and left the room while the buccaneer stared and then smiled it was pleasant to think that his rivalas he considered rupertshould be in such straits and should be pursued by the vindictive hatred of miss pewsey who would leave no stone unturned to bring about the conviction of young ainsleigh well said the buccaneer with his hands in his pockets i guess im not taking a hand in this biznai and it aint lively round these quarters ill git and this mr burgh did when he passed out of the front door he brushed against a plainly dressed rubicund man with sharp grey eyes who glanced at him inquisitively however the stranger said nothing but proceeded to ring the bell the maidservant who appeared took him into the drawingroom and carried a card to miss pewsey the name thereon was orlando rodgers cid with this in her hand miss pewsey sailed into the drawingroom and looked at the comfortable creature who rose to greet her mr orlando rodgers cid queried the little old lady criminal investigation department said the man in a cool voice and with a sharp glance at the dry drab woman im in charge of the wharf murder case and have been sent down by the treasury as i have seen the superintendent and can learn nothing likely to throw light on the subject i have come to youa relative no answered miss pewsey sitting down in a rigid way i am the companion of the late miss wharf her only relative down here at all events is miss olivia rayner can i see her i think notat present she is in her room weeping though why she should display such grief i cant understand added miss pewsey spitefully its natural in a relative miss said the detective looking hard at the withered little face miss pewsey laughed in a shrill manner and spoke between her teeth more than ever emphasising every word as usual oh dear me no said she miss wharf and olivia never got on well the girl hated her aunt though dearest sophiamiss wharf you know sirbrought her up when she hadnt a shilling or a friend in the world to whom have i the honour of speaking asked rodgers wondering how much of this spiteful speech was true and seeing plainly enough that the speaker was no friend to the niece i am lavinia pewsey said that lady and for years i have been the cherished friend and dearest companion of sophia we were at school together and wereas i may saylike two cherries on one stalk anything i can do to avenge her death will be done punishment by the law doesnt come under the head of vengeance it comes under the head of hanging and ill be glad to see the rope round his neck of whom are you talking asked rodgers phlegmatically of the man who killed my dearest friend oh i understood from the superintendent that the affair was quite a mystery not to me snapped miss pewsey rupert ainsleigh strangled her to get the fan what fan asked the detective taking out his notebook and who is rupert ainsleigh miss pewsey spread her skirts and folded her hands together in a prim way i shall tell you all she cried and please take down all i say i am prepared to make this statement in a law court well said rodgers moistening his pencil you may have to now this mr ainsleigh of royabay a few miles from marport said miss pewsey quite one of the old families a nice come down for the ainsleighs for the last of them to die on the gallows he is not there yet said rodgers dryly and may i ask you to speak in a more reasonable way i see you dont like the man i hate him miss pewsey drew a long breath and i hated his father before him to say nothing of his mother who was a cat then your evidence is prejudiced i fancy never you mind mr orlando rodgers she replied sharply take down what i say and then you can sift the matter out for yourself my sophia was murdered to obtain possession of a fan what fan asked rodgers again miss pewsey smiled and calmly detailed all she had learned from dr forge concerning the fan you can ask my nephew clarence burgh about these things also she ended and dr forge and mr christopher walker who brought the chinaman tungyu to the ball and wait a bit interrupted the detective it appears to me from what you say he ran a quick eye over his notes that the suspicion points to these chinamen you mention they advertised and they wanted the fan now hweias i hear from youwas not at the ball but tungyu was therefore tungyu didnt do it said the little woman i dont pretend to understand why hwei offered death and tungyu money for the possession of the fan nor do i know why this mandarin whatever his name may be is so anxious to get possession of the article but i know that the fan is gone and that tungyu who did not intend murder hasnt got it then who has rupert ainsleigh he went up about the advertisement and knew all about the fan i believe he killed my sophia and got the fan so as to sell it for five thousand to tungyu but a gentleman of property wouldnt a gentleman of property snorted the old maid smoothing her dress why hes head over ears in debt and will lose royabay before the end of the year on account of the foreclosure of a mortgage hed have done anything to get money and five thousand pounds is not a small amount this is all very well but i dont see how you connected mr ainsleigh with the crime by means of the silk necktie said miss pewsey with a triumphant smile and related how rupert had received the scarf from olivia if he is guiltless how came his silk tie round the throat of sophia rodgers was shaken by this piece of evidence it looks queer i admit he said then added i understand that mr ainsleigh is an admirer of miss rayner he wants to marry her and she is in love with him said miss pewsey which is an additional reason for the crime i dont understand youre not a sharp man said the old woman tranquilly dont you see that as miss rayner inherits dearest sophias money she will get the mortgage also then with that and the five thousand pounds mr ainsleigh would be free from his moneytroubles well she added sharply as the detective rose what do you say nothing at present give me the address of dr forge who i believe examined the body and of your nephew and mr ainsleigh miss pewsey did this with alacrity and accompanied rodgers to the door dont spare him she said venomously hes guilty and he shall hang and she shut the door herself what a spiteful woman mused rodgers leaving ivy lodge her story is so very explicit that i am inclined to doubt it she wants this young man scragged why he could find no answer to this question but went on his way to see clarence burgh his interview with the buccaneer was brief clarence related the story of the yacht and set forth his theory of tungyu mind said he i dont like ainsleigh as hes trying to run the girl i want to hitch longside of but i guess he didnt scragg the old girl you speak fairer than your aunt said rodgers dryly clarence heaved up his right shoulder huh said he if you go by womans jaw youll get on the shoals tungyu scragged the old girl you bet and hes on his way to china in that yacht well well see if we cant stop the yacht she must coal somewhere what is her name the stormy petrel said clarence i got that out of a boatman who was rowing about her yesterday did he see any chinaman on board no he didnt see anyone there didnt appear to be anyone about or else they were at tea concluded clarence ungrammatically humph said the detective noting the name of the yacht do you know anything of the silk tie no aunt lavinia says it belongs to ainsleigh but i never saw it till it was round the throat of the old girl i should like to think he put it there said clarence pleasantly for i want that chap out of the way but i believe tungyus the man perhaps he is have you a copy of that advertisement no but i reckon ainsleigh has aint you going to see him rogers nodded straight away and i thank you for what you have told me you want him hanged i presume well no i reckon not hes in my way but i can lay him out on my own without the lynching biznai you are fairer than your aunt said the detective once more go slow shes only an aciddrop and you cant size her up just as an ordinary girl she was crazy on markham the father of this young ainsleigh and and proposes to hang the son to avenge herself on his father a nice woman truly but it seems to me mr burgh that if anyone killed miss wharf hwei is the man might be he wasnt at the ball anyhow tungyu was but tungyuas i understand from miss pewseyintended to call the next daytoday that isand buy the fan for five thousand huh clarence heaved up his shoulder again perhaps he thought hed settle in another way day ill be along here whenever you like to call i wish to see this biznai through you bet rodgers departed and sought out rupert at royabay the young man was walking up and down the terrace smoking furiously at the sight of the stranger he frowned and rodgers noted that he looked worn and ill might be money worries thought the detective and it might be the other thing however he kept these thoughts to himself and merely detailed what he had learned from miss pewsey and set forth the accusation she brought against him ainsleigh heard the detective quietly enough and smiled wearily when the explanation was concluded miss pewsey doesnt love me he said quietly and would like to see me out of the way so that miss rayner could marry her nephew i see nodded rodgers miss rayner will have the dead ladys money and the nephew is poor i really dont know replied rupert coldly mr burgh is a mystery to me he comes from nowhere though i believe he has been in china and knows what about the fan i think so at all events young walker declares that burgh was talking to a chinaman near the mansion house burgh admits this and also admits that the chinaman was hwei who put in that advertisement im inclined to suspect hwei himself said rodgers looking keenly at the worn face of the young man but this silk tie it is mine mr rodgers miss rayner gave it to me last night so miss pewsey sayson the balcony quite so miss pewsey was spying and saw the tie given as the colours are rather pronounced she could easily identify it i took it to the cloakroom and placed it in the pocket of my overcoat and took it out again no rupert rose and grew crimson surely you are not so unjust as to believe miss pewseys malignant tale you may be sure mr ainsleigh that ill act fairly towards you said the detective dryly but the tie having been used to strangle i dont know how it came round her throat interrupted ainsleigh imperiously i placed the tie in my overcoat pocketthat was the last i saw of it until i noticed it on miss wharfs dead body did anyone else see the tie yes major tidman who is he a retired army mansouth american armywho stops at bristol hotel he is much respected here i went to the cloak room and found him talking to tungyu both saw me place the tie in my coat rodgers sat up oh said he opening his eyes widely then tungyu saw you place the tie in the coat he did but if you suspect he took it out again i think you are wrong he left the room and i exchanged a few words with major tidman what about about this fan major tidman told me to leave it alone but of course i never intended to meddle with it miss wharf had it and she hated me too much to let me handle it though she did give me the chance of making the money said rupert with an after thought eh how was that she offered to let me have the fan if i gave up my claim to miss rayner whom she desired should marry mr burgh i refused humph said rodgers again and how does major tidman come to know about the fan i refer you to him for an answer and how did he come to know tungyu i believe he met him in canton replied rupert restlessly he had some adventure there connected with this ubiquitous fan asked rodgers sharply yes he promised to tell me the adventure today but i had not seen him yet humph he may come after all ill call on this gentleman at the bristol you say quite so rodgers took a note now then mr ainsleigh tell me how you came to go up about the advertisement rupert related his fathers dealings with lokeong and referred to the secret said to be connected with the fan the detective heard him in silence and appeared to be struck by his frankness i think its one of the most complicated cases i ever had to do with mr ainsleigh and will take a lot of searching into i hope you dont suspect me humph the tie is strangely enough the rope used to strangle this woman and you admit that it is yours but tungyu saw you put it in your overcoat pocket and he wanted the fan for five thousand pounds remember hwei was the one who threatened to gain the fan by killing dont defend tungyu too much said the detective dryly your position is not a pleasant one and do you mean to arrest me asked rupert rising angrily not at present but no doubt at the inquest you can prove an alibi rupert turned away i cant he said in a low voice i was walking outside smoking between eleven and twelveon the beach thats a pity mr ainsleigh i may have to arrest you after all but who is this gentleman major tidmanquite so goodday major chapter xi the canton adventure major tidman who was standing at the foot of the terrace stared at the man before him how do you know my name he asked and looked towards rupert for a reply mr rodgers produced a red silk handkerchief and wiped his face for it was noon and very warm a guess on my part he answered mr ainsleigh said you might come here to tell him of your canton adventure and i fancied it might be you major tidman i am not aware said the major loftily why you should interest yourself in my private affairs i interest myself in everybodys private affairs when they have to do with murder said rodgers quietly tidman stared and gasped then you are the detective in charge of the wharf murder case i am glad to see you sir he laid a finger on tidmans chest you have something to tell me no doubt no said the major gasping again i have not rupert looked at him suddenly and the majors small eyes fell before that direct gaze let us go into the library said ainsleigh tranquilly we may as well have a long talk before i am arrested tidman jumped arrested he cried staring something in his looks made rodgers take the cue thus offered i may have to arrest mr ainsleigh for the murder he said significantly but thats rubbish why should he murder miss wharf on account of the fan put in rupert grimly ill never believe thatnever said tidman vigorously rodgers looked at him sideways well you see said he in a cheerful voice miss wharf was strangled with a red and yellow silk tie belonging to mr ainsleigh i know and i saw him place that tie in his overcoat pocket you say that quite so mr ainsleigh might have taken it out again no he couldnt have done that the attendant came back and remained in the room all the rest of the evening how do you know that because i returned to the cloakroom to see if mr ainsleigh was there i learned from the attendant said the major volubly that mr ainsleigh and mr burgh had been fighting oh said the detective so mr burgh knew of the tie also he did not put in young ainsleigh rapidly he came in after i put the tie away he insulted me aboutabout a lady said rupert hesitating and i knocked him down twice didnt the attendant interfere no burgh threw him a shilling and told him to cut i ordered the man to stay but he obeyed burgh then we had a row and i went away leaving mr burgh in the cloakroom asked rodgers shrewdly yes but he knew nothing about the tie he could not have taken it i am sure he didnt the detective smiled in a puzzled manner upon my word mr ainsleigh you defend everyone first tungyu now mr burgh who is your enemy i have so many enemies said rupert with a shrug tungyu told me that burgh and forge and major tidman were my enemies thats a lie on tungyus part chimed in the major angrily i am not your enemy rupert turned on him quickly prove it then he said sharply by stating that i was with you on the beach last night after eleven oh oh cried rodgers smiling so you can prove an alibi after all mr ainsleigh yes said rupert shortly but i did not wish to speak until i heard what major tidman had to say rodgers shook his head you have too nice a sense of honour was his remark or else you are very deep rupert did not reply his eyes were fixed on the majors face which changed to various colours you knew my father well tidman yes we were old friendsgood friends faltered the other do you know how he died no i do not the major wiped his face i can safely say i do not but you know he was murdered the major started who told you that tungyu and you know tungyu who might have explained the circumstances of my fathers death to you he did not said tidman earnestly but i heard that mr ainsleigh did die by violence i dont know under what circumstances this is all very well gentlemen said the detective but it does not help me it may help you mr rodgers the murder of miss wharf is connected with this fan and the major can tell you about his canton adventure which has to do with it also major tidman turned grey and his face looked fearful i came to tell you rupert he said trying to be calm but it wont help this man he nodded towards rodgers to find the assassin well see about that replied rodgers briskly let us go in and sit down the fan is at the bottom of this business and when i learn all about it i may know how to act the major shrugged his plump shoulders and walked towards the open french window when he passed through to the library the detective and ainsleigh followed in a few minutes they were comfortably seated rupert asked the two if they would have some refreshments and receiving a reply in the affirmative rang the bell though mind you mr ainsleigh said rodgers this drinking a glass of wine doesnt stop me from arresting you if i see fit you can set your mind at rest said rupert coldly i have no wish to tie you down to a bread and salt treaty some wine mrs petley the housekeeper who had entered was as plump as ever but her face looked yellow and old and haggard and there was a terrified look in her eyes in strange contrast to her usual volubility she did not speak a word but dropping a curtsey went out that woman looks scared said the detective she is scared assented rupert we have a ghost here mr rodgersthe ghost of a monk and mrs petley thought she saw it last night really said the detective with goodhumoured contempt she thought she saw a ghost what nonsense no sir it aint nonsense it was the housekeeper who spoke having seen the major coming up the avenue she knew that he would require his usual glass of port and therefore had prepared the tray while the conversation was taking place on the terrace this accounted for her quick return and she set down the tray with the jingling glasses and decanter as she spoke it was a ghost sure enough said mrs petley when the small table was placed before the three gentlemen the ghost of abbot raoul ive seen him times and again but never so plainly as last night it was between eleven and twelve added mrs petley without waiting for permission to speak and i sat up for master rupert here i took a walk outside it being fine and dry and like a fool i went in to the abbey why shouldnt you go there asked rodgers because abbot raoul always walks where he was burnt replied mrs petley and there he was sure enough no moonlight could i see but the stars gave a faint light and he was near the squarethe accursed square where they burnt the poor soul i gave one screech as he swept past in his long robes and a cowl and when i come to myself on the damp grass he was gone i hurried in and told petley who came out and searched but bless you went on the housekeeper with contempt he couldnt find a thing that had gone back to the other worldnot he it was a dream mrs petley said rupert soothingly no sir trouble is coming to the ainsleighs as always does when the abbot walks and this morning i went out and found this and mrs petley fishing in her capacious pocket produced a small stick which smelt like cinnamon round it was a roll of scarlet paper inscribed with queer characters rupert stretched out his hand to take it but the detective anticipated him its a jossstick said rodgers ive seen them in the whitechapel opium dens humph why should the ghost of an old monk use a jossstick like the chinese before anyone could reply mrs petley gave a cry i told you trouble was coming master rupert dear she said with the tears streaming from her fat face and anything to do with that weary chiner where your poor pa lost his life always do bring trouble oh dear me she put her silk apron to her eyes and walked slowly out of the room i must tell my john he may be able to say whats coming as he have a gift of prophecy that he have when mrs petley closed the door after her the three men looked at one another do you believe in this ghost mr ainsleigh asked the detective examining the jossstick rupert did not give a direct answer i dont know what to believe mr rodgers our family traditions have always pointed to the walking of of abbot raoul before trouble and it might be so i have never seen the ghost myself though your ghost is a chinaman said the detective tapping the stick but what would a chinaman be doing in the cloisters ah thats what weve got to find out there was a yacht in marport harbour last night which came at midday and departed in a hurry after midnight burgh says he believes tungyu went away in her after committing the murder even if he did said rupert calmly that does not show how the jossstick came here or why a chinaman should be masquerading as a monk for that i take it is your meaning it is i believe there were other chinamen on board that boat was the detectives reply perhaps this man hwei came to the abbey he might have come said ainsleigh carelessly or tungyu went on rodgers no said the major who had kept silent all this time but had observed everything it was not tungyus day rodgers turned on him what do you mean by that the major settled himself more comfortably in his chair ill tell you my adventure at canton first he said and then you may understand i cant get to the bottom of the matter myself for why lokeong should have a private god of good luck is more than i can tell the others looked at him amazed at this queer speech what is this private god asked the detective i dont know save that it is called kwangho rupert started that was the god mentioned in the advertisement yes so it was replied the major quietly but just you wait and hear my story it may lead to something being discovered one moment mr ainsleigh show me the advertisement rupert rose and going to the writingdesk took therefrom the slip he had cut from the paper rodgers read it quietly i see here is mentioned the doom of the god kwangho lokeongs private god of good luck said the major are there private as well as public gods in china tidman looked perplexed i cant say i know nothing wait and hear what i can tell he settled himself again and began to speak rapidly i was in canton seven years ago said he i had made my money here and didnt intend to travel again but miss wharf persuaded me to go to china to see if i could find out why markham ainsleigh had been killed rupert looked astonished why she hated my father she loved him first and hated him later said tidman quietly a fine woman was poor miss wharf i was in love with her i never knew that tidman i was though said the major and miss pewsey hated me for being in love with her i spoke badly of miss wharf to you ainsleigh because i was angered with her you called her a mass of granite and so she is said the major angrily she promised to marry me if i went to china and learned how your father came by his death i did go but i came back without learning more than that he was murdered so miss wharf refused to keep her promise i believe it was that pewsey cats fault wellwellgo on said rodgers looking at his watch all this business is very roundabout i want to get on with my work this may have to do with it said the major smartly well i was in canton and intended to go up to the kansu province to make enquiries i met forge in canton he had just come from pekin and showed me round he laughed at the idea that markham had died by violence and said it was dysentery so he always said murmured rupert who listened intently and told a lie retorted tidman however i believed him but all the same i intended to make enquiries at the mine of the hwei river in the kansu province but i stopped in canton with forge for a time as he said he would go up with me in some way the fact of my trying to learn the truth about markams death got about no doubt forge told it to others suggested rupert i dont know i never got to the bottom of the business but one day a halfstarved chinaman stopped me in the street and told me he could explain if i came with him i went to a miserable house in a low part of the city the man closed the door and then drew a fan from his breast the fan in question asked rodgers making a note yesthe very article he told me that this fan would reveal the truth and offered it to me for money no he refused to take a penny he seemed anxious to get rid of the fan and kept looking round everywhere as though he thought someone might be listening i asked him how the fan could tell about the death but all he said was that it could but in what way asked ainsleigh puzzled i really dont know said the major with an air of fatigue i am telling you all i know i took the fan and cleared and got home safely enough then i hid away the fanwhere it doesnt matter but i have travelled so much that i always keep a secret place for money and valuables i placed the fan there though i really didnt know what to make of the matter after a few days i came to my rooms to find that everything had been ripped open and smashed and searched and the fan was gone said rodgers not it theywhosoever they were who searched could not find my hiding place well a day or two later as i was walking along the street at night i was seized up and gagged and carried to some low chinese house there a chinaman examined me and asked me what i had done with the fan what sort of a man was he asked rupert would you know him again the major looked doubtful chinamen are all so alike he said but this chap had only one eye and was a villainous looking beast he declared that he knew the first celestial had given me the fan and that he wanted it i refused to give it up he took out a knife and said he would slice me up oh broke off the major looking grey and old however shall i forget that terrible moment ainsleigh do you wonder that i shudder to relate this adventure and that i refuse to speak of it i was in that miserable place in the midst of a horde of chinamen bound and helpless with a knife at my throat i never did care for death said tidman boldly but to be cut slowly into slices was more than i could stand why didnt you give up the fan then asked rodgers because i made up my mind that slicing or no slicing i wasnt going to be bullied by a lot of heathen devils the position was awful but im an englishman and i resolved to hold off to the last moment i dare say i would have given up the fan after all as the oneeyed brute began to cut me up i lost a big toe oh said rupert while rodgers shook his head did this man cut a toe off yesmy big toe i was about to give in when suddenly a small chinese boy dressed in redqueerly enough as the chinese dont go in much for that colourappeared and said something the oneeyed chinaman scowled and put his knife away then he cleared out with the boy and his other friends and i was left alone then with the loss of blood and the pain of my toe i fainted no wonder said ainsleigh i dont blame you well well then i came to my senses in my own room forge was with me and said that he had traced me to the hovel and had rescued me with the aid of the canton police he declared that i would have to leave canton at once or this oneeyed chinaman would be after me i agreed and with forge i went that very day on board a homewardbound steamer i thanked forge for having helped me and he asked if i would give him the fan as a reward i refused as i wanted to know how it could tell about markhams death forge said that if i kept possession of the fan the oneeyed chinaman would track me to england and kill me but i held out till i got to marport then i grew weary of forge worrying me particularly as he promised to do what he could to learn the secret of the fan and help me to marry miss wharf so he took the fan and then as you know ainsleigh he took it out to china again where it fell into the hands of a pirate from whom clarence burgh received it but how did it get from dr forges hands into those of the pirate asked rodgers curiously i dont know you can ask forge he lives here the detective took a note of the doctors address thats all right he said theres no doubt the poor lady was killed to procure this fan did you tell her of your adventure no said the major with a shudder i merely said that i could not learn how markham was killed and she refused to marry me i did not care about speaking of the adventure you know how the fan came into miss wharfs possession mr rodgers yes the detective nodded mr burgh told me but ill have another talk with him humph it seems to me that one of these chinamen killed miss wharf and that the tie was used to lay the blame on mr ainsleigh here well said ainsleigh drawing a breath i am glad to hear that you dont suspect me but i cant think that tungyu stole the tie even though he did see me place it in the coat ill look after that cloakroom attendant said rodgers making another note and hell have to give an account of himself but i dont see what this private god kwangho has to do with the matter i can only tell you this said major tidman i had a cold last night and stopped in my room but i heard that tungyu was down the stairs and as i knew him in canton i went to have a look for him he was a pleasant companion in canton did you tell him about the fan and your adventure no ainsleigh and i was annoyed that you should have let slip that i had such an adventure i dont want to be mixed up in the matter tungyu is nice enough but if he has to do with the fan he is quite capable of turning nasty and making things unpleasant for me but i mentioned about his advertisement and how i came to know of it through you he confessed that lokeong had lost the fan and wished it back again as it had to do with some family business the finding of it was referred to the god kwangho and the priest of the god said that two men were to search for the fan hwei and tungyu yes they were to search on alternate days if hwei found it he was to kill the person from whom he got it if it was tungyus day he was to give the fortunate person five thousand pounds and whose day was it on the night of the crime hweis said the major that was why tungyu could not buy the fan when miss wharf offered it to him chapter xii at the inquest when mr orlando rodgers of the cid rolled into the superintendents office the next day to relate what he had heard he was not so glib as usual after sleeping on the extraordinary tale he had heard from major tidman and considering the fragments imparted by clarence burgh and young ainsleigh he came to look on the matter as something to do with the arabian nights the fan which the deceased lady had carried at the ball was certainly gone and the whole of these marvellous matters connected with china hung on the fan but miss wharf may have been murdered for some other reason and rodgers was half inclined when looking into the case in the cold searching morning light to abandon the fan theory but he delayed doing this until he had consulted with superintendent young who looked after the marport police what do you think of it he asked when his tale was told the superintendent was a tall thin man with a cold eye and a distrustful manner he believed only half he saw and absolutely nothing he heard consequently when rodgers ended and his opinion was asked he sniffed disdainfully and put on his most official expression its a fairy tale said young in his dry voice which was like the creaking of a rusty wheel well now the woman was murdered but not for this fan mr rodgers then what motive do you think i dont undertake to say sir let us gather all the evidence we can and submit it to an intelligent jury at the inquest it takes place today at the public house near the corner of the cliff road and not far from ivy lodge when the jury has inspected the body it will sit with the coroner at the bulls head a chinaman calling himself tungyu was at the ball you know said rodgers unwilling to abandon the theory in spite of his doubts where is he now i cant say mr christopher walker brought him down and i went to see that young gentleman before he departed for business this morning he told me that tungyu was a clerk in the same firm of tea merchants as he was employed with and had not been at the office since he left to come to the ball mr walker last saw tungyu at the door of the hotel looking out across the pier well said young drily that yacht was there went on rodgers and showed a green light so its just possible that mr burgh may be right and that the chinaman did steam away in her well then search for the yacht i intend to and when i find her mr tungyu will have an explanation no mr rodgers said the superintendent rising i cant believe all this business is about a trifle such as this fan some more serious motive is at the bottom of this murder now mr ainsleighs tie i can explain that said the detective and he did young listened disbelievingly so he says was his comment but i dont think mr ainsleigh is the sort of man to commit a brutal crime like this and in so public a place everyones capable of committing a crime if theres anything to be gained was the superintendents philosophy and mr ainsleighs very agreeable manner with which you appear to be struck may be a mask to hide an evil nature oh rubbish begging your pardon mr young look at this jossstick and rodgers held it out that was found in the ruins of royabay abbey so you see some chinaman must be mixed up in the job i am beginning to believe that the tale may be true after all its too wildtoo farfetched i cant believe it because you havent imagination we dont want imagination in this matter mr rodgers facts sir rodgers got up and put on his hat well well not be able to agree i can see that said he and as the case is in my hands i am going away to look after evidence why not arrest mr ainsleigh because the evidence against him is not sufficiently strong the detective sat down again see here mr superintendent if i so chose i could manufacture a case against three of these people at least and give it to them pretty strong too supposing for the sake of theorising mind we say mr ainsleigh killed the woman which i am inclined to think he did on the ties evidence very good i can show you how strong you can make the case against him mr young this young man was at the ball he hated the deceased and she hated him on account of the difficulty of the marriage with miss rayner ainsleigh wants money badly and might have killed the old woman to get the fan and sell it for five thousand pounds also by marrying miss rayner who will inherit miss wharfs money he gets rid of a mortgage thats troubling him what was easier for him than to pretend to put the silk scarf in his coat pocket so as to blind those who saw him do it and then to lure miss wharf out on to those steps and scrag her then he could pass the fan to tungyu who wanted it and arrange about the money being paid after that and when tungyu had gone off to the yacht mr ainsleigh could slip back into the ballroom and assist in finding the body and remember he says he was strolling on the beach smoking between the hours of eleven and twelve and wont prove an alibi though between ourselves i think he can through major tidman well said young dryly doesnt this go to prove his guilt i can prove tungyus in the same way said rodgers coolly he was in the cloakroom when mr ainsleigh placed the scarf in the coat he could easily have stolen it as these chinamen are clever thieves and have then lured miss wharf on to the steps under the pretence of treating about the fan suddenly he slips the scarf round her throat before she can cry out goes down the steps and on to the beach where a boat is waiting for him and by now may be on his way to his employer the mandarin lokeong it sounds feasible i admit but one moment went on rodgers eagerly quite as strong a case can be made out against major tidman he did not come to the ball but lurked in his room all the evening yet he came down to see tangyuwhat aboutto sell the fan of course you cant prove that am i proving anything i am simply showing you what strong cases can be built up out of nothing well then tidman sees the scarf put in the coat by a young man whom he knows is at enmity with the deceased and takes it out again he gets miss wharf to come on to the terraceany pretext will do as he is her lover and her old friend there he strangles her on the steps and taking the fan passes it along to the chinaman who makes for the yacht so you see if i chose i can build up a case against each of these three gentlemen and each equally strong why if i had a mind to entangle young mr burgh in the affair i could do so but tungyu mr burgh and major tidman might prove alibis so they might and mr ainsleigh might do so also he has not done so yet and if he was in danger he would quite so said rodgers quickly and seeing the slip and his very reluctance to prove an alibifor surely someone besides tidman must have seen him on the beachshows me he is innocent however this isnt business mr young so ill go and see what evidence i can gather so to dr forge went the detective feeling very bewildered over the case and small blame to him for the matter was surely most perplexing it is only in novels that the heavenborn detective in the confidence of the author displays wonderful cleverness in finding clues where none exist but a flesh and blood worker like rodgers had to puzzle out the matter in real life as best he could he was not at all sanguine that he would run down the assassin of miss wharf on the face of it rupert ainsleigh appeared to be guilty and rodgers doubted his guilt for this very reason i believe one of these chinaman did it said rodgers as he rang forges bell dr forge was within and consented at once to see the detective when the two were in the chinese room rodgers unfolded himself and asked forge who knew the chinese character what he thought my dear sir the case is plain said forge calmly tungyu gave hwei the office and lured miss wharf on to the steps where hwei strangled her with the scarf stolen by tungyu so as to throw suspicion on mr ainsleigh humph it looks like it said rodgers musingly so you believe this wild story of major tidmans i know it is true said forge quietly i helped him to get free as he related i was a partner with mr markham ainsleigh in the mine on the hwei river i went to pekin about a concession and while i was away mr ainsleigh died of dysentery as to the fani cant exactly say i never knew of this private god business but its the kind of thing lokeong might invent he is a very superstitious man and like napoleon he believes in his star he was concerned in the boxer rebellion but afterwards he joined the court party of the dowager empress who is now all powerful i never saw the fan in his hand but it might have to do with a secret what kind of a secret i cant say unless it has to do with lokeongs political fortunes he has many enemies who envy his rapid rise these enemies probably stole the fan to ruin him how this coolie who gave it to major tidman got hold of it i dont know but he was glad to get rid of it which makes me think the story of the alternate days and the blessing of the god kwangho might be true the chinese do not think as we do mr rodgers and have their own way of settling these matters the attack on tidman when he had the fan in canton shows clearer than ever that it was wanted by lokeongs enemies he gave it to me why did you want it for two reasons said forge quietly in the first place from what happened to tidman i saw that while he held the fan he was in danger but then you were in the same danger objected the detective i was and i expected trouble but i was better able to deal with the matter than tidman as i understand the chinese character i got the fan in london and locked it up in yonder cabinet i thought it was there all the time and when i found it gone i was quite annoyed as major tidman will tell you then i recollected that i had taken it back to china to give to lokeong that is my second reason mr rodgers i knew i could get a concession i wanted through lokeongs influence and i did so the fan went back to him and you forgot that you had given it i did it seems strange to you but as i told tidman and miss pewsey my memory is impaired by opium smoking however that is the story of the fan and burgh got it from the hand of the dead pirate how the pirate came possessed of it i cant say apparently lokeong lost it again he couldnt have valued it much if he lost it so often he valued it at five thousand pounds and more said the doctor dryly how it was lost i cant say i may find out when i go to china again in a few months lokeong is in pekin and as we are friends he will tell me and show me the fan again ah then you believe i believe it is on its way to lokeong and that tungyu and hwei came together down here to get it when only one was on the spot this god business of alternate days made the matter difficult with both together the owner of the fan was bound to be killed or made rich unfortunately for miss wharf the day or night was hweis and he carried out the order of the god kwangho by strangling her well said rodgers rising all i can say is that im glad i do not live in china how much of this is to be made public my advice to you is to make nothing public or as little as you can said dr forge dryly you see how persistent these chinamen are you make trouble and you may be killed also your being in england wont save you any more than it saved miss wharf poor soul i shall do my duty in spite of all said rodgers coolly i am not going to be frightened by a couple of chinese brutes very clever brutes said forge softly but rodgers took no notice and marched away with his head in the air come what may he was determined to punish the assassin of miss wharf and if it was hwei the man would have to be caught ill go to pekin myself for him said rodgers angrily im not going to be bested by these barbarians little that was new came to his hand before the inquest which was a comparatively tame affair the jury inspected the body and then adjourned to the bulls head to hear the case rodgers set forth what evidence he had gained but touched as lightly as possible on the chinese business he called dr forge who deposed to having examined the body and asserted that miss wharf had been killed between eleven and twelve she must have been strangled almost instantaneously as had she cried out she would have been overheard by those on the terrace this evidence caused but little sensation when rupert was called however all were excited he deposed as to the scarf which he had received from olivia and said what he had done with it he declared that he had been walking on the beach smoking and only returned to the ballroom shortly before midnight when the body was discovered he stated that he had spoken to major tidman on the beach and thus proved an alibi clearly enough the rest of the evidence was not very important chris walker told how he had brought tungyu to the ball and handed in a slip of advertisement and then rupert was recalled to tell what he knew tidman related his interview with tungyu and described how both had seen rupert place the tie in the overcoat pocket then it appeared that the whole of the case turned on the fact that the scarf had been removed from the pocket no one knew miss pewsey said that rupert took it but her evidence was so obviously prejudiced that the jury would not believe all she said lotty dean who was at the ball declared that she saw miss wharf cross the terrace about eleven and go towards the floral arch on the other side of which were the steps she was quite alone and seemed tranquil she was fanning herself at the moment said the witness ah said the coroner then she had the fan at that time it was gone when we found the body put in miss pewsey and was rebuked for speaking out of order the interest of the case turned on the evidence of dalham the attendant in the cloakroom he was a dissipatedlooking man and gave his evidence very unwillingly owing to his having left the cloakroom at burghs request rupert as he threatened to do had reported him to the manager and mr dalham had been dismissed this loss of his situation did not make him any the sweeter towards ainsleigh but all the same he could not state on his oath that the young man had returned to take the tie again from the pocket nor had the chinaman or major tidman returned dalham knew the major well and as he phrased it would have spotted him at once while the gay dress of tungyu would have been equally conspicuous had he attempted to meddle with a coat which did not belong to him you did not leave the room again asked the coroner i only left it once said dalham because mr burgh and mr ainsleigh wanted to fight weve heard about that and it has nothing to do with the case said the coroner but you were in the room the rest of the evening ive said so a dozen times sir growled the badgered man lots of people came for their things and some late arrivals left theirs but i was at my post all the time except that once when i left mr burgh with mr ainsleigh i never saw major tidman nor mr ainsleigh nor the chinaman touch the cloak the coroner called burgh and asked him if he was alone in the room at any time clarence frankly admitted that he was but as i never saw ainsleigh place the tie in the coat and never knew that he possessed such a tie i dont see how you can accuse me much more evidence was given but it all led to no result finally the jury having heard much more of the chinese story than rodgers approved of brought in a verdict against tungyu hwei they could say nothing about as he had not been present but tungyu wanted the fan and the fan had disappeared while tungyu was also absent wilful murder against tungyu was the verdict and on hearing the evidence and on reading all that had been said in the papers the general public agreed with the verdict under the circumstances no other could have been given only one person dissented it was that ainsleigh who killed dearest sophia said miss pewsey chapter xiii the will the funeral of miss wharf was attended by many people of course all her friends came with the usual wreaths of flowers but owing to the tragic circumstances of her death many strangers were present she was buried in the family vault with much ceremony and then the mourners departed talking of the crime it was the general opinion that tungyuwho had not yet been heard ofwas responsible for the death and that he had sailed away in the stormy petrel rodgers having returned to town after the inquest was making inquiries about the yacht when he discovered her he hoped to learn particulars as to the flight of tungyu these many days rupert had not seen olivia although he had called at ivy lodge but miss pewsey who took charge of everything in her usual meddlesome way would not allow him to be admitted olivia did not even know of his visit she remained in her room and mourned the death of her aunt miss wharf had certainly been a good friend to her but she could not be said to have been a kindly aunt all the same olivias conscience pricked her for having secretly married rupert as she now thought she should have told her aunt but the marriage was decided upon in a hurry and when the girl had been more than usually piqued by the insulting speeches of miss wharf however the old woman was dead and olivia little as she loved her wept for her tragic end miss rayner during her mourning read the evidence given at the inquest and wondered why she had not been called as a witness if only to prove that she had given the scarf to rupert she thought it extraordinary that tungyu should have used the tie to strangle miss wharf and could not think how it came into his possession after some thought she concluded that he had taken the scarf from ruperts pocket so as to implicate him in the crime and had bribed dalham the attendant who certainly was not above being bribed to say nothing about the matter if this were the case dalham would probably blackmail tungyu for the rest of his life as he was just the kind of rascal to make money in shady ways then it occurred to olivia that as tungyu had sailed for china presumably in the yacht dalham would not be able to make a milch cow of him however whether tungyu was guilty or not she cared little rupert was safe in spite of the evidence of the scarf and so long as he escaped being arrested the girl felt perfectly happy after the funeral olivia came downstairs again and found miss pewsey looking after things as usual the little old maid was most polite and it seemed as though she was now anxious to make much of olivia thinking she would inherit the money miss pewsey had not a shilling to bless herself with and for years had lived on the bounty of miss wharf now that olivia was to be the mistress of ivy lodge miss pewsey appeared desirous of making herself pleasant so that she might remain olivia saw through her newly born politeness and although she disliked the woman was not averse to her remaining for a time at least i should be glad for you to remain altogether explained olivia when matters came to be discussed but of course now that my aunt is gone i may marry mr ainsleigh oh hell marry you quick enough for your money snapped miss pewsey not but what hes a handsome young fellow but dont run down rupert interrupted olivia flushing i love him you have never been just to him miss pewsey coughed i dont think he is a very good young man i hate good young men said olivia mr chris walker is one of those who never cost his mother a single pang why my aunt should wish me to marry such a milksop i cant understand well then why not marry clarence asked the old maid he is not a milksop and has cost his motherpoor soul many a pang and he loves you dearly olivia i should think you would be able to live very nicely on five hundred a year and with this house rent free if i come into possession of the property that is oh i am sure you will said miss pewsey effusively to whom should dear sophia leave the money if not to you her nearest relative she might have left it to you for she loved you while she only tolerated me miss pewsey threw up her mittened hands with a cry of dismay oh my dear theres no chance of my being so lucky sophia was very close about money matters surely not with you miss pewsey she always consulted you in everything you had great influence over her if so i made no use of it for my own benefit said miss pewsey with great dignity sophia never consulted me about her wills i know she made several and dictated the last just a week before her death while she was confined to her room with that cold you know olivia i suppose miss pewsey tittered i suppose she wanted to be amused i shouldnt think making ones will was amusing said olivia dryly however the lawyer will be here this afternoon to read the will and we shall know if i inherit i am sure you will get the money and dear you wont forget your poor lavinia purred miss pewsey let me remain here with you until you marry mr ainsleigh or until i marry theophilus are you really going to marry dr forge asked miss rayner looking with secret amazement at the withered face and shrunken form of miss pewsey and wondering what the doctor could see in her to make her his wife i really am said miss pewsey emphatically and with a shrewd look in her eyes and i see that you think it is ridiculous at my age to marry also i am not handsome i know all the same theophilus is willing to make me mrs forge and i dare say ill grace the position well enough it isnt love added miss pewsey at our age dear that would be too absurd we are simply entering into a partnership he has money and i have brains dr forge has brains also not so much brain power as i have i am not lovely i know dear but i am clever and miss pewsey drew herself up proudly why poor dear sophia would never have died worth so much money but for me ah if she had only given me that fan when i asked her she would not have been killed and i should have got five thousand pounds and more from tungyu for her but she would keep the fan miss pewsey squeezed out a tear and so met with her doom that nasty chinaman miss pewsey shook a small fist i wish he could hang olivia looked at her i heard that you disagreed with the verdict miss pewsey meaning that i said mr ainsleigh was guilty snapped the old maid well i did dear but i have changed my mind miss rayner did not believe this for miss pewsey looked very malignant as she spoke her change of opinion was made merely to adapt herself to circumstances and to retain a home until such time as her marriage with forge would enable her to dispense with miss rayners help however olivia did not argue the point she wished to keep on good terms with the old maid until rupert declared the secret marriage then she could go to the abbey and leave miss pewsey behind with all other disagreeable things with pastor the solicitor of the deceased lady came clarence burgh and dr forge lady jabe more manly than ever appeared with chris walker who had taken a holiday on purpose to hear the will read and lady jabe explained this to miss pewsey in a whisper i know that poor sophia wished chris to marry olivia she said so i thought the will might state that the money would be left to her on such a condition i therefore made chris ask for a holiday so that he might hear of his good fortune let us hope it will come aid miss pewsey dryly but fortune or no fortune olivia will stick to young ainsleigh he is a nice young man but poor chris is poor also yet you want him to marry olivia i think chris has a better character than young ainsleigh who looks as though he has a will of his own now chris has none i have broken it and olivia as mrs walker can order him about like a slave i hope sophia has made the will as i wished youll hear in a minute for my part added miss pewsey in her spiteful way i hope sophia has left the money to olivia on condition that she marries clarence and keeps him at home and keeps him on the income corrected lady jabe who did not at all approve of this speech no man should live on his wife you propose that chris should do so indeed no he earns quite a good salary at the office and i could live with the young couple to prevent waste i am quite sure you would said miss pewsey if you get the money lady jabe would have made a sharp reply as miss wharf being dead she was under no obligation to curry favour with miss pewsey but at that moment she saw chris talking to olivia and as the girl seemed deeply interested she pointed out the two with her cane i see chris is losing no time she murmured such a lover as he is but had she heard chris talking she would not have been so happy the young man was simply replying to a question put by olivia as to the whereabouts of tungyu i really dont know where he is miss rayner said chris earnestly there was a policeofficer at our place the other day inquiring but tungyu has not been near kumgum lis since i took him to the ball i believe he asked me to get him an invitation so that he might kill your aunt does kumgum li know anything about him asked olivia no he came with a letter of introduction from a mandarin lokeong no that is not the namelet me seethe mandarin hop sing ah said forge who was listening lokeongs rival i never knew that but kumgum li gave tungyu a place as extra clerk when he received the letter he knows nothing more than what the letter explained and what did it explain asked forge with sudden interest i cant tell you replied chris coldly i am not in the confidence of my employer and if i were he added fixing an indignant eye on the sardonic face of the doctor i should say nothing quite right replied forge not at all disconcerted you keep out of these chinese affairs theres danger in them connected with the fan demanded olivia yes said forge slowly connected with the fan olivia being a woman and curious would have asked further questions to which dr forge might have hesitated to reply but that miss pewsey called her dear theophilus to her side the will was about to be read and miss pewseyso she saidwanted support forge crossed to the withered little shrimp he had chosen heaven knows why for his wife and sat down the lawyer opened an envelope and took out a rustling parchment just as he cleared his throat the door opened and the maid announced mr ainsleigh miss pewsey glared and no one appeared glad to see him lady jabe least of all as she knew he was a powerful rival to chris but rupert bowed to the company in silence took no notice of their cold looks and walked over to where olivia sat a little apart he seated himself beside her the girl smiled a little faintly and then gazed straight before her no one made any remark as pastor was beginning to read the will miss wharf it appeared died worth one thousand a year and the house and furniture and land of ivy lodge five hundred a year went to a distant relative as miss wharf was unable to leave it to anyone else by reason of only having a life interest in this amount then a few personal bequests were left to lady jabe to chris walker and to some other friends ivy lodge and the furniture and the land it was built on and the remaining five hundred a year was left tolavinia pewsey when the name was mentioned the little old maid quivered and olivia pale and quiet rose to her feet in a moment miss pewsey prepared for battle was on her feet also and the two women looked at one another you knew of this will said olivia quietly no replied miss pewsey you did and all your paying court to me was a blind so that i might not suspect aunt sophia had left the money to you dearest sophia left the money to whom she chose said miss pewsey in a sharp shrill voice do you mean to say that i exercised any undue influence over her i say nothing was olivias reply but hard on me as my aunt was i do not think she would have left me penniless while the money which belonged to my family goes to a perfect stranger a stranger cried miss pewsey tossing her head am i a stranger indeed i was hand and glove with dear sophia when we were at school together i gave up my life to her and you have got your reward said olivia bitterly as you say retorted miss pewsey tossing her head again but the will is in order and i had nothing to do with the making of it i appeal to mr pastor why certainly said the lawyer looking on olivia with something like pity miss wharf gave me instructions to make a new will during the week before she met with her untimely end miss pewsey was not in the room but no doubt she induced my aunt to cut me out of the will no cried miss pewsey breathing very hard and looking more drab than ever i wont stand this your aunt had good cause to take the money from youoh you deceiving girl at this rupert suddenly rose and took olivias hand he half guessed what was coming and looked at the spiteful face of the heiress olivia stared she could not understand miss pewsey was about to speak when mr pastor intervened may i be permitted to remark that i have not finished reading the will of the deceased lady said he sweetly theres no more money to be disposed of said olivia bitterly my enemy has got it all pastor made a gesture of silence to prevent miss pewsey bursting out into a volume of words there is no more money to be disposed of as you say miss rayner but miss wharf sets forth in the will why she disinherited you ah cried olivia a light breaking in upon her and reading the truth in miss pewseys look of triumph so my aunt knew she knew that you had secretly married the gentleman beside you everyone was on his or her feet by this time and every look was directed towards olivia is this true asked lady jabe yes cried miss pewsey before either rupert or olivia could speak of course it is true let them deny it if they can i heard olivia say herself that she had been married at a registrars miss rayner or rather mrs ainsleigh turned on the little woman i should like to know when i said that to you miss pewsey you never said it to meoh dear no said miss pewsey shrilly you were not straightforward enough but i heardoh yes i heard miss wharf said the lawyer folding up the will told me that she learned of this from miss pewsey just before she called me in to make a new will the five hundred a year was left to you miss mrs ainsleigh said rupert quickly very good to you mrs ainsleigh by a former will but on discovering the secret marriage my client made a new willthis he shook it and miss pewsey benefits miss pewsey has every right to benefit said mrs ainsleigh in a clear cold voice she has been well paid for being a spy spy shrilled miss pewsey glaring yes i was a spy in the interests of dearest sophia i followed you several times when you went to meet mr ainsleigh near the flagstaff and on the last occasion ah said olivia tranquilly so i thought i heard something moving it was you concealed rupert said it was a ratperhaps he was right well miss pewsey you have gained your ends and now now you leave my house said the old maid yes my house olivia made no reply but placed her hand within her husbands arm rupert conducted her towards the door mrs ainsleighs effects will be sent for said he looking at miss pewsey we will not trouble you further but the law will trouble you cried miss pewsey you rupert turned and looked at her the venomous words died on her lips she dropped into her chair while ainsleigh and the disinherited olivia left ivy lodge to the woman who had schemed for it in so base a way chapter xiv a mysterious letter if miss wharfs tragic death made a great sensation in marport the announcement that miss rayner was married secretly to ainsleigh of royabay made a still greater one some people thought olivia had behaved badly to her aunt and these were confirmed in their belief by the story told by miss pewsey but others considered the marriage to be quite romantic and knowing how miss wharf had tried to make her niece marry clarence were pleased that the girl had thus circumvented the schemes of the buccaneer but whether the critics were hostile or favourable they were all equally anxious to call at royabay and see its new mistress mrs ainsleigh received them quietly and with a dignity which compelled all to refrain from making remarks unpleasant or otherwise she settled down rapidly to her new position and after a time everyone was quite on her side certainly a few illdisposed people agreed with miss pewsey who could not say anything sufficiently bad about mrs ainsleigh but on the whole people were anxious to welcome the new mistress of the great place of marport rupert and olivia appeared to be very happy and after allas someone said the marriage was their own business a month after the installation of olivia at royabay her husband received a visitor in the person of dr forge that melancholy man made his appearance one afternoon when the young couple were in the garden and therefore they could not refuse to see him olivia had she been able would certainly have declined the visit as she was aware that forge intended to marry miss pewsey next month as it was she had to be polite and she was coldly so rupert also was not very genial from what john petley had said and from what tungyu had hinted he began to think that forge was not the friend he pretended to be and consequently the young man was on his guard dr forge saw this and seized the opportunity when olivia went withinwhich she did as soon as politeness permittedto speak to his quondam ward we dont appear to be friends said the doctor i dont see how you can expect it replied rupert coldly you marry miss pewsey next month and she has been and is olivias bitter enemy i am aware that my future wife is prejudiced said he deliberately but i assure you rupert she did not scheme for that money ainsleigh scoffed why she spied on olivia and told miss wharf what we would rather had been kept silent i dont think you acted quite fairly towards miss wharf that is my business i dont intend to defend myself was the young mans reply did you come to discuss this matter no i came to ask how this matter would effect your future in what way in the way you stand with your creditors rupert did not reply immediately the two were walking on the lawn but rupert entered the door of the abbey and strolled round the ruins with forge by his side he mistrusted the man intensely i should like to know if you are my friend he asked giving utterance to this mistrust surely i am was the quiet reply why should you think me to be otherwise because i marry miss pewsey no you can marry whom you choose i have nothing to do with that dr forge but when you were my guardian why did you not tell me that the property was so encumbered i wanted your boyhood to be unclouded and also he added seeing rupert make a gesture of contempt i thought you might get money from china rupert started what do you mean by that well said forge deliberately and looking on the ground you know that your father and i invested in a gold mine on the hwei river well we worked it for a long time until your father died of dysentery are you sure he died of dysentery asked ainsleigh sharply so far as i know he did was forges patient reply as i told you before i was in pekin when he died but if you are in doubt you should go to china and ask lokeong what has he to do with it this much said forge quietly and i am telling you what i have kept hitherto from every living creature your father and i made money out of the minea great sum i made the mostabout ten thousand pounds but your father made at least eight thousand and where is that money asked rupert anxiously lokeong has it yes i went to pekin to get a concession with regard to buying or leasing more land i left your father with lokeong he was at that time a kind of foreman but also he was in the confidence of the rebellious boxer leaders these threatened to undermine the power of the dowager empress who was not then so strong as she is now as a matter of fact lokeong himself was a leader of the boxers he came to us in disguise and worked up until he became our foreman but he did this because he heard that the mine was paying and wanted money your money asked ainsleigh deeply interested yes and the money belonging to your fatherin all eighteen thousand pounds when i was at pekin your father who did not understand the chinese so well as i did managed to make trouble in what way he interfered with the religion of the coolies in some waya most disastrous thing to do lokeong took advantage of the riot and robbed your father of the eighteen thousand pounds and killed my father ah said forge quietly i really cant say that it was it reported to me at pekin that markham had died of dysentery he was buried near the mine i was advised not to go back as the chinese were enraged against the foreign devils lokeong took the money and returned to his boxers where with the money he attained to even greater power than he formerly had possessed afterwards he deserted his party and came on the side of the empress dowager she is a clever woman and was glad to get him so he speedily rose high at court now he is very powerful and still holds my fathers money precisely and mine also i have been to china again and again to try and make lokeong give up this money and then i intended to pay you eight thousand pounds but hitherto i have failed i am about to make a last attempt as i sail for canton after christmas i had intended to go earlier but i must marry miss pewsey and leave her in charge of my house as mrs forge before i go so now you know rupert why i went so frequently to china and what has the fan to do with all this nothing so far as i know it is lokeongs property and was a bequest which he values i understand that there is some secret belonging to it connected with political affairs and which make his enemies anxious to get hold of it didnt you know the secret when you possessed the fan no said forge viciously i wish i had known it if it could have damaged lokeong i certainly should have made every use of it he keeps me out of ten thousand pounds and its through his influence with the empress dowager that i am prevented from working the mine further it is a rich mine and if i worked it i could make a fortune but lokeong stopped that i was a fool not to use the fan and make lokeong give me the mine for it but you did give him the fan forge looked confused for a moment yes i did said he after a pause that is it was taken from me i got it from tidman in the way you know and always expected trouble but i expect hwei and tungyu did not find out at the time that it had come to this country so i was left alone had they discovered that i was the possessor i should have been killed or you might have got a large sum of money quite so it would have all depended if i gave the fan to hwei or to tungyu i should have preferred the latter but of course i never knew the different days appointed by the god then that business is really true i believe it is but i never knew much about it till tungyu told me then it was too late miss wharf had the fan and it was hweis day he took advantage of the chance do you think he was here yes certainly he killed miss wharf but the verdict said that tungyu poohpooh cried forge snapping his long fingers tungyu would not have dared to disobey the order of kwangho the god hwei is the culprit but i said as little as i could about that i dont want to be entangled in the matter again but one of the chinamen has the fan and by this time it is nearly at pekin there doesnt seem to be much chance of our getting that money rupert you did give the fan to lokeong reiterated ainsleigh well it was taken from me i went to his palace and told him i would give him the fan in exchange for the eighteen thousand pounds i then intended to come back and give you eight to clear off your mortgages and resolved to live on the remaining ten which are rightfully my own but lokeong had me seized and the fan was taken from me he then forbade me setting foot in china again but i am going for all that said forge threateningly i shall go after christmas i am bound to get my money and yours you kept that fan for a long time for two years only and then when i thought everything had blown over i took it to lokeong with what result you know now then i have been plain with you rupert surely you can see that i am your friend tungyu said you were not doctor naturally replied forge he wanted to make bad blood between us so that i should not tell you this story how does he knowtungyu i meanbut what you might not go to china and complain about lokeong keeping this money i prefer to stop here with my wife said ainsleigh but you can complain and be hanged or sliced or shot or fried no thank you remember what kind of treatment tidman met with at the hands of hwei what was he the oneeyed chinaman yes hes the gentleman and i hope he wont come your way he is a beast but by this time he and tungyu are on their way back to their own land and now rupert ill say goodbye as i am poor myself lacking this ten thousand pounds rightfully mine which lokeong detains i cant help you but ill tell you what ill do ill get miss pewsey to extend that mortgage no thank you all the same said ainsleigh throwing back his head i dont want to be indebted to your wife she is not my wife yet said forge significantly but you intend to marry her yesyesquite so forge looked queerly at rupert as though about to say something then he changed his mind and walked away rapidly without saying goodbye rupert returned to the house and told his wife all that had taken place she was still doubtful of forges good intentions a decent man would not marry that wicked little woman well said rupert doubtfully from the way he spoke and looked i think miss pewsey marries him and not forge miss pewsey mrs ainsleigh looked up quickly has she got any hold over him i dont understand dear the same as she had over my aunt rupert that little woman looks frail but she is strong and has a will like iron in spite of her looks aunt sophia was wax in miss pewseys hands she exercised a kind of hypnotic power over aunt sophia and that was how the will came to be made in her favour in that case why not try and upset the will on a pretext of undue influence it could be done certainly but i have no facts to go upon but it seems to me from what you say that miss pewsey has hypnotised forge hes not the kind of man to be hypnotised yes he is he smokes opium a man who would give way to that vice is not a strong man but let her be and let him be also rupert i dont believe about this money in china it is no use our building on that if the place has to be sold at the end of the year we will take what we have left and go to canada so long as i have my boy i dont much care and she wreathed her arms round his neck dear olivia i wish i wasnt the hardup wretch i am i would not have you any other than you are if money comes to us it will come honestly not through the hands of dr forge or his future wife neither one is honest rupert would have argued this point as he thought his wife was a trifle hard but olivia stuck to her guns and gradually all reference to forge and his story was dropped by tacit consent the young couple had quite enough to do in talking of their future which was doubtful to say the least of it however rupert had arranged with the lawyers to hold over all claims for another year it only remained to get miss pewsey who now held the fatal mortgage to extend the time but olivia would not allow her husband to ask a favour of the bitter little woman as she was sureand rightly sothat it would not be granted the mortgage held by miss pewsey was for three thousand pounds and the two set their wits to work to see if they could pay this off by christmas then they would have a good few months left to arrange other matters if possible olivia wished to keep royabay though the outlook was not cheering another month slipped by but few changes took place in marport as it was now rather wintry so many people did not come down to the seaside rupert and olivia lived rather a lonely life at the abbey but being very much in love this did not disturb them in fact it was rather a pleasure sometimes chris walker and his aunt called lady jabe had got over her disappointment now that olivia was poor and constantly abused miss pewsey for taking the money she was making the unfortunate chris pay attentions to lotty dean whose father was a grocer and had ample wealth things were going on nicely in this quarter and lady jabe was pleased clarence burgh had left marport and was now amusing himself in london sometimes he came down to see his aunt who was getting ready for her bridal and still lived in ivy lodge there forge intended to remove when married as the house was rent free and already he had given notice to tidman as the major told rupert one evening and im glad hes going said the major as he sat with his usual bottle of port before the fire after dinner i couldnt stand seeing that pewsey cat in my house as mrs doctor forge i wonder why he marries her said rupert who was smoking on the other side of the fire place because he is frightened of her sir that woman for some reason makes everyone frightened of herexcept me added the major swelling why even that young burgh hardly comes to see her though hes down here nowwaiting for the wedding i suppose it comes off next week and a nice fright that pewsey cat will look as a bride rupert laughed olivia had left the room and retired to bed the major who had been fidgeting all the evening looked round when alone with his host i want to talk to you he said what about havent you been talking all the evening not on the subject nearest to my heart said tidman sipping his port i waited till mrs ainsleigh went away as i dont want to revive unpleasant memories oh said rupert with a shudder surely you are not going to talk of the murder nocertainly not but i am of the thing that caused it rupert sat up quickly the fan why thats in china tungyu took it after he tungyu did not take it said the major producing a letter i thought he did if you remember for you and i saw him on the beach on that night yes he was talking to a boatman arranging for his flight said tidman grimly and then he went back as i thought and murdered that woman but he didnt the major paused to give full dramatic effect he thinks i did it oh rubbish said rupert if you can prove an alibi on my behalf i can prove one on yours we walked and talked on the beach till nearly twelve then you went back to your bed and i returned to the ballroom immediately afterwards the body was found what makes tungyu accuse you and why do you get a letter from china its not from china but from london is tungyu there asked ainsleigh quickly yes in some place in rotherhithe he writes from there in this letter read it and he passed it to his host rupert glanced over the few lines which were very neatly written on yellow paper the letter was to the effect that if major tidman would bring the fan to a certain place in rotherhithe he would receive the money humph said ainsleigh handing it back so it seems that tungyu has not got the fan yes confound him and he thinks i have it in which case he must believe that i murdered miss wharf rupert nodded it looks like it said he what will you do i dont know i do not want another canton adventure i thought here the major hesitated i thought you might go ainsleigh did not burst out into a voluble refusal as tidman expected but stared at the fire seeing this tidman urged his point i think if you went you might get at the truth of the matter he said if tungyu didnt murder miss wharf who did will you go rupert still gazed at the fire he was thinking of the eight thousand pounds due to him held by lokeong and which if gained would pay off miss pewsey yes said he at length ill go it was a risk as he knew but the money was worth the risk chapter xv the rotherhithe den as a rule rupert told his wife everything thinking there could be no happiness unless a married couple were frank with one another also he frequently went to olivia for advice believing in the keen feminine instinct which usually sees what is hidden from the denser masculine understanding but on this occasion he refrained from revealing the object of his visit to london as he knew she would be feverishly anxious all the time he was absent it was just possible that hwei might be at rotherhithe instead of tungyu and then rupert might meet with a death similar to that of miss wharf certainly he had not the fan and never did possess it but how was he to convince a distrustful asiatic of that therefore rupert went to town one afternoon by the nine oclock evening train from marport and olivia thought he was merely going to see his lawyer on business connected with miss pewseys mortgage her husband was to return the next day in time for luncheon and as he had often run up to town before olivia had no misgivings had she been aware of the danger he was going into she assuredly would not have let him go mrs ainsleigh had led an unhappy life and now that things were brighter she certainly did not wish to see her days clouded by the loss of the husband whom she loved so dearly as what money there was went to keep up royabay its master was too poor to travel first class but he was lucky enough to find a third class smoking carriage empty and sat down very content owing to the nature of his errand he wished to be alone to think out his mode of procedure tungyu would not be an easy person to deal with still less would hwei should he happen to be on the spot and ainsleigh had little knowledge of the chinese character from what forge said he judged it to be dangerous there were few people travelling by the train and rupert quite believed that he would have the compartment to himself but just as the train was moving off a man dashed into the carriage and dropped breathlessly on the seat i guess that was a narrow squeak he gasped mr burgh said rupert by no means pleased well i am surprised said the buccaneer if it aint ainsleigh mr ainsleigh was ruperts reply for he disliked the man too much to tolerate this familiarity oh shucks retorted burgh wiping his forehead tisnt any use putting on frills with me sir i guess im as good a man as you any day let us admit you are better said rupert coldly and cease conversation but this mr burgh was not inclined to do i reckon this old tram wont stop at any station for half an hour said he pulling out a long black cigar so i dont see why we should sit like dummies for thirty minutes come along lets yarn you think im a wrong un well i guess im no holy bill if thats what you mean but i surmise that im friendly enough with you ainsleigh our last interview was not of a friendly character you bet you laid me out proper and gave it to me pretty free i respect a man who knocks me down i thought youd curl up when faced ainsleigh but i see youre a fighter that being so why i climb down not that im a cowardoh nonot by a long chalk but i know how to size up things and how do you size them up in this case well said clarence lighting up i guess youve got the bulge on me i was sweet on your wife but you aimed a bullseye and i got left that being so i conclude to leave other mans goods alone meaning mrs ainsleigh said rupert dryly thank you oh no thanks ive got enough sins already without putting a gilded roof on my iniquities see here clarence leaned forward and looked agreeable though his wicked black eyes snapped fire why shouldnt you and i be friends rupert did not reply at once he did not like burgh who was an aggressive bully of the far west all the same something might be learned from burgh relative to the murder and to the chinaman he knew hwei and knew something of the fan so rupert resolved to be on reasonably friendly terms with the buccaneer in the hope of learning something likely to be of use if mr burgh had a lantern there was no reason why ainsleigh should not use the light to illuminate his somewhat dark path therefore when rupert did speak it was to express a wish to be friendly yet strange to say as soon as he showed a disposition to come forward clarence the wary showed an equal disposition to retire ho said the buccaneer i guess you want my help or you wouldnt be so friendly all at once i am friendly by your own desire said ainsleigh dryly if you like we need not talk but can part as enemies no said burgh throwing himself indolently back on the cushions fact is i need you and you need me how do i need you asked rupert sharply well drawled clarence eying the clearcut face of his late enemy its just this way aunt lavinias an old cat she was all square with me so long as she thought id hitch up longside miss rayner mrs ainsleigh if you please and leave out her name right oh ill use it only once aunty thought id annex the cash and mrs ainsleigh and that she would live on the pair of us but as things are aunty has the cash and youve got the lady so i am leftyes sir i guess ive been bested by aunty well sir i calculate im not a millionaire and i want cash to start out on the long trail aunty wont part shabby old puss that she is but i reckon if youll help me ill rake in the dollars slick why should i help you to get square about that murder rupert drew back do you know oh i know nothing for certain or i shouldnt take you into partnership but i believe i can spot the person surely you dont think miss pewsey oh no she wouldnt harm anyone unless she was on the right side shes a cat but is clever enough to keep herself from being lynched sides she was comfortable enough with old wharf and wouldnt have sent her to camp out in the new jerusalem by strangling but auntys going to hitch up longside old forge and he asked rupert secretly excited but looking calm enough go slow i dont know anything for certain but i guess forge had a finger in the pie he wanted the fan you know nonsense he had the fan for two years and made no use of it i reckon not he didnt know its secretand the secrets worth money i judge do you know the secret no if id known i shouldnt have passed the article along to old wharf but im hunting for the secret and when i find it out ill shake old forges life out for that fan but tungyu has the fan ho snorted the buccaneer and tungyus gone to china with hwei and the fan shucks they gassed that at the inquest but the poppycock dont go down along o me no sir i guess old forge has the article now you sail in with me and find out how can i well said the buccaneer reflectively your father was a friend of the doctors and hes chums with you just you get him to be confidential like and then forge is the last man to be confidential with anyone said rupert coldly and if this be your scheme i cant help you there is not a shred of evidence to prove that forge killed miss wharf no thats a frozen fact but i guess im going to straighten out forge to pay out aunty then both will have to part with cash for my going on the long trail im in the dark now but later an end was put to mr burghs chatter by the stoppage of the train at a station and by the entrance of a joyful party of father mother and three children these last returning from a happy day in the country made themselves agreeable by crying clarence closed his mouth and only bent forward to say one last word to rupert i reckon well talk of this tomorrow when i get back to marport said he im putting up at the bristol and auntys footing the bill ainsleigh nodded and buried himself in his own thoughts he did not see how clarence could bring the crime home to dr forge but the buccaneer evidently had his suspicions rupert resolved to keep in with burgh on the chance that something might come of the matter he saw well enough that clarence in desperate want of money would do all in his power to prove forge guilty and would then blackmail him and miss pewsey or as she would then be mrs forge this last design which rupert suspected burgh entertained he resolved should not be put into practice but if forge was guilty he would be arrested and tried therefore when clarence parted with ainsleigh at the liverpool street station the latter was moderately friendly night said the buccaneer wringing ainsleighs hand see you tomorrow at marport keep it dark and he winked and disappeared ainsleigh moved towards the barrier to give up his ticket as he did so he was roughly jostled but could not see the person who thus banged against him he left the station however with the feeling that he was being followed and kept looking back to see if amongst the crowd there was any special person at his heels but he could see no one with his eyes on him yet the feeling continued even when he got into the underground train which was to take him to rotherhithe the young man had put on a shabby suit of blue serge for the adventure andas the night was rainywore a heavy overcoat the same in fact which he had left in the cloakroom of the bristol hotel on that memorable occasion the compartment was filled with a rather rough set of workmen going home and some were the worse for liquor however rupert sitting quietly in his own corner was not disturbed and arrived in rotherhithe without trouble he was thankful for this as he did not wish to have a row when engaged on a secret errand it was dark and stormy when he stepped out into the street but as the address given in the letter written to major tidman was that of a narrow street close at handrupert had looked it up in the directoryhe did not take a cab on his way along the streaming pavement he again had the sensation of being followed and felt for the revolver with which he had very wisely provided himself but nothing happened and he arrived at the mouth of the narrow street which was called penters alley there were few people about as the ragged loafers were within not caring to face the pelting rain in their light attire rupert stepped cautiously down the side street and saw in the distance a chinese lantern which he knew marked the house he was to enter this token had been set forth in the letter just as the young man was half way down a dark figure which had crept up behind him darted forward and aimed a blow at him rupert dodged and tried to close but at that moment another figure dashed between the two men and delivered a righthander there was a stifled cry of rage and the clash of a knife on the wet pavement then the first assailant cleared off and rupert found himself facing his rescuer just in time said clarence burgh what you here said rupert surprised i left you at the station i guess thats so but i followed you and by what right thats square enough replied burgh youd agreed to work along with me on this racket not altogether i had not made up my mind well i guess youll make it up now mr ainsleigh it was a good job i came after you as i did or this would have been into your ribs and he held up a long knife which he had picked up i am much obliged said ainsleigh but well if youre obliged let me go along with you and see you through this game i dont know what it is but im on for larks ainsleigh reflected and on the impulse of the moment trusted the man clarence had undoubtedly saved his life and it would be just as well to take him also clarence could do no harm as tungyu and hwei would see to that very good said ainsleigh come along im going to where that chinese lantern is clarence gave a long whistle and smote his leg gad said he between his teeth youre on the chinese racket again oh behalf of major tidman and rupert rapidly gave details burgh whistled again ho he laughed so they think tidmans the strangler well i guess not forge for my money lets heave ahead ainsleigh and see what the chinkeys have to say the two moved on and stopped under the lantern a sharp knock at a closed door brought forth a chinese boy who was dressedqueerly enoughall in red rupert recalled tidmans adventure at canton and did not like the look of things but clarence pushed past him and addressed the boy weve come to see tungyu said he give this brat the letter ainsleigh the boy took the letter and instead of looking at it by the light of the lantern smelt it carefully then ainsleigh remembered that it was strongly perfumed with some queer scent clarence cackled rummy coves these chinese beasts said he politely evidently the boy was satisfied for he threw open the door and the two adventurers entered they passed along a narrow corridor to a second door on this being opened they turned down a long passage to the right and were conducted by the red boy into a small room decorated in chinese fashion somewhat after the style of that in dr forges house at the end there was a shrine with a hideous god set up therein and before this smoked some joss sticks giving out a strange perfume a tasselled lantern hung from the ceiling the chairs and table elegant in design were of carved black wood and the walls were hung with gaily pictured paper the room was neat and clean but pervaded by that strange atmosphere of the east which brings back curious memories to those who have travelled into those parts after conducting them into this room the red boy vanished and the men found themselves alone well i reckon weve got to make ourselves comfortable said the buccaneer sitting rum shantyjust like an opium den i know of down frisco way ho i wonder how tungyus escaped the police i wonder rather who it was that tried to knife me said rupert sitting clarence looked queer well talk of that when we get through with this business heres some fairy even while he spoke a tall lean chinaman entered noiselessly he had a rather fierce face and one eye burgh started up hwei said he amazed i thought you had lighted out for frisco chapter xvi the fan mystery the oneeyed chinaman did not smile nor did he greet burgh in any way friendly or otherwise he simply looked at the two with an impassive gaze and then glanced at a clock the hands of which pointed to thirty minutes past eleven what a clock should be doing in this eastern room the visitors could not make out it seemed to be out of place yet there it was and there was hwei staring at it he still preserved silence and brought his one eye from the clock to rupert with a malevolent glare major tidman has not come said hwei in english as good as that spoken by tungyu but in a grating voice no said rupert who was addressed he received your noteor rather tungyus letterand asked me to come here on his behalf and i guess hwei drawled clarence that i have come to see the business through that will not take long said the chinaman cheerfully yet with an unpleasant stare where is the fan of the mandarin i have not got it replied ainsleigh shortly major tidman did not send it perhaps no for the simple reason that it is not in his possession that said hwei grimly is a lie its the truth chipped in burgh suddenly old man tidman didnt choke that woman you mean miss wharf burgh nodded thats so said he in a curt way but with a watchful eye on the oneeyed chinaman hwei gnawed his long finger nails and then slipped his hands inside his long hanging sleeves in his dull blue clothes with the clumsy slippers he looked taller than ever and quite as unpleasant as at first sight his pigtail was coiled round his shaven head he looked sharply at the two men with his one eye and appeared to be thinking its my day said he at length ainsleigh and burgh jumped up do you intend to murder us asked rupert if you have the fan rejoined hwei coldly it is the order of the god kwangho and he bowed reverentially to the ugly image what rights that second hand joss to give orders in a free country hwei asked clarence and dont you think well give in without laying you out hwei made a clicking noise with his tongue and then smote a small brass gong which hung near the door the thunder had scarcely died away before the door opened and there appeared four or five villainous looking chinamen with long knives rupert stepped back and stood against the wall with his revolver levelled but clarence simply produced the knife he had picked up on the pavement i guess he said reflectively you tried to knife ainsleigh outside the knife heres the same as those things yonder and he nodded towards the door well sail in were ready for the play hwei started at this speech and chattered something in chinese at once the door closed and the three were again alone i never ordered anyone to be knifed outside he said with his one eye on clarence that would be foolish first the fan then the death i was certainly attacked outside said rupert lowering his revolver who attacked you sir i cant say but perhaps burgh thats my business said the cheerful clarence who had taken his seat and did not seem to be at all afraid of the dangerous position in which he found himself what we have to do is to yarn about this fan i saw you in frisco hwei i reckoned the fan was there we thought so mr burgh but it came to the ears of lokeong that it was in england so then i came here ah i saw you in china also said clarence you did and learned much about the fantoo much growled hwei rupert who was growing weary of all this hinted mystery sat down again and threw the revolver on the table i wish you would make a clean breast of this he said calmly i dont care about the fan but i do want to know who killed miss wharf major tidman did no he was with me on the beach i went out to smoke and we strolled up and down till nearly twelve he was with me shortly after eleven so he could not have killed the woman hwei pointed a long finger at the young man i saw major tidman speaking to a boatman on the beachthe boat came from the stormy petrel your boat said burgh quickly no the boat of tungyu it was my day but tungyu hoped to get the fan after twelve at night and then would have had the right to take it away in the boat major tidman killed miss wharf and gave the knowledge of his crime to tungyu he would not part with the fan till the money was paid tungyu went away in the boat so that the police might not get him he was wise added hwei with a queer smile as he is accused of the murder which you committed no i did not had i found miss wharf outside i should have killed her it was my hour but she escaped me then you were in marport on that night asked rupert hwei nodded not at the hotel tungyu went to the ball and was to bring miss wharf out down the steps so that i could kill her i came to the steps about twelve and while waiting on the beach i saw you sir talking to the major but tungyu betrayed me hweis face looked fiercer then ever he did not bring her to me in my hour and so betrayed the trust of the god kwangho he wanted her to live so that he might buy the fan next day but so long as he got the fan hwei flung out a long arm no said he austerely if tungyu gets the fan it goes with its secret into the hands of mandarin hop sing who is the enemy of my master and who is your master asked clarence lokeong listen hwei took a seat and talked with his one eye on the visitors the fan is my masters and holds a secret which means much to him it was lost we invoked the god kwangho by the mouth of his priest the gods said that two men should search for it i was to search for lokeong and tungyu for hop sing the enemy of my master hop sings emissary was to buy the fan at a large price i was to kill the person who held it thus said the god justice would be done the person who held the fan would be rewarded for virtue or slain for evil one day is mine and the next day is tungyus at the ball i had my hour and had i found miss wharf i would have slain her for the fan but tungyu betrayed me as he wished to buy the fan next day but the god kwangho interfered and the woman who held the fan wrongfully met with her doom great is the justice of the god kwangho and he bowed again to the ugly image which was half veiled by the curling smoke rupert stared at the man who talked such good english yet who used it to utter such extraordinary things he was not acquainted with the chinese character and could not understand the affair but on reflection he concluded that the alternate killing and rewarding was adopted as giving a chance of treating the person who secured the fan in the way he or she deserved i see what you mean said he if the person got the fan wrongfully it would come into your possession in your way if rightfully it would go to tungyu therefore the holder of the fan would be rewarded according to his or her deeds hwei bowed great is the wisdom of the god kwangho said he then i guess youre wrong and the god also said clarence old miss wharf got the fan squarely enough from me she had it wrongfully said hwei obstinately else she would not have been slain who slew her asked rupert seeing the uselessness of argument major tidman no i tell you he was on the beach tungyu killed her hwei shook his head tungyu dare not said he the god would slay him if he disobeyed the god didnt slay him when he played low down on you in keeping miss wharf back from your knife said clarence tungyu has done penance he has made amends he wrote to major tidman telling him to come here on my night so that he might meet with his doom but he hasnt come he is afraid no said rupert decisively the major has not the fan who has i know no more than i do who killed miss wharf hwei wavered and his keen face grew troubled the persistence of rupert was having its effect are you sure quite sure said ainsleigh promptly will you swear this before the god kwangho certainlybut remember i am a christian hwei went to the shrine and brought forth a joss stick the god kwangho is all powerful said he solemnly if you lie he will not spare you burn this joss before him and swear no said rupert drawing back i am a christian hweis eye flashed with fury you are lying said he you will never leave this place alive oh i guess so said clarence easily neither i nor ainsleigh has the fan and you cant kill either of us unless the god grows angry youve got to climb down before him that is true said hwei dropping the jossstick and sat in his chair with a puzzled face he then pointed to the clock the long hand of which was drawing to twelve when that strikes my hour is over he said but i may kill you before then youve got ten minutes to do it in said burgh cheerfully and ainsleigh and i intend to fight for it youll be hanged too no said hwei ill be on my way to china with the fan i have a boat waiting near to take me to a special steamer i intended to kill major tidman take the fan and go then all the police in the country would not have caught me and your nice little plan has been defeated by the major not coming up said rupert calmly just as well he didnt and i have not got the fan who haswho has said hwei biting his nails and evidently quite at a loss i made sure he looked at clarence oh it wasnt me said that gentleman promptly but i may know who killed the old woman and has the fan hwei flung himself forward telltelltell he grasped and he laid his long fingers on burghs throat the young man threw him over with a great effort and slipped back to the wall where he stood beside rupert the two had out their revolvers you wait said clarence in a breathless voice for the struggle though brief had been violent tell me the secret of the fan and ill give you the name of the person who has it what cried hwei furiously betray my master you foreign devil i will kill you first youve just got five minutes to do it in cried burgh jeeringly the chinaman put his fingers to his lips and blew a shrill whistle in a moment the room was filled with chinamen chattering and screaming like so many infuriated parrots hwei threw himself on the young men diedie he said thickly firefire cried clarence kicking hwei back for the next few minutes rupert had no very clear idea of what was happening he fired into the mass of chinamen pushing forward and heard a cry as a man dropped the others fell over him and in the struggle upset the shrine the ugly joss rolled on to the floor and caught fire there were shrill screams from the chinese who began to jab with their knives clarence was rolling on the floor in close grips with hwei and the draperies of the joss flared away in a brilliant manner it seemed as though the two rash men would be either burnt or stabbed and the end was coming rapidly all at once the silvery chime of the clock sounded and then came the rapid striking of the hour the door opened and the boy in red appeared he said something in a screaming voice and then almost as by magic the room emptied the rolling mass of chinamen had extinguished the flaming joss and hwei suddenly disengaging himself from the buccaneer darted through the door the boy followed with the rest of the assailants and when rupert and burgh got their breath they found themselves facing the still smoking joss with tungyu blandly smiling at them ho said clarence rising and shaking himself i guess the rows over hurt ainsleigh got a flesh wound said rupert winding his handkerchief round his left arm and you im as right as a pie so heres tungyu your hour i guess the chinaman bowed and picking up the god restored him to his shrine which was considerably damaged it is lucky the red boy cried that hweis hour was over he said coolly or you would both have been killed you wouldnt have got the fan though said rupert throwing himself down on his seat but you dont intend to kill us i suppose no the god kwangho is merciful now i make you rich humph said burgh crossly i wish i had that fan with me you have or mr ainsleigh here has it said tungyu i will give you five thousand for the fan i havent got it thinkten thousand great scot cried clarence avariciously wish i could trade fifteen thousand said tungyu his eyes glittering come gentlemen its better to be rich than dead for the next twentyfour hours i can give you money then comes hewis hour and he will kill you not much said burgh im going to cut you shall be kept here till you give up the fan rupert shrugged his shoulders you wont believe he said why not search us then you can see we have not the fan do you believe that major tidman has it yes he gave it to you he killed he did not can you swear that he did no but i thought oh shucks said clarence shoving himself forward see here mr tungyu im sick of this business we havent got that durned fan but i can tell you who has tell then and i give you a thousand pounds not good enough said burgh coolly see here you let us go free and tell us the fans secret and ill tell you yes and get the fan and learn the secret cried tungyu excited but you cannot make use of the secret dont want to and as to the fan you can get it from the person i tell you of then you can fork out fifteen thousand the chinaman deliberated we have been wrong about major tidman i think said he politely it seems someone else has it i suppose i didnt kill the old girl myself if thats what you mean quite so said tungyu after another pause well as you cant make any use of the secret ill tell you of it then you can go free after you have told me who killed miss wharf eight oh said clarence and rupert listened breathlessly the fan said tungyu is jade on one side and enamel on the other the enamelled side is painted with a picture invisibly to bring out the picture this fan has to be waved in certain smoke what sort of smoke i wont tell you that said tungyu politely i have told enough well then said rupert when the picture is visible what happens it will show a hiding place which contains certain things we want to get in order to ruin lokeong with the empress oh i see a plan of a secret hidingplace now you know said tungyu to clarence tell me not till i know of the smoke i refuse but i give you fifteen thousand to get that fan one thousand now if you tell me who killed the woman and who has it good said clarence ill trade dr forge strangled miss wharf ah said tungyu leaping up he has the fan thanks kwangho and he bowed to the halfdestroyed image chapter xvii a disappearance when rupert returned to marport next day burgh accompanied him the young squire of royabay wished to give information to the police regarding the guilt of forge but clarence persuaded him against doing so youll only get me into a row said he in his candid way you see i told a lie you tell so many lies said rupert sharply i dont know but what i ought to give you in charge i guess not seeing i saved your life last night no youre right there burgh but have you really anything to do with this murder no cept as how i told old tungyu last night just repeat what you said i was so faint with the loss of blood that i didnt gather half you said burgh nodded you were pretty sick id to help you back to civilization same as if you were drunk if i hadnt youd have been robbed and killed down that bowery gangway ainsleigh could not but acknowledge that clarence had acted very well he had saved him from the man who attacked him in the street and also it was owing to him that the two had escaped from the gang of hwei finally burgh had taken rupert back to the guelph hotel in jermyn street when he was rather shaky from the wound it was much better this morning but ainsleigh looked pale and not at all himself still he did not grudge the trifling woundit was merely a scratch although it had bled freelyas the knowledge he had acquired was well worth the trouble they had left the den in penters alley some time after midnight and had returned safely to the west where rupert had acted as host to burgh that was clarence all over whenever he did anyone a service he always took it out of him in some way and but for the dangerous position in which he found himself would have quartered his carcase on rupert for an indefinite period but there aint no denying that im in a fix said burgh as the train drew near marport that is if you split ainsleigh no i wont split on you but if forge is guilty he must be arrested said rupert decisively but i dont know if he strangled the old girl after all you said he did last night well i wanted to know the secret of that fan rupert shrugged his shoulders you know that the fan when waved in a certain smokeof which by the way you learned nothingreveals a hiding place which contains certain things tungyu wants to ruin lokeong said burgh quickly so i guess if i can pick up that fan from old forge ill yank in the dollars arent you satisfied with what you have this thousand oh thats all right i cashed the cheque before i joined you at the stationgot it in gold so i can clear out when it suits me its always as well to be ready to git i suppose said ainsleigh dryly in your varied career you have had frequent occasions to git as you call it you bet but gits slang american and good turkish lingo so youve no need to sneer old man say about forge whats to be done ill communicate with rodgers and tell him what you say if the doctor is guilty he must suffer my eye said clarence reflectively wont aunty be mad well i guess this will square us she wont play low down on me again burgh youre a blackguard i am thats a fact said the buccaneer in no wise disturbed but dont you say that in public or the furll fly pooh you know im equal to you but this story the one i told tungyu last night grinned burgh ill reel it out now and you can sort it out as you choose i believe forge to be the scragger of the old girl because he had that tie of yours how did he get the tie i gave it to him confessed clarence candidly yesi remember you said so last night but i forget how you explained the getting of it huh drawled burgh folding his arms you might call it stealing old pard ysee miss pewseymy old aunty that issaw olivia mrs ainsleigh hang you right oh continued burgh imperturbably well aunty saw mrs ainsleigh pass the tie to you and when you went to the cloakroom she told me i was real mad not knowing how things were as i wanted that tie for myself id no notion of your getting things made by the young lady i was sweet on i wish you would leave out my wifes name said rupert angrily and wincing with pain for his wound hurt him not a little ill try dont get your hair off well i cut along to the card roomno twasnt the card roomthe cloakroom and saw you standing by your coat just hanging it up again and you saw me put the tie in the pocket i guess not but i fancied you might have done so then i waited outside while you yarned with the chinese cove and tidman after that i cut in and you know the rest up to the time i knocked you down well smashing blow said burgh coolly you can use your hands pretty well i reckonbut a six shooters more in my line well when you cut i lay down and saw stars for a time then i thought id pay you out by annexing the tie you didnt know it was there thought it might be rejoined burgh coolly anyhow there was no harm in trying i found the tie and went out with it thinking you be pretty sick when you found it gone i went into the cardroom where old forge was cheating i guess and had a yarn along ohim he just roared when i showed him the tie for he hates you like pie whats that asked rupert sharply you are mistaken i guess not that old man would have been glad to see you scragged mr ainsleigh he asked me to let him have the tie what for burgh shrugged his shoulders he didnt say but i let him have it anyhow i wasnt in a position to refuse ysee ainsleigh im not a holy bill and and forge knows a few of your escapades likely to land you in yneednt say the word interrupted burgh in his turn tisnt a pretty one but i guess forge could make things hot for me if he liked so that was why i lay low when i saw the tie round the old girls throat i guessed then forge had scragged her and boned the fan i asked him about it and he lied like billeo said hed lost the tie and never touched the old un then he said if i made any fuss hed tell the police about about what asked ainsleigh seeing the man hesitate huh replied burgh uncomfortably i guess thats my business i told you i wasnt a saint i suspect youre a thorough paced gaolbird no i aint been in quod where i gavorted round in the naked lands they dont shove a man in chokey for every trifle such as murder eh i havent murdered anyone yet confessed clarence easily but one never knows but i told about forge last night as i wanted to get this thousand now ill try for the fan and see if i cant get the fifteen thousand to come my way if forge cuts up rough ill light out with what i havehe slapped his pocketsfor callao and he began to sing the old song on no occasion is extradition allowed in callao and i know a daisy of a girl out there said the scamp winking ainsleigh was too disgusted to speak he felt that as he was as big a ruffian as burgh to tolerate this conversation and he was relieved when the train steamed into marport station as soon as it stopped he jumped out and nodding to his companion he was about to take his leave when clarence stopped him say you wont round on forge till i get this fan business settled i intend to write to rodgers today said ainsleigh tartly bad as your aunt is she shant marry that scoundrel if i can help it but i only know forge got the scarf as i told you he mightnt have scragged her yknow he says he didnt and relied on what he knows of you to keep things quiet no mr burgh i intend to have the man arrested and rupert turned away while clarence apparently not at all disturbed went away whistling his callao ditty rupert drove to royabay and was welcomed with joy by his wife she was much alarmed when she saw his condition and was very angry when he told of his danger she made him lie down and bathed the wound of which rupert made light its nothing dear he said it might be dangerous there might have been poison on that knife rupert you know what the chinese are no olivia i certainly dont all this business of the fan and the god kwangho is most ridiculous tell me all about it said olivia when she had placed a tray with tea and toast before him i shall do so at once as i want your advice and rupert related all that had occurred from the time of his meeting with clarence burgh in the train on the previous night olivia listened in silence well asked rupert drinking his tea what do you think i think mr burgh is a scoundrel anyone can see that and worthy of his aunt perhaps shes a bad one that miss pewsey but she may not know what a rascal she has for a relative and at all events i cant let her marry forge do you believe he is guilty he might be said olivia cautiously but i would much rather believe that burgh gave the tie to his aunt and that she strangled aunt sophia rupert laughed what a vindictive person you are dearest said he miss pewsey is bad but not so bad as that id credit her with anything said olivia who was truly feminine in her detestation of miss pewsey she has insulted me for years and put aunt sophia against me and caused me to lose the money wellwell said rupert soothingly let us think the best of hershe has her good points where are theywhat are they she is ano olivia checked herself and looked penitent i really must not give way to such unworthy feelings ill try and think the best of her and i agree with you darling that she must not marry dr forge do you think i should write to rodgers certainly the marriage must be stopped write today but rupert did not write that day for the simple reason that the wound on his arm grew very painful and he became delirious the doctor who was called in said that there was poison in the blood and then olivia was alarmed lest rupert should lose his arm and perhaps his life however the doctor was young and clever and by careful treatment he drew out the poison and in a few days the young mans arm had resumed its normal condition and his brain again became clear then he wrote a letter to rodgers asking him to come down to royabay on a matter connected with the murder of his wifes aunt after the letter had been posted rupert went out for a walk with his wife and strolled round the grounds as the two crossed the lawn admiring the beauty of the day which was bright and clear and slightly frosty mrs petley appeared coming up the avenue she made straight for the young couple please master rupert that gents called again what mr burgh said olivia and then in answer to her husbands enquiring look she explained he has called for the last three days dear since you were ill i never told you as i thought it might worry you and he just called to ask how you were master rupert said the old housekeeper and never come nearer than the lodge as old payne can testify i told him you were out walking and he asked if he could come in and see you certainly said rupertthen when mrs petley hurried away he turned to olivia burgh simply wants to find out if i have communicated with rodgers hes frightened for his own skin shortly mrs petley returned with the information that mr burgh was nowhere to be seen this did not trouble rupert who thought that the buccaneer always of an impatient disposition might have grown tired of waiting with olivia he strolled round the grounds for thirty minutes and at length entered the ruins of the abbey here the first thing they saw was mr clarence burgh seated on a stone under the copper beech he jumped up and came forward with his usual grace and invariable impudence glad to see you out again ainsleigh said he taking off his hat and you look well mrs ainsleighjust like a picture thank you replied olivia concealing her dislike with difficulty you wish to see my husband i presume just for two shakes said clarence easily say old man what about forge are y going to round on him rupert nodded i have written to rodgers today but ill give him this chance of escapewarn him if you like not me said burgh coldly every man for his own durned skinbegging your pardon mrs ainsleigh i saw him while you were trying for kingdom come and told him that hed the fan what did he say gave me the lie swore hed been in the cardroom between eleven and twelve and never saw the old girl said hed had enough of the fan as it had nearly caused his death then he said hed split on me if i gave him away but you told him you did confess to the chinaman oh thats all right forge dont care a red cent for their telling the police they wont engineer the biznai into the courts so long as they get the fan they dont mind forge knows they wont make the matter public but now hes in mortal fear lest they should kill him thinking hes got the fan you beton my evidence well said burgh calmly and with a twinkle in his evil eyes i reckon old man forge is in an almighty fix hes in danger of being knifed by hweithanks to me and of being hanged for killing the old girlthanks to you olivias face expressed her disgust if you have heard all you wish to hear well go away she said to her husband right oh said burgh dont mind me pretty place yhave here he added looking round the beautiful cloisters thats the place where they lynched the old monk i reckon ive heard that silly rhyme of yours ainsleigh i guess youve fulfilled one part how so asked rupert stiffly about the marriage yknow a poor ainsleigh has wedded a poor wife so thats all right now i i must be going interrupted ainsleigh annoyed by the mans glib talk have you anything else to say only this forge is going to hitch longside aunt lavinia tomorrow and if you run him in shell get left all the better for her said ainsleigh calmly hes a bad lot thats so much worse than you think he was the man who tried to stab you in penters alley no he was though i saw his face under the lamp as he let fly then he cut andyou know the rest but im off my eye clarence chuckled what a shine therell be tomorrow when aunty gets left burgh strolled away whistling and olivia expressed her disgust at his free and easy manners rupert reflecting on what clarence had told him of forges assault resolved to be a fair and open enemy he decided to call on forge and tell him that he had written to rodgers also he desired to ask why he attempted the second crime olivia approved so rupert went early next day to tidmans avenue the door was opened by mrs bressy who was wiping her mouth as though she had just been at the bottle which was probably the case in reply to ruperts enquiry for her master she told him that dr forge had gone he went to londing sirlarst night said mrs bressy did he leave any address no mr ainsleigh he did not the inference was easy forge had bolted chapter xvii a surprise rupert was much disappointed that forge had not been arrested apart from the fact that he thought the old scoundrel should suffer for his dastardly crime in killing an inoffensive woman he wished to learn what forge could reveal of his fathers death the explanation already given did not satisfy him and he suspected that the doctor knew more than he chose to admit but under pressure and standing in danger of his life he might be induced to be more explicit but as the man apparently warned by clarence had disappeared there was no more to be said and forge had taken a large trunk and all his loose cash so there was no doubt that he intended to keep away from marport ainsleigh much disgusted went to seek clarence burgh at the bristol hotel but learned that he also had gone away much perplexed the young man sought out major tidman and laid the case before him the major was much astonished at the recital and very angry to learn that hwei and tungyu suspected him of the murder but i guessed they did from the fact of that letter asking after the fan said tidman pacing his room much agitated i hope ainsleigh they dont think i have it now or my life will not be worth a moments purchase no you neednt worry burgh has fully convinced them that forge has the fan then theyll make for him no doubt and perhaps that is why forge cleared out but i dont understand why our friend burgh should make himself scarce i do said tidman sitting down and wiping his bald forehead he isnt a man with a clean past and forge knows about it its just on the cards that to revenge himself on burgh for having told hwei about the fan forge has written to the police giving an account of master clarences delinquency but on the other hand if burgh warned forge that i had written to rodgers the doctor might forgive him not he forge is a bitter hater and after all clarence would only be trying to right what he had put wrong if hed held his tongue about the fan and the murder there would be no need for forge to cut as it is i believe the doctor will make it hot for our mutual friend when did you see burgh last at dinner last night he said nothing about going away and i quite believed he would stop on hes in good quarters here and miss pewsey is paying the bill but he took a small bag with him saying he was going up town for a few days and left by the nine evening train ah he may come back after all he may but i doubt it he doesnt want to face an inquiry you see he gave the tie to forge and said nothing about it at the inquest so that makes him an accessory after the fact but burgh didnt know forges game no all the same he should have spoken out at the inquest well and what is to be done now nothing im sick of the whole business but forge told me that this mandarin lokeong holds eight thousand pounds belonging to my father i intend to write for it tidman looked doubtful i dont think youll get it said he unless you produce the fan oh i expect forge has taken that away with him well then tungyu and hwei will be on his track and i shouldnt give much for his life wait a bit he may get the money from tungyu if he chances on tungyus day queer start that added the major musingly the red boy appeared when i just had my big toe cut off and saved my life it happened much the same with you and hwei lost his power as he was getting ready to kill you i wonder these two scoundrels obey the god so slavishly oh they are both afraid of the god said rupert rising to take his leave but i must get home theres nothing more to be discussed nothing replied the major chuckling unless it is about that old cats disappointment ill go up to st peters church and see how she takes it of course said ainsleigh lingering at the door its her wedding day i expect she knows by this time that forge has cut i hope not said the major cruelly i wouldnt lose the fun for something rupert didnt agree with his callous view of the case as miss pewsey was a woman after all although a bad one and it would be hard that she should suffer what she would certainly regard as a public disgrace so rupert avoided st peters church and went home again here he found olivia with a letter this arrived by the early post she explained but you went out so quickly that i could not give it to you just look at it rupert such beautiful writing a foreigners evidently said her husband looking at the really elegant calligraphy they take more care than we do of their pothook and hangers olivia he started whats the matter rupert put the envelope under her nose smell it dont you recognise the scent no said mrs ainsleigh its a strange scent very and was used to perfume the letter which tungyu sent to major tidman this may have to do with the fan again olivia looked nervous i wish we could hear the last of it she said it has caused enough trouble already open the letter dear rupert did so and was more astonished than ever heres an unexpected development he remarked passing the letter to olivia lokeong is in england mrs ainsleigh read the few lines which stated that the mandarin was stopping at a fashionable hotel in northumberland avenue and would do himself the honour of calling on the son of his old friend in a few days hes come to see after the fan personally said olivia returning the letter i am glad so am i said rupert quickly ill now learn the truth about my father and see if i cant get that eight thousand pounds rupert do you think lokeong killed your father i cant say forge declared over and over again that he died of dysentery and that lokeong seized the money for the boxers but ill demand an explanation from the mandarin will he give it asked mrs ainsleigh doubtfully hell have to replied rupert grimly and hell have to give the money back also i dont care for forges cash as a villain such as he is doesnt deserve any reward but i want my own eight thousand and ill have it i hope so sighed olivia we could then pay off miss pewsey or rather mrs forge as she no doubt is by this time no forge has bolted what on the eve of the wedding yes he cleared out last night either he fears being arrested for the murder of your aunt or he dreads lest hwei should come down to kill him for the sake of the fan at all events he has gone and miss pewsey is no doubt waiting at the altar of st peters church for a bridegroom who will never come but we must attend to our own troubles dear ill write to the mandarin today and ask him to visit us when it suits him or else i can run up no interrupted olivia in a voice of alarm i wont have you go away again until this fan business is settled im always afraid of your falling into the hands of these chinamen i shall ask mr lokeong to stop them searching for the fan he can stop hwei said rupert rising but tungyu is in the employment of hop sing the mandarins rival dont be afraid my dearest i have been protected by providence these many days and it is not likely that ill come to grief but i fear for forge and for burgh who has likewise bolted those two will certainly get into trouble it is wrong to say so said mrs ainsleigh with a sigh but i do dislike that man burgh and dr forge also leave them in gods hands dear replied her husband gravely if they have sinned they will be punished what we have to do is to learn if lokeong will restore this money ill write asking him to come down to royabay and rupert went to the library forthwith it was an autumnal day with a promise of rain ragged clouds drifted across a cold blue sky and the wind was rather high already many trees had shed their leaves but the pine boughs still bore their sombre burdens everything looked old and miserable and there seemed to lurk a premonition of evil in the air at least olivia thought so as she stood at the drawingroom window looking out on to the terrace and down the avenue which could be seen from this point of view rupert was in the library engaged on his letter to the mandarin and olivia was half inclined to join him she felt weary chilly and out of spirits and could not account for doing so im the happiest girl in the world she assured herself i have married the man i love and he adores me he rescued me from a miserable life and is making me immensely happy i should certainly be in the best of spirits yet she stopped short at this point and her eyes became fixed while a colour flushed her somewhat pale cheeks and no wonder up the avenue battling against the force of the wind came miss pewsey she wore a bridal dress of white a lace bonnet trimmed with orange blossoms and carried a bouquet of flowers to see this figure in such a dress walking under a sombre sky between dripping trees and with the winds blowing furiously against it was a strange sight and gave olivia what the scotch call a grue then she became indignant it was insolent she thought that this woman who had insulted her so often who had made her life miserable who had robbed her of her inheritance and who had tried to defame her character should thus present herself on the impulse of the moment and in spite of wind and of the rain which was beginning to fall mrs ainsleigh threw open the french window and stepped out on to the terrace it was in her mind to order miss pewsey away she deserved little mercy at olivias hands the noise made by the opening of the window made miss pewsey raise her head and then she came straight across the grass as she drew near olivia was struck with the tragic horror of her face she was always old in her looks but now she seemed at least a hundred her lips were white her eyes red and with dark circles under them a myriad wrinkles ploughed her face and her usually bright eyes were dim and bloodshot to see this weird face under the bridal bonnet was at once grotesque and pathetic without a word miss pewsey climbed the steps gasping at every step and came directly towards olivia she passed her and entered the room mrs ainsleigh came after in a whirlwind of passion what do you mean she demanded this is my house i am aware of the fact said miss pewsey dropping into a chair and shaking out her soiled and sodden bridal dress but it may be mine before the end of the year but dont let us quarrel she went on in a piteous way im in trouble what is it asked olivia who could guess theophilus has left me yes last night he went away leaving a cold letter behind him which was to be delivered to me at the altar and it was wept miss pewsey that old woman mrs bressy brought the note it said that theophilus has left me for ever and all my friends were there and i was awaiting the happy hour thenthenshe broke down sobbing olivia was touched miss pewsey had always been her enemy yet there was something about the unhappy creature which called for sympathy i am sorry for your trouble said mrs ainsleigh in a softer voice no said miss pewsey drying her eyes with a very wet handkerchief you cant be i never liked you nor you me that is perfectly true and you turned my aunt against me all the same i am sorry and anything i can do shall be done miss pewsey threw herself on her knees before her enemy who was thus heaping coals of fire on her head then ask your husband to leave my theophilus alone she whispered clarence who has also gone wrote to me and said that mr ainsleigh accused theophilus of the death of my dearest sophia what cried olivia does mr burgh dare why he accuses dr forge himself rupert certainly wrote to the detective mr rodgers but mr burgh has to substantiate his statement miss pewsey jumped up what she said much more her own evil self did clarence accuse my theophilus its a liea lie i have kept silence too longmuch too long about what about the murder screamed miss pewsey it was clarence who killed my sophiayesyou may look and look oliviabut it was clarence himself he took the tie from the coatpocket i told him you had given it to him and but he gave it to dr forge he did not clarence took sophia out on to the stepsat least he appointed to meet her there to tell her about the fan then he strangled her thinking your husband would be accused theophilus came on clarence when he was picking up the fan sophia held it in her death grip and it was some time before he could get it loose theophilus came and hearing steps clarence ran away down to the beach then he returned to the ballroom by the front of the hotel but the fan theophilus forge has it said miss pewsey setting her face and i expect he has taken it with him why didnt you tell this at the inquest because i didnt clarence is my own sisters son i could not see him hanged he had to hold his tongue although he wanted the fan back again but i insisted that theophilus should make the money out of it this is clarences revenge because the fan is kept from him he threatens theophilus oh olivia do ask your husband to leave the matter alone i will give up that mortgage i can do nothing said olivia it isnt in my husbands power he has written to rodgers but he has not told him anything said miss pewsey eagerly no he merely asked him to call then he shall see me and ill tell him of clarences wickedness but the fanthe fanwell get the money and theophilus will come back to be loved and respected i dont love him but i see we can make a lot of money together the fan said miss pewsey counting on her lean fingers the money from lokeongthe money of sophia and oh cried olivia in disgust go away you miserable creature and think of the hereafter miss pewsey gave a shrill laugh you cant help me and your husband cant help me so ill go but when i come back here it shall be as mistress i hate you oliviai have always hated youiioh youshe could utter no more but gasping shook her fist and ran out of the window and down the avenue with an activity surprising in a women of her years after dinner and while they were seated in the library olivia told rupert of miss pewseys visit and accusation he declined to believe the tale if burgh was guilty he wouldnt have brought an accusation against forge he said as the doctor if this is true knows the truth and forge if innocent would not have cleared while ainsleigh was thus explaining the door was burst open and mrs petley white as chalk rushed in the ghostthe ghost said she dropping into a chair the monkin the abbey anxious to learn if there was any truth in these frequent apparitions reported by mrs petley rupert left the swooning woman to the care of his wife and departed hastily from the room calling old petley he went out of the front door across the lawn and into the cloisters petley hobbled almost on his heels with a lantern the young man stopped at the entrance to the cloisters and listened it was raining hard and the ground was sopping wet but beyond the drip of the rain and the sighing of the trees no sound could be heard snatching the lantern from petley rupert advanced boldly into the open and swung the light too and fro and round about he could see no ghost nor any dark figure suggestive of abbot raoul try the black square piped the feeble voice of petley behind with a shrug rupert did so he thought that the housekeeper was mistaken as usual and that the ghost was the outcome of her too vivid imagination walking deliberately to the black square where abbot raoul had been burnt three hundred years before he swung the light over its bare surface in the centre he saw something sparkle and stooped then he rose with a cry it was a fan rupert picked it up opened it and looked at it in the lantern light there were the four beads and half a bead and the green jade leaves the very fan itself chapter xix a visitor how came the fan thereand on the accursed square of ground where no grass would grow rupert was not superstitious yet his heart gave a bound and for the moment he felt sick this fan was the cause of much trouble in the past it had cost one woman her life and it might yet claim another victim with the fan in his hand and the yellow light of the guttering candle in the lantern gleaming on its beauty he stood stupidly staring unheeding the feeble piping of petleys voice as he peered in at the ruined archway whats the matter master rupert questioned the old butler with a shiver have you seen it no said rupert at length and he hardly knew his own voice so heavy and thick it was theres nothing to be seen a cry came from the old man dont stand on that accursed ground master rupert he said almost whimpering and tonight of all times why tonight said rupert retreating back to the arch any night shivered petley putting his hand on his young masters arm and drawing him out of the cloisters its not a good place for an ainsleigh to be in at night the abbot john i dont believe in the abbot but anne saw himor it shes not the one to tell a lie mrs petley is deceived in some way rupert considered a moment and thrust the fan into his pocket in the darkness and because he turned aside the lantern light old petley had not seen that anything had been picked up im going to search round said rupert the butler gave a long wail as ainsleigh broke from his grasp no no he cried lifting his long hands not at night but rupert now quite himself did not heed the superstitious cry he disbelieved in ghosts more than ever some flesh and blood person had brought the fan and recollecting burghs story and what olivia had reported of miss pewseys talk that afternoon he quite expected to find dr forge lurking in the cloisters he would search for him and when face to face he would demand an explanation so rupert swiftly and lightly walked round holding the light high and low in the hope of discovering some crouching form and all the time petley waited trembling at the door the rain fell softly and there was a gentle wind swinging the heavy boughs of the pines so that a murmurous sound echoed through the cloisters like the breaking of leaguelong waves on a pebbly beach for at least half an hour rupert searched but he could see no one he could not even find the impression of feet sodden as was the ground after looking everywhere within the cloister and in the abbey itself he brushed past the old butler and walked down the avenue here also he was at fault as he could see no one the gates were closed but there was a light in the small house near at hand ainsleigh knocked at the door and shortly old payne holding a candle above his head appeared expressing surprise has anyone entered the gates tonight asked his master no sir i closed them at five as usual no one has come in there were no signs of the gates having been climbed and the wall which ran round the estate was so high and the top was pricked with such cruel spikes that no one could possibly have entered that way old payne insisted that no one had entered he had heard no voices no footsteps and seemed much perplexed by the insistence of his young master at length rupert desisted from making inquiries being perfectly assured that he would learn nothing he returned up the avenue slowly to the mansion wondering how it came about that forge had entered the ground and left the fan on the very spot where abbot raoul had been burnt mrs petley had recovered from her swoon and with her husband had retreated to the kitchen so rupert learned from olivia and he then gave her a description of his finding of the fan she was very amazed and curious show it to me she said not just now dear replied rupert walking to the door i must ask mrs petley first to explain what she saw she declares it was abbot raoul pooh forge masquerading as the monk i expect though why he should come here and bring this infernal fan i cannot understand what is the time olivia nine oclock she replied we had dinner early yes well ill see mrs petley you need not say anything about the fan and as old john didnt see me pick it up there will be no difficulty with him why should there be any difficulty with him asked mrs ainsleigh your aunt was killed for the sake of the fan and the person who killed her must have been within these grounds tonight i want to keep the matter quiet until i see rodgers tomorrow then ill explain all and place the fan in his hands then you think dr forge has been here yesor clarence burgh but as they have left marport i dont see what they have to gain by remaining in a place fraught with so much danger to both they cant both be guilty rupert no but burgh declares that forge strangled your aunt and miss pewsey lays the blame on her nephew but i dont believe either one of them i shouldnt be at all surprised to learn that the assassin is major tidman after all he wanted the fan badly so as to get the money but you were with him on the beach between eleven and twelve i was and the evidence of dr forge went to show that miss wharf was killed between those hours but suppose olivia rupert sank his voice and drew nearer suppose forge knew from the condition of the body that your aunt had been killed before eleven and had procured the fan from tidman by threatening to say so in which case the major could not have proved an alibi it might be so replied mrs ainsleigh but then the body would have been found earlier no there was not a single person so far as i know who went down those steps tungyu certainly didbut that was after the crime was committed and we know he did not carry the fan with him it is a very strange case perhaps after all tidman had already killed the woman when he joined me on the beach to smoke oh rupert how horrid was he disturbed he certainly seemed rather alarmed but i put that down to the circumstances he never shook off his fear of that adventure he had in canton and of course the mere presence of chinamen would make him uneasy but he kept his own council however we can talk of this later i must see mrs petley and rupert disappeared the housekeeper stuck to her story she had gone into the cloisters to gather mushrooms which grew therein and had the lantern with her while stooping at the archway to see what she could pick she heard even through the moaning of the wind the swish of a long garment the sound brought her to her feet andas she phrased itwith her heart in her mouth the place was uncanny and she had seen the abbot before but never so plainoh never so plain wailed mrs petley throwing her apron over her white hair and rocking i held the light over my head and dropped it with a screech for there not a yard away master rupert i saw it with a long gown and a hood over its wicked white face did you see the face i did just as i dropped the lantern white and wicked and evil i dropped on my knees and said a prayer with closed eyes and then it went i took the lantern and ran for the house for dear life till i burst in on you and the mistress oh master rupert dear what did you see nothing and i believe mrs petley you beheld some rascal masquerading no no twas a ghostoh dreary me my days are numbered mrs petley could not be persuaded that the thing she saw was flesh and blood so rupert gave up trying to convince her he returned the lantern back to old john and told the couple to retire to bed they were both white and nervous and not fit to be up then he came back to the drawingroom and found olivia seated by the fire reading at the door rupert paused to think what a pretty picture she made in her rich dinnerdressone of miss wharfs giftsand with one small hand supporting her dainty head she looked up as though she felt the magic of his gaze and he approached swiftly to press a kiss on the hand she held out to him well asked olivia rupert shrugged his shoulders theres nothing to be learned said he mrs petley wont give in she believes she has seen a ghost and declines that her days are numbered as she is nearly seventy i daresay they are but this fanhe took it out of his pocket let me see it said olivia stretching out her hand but rupert drew it away and spread out the leaves no my dear i dont like you to handle the horrible thing and besides you have seen it often enough in the hand of your aunt yes but now there is an awful significance about it theres blood blood cried his wife shuddering but she was strangled i speak figuratively my dear this little trifle has cost one life it may cost more i am quite sure lokeongs life hangs on this fan or he would not be so anxious to get it back it has a secret and i intend to learn what the secret is oh you mean to wave it in the smoke said olivia remembering what rupert had told her of tungyus speech yes i do i want to see the invisible picture then we may learn of this hiding place which contains the things lokeongs enemies wish to secure i expect it is some treasonous correspondence but rupert the hidingplace will be in china lokeong would not send papers of that kind to be concealed in england it would be the safest place replied rupert dryly however i intend to try the experiment of waving this fan in the smoke you dont know the kind of smoke i can guess the kind olivia do you remember that joss stick which mrs petley found in the abbey yesat the time she saw the ghost precisely the ghost left that jossstick behind on the first occasion and the fan on the second now i shouldnt wonder if the fan had got into the hands of hwei and that he was the ghost what makes you think that well hwei confessed that he was lurking outside the bristol hotel to get a chance of killing miss wharf when she was lured out by tungyu that gentleman however played false all the same hwei was here and perhaps he came up to the abbey why asked olivia looking perplexed ah that i cant tell you but i fancy the answer is to be found in this fan as soon as we see the picture but the smoke must be made by that jossstick it smells like cinnamon and is apparently a manufactured article hwei brought it so that he could wave the fan in its smoke and then learn the secret but he dropped the jossstick andwhere is it olivia i put it in a drawer over there after you showed it to me mrs ainsleigh went to a rosewood cabinet and opened a drawer she then returned with the jossstick in her hand and gave it to her husband who was kneeling on the hearthrug i hope it wont explode rupert said olivia nervously he stared why should you think that well it might have been dropped on purpose and looks like a cracker with that red paper round it perhaps theres dynamite nonsense said rupert taking out a match however if you are afraid go into the next room no said olivia seating herself if you are to be blown to bits ill be blown up with you they both laughed at the idea and then rupert lighted the match it was distinctly nervous work however and olivia started back as her husband set the joss stick fizzling she was leaning forward in the chair with her dark head nearly touching his fair hair the joss stick smoked slowly and a queer odour diffused itself though the room olivia sniffed rupert she said positively its the same scent as was on that letter of tungyus and of lokeong also said rupert watching the thick bluish smoke which now began to curl up from the joss stick apparently the mandarin uses the perfume as a kind of clue or perhaps it is a special scent dedicated to this private god of his i shall never understand chinamen and im very sure i dont want too olivia hold the stick while i wave the fan in the smoke being now assured that the smoke was proceeding from a harmless article mrs ainsleigh took the stick and held it lightly while her husband gravely waved the outspread fan in the thick smoke the joss stick fizzled and burned and gave out its queer smell which made both slightly dizzy every now and then rupert looked at the enamelled side of the fan where tungyu said that a picture would appear there certainly did seem something scrawled on the smooth green sticks and a blurred outline revealed itself for quite ten minutes ainsleigh continued waving until the joss stick burnt down nearly to the root then he looked again olivia placed the still fizzling joss stick in the fender and peered over his shoulder she uttered a cry when she saw the black outline of the picture and rupert nearly echoed it they were looking at a drawing of the cloisters yesthere were the cloisters of royabay abbey taken as by a camera from the archway the architecture was clear enough and the trees also but the picture was merely evanescent for as the fan grew cold again the outlines vanished however they knew that the hiding place of the presumed papers was within the cloisters of royabaybut in what spot rupert laid down the fan and propounded the problem to his wife the indications would be more exact yes replied olivia thoughtfully and picked up the fan i suppose you are right rupert it must have been hwei who came to the abbey on the night my aunt was killed and dropped the joss stick perhaps he came to see if he could find the hiding place without the aid of the fan no said rupert hwei is the servant of lokeong and probably knew of the hiding place whereas tungyu who served hop sing wanted the fan to learn about it i expect had tungyu bought the fan he would have come here and found the papers and then have cleared out to china to place them in his masters hands and ruin lokeong are you sure there are papers hidden said olivia fingering the beads dangling from the thick yellow cord i think so it cant be gold or silver or jewels however what we have to do is to find what is hidden then when lokeong comes down we can make a bargain with him if he hands over my eight thousand ill give him whatever we find but how are we find the spot said mrs ainsleigh dreamily oh rupert she added its in one of the trees dont you remember a tree was drawn at the side of the picture with a white line down the trunk no i didnt see that i saw the four trees and the stump drawn in the picture mrs ainsleigh rattled the beads through her fingers four beads and half a bead she exclaimed rupert those stand for the four trees and for the stump what makes you think so the half beadthat is the stump and see one of the beads is of jasper that might be the copper beech by jove rupert jumped up i believe you are right i am sure i am and in the tree drawn at the side of the picture which you did not observe there was a white line down the trunk well said rupert pondering perhaps whatever is hidden is tied to a string or a chain and is dropped down the trunk of one of the four treesor perhaps in the stump not in the stump said olivia quickly for then the line would be visible while in the other trees it would be concealed in the thick foliage i fancy the line must be down the copper beech trunk as there is but one red bead there is but one tree thoughone copper beech you know said her husband i am inclined to think that to make things safer the hiding place must be in one of the green trees signified by the jade beads the question is which tree is it olivia looked at the fan again and as she did so started rupert also raised his head they heard the sound of wheels scrunching the gravel outside and wondered who was arriving so late the clock pointed to halfpast ten the servants had gone to bed so rupert followed by his wife who was rather nervous went to the door when rupert opened it he found himself facing a tall handsome man in a fur cloak and wearing a strange hat good evening said the stranger in the best of english i speak to mr ainsleigh i think i am the marquis lokeong chapter xx the mandarin explains i must apologise for this very late visit said lokeong when he was conducted to the drawingroom by his surprised host but i must explain not now marquis replied ainsleigh giving his visitor the rank which he claimed you must be weary and hungry no i am perfectly well and enjoyed a meal before i left london if you will give my servants orders to take up my luggage and will then hear what i have to say you will do everything i desire rupert went again to the hall to tell the two chinese servants which lo keong had brought with him to take the trunks up to the bedroom which the marquis would occupy then he went to the back and made mr and mrs petley rise both were disturbed when they heard that a chinese grandee was in the house i do hope he wont bring trouble with him said mrs petley to her husband i never could abear them things since i saw that creature who brought home the old masters baggage and missus as is dead couldnt bear him either he was a cockeyed man said old john reflectively cockeyed yourself retorted the housekeeper who had a better memory he was oneeyed and a nice ugly thing he looked ah well as i always says abbot raoul dont walk for nothing and this chiner gentleman coming here means trouble old john who was much the same way of thinking himself grew annoyed by his wifes pessimism and told her to hurry up and come to the kitchen then he went to see after the bedroom which his master had selected for the untoward guest mrs petley came down to find her kitchen in the possession of two grave silent chinamen who had lighted the fire and were boiling water for tea well im sure said mrs petley surveying both with distaste the idear of these furreiners taking liberties and she sniffed at the far east meanwhile rupert returned to the drawingroom and found the marquis paying attentions to his wife lokeong was a tall finelooking man grave and extremely polite he had admirable manners and his clothes were of the finest olivia in her rich dinner dress felt quite plainly dressed beside this gorgeous gentleman who wore a jacket of rosepink a coat of grass green satin pale blue silk trousers and thicksoled white green shoes he also had a glossy pigtail woven with silk and carried a small fanat which olivia shuddered seated in a deep armchair he looked a potentate quite out of place in that sober english drawingroom the marquis was very affable and deferential to mrs ainsleigh who quite overcame her dislike to celestials after a few moments converse with this splendid specimen of the aristocracy of cathay you are quite sure you wont have some refreshment she asked lokeong waved his slim hand graciously i thank you no said he and if you will allow me to explain myself you can then retire i am ashamed of having called at this hour but he looked at rupert first and at olivia afterwards my excuse is a good one i have seen hweiwhom you know ainsleigh shuddered yes and i dont retain any very pleasant recollections of that gentleman said he lokeong laughed quietly hwei is a true devote of the god kwangho i dont understand about that god said olivia i have come to explain said the chinaman it is a great pity i did not come before you would then have had no trouble about this and he took up the famous fan which olivia had tossed on the sofa oh the young couple looked at one another and if they did not say oh the expression of ohan amazed oh was on their faces lokeong seemed to have his eyes everywhere and took up the fan as if it was the most natural thing it should be lying there you understand he went on in his calm wellbred voice i have seen hwei and he told me everything about the murder about the murder mrs ainsleigh and about the hunt for the assassin also about your husbands visit to london and full details concerning the folly of tungyumy enemys servant who related how the picture on this he laid a long yellow finger on the fan could be brought to light his eyes wandered to the fragment of the joss stick within the fender i observe that you have been clever enough to see the picture yes said rupert quite amazed at this penetration but how do you know that very easily hwei told me that he came to the cloisters one night to see that all was well he knew of the hiding place then asked olivia eagerly certainly i have always trusted hwei but tungyu did not know and hence his desire to procure the fan hwei was here on the night poor miss wharf was killed and dropped the joss stick you have been clever enough to make use of it well now you both know where the packet is the packet of papers which mean my lifepapers connected with the boxers which the mandarin hop sing would give much to possess we know that the packet is hidden in a tree said rupert but which tree we cannot guess ah lokeong slipped the beads through his fingers here is a piece of jade with a gold band round it the third bead consequently the third tree we will look for the packet as soon as i explain myself the packet must be safe as you have the fan and i know mr ainsleigh you are my friend as i was the friend of your father before you what rupert threw back his head i understood from dr forge that you were my enemy lokeong frowned ah he goes as far as that said he then paused a moment i will explain olivia would have interrupted but he threw out a long arm in an imperious manner and began his story without further preamble playing with the fan all the time my name said the marquis is lokeong and i am a native of the province of kansu where the mine is murmured rupert exactly mr ainsleigh my native town is on the hwei river and not far from the mine your father bought along with dr forge pardon me sir but dr forge did not buy it he was merely a servant of your fathers the mine was owned by your father alone i conducted the negotiations on behalf of the owner of the land but forge says i can guess lokeong waved his hand coldly he blackens my name to you and lies about the mine always badalways foul always a liarthat man must be killed i have spared him too long olivia shuddered no marquis said she i beg that there may be no more murders not in england but when this forge comes again to china here the marquis smiled in a cruel way but made no further remark the young people shuddered he smiled benignly on them and went on with his story in a calm level voice my respected parent was a merchant said he calmly and he gave me a fine education of which as you know we think greatly in the middle kingdom i secured the hanlin degree which is very high and so became greater than my friend hop sing who failed that success made hop sing my enemy i returned home and hop sing made trouble it is not necessary to explain how added the marquis with another wave of his hand but the trouble resulted in my leaving my parental roof and becoming a soldier with the boxers who then conspired against the empress dowager but before i left my native town i acted as the middle man between a respected resident and mr markham ainsleigh who desired to lease a gold mine on the hwei river i left him in full possession of the rights to work the mine and dr forge assisted him not as a partner asked rupert breathlessly by no means mr ainsleigh forge was a good doctor but he knew nothing about mining he doctored the coolies and attended to minor matters your father looked after the mine personally i understand he learned how to do so in california yeshe was there before i was born but permit me to continue mr ainsleigh well then i left your father in possession of the mine and joined the boxers i rose to be a leader and afterwards returned to see my parents at that time the rebellionfor that it wasproved unfortunate so it was necessary that i should conceal myself i took service with your father as a foreman of the mine and i can safely say said lokeong with a certain show of emotion that your father saved my life i consider myself indebted to him and now i am indebted to his son it is very good of you said rupert i need a friend you have one in me said the marquis courteously but to proceed as the night grows darker i was your fathers friend hop sing was his enemy and forge sided with hop sing but why did he do that asked ainsleigh impetuously forge was at college with my fatherthey were great friends so mr markham ainsleigh thought but dr forge was greedy and wished to have the mine to himself hop sing who had some influence at the imperial court promised to help dr forge to get rid of your father and secure the mine provided i was ruined and forge acted this base part he did said the mandarin quietly i may tell you mr ainsleigh that i was completely in your fathers confidence he made a great deal of money out of the mine and i arranged for it to be turned into safe investments through a third person whose name need not be mentioned a large sum was placed out at interest and all these many years the interest has been accumulating you will receive a handsome sum i assure you mr ainsleigh but broke in olivia perplexed dr forge told my husband that the whole amount was eighteen thousand of which ten thousand belonged to him and eight thousand to rupert dr forge places the money obtained from the mine at a low figure said the chinaman smiling what the amount is i shall tell you later meanwhile i must explain the intrigue which led to your fathers murder ah rupert leaped to his feet then he was murdered he wasby the emissary of hop sing be calm mr ainsleigh and be seated your father died quietly enough by strangulation what was he killed in the same way as miss wharf lokeong bowed his stately head yes and by the same person tungyu cried olivia starting to her feet in her turn exactly mrs ainsleigh i know that tungyu strangled mr markham ainsleigh and i believe that he strangled your aunt rupert sat down on the sofa and drew his wife down beside him but tungyu was the man who was to buy the fan quite so lokeong folded and unfolded the fan calmly you know of the god kwangho yesbut i cant understand naturally the marquis laughed quietly that is a thing beyond the comprehension of a western barbarianyour pardon for so calling you kwangho went on the mandarin is an ancestor of mine who lived during the ming dynasty he was a sage and very famous so i took him as my private god olivia looked amazed and a little shocked a private god i never knew that anyone could have a private god even in china she said if you have read roman history mrs ainsleigh you will remember the lares and penates which were something of the same kind i was very unfortunate with the public gods of my country so i chose kwangho to be my geniusmy destiny i had an image made and offered him incense it was in fact what you might call ancestral worship only i looked upon kwangho as one who could control my destiny i was right said lokeong emphatically for from the moment i sacrificed to kwangho my fortunes changed in what way asked rupert wondering that a clever man like this should talk so superstitiously in every way the priest of my new god kwangho consulted the deity and ordered that i should leave the boxers and attach myself to the party of the empress dowager who was to be all powerful in the future i think added lokeong smiling blandly that kwangho was right in that who is so powerful as my august mistress true enough admitted ainsleigh impatiently but what has this to do with the death of my father patience mr ainsleigh i arranged to leave the boxers we were fighting for the emperor who was then being crushed by the empress dowager i had many papers showing my devotion to the boxer cause and to his imperial majesty these papers i intended to destroy but remembering that some day the emperor might overcome the empress i decided to keep the papers they would show that i had worked for the emperor and thus my fortunes would be secure should his imperial majesty reign alone as yet added lokeong with a shrug he has not reigned alone and my august mistress still rules the destinies of the middle kingdom ah and if she got those papers she would cut off my head replied lokeong quietly so now you see why i thought it best to conceal them i wished to preserve the papers so as to keep myself in favour with the emperor when he became supreme and i wished to conceal them from the empress dowager and her spies while she ruled china you understand we do said the young couple so you used the means of the fan to tell where they were hidden asked rupert the mandarin assented i did i spoke to your father about this plan of concealment i knew the papers would not be safe in china as the emissaries of hop sing would find them and i should be ruined so on the suggestion of your father i decided to hide them in england but why in the abbey mr markham ainsleighs suggestion sir he said that this place had been in the possession of his family for years and would likely continue to remain under the ainsleigh alasalas sighed rupert not at all sir was lokeongs brisk reply you will have enough money to keep this place i assure you but to continueyour father whose health was very bad arranged to take his money back to this place and to take also the papers i wished to hide we arranged that they should be concealed in the third tree and then i hit upon the plan of an invisible picture on the fan with the assistance of the beads to identify the hidingplace but was that necessary when you knew the hidingplace i wished my heirs to benefit by my services to the emperor during the boxer rising and they were not to know of the existence of these papers till i died so you will understand yes its very interesting so please go on well while we were arranging these things forge went to pekin and got a concession to work the mine from the empress through the influence of hop sing meanwhile i arranged to enter the service of my imperial mistress and left your father ill of dysentery of which according to forge he died no said the mandarin decisively he was recovering he had the packet and the fan which he was to take to this place hwei was to go with him and design the invisible picture and hide the packet i went to see about letting your father have the money which i had invested for him all was ready and he was winding up his affairs then the emissary of hop sing strangled your father tungyu said rupert much agitated i have already said that replied the marquis rather tartly your father died and forge obtained the mine but he did not hold it long i represented that forge had obtained the death of mr markham ainsleigh through hop sing the empress took my view hop sing was disgraced and i was promoted forge had to leave china for the time being but he came back several times i sent hwei to this place with your fathers effects and with the fan he concealed the packet and drew the picture your mother was alive then mr ainsleigh and hwei showed her the fan though he did not tell her the secret ah cried rupert now i remember where i saw the fan yes lokeong nodded as a boy of five you may remember it i certainly do but marquis why did you not send my fathers money to my mother ah she died and although i knew you were the heir and in the guardianship of forge who was your enemy i could do nothing hop sing got the upper hand again and i was in my turn disgraced then hop sing learned about the papers and about the fan being the means of finding the hidingplace he ordered tungyu to find the fan hwei was bringing the fan back from england to me he was assaulted when he landed in china but he luckily had given the fan to a brother of his so hop sing could not find it then the brother was killed and a coolie who knew nothing of the fan took possession of it afterwards i wanted the fan hop sing told me what he suspected so i applied to the god kwangho the god declared through his priest that hop sing was to come with me to the shrine he did so and thus bitter enemies as we were we came for a time to be in peace and then the arrangement was made yes the god said that an equal chance must be given to good and evil hwei was appointed to find the fan for me and to give death to the person who had it tungyu acted for hop sing and was to give a reward of not less than five thousand pounds so that the person who held the fan should be rich for life each was to hold sway for twentyfour hours i caused this to be published in the chinese newspaper in pekin the coolie heard it and being fearful lest he should be killed he kept the fan for years and said nothing then major tidman ah i know he came to see how my father died quite so mr ainsleigh and the coolie knowing the fan was connected with the deathfor he afterwards went to kansu mine and asked questionsgave the fan to the major to get rid of it and and we know the rest said rupert rising tidman gave it to dr forge and he gave it to youor rather you caused it to be taken from him no said the mandarin that is not true i never saw the fan till now all these years i have never set eyes on it but dr forge said whatever he said he speaks falsely said lokeong but it is growing late mr ainsleigh and i see that your wife is weary let us retire and i shall tell you the rest of the story tomorrow but before i go to rest added the mandarin decidedly i must assure myself that the packet is still in the trunk of the third tree rupert was quite ready and lighted the lantern the two men went to the abbey into the pitchy darkness and walked to the third tree near the bare spot lokeong who seemed to be able to see in the dark like a cat looked round and laid his finger on a huge oak this is the tree said he confidently but i cant very well see said rupert from which side do you count from the left to right explained the mandarin in these robes mr ainsleigh i cannot climb the tree will you please to do so you will find the hollow trunk and the line pall it up the papers will be at the end bring them to me if you please so speaking lokeong took the light and rupert although in thin evening dress began to climb the tree luckily it was not difficult as the branches hung low but it was disagreeable on account of the dripping wet every movement shook down much moisture however the active young man disappeared in the foliage and then felt round he could not see and came down to get the lantern which the chinaman passed to him then he found that the trunk of the tree was broken off amidst the thick branches and that the centre was hollow he espied a rusty thin chain and pulled it up at the end there was a small box which he brought down with an exclamation of joy lokeong took it it opened easily in his hand gone cried the marquis in a voice of anguish he spoke truly the box was empty chapter xxi who is guilty next morning at the early hour of nine oclock orlando rodgers drove up to royabay filled with curiosity he had received ruperts letter which summoned him to come down on matters connected with the murder and he was eager to learn details rodgers himself had been unlucky he had traced the stormy petrel to the thames near rotherhithe and had learned from the captain that two chinamen had hired the boat for a couple of days they went down to marport and had gone ashore early in the evening they came on board again after midnight and then had requested to be put ashore at rotherhithe the captain confessed that he had been paid well for the job and thoughtwith a winkthat there was no chance of his knowing his employers again rodgers of course recognised that tungyu and hwei in their queer partnership had hired the yachtwhich it seems was a public boat anyone could take for a periodand he knew also that the den where rupert and clarence had met with their adventures was in rotherhithe he learned of this from no less a person than mr burgh himself for the buccaneer called at the police office in london to ask if the chinamen had been caught rodgers had extracted a full account of the adventures and had gone to the den only to find it empty and the chinamen conspicuous by their absence burgh himself had not returned as he promised and the detective was annoyed at this after he heard ruperts story had he known what this was he certainly would have arrested burgh there and then for participation in the murder but the astute clarence in telling his penters alley adventure had taken care not to incriminate himself on arrival the detective was shown into the drawingroom where rupert was sitting with the stately mandarin olivia was not present as she had heard quite enough about the fan and wished to hear no more not even the end of lokeongs very interesting story rodgers recognised that lokeong was of a different type of celestial to tungyu and hwei and paid him great deference he explained to rupert his illsuccess with the yacht stormy petrel and detailed the interview with clarence i wish i had told you about him in my letter said rupert jumping up much annoyed with himself you could have arrested him and when rodgers heard the story he blamed ainsleigh as much as he blamed himself for not having risked an arrest on suspicion but you know sir said he huffily burgh really didnt give himself away i could do nothing to himor to the captain of the stormy petrel either on what evidence i hear as to those chinamen ah said lokeong you must let me deal with them mr rodgers can you deal with tungyu the mandarin drew down the corners of his mouth i think so said he it is my belief that he has the papers what papers sir lokeong seeing it was absolutely necessary to make things plain if he wanted to secure his precious packet related almost word for word the story he had told on the previous night so you see he observed tungyu probably strangled miss wharf as formerly he strangled mr markham ainsleigh i discussed this with hwei and he knowing that tungyu had betrayed him once was much of the same opinion but if tungyu has the papers why did he write to tidman argued rupert not inclined to take this view probably to throw hwei off the scent tungyu knows well enough that if he started for china hwei would suspect he had the papers and would follow him to get them by murder probably said the mandarin indifferently and after all sir why not tungyu killed your father and miss wharf hwei is watching him and if he can make sure that tungyu has my parcel he will kill himwith my approval ended lokeong calmly wait a bit said rodgers also coolly though the speech astonished him not a little when you talked to hwei you did not know that the papers had been stolen no but he who has the fan has the papers hwei and i both thought that tungyu had the fan and therefore hwei watches him i came down unexpectedly last night instead of waiting so that i might assure myself that the packet was safe but only a short time before mr ainsleigh found the fan tungyu must have come down and taken the papers rupert nodded certainly without doubt he was the ghost mrs petley saw and when she came on him suddenly he dropped the fan and fled he must have climbed the wall of the park in spite of the spikes lokeong smiled sourly i do not think anythingspikes or otherwise would have kept tungyu from gaining possession of those papers and of course he knew the way to make the picture visible how was that i thought only you and my father and hwei ah said the mandarin calmly it seems that tungyu overheard the discussion between myself and your father as to the hiding of the papers and the plan of the fan when he strangled markham ainsleigh he hoped to find the packet at once but hwei secured both the fan and the packet i have told you how they came to england and how hwei gave the fan to his brother the brother was killed by accident and the coolie i spoke of found the fan in his clothing knowing nothing of its significance then he learned the truth from the notice i put in the pekin paper and was afraid lest he should offend the god kwangho no he was not afraid of deathfew of us are in china but the anger of a god is different it means ages of torment and the chance of being born again in the belly of some creeping animal so the coolie kept the fan till he found an opportunity of giving it to a foreign devil in the person of major tidman i cant understand how he knew the major wanted the fan save that he must have heard that tidman was searching for news as to the death of markham ainsleigh the coolie then knew from enquiries at the mine that the fan was connected with the death and thus that the god kwangho might have appointed the death of markham yes said the mandarin complacently the coolie was afraid of the god and no doubt was glad when major tidman took the fan rodgers stared as lokeong spoke its rum to hear a gentleman like yourself talk this way sir he said ah smiled the mandarin our eastern ways are different to yours yes said the detective but you are so clever that i dont see how you can believe in all this stuff about the private god lokeong waved his hand imperatively let us not speak of that or we anger kwangho he is the controller of my destiny rather let us see how we can recover my papers from tungyu if he has them put in rupert perplexedly and if so hwei will get them back assuredly replied the mandarin the first attempt that tungyu makes to leave england for our own land hwei will guess the truth and will kill him to get the fan or the papers but the fan is here yes hwei however thinks tungyu has it i shall tell him that tungyu has taken the papers but by breaking the agreement come to before the god wont kwangho be angry marquis hwei does not mind he is my slave and will do anything for me nono added the marquis calmly as tungyu first disobeyed the god in not bringing miss wharf to meet with her doom at the hands of hwei kwangho will give him up to my vengeance neither of the europeans could make anything of this what we want to know said ainsleigh speaking for himself and rogers is how did the fan get back to you i told you last night it did not get back replied lokeong i heard from hwei that the fan was given to miss wharf by burghbut how he got it lokeong shook his head from a pirate in chinese waters no the fan never came back to china lokeong took a paper out of his pocket i should have given that to you last night it will show you why hwei and tungyu came to look for the fan in england and he gave the paper to rupert the young man read it it was in scratchy female handwriting and was to the effect that the fan of the marquis was in the possession of a certain person in england no name was signed to this paper and after rodgers had read it lokeong took it again and laid it on the table so you see he remarked when i got that letter i knew the fan was in england i sent hwei to search for it and of course tungyu on behalf of hop sing came also they could not find who had written the letter and advertised the fan as you know then burgh told a lie said rupert lokeong opened his mouth to speak but before he could do so mrs ainsleigh entered with a sheet of foolscap in her hand i beg your pardon for interrupting you gentlemen she said excitedly but here is something you should know rupert she turned to her husband and thrust the paper into his hand its from dr forge what cried ainsleigh astonished has he dared to write yes and he writes to some purpose read it out rupert i am sure the marquis and mr rodgers will be glad to hear if it bears on the case hesitated the detective it does answered olivia seating herself listen rupert glanced at the heading of the letter he gives london as his address he said so he apparently is afraid of being caught read dear said mrs ainsleigh impatiently thus adjured rupert began my dear mrs ainsleigh said forge in his communication i write to you rather than your husband as i think you will judge me fairer than he will as if i could put in mrs ainsleigh impatiently i am not a good man and i never pretended to be but i have been poor all my life and the lack of money is the cause of my having acted in a way which otherwise i should not have done there is much truth in becky sharps remark that anyone can be good on five thousand a year had i possessed that amount this letter would never have been written as it is i write because i hear that the marquis lokeong is in england and he will no doubt tell your husband his own story which is not creditable to forge said the marquis suavely rupert nodded and proceeded i was at college with markham ainsleigh your husbands father and he believed in me but i was always jealous of him as he was handsomer than i was he possessed an ancient and honoured name and was fairly well off i was born of poor parents and was of humble origin markham certainly helped me with money and with influence so that i obtained my degree and a nice way he repaid his obligations said olivia sharply hes frank enough about his baseness at all events said rupert and then continued the letter markham wanted money and as the doctor of a liner to hongkong i had heard of a littleworked gold mine on the hwei river i told markham about it and proposed that he should go to china to work the mine he agreed and took me with him as he thought that my medical knowledge would benefit him does forge say he owned part of the mine asked lokeong no listen said rupert reading slowly i was merely the doctor as markham bought the rights to work the mine with his own money but he promised me a share and my share now amounts to ten thousand pounds that is true in a way said lokeong out of the money i pay you mr ainsleigh this man can certainly claim that amount then what i receive must be a large sum said rupert the chinaman smiled faintly much larger than you think said lokeong pardon my interruption and proceed rupert continued but i was not satisfied with my share and wanted all the money lokeong had an enemy called hop sing and he promised if i could ruin lokeong that he would put markham out of the way and give me the money which had been obtained by working the mine i knew that markham had never sent any money home as he wanted to wait until he could become a millionaire and then return to astonish his wife and restore the splendours of royabay i therefore saw hop sing i think you can leave all that out mr ainsleigh said lokeong it is the story i told you so it is said rupert running his eyes down the closely written page wellhumhum he picked up the thread of the tale lower down it seems he said speaking for himself that hop sing fell into disgrace and forge could not get the money he went to china several times as hop sing recovered his position and i fell into disgrace said the marquis the empress is a woman you knowpardon me mrs ainsleighand whimsical well said rupert smiling you seem to have been up and down several times when hop sing was in favour forge went to china but the mandarin refused to help him to get the money which was under the control of lokeong unless the fan was obtained forge learned the conditions of the fan and finally got it from the major he took it to england and locked it up in a cabinet but he was afraid to take it to china or use it in case hwei should kill him and hwei would have killed him said the marquis it was as well that forge was so careful but how did he lose the fan miss pewsey took it said rupert glancing at the letter a woman the marquis took the note from the table and passed it to mrs ainsleigh tell me madam is that a womans handwriting olivia looked surprised it is miss pewseys handwriting ah said rupert so she wrote to lokeong telling him the fan was in england listen to what the doctor says and he began to read again miss pewsey came to my house and was very friendly she wanted me to marry her saying she was trying to get miss wharf to leave her the money that should have been left to you mrs ainsleigh ah said olivia significantly so she did work for that go on the letter went on as followsi didnt like miss pewsey who was old and ugly and evilmuch worse than i ever was in my worst days but she haunted my house and i got used to her i used to smoke opium and grew very ill in fact on more than one occasion i became delirious miss pewsey came and nursed me she took advantage of my delirium to learn the whole story of the fan and learned alsodont be startled at this mrs ainsleighthat through me markham had lost his life we know that from the marquis said rodgers but i suspect mr forge wouldnt have spoken out had he not guessed the marquis would tell the whole yarn go on mr ainsleigh miss pewsey went on the letter insisted that i should marry her or else she threatened to reveal the story to rupert i was unwilling that this should be as i thoughtand very rightlythat i should get into trouble and he would have rupert broke off grimly to explain i should have shaken the life out of him however to continue and he again began to read this highly interesting letter i therefore agreed to marry her but always sought an opportunity of escape during one of my insensible fits after a bout of opium smoking miss pewsey took the key from my watch chain and opening the cabinet gained possession of the fan i denied this to major tidman at miss pewseys behest or else miss pewsey would have denounced me not she said rodgers chuckling she would have lost her husband had she done so she has lost him in any case said olivia but i can tell you what is in the rest of the letter as i see rupert is tired of reading miss pewsey gave the fan to clarence to give to me to win your favour said rupert no to bring about my death miss pewsey thought if i was out of the way she would get aunt sophia to leave her the money what a wicked woman said lokeong we have none such in china well went on olivia rapidly miss pewsey wrote to the marquis saying the fan was in england here is the letter said rodgers nodding towards the epistle yes how strange i should see it almost immediately after dr forge wrote said mrs ainsleigh innocently miss pewsey laid her plans well said rupert looking again at the letter she intended to tell hwei that olivia had the fan so that she should be killed but olivia refused the fan and miss pewsey made clarence give it to miss wharf so that the poor lady might be killed but miss pewsey delayed the death at the hands of hwei by holding her tongue till a will was made in her favour chance favoured her for she got the will altered by learning of our marriage when she played the spy said olivia quite so said ainsleigh she then read the advertisement and knew that the two men hwei and tungyu were in england she wrote and told them that miss wharf had the fan the letter was sent shortly before the ball and after the new will was made tungyu therefore came down to the ball to get the fan this was not what miss pewsey wanted as she desired hwei to kill the woman she knew about the god kwangho then asked lokeong i think so but forge isnt clear on that point however he declared that he does not know who killed miss wharf nor who has the fan he was told by clarence how heburgh had accused him to the chinamen and then grew fearful also he heard that the marquis was in england and so he knew the whole story would come out as he dreaded arrest he fled but he could have prevented burgh from speaking said olivia you know rupert how mr burgh told you that forge knew things about him i daresay if the marquis had not come to england forge would have silenced clarence and fought the matter out but he knew that the truth about my fathers death would be told by the marquis and also dreaded lest he should be accused of miss wharfs murder he says that clarence never gave him the tie as he says he did and declares that he was in the cardroom all the evening how does he end the letter asked rodgers rupert read the last words so i write you this mrs ainsleigh to show you that i am innocent of the death of your aunt i see that the game is up and that ill never get the ten thousand from lokeong also if i remain i shall have to marry miss pewsey and cannot bear the idea when you get this ill be far away on the sea on a voyage to a land i need not particularise not china i hope said the marquis if he comes there again i shall have to kill him he deserves to be punished for having brought about the death of my friend markham ainsleigh what is to be done now gentlemen we are no further on than before we certainly dont know who had the fan said rodgers or who has the packet put in olivia tungyu has it i am sure said lokeong i dont agree with you marquis said the detective tungyu and hwei certainly cleared back to rotherhithe by that yacht but if the fan had been on board hwei would have spotted it tungyu is very cunning said the marquis doubtfully well said rupert folding forges letter up i suggest that the marquis should offer a large reward for the fan with his own name appended then whosoever has the packet will bring it for of course added rupert shrewdly those who had the fanif more than onewill have the packet tungyutungyu said the marquis shaking his head however i will try the advertisement and appoint a place i am willing to give a large sum for the packet and i am prepared to arrest the person who brings the packet as the murderer of miss wharf said rodgers you leave the thing to me marquis come with me to london my friend said lokeong and we will write the advertisement i shall reward you largely if you get this packet back again and what will you do rupert asked olivia eagerly her husband looked up i shall hunt for the packet on my own account good said lokeong in his stately manner we will see who is fortunate enough to bring me the packet and earn he looked at rupert impressively one hundred thousand pounds chapter xxii afterevents rodgers went to london with the marquis lokeong that very day and rupert wanted to go also but olivia objected to this she feared lest her husband should be wounded again i dont wish to lose you darling said mrs ainsleigh coaxingly but the money said rupert dubiously you mean the hundred thousand pounds said olivia that will be paid to you by the marquis it is rightfully your own humph it seemed to me that lokeong hinted he would pay the money to whomsoever brought him the packet in that case rodgers nonsense said olivia quickly i am quite sure that the marquis means well to both of us no doubt he will reward rodgers largely should he get the packet but he will give you your fathers money all the same i should like to hunt for the packet on my own account olivia said rupert obstinately let those hunt to whom the packet is of value but i dont believe that this advertisement will bring forth anything argued ainsleigh frowning if tungyu has the packet he certainly wont pass it along to lokeong if burgh stole it he will be afraid lest hwei who is in lokeongs pay should kill him as to tidman you thought he was guilty said olivia smiling and i still have my doubts rejoined her husband so ill call at the bristol and have a talk this conversation took place the day after the mandarin had departed and rupert was worrying about the exciting chase for the packet which he foresaw would take place however as olivia insisted he should not risk his life again with asiatics he interested himself still in the case by talking it over with major tidman on arriving at the bristol he was shown up at once to tidmans room and found the major spick and span as usual but greatly excited i was just coming up to see you said the major look here and he handed rupert the mornings copy of the daily telegraph ainsleigh looked at the place indicated by the major and saw the advertisement asking for the return of the fan on delivery of which the sum of five thousand would be paid i see that the marquis has lost no time said rupert throwing down the paper he and rodgers must have inserted the advertisement at once oh said the major staring so you know yes lokeong and rogers were with me yesterday lokeong why that is the man who owns the fan exactly he is a marquis and high in the service of the empress dowager of china as to the fan rupert rapidly detailed how it had been found in the cloisters and related also the subsequent discovery that the box attached to the chain in the tree trunk was empty and the man who took the fan from miss wharfs dead body stole the packet said rupert so it is not likely he will risk arrest by coming forward to give the papers to lokeong tidman sat down astounded at these revelations i wish i had been present said he i was always curious about the fans secret a very ingenious device ainsleigh very assented rupert dryly then he cast a sidelong look on the major and spoke to the point you had nothing to do with the stealing of the fan i hope major i cried tidman bouncing from his seat like an india rubber ball well you see went on rupert we met on the beach after eleven but it is just possible in spite of forges evidence that miss wharf may have been killed before then and you believe that i killed her thank you ainsleigh my good friend rejoined the young man calmly lokeong believes that tungyu broke his oath before the god and strangled miss wharf but i disagree with him as tungyu could have procured the fan by milder means the next day hwei could not have strangled the woman as he was haunting the abbey grounds to see if the packet was still safe forge in a letter to my wife insists that he never got the tie and certainly did not kill miss wharf so so you have narrowed it down to me cried tidman in a burst of indignation its too bad of you ainsleigh i am not a thin skinned man by any means but i do feel this very deeply i swear the major flung up his hand dramatically i swear that i never possessed the tie and i never killed miss wharf and i never took the fan and thats all right interrupted rupert if you did not take the tie you certainly could not have strangled the woman after all perhaps i have been too hard on you major ah said tidman angrily you are prepared to take my word for it now unsupported by other evidence your accusation cant be made seriously ainsleigh well upon my soul said rupert passing his hand through his hair i really dont know what to think or say this case seems to grow more mystical at every step i admit that as you deceived me at the time we discussed the advertisement you think i deceived you again well i did not that was my one and only deception i wanted the fan in order to procure money i admit but the danger of being killed by hwei instead of being rewarded by tungyu was too great i dropped the matter then who do you think is guilty clarence burgh oh i am sure of it he admits that miss pewsey told him the tie was in the overcoat pocket no doubt he took it out and used it to incriminate you then again burgh learned from tungyu how the picture could be rendered visible true enough mused rupert well he might be guilty and he certainly was in the cloisters one day so as to examine the place said the major and afterwards he came at night in the monks disguise knowing about the ghost and the legend he was startled when he secured the packet and left the fan by accident on the black square or by design said ainsleigh remembering the prophecy which says that gold will come from the holy ashes if i get this one hundred thousand pounds the prophecy will certainly be fulfilled in a sort of way it was indirectly owing to the fan that lokeong told me of the money my father made in china and through the fan when the packet is restored he intends to give the money to me oh humbug said the major contemptuously i dont believe in that foolish rhyme a bit but are you of my opinion that burgh is guilty yesin the way you put it it seems probable well then said tidman angrily and striking the table with his fist i have had enough of being suspected so ill help you to hunt down the assassin i must know who killed miss wharf or else you will be accusing me again see here and he threw a paper on the table it was a square of yellow paper strongly perfumed which asked the major to bring the fan to the den in penters alley you showed me this before said rupert i went up on your behalf look at the date said tidman pointing its a new invitation i think tungyuwho writes the letterbelieves i killed the woman and have the fan after all well last time you went on my behalf this time danger or no danger ill go myself you can come if you like i shall certainly come said rupert jumping up olivia does not want me to proceed further in this matter but now that you are going ill go too tungyu cant know that the fan is in my hands or that the packet is missing hes not so clever as i thought he was said tidman coolly or he wouldnt have bungled this affair as he has done i am not afraid of him now but you see that the appointment is for tomorrow night at nine oclock at penters alley under the lantern exactlythe same place but as rodgers knows of my adventure i wonder tungyu risks another meeting besides rodgers told me he had been to the den and found both chinamen gone oh thunderbolts never strike in the same spot twice said tidman it is the safest place rodgers having gone once will not go again well will you come yes said rupert firmly and went back to the abbey to persuade his wife to let him make one more attempt to solve the mystery olivia was obdurate at first but after a time she yielded though she assured rupert she should be miserable all the time he was away and do take care of yourself she said of course ill take every care replied her husband and so it was arranged that rupert should go up to town with major tidman by the six oclock train the next evening and proceed to penters alley to see tungyu and learnif possible the truth olivias attention was somewhat taken off the projected expedition to the wilds of rotherhithe by a visit from lady jabe that eccentric female looking more like a judge than ever and dressed in a most manly fashion appeared with a shining face to announce that chris was engaged to marry lotty dean its most delightful said lady jabe her father is merely a retired grocer but i have consented to overlook that if he settles some money on the young couple and has he consented asked olivia languidly she did not take much interest in the affairs of mr walker yes mr dean has allowed his daughter a thousand a year paid quarterly said lady jabe amiably and that with what chris earns at the office will keep us nicely us echoed mrs ainsleigh smiling certainly was lady jabes calm reply i have been a mother to chris and i intend to be a mother to lotty i shall look after the house and control the purse otherwise the young pair may get into the bankruptcy court olivia privately thought that under lady jabes care the young couple would have a bad time even though they might be free from bankruptcy what does mr walker say oh chris is delighted he had better be id like to see him cross me dear olivia ive broken his spirit thoroughly lotty certainly is a trifle difficult but ill break her also by degrees i think you should leave mr and mrs walker to manage their own affairs said olivia indignantly oh dear me no replied lady jabe calmly that would never do a couple of babies my dear olivia who need a firm hand ill look after them and receive a small sum for doing so my late husband did not leave me well off she went on confidentially so it is necessary that i should do the best for myself but now thats all settled and im glad you are pleased not with your proposed arrangement lady jabe oh yes you are dear olivia nothing could be better whatever you may say and now to talk of other and less pleasing matters miss pewsey who robbed you of your inheritance is about to leave marport yesyou may look surprised but she is selling ivy lodge and intends to go to america in search of the doctor asked mrs ainsleigh doubtfully quite so i understand that dr forge has gone there but just think what a brazen women miss pewsey must be to follow a man who left heras you might say at the altar miss pewsey is in london now making arrangements to sail for new yorkso she told me yesterday i wish her all joy added lady jabe shaking her head but i fear the man will spend her money and leave her when lady jabe went olivia thought over the projected departure of miss pewsey on the trail of dr forge she was glad at heart that her enemy was leaving marport but could not help thinking that the bitter little woman was going out of her way to make trouble for herself and as forge was wanted for participation in markham ainsleighs murder olivia though she would inform her husband of his whereabouts so that he might be brought back if necessary but rupert listened thoughtfully and then replied after consideration i wont move in the matter he said calmly forge behaved like a scoundrel but as he has gone i leave him in gods hands he will get his deserts yet olivia will you send him the ten thousand pounds rupert no said the young man decisively i shall certainly not do that forge deserves some punishment and shall have it by being deprived of the money he sinned to obtain he did not kill my poor father but he certainly brought about his death indirectly leave him to god olivia as for ourselves we will get our own money from lokeong and restore the abbey and miss pewseys mortgage it is due shortly before christmas and i shall be able to pay it off before then miss pewsey has done her worst olivia henceforth she will be harmless and what about her punishment rupert i should think the loss of forge has punished her and if she really intends to follow him she will be more disappointed the man will not marry her no olivia miss pewsey also sinned to get money but she will be punished you may be certain the next evening rupert again assumed his old suit and heavy cloak and went away olivia clung to him as he left the door oh my darling be careful she said if you are killed i wont be rupert assured her i have taken the precaution to write telling rodgers of this meeting he will bring by my advice a couple of plaincloth policemen to penters alley and if there is trouble both the major and i will be able to get away comforted thus olivia kissed her husband and saw him drive down the avenue then she returned to her room to count the moments until he returned all their troubles had brought olivia and rupert closer together and in their implicit trust in one another lay the elements of future happiness ainsleigh found the major also plainly dressed waiting at the station and the two were speedily on their way to town owing to an accident to the train they were late in arriving at liverpool street station and the major fumed we wont be in time he said when they went to the underground railway oh i think so said rupert calmly its just as well we should not be too early i want rodgers and his men to be on the spot but what do you think will come of all this asked tidman nervously i think we will find the papers but if tungyu had them he would not have written to me he is playing some sort of game i cant understand and i have given up theorizing let us wait the major grumbled a little but finally agreed that ainsleigh was right they soon arrived at rotherhithe and stepped out into the main street the night was fine and there was a bright moon i like this better than when i was here last said rupert as the two went down to penters alley its a good thing theres a moon said the major casting a glance upward if these chinamen try to bolt we can chase them do you expect hwei to be there also i cant say said tidman but if tungyu is i suspect hwei wont be far off they work in couples as you know and pull against each other like illmatched dogs said rupert a queer compact this its silly i think the mandarin must be mad with all this rubbish about his gimcrack god kwangho here we areand theres the lantern what a narrow street they stepped down the alley in the bright moonlight the lantern flared above the same house as rupert had entered before and at the door stood a small figure it was the chinese boy dressed in red ah said rupert significantly hwei is certainly here as well as tungyu well have trouble if hwei tries to kill me ill shoot said the major and produced a neat revolver ive held my life in my hands before now rupert was about to speak to the boy who stood silently before the closed door when he heard a long agonised scream within the house the boy smiled in a cruel manner and rupert tried to dash past but the boy prevented him tidman however was more fortunate and flung himself against the door evidently a tragedy was taking place inside as the major ran forward the door opened suddenly and burgh dashed out and down the street towards the river after him came tungyu his face alive with fury tidman gave a shout and made after the two but rupert wondering who was being killed sprang down the passage and entered the room where formerly he had met with the adventure a tall chinaman was standing in the middle of the floor wiping a knife on his blouse he turned and rupert beheld hwei the chinaman pointed to the floor with a ghastly smile the doom of the god kwangho said he and ran out of the house swiftly rupert cast his eyes on a body lying on the floor it was that of a woman and from her breast a stream of blood was flowing she was not yet dead but looked up with a paindrawn face ainsleigh drew back with an exclamation it was miss pewsey chapter xxiii the chase rupert stared at the wounded woman amazed how came miss pewsey into this den he was so astonished that he forgot to call for assistance miss pewsey gave a moan and opened her eyes at once she recognised ainsleigh for the light from the tasselled lantern overhead fell full on his amazed face so you are safe said miss pewsey with difficulty didnt tungyu kill you i have just arrived said rupert your nephew has gone out followed by tungyu i hope hell catch him muttered miss pewsey tungyu stabbed me clarence snatched the papers and ran away leaving me here to die how did you get the papers asked rupert startled i got them from clarencehe asked me to come up here andoh she fell back insensible rupert thought she was dead and forgetting where he was cried loudly for assistance he heard footsteps approaching and lokeong in sober attired entered the stately chinaman was roused out of his usual self he appeared disturbed and his face was distorted rodgers and his men are chasing tungyu said lokeong grasping ruperts arm go after them tungyu has the papers but miss pewsey lokeong started back that woman he cried as startled as rupert had been pooh let her die she deserves her fate she has been the cause of the trouble gogo mr ainsleighgo after tungyu but miss pewsey repeated rupert seeing the woman open her eyes and recognising that life yet remained ill see to her ill get a doctor lokeong struck the gong near the door but get me those papers all my life depends upon them rememberone hundred thousand poundsgogo it may be too late dont allow tungyu to escape rupert was quite bewildered as the chinaman pushed him out of the door then recognising that he could do nothing to help miss pewsey and that lokeong for his own sake would do all he could to keep her alive so that he might learn how the packet came into her possession rupert ran out of the house and found the street filled with screaming chinamen and chattering europeans some policemen were coming down the alley from the main thoroughfare and everyone appeared to be alarmed the ragged mob rushed into various doors at the sight of the officers but the chinamen still continued to cackle and scream suddenly rupert heard a revolver shot and wondered if the major had got into trouble remembering that burgh with tungyu in pursuit had gone down the alley towards the water he raced in the same direction and at once two policemen seeing him go followed there was no time to undeceive them so rupert ran on eager to come up with burgh he had the papers according to miss pewsey and in spite of lokeongs statement ainsleigh suspected that miss pewsey was right else tungyu would not be in pursuit of the buccaneers as rupert tore down the moonlit alley he heard the high clear voice of the mandarin calling on the police to stop then the tumult recommenced it mattered little to ainsleigh as he raced blindly on he felt a thrill of joy in his veins it seemed to him that he had never lived before and that this manhunt was the climax of life at the end of the alley he came on a dilapidated wharf which ran out into the turbid water and saw a stout figure dancing on this at once he hurried down to find major tidman who recognised him at once there was a boat waiting gasped the major seizing ruperts arm burgh jumped into it and pushed off tungyu came after and as the boat was already in midstream he plunged into the water where is hwei rodgers and his men are after him i fired a shot and i believe i hit tungyu as he was swimming who has the papers burgh keep a look out for him ill run along the bank and before the major could expostulate ainsleigh dashed up the wharf and ran along the bank of the river he did this because his quick eye had seen a black head bobbing in the water below the wharf the swimmer was evidently making for the near shore rupert did not know if it was tungyu or hwei but hurried at top speed along the bank in the hope of catching the man when he came ashore he sped along a kind of narrow way for here the old houses of rotherhithe came down almost to the waters edge there were lights in some of the windows but for the most part these were in darkness to ruperts left loomed the house and on his right was the river bank shelving down to the glittering water a few piles ran out into the stream and as the river was low there were acres of evilsmelling mud the man was making for the bank and battling hard against the stream which was sweeping him down rupert shouted and seeing him on the bank the swimmer seemed to stop apparently dreading the reception he would get finally he resumed his stroke and made for a wharf some distance down ainsleigh ran for this but was stopped by a wooden fence he managed to climb over and raced on to the wharf but the swimmer was nowhere to be seen suddenly rupert caught sight of a figure crawling up the bank a little distance below and again ran up the wharf to the pathway the man who had landed caught sight of him and leaping on to the hard path ran along the river bank but in a swaying manner as though his powers of endurance were exhausted considering how hard he had battled with the current probably the mans strength had given out and rupert feeling fresh and fit thought he would have no difficulty in catching up but the man ran hard and then dropped out of sight below the bank apparently he had taken to the river again rupert raced down so quickly as to overshoot the mark where the man had slipped down while looking round he caught sight of him again he ran up the bank and dodged into a narrow side street rupert was after him in a moment the man had vanished round a cornerso ainsleigh thoughtbut when rupert came after he saw the street in the moonlight was perfectly empty and turned back the fugitive had tricked him by dodging into a dark corner and was again on the bank he leaped on the wharf and scrambled down the piles to a boat which swung at the end of a long rope while he hauled this in painfully and pantingly rupert leaped on him the man looked up with an oath and closed with his pursuer it was burgh the papersthe papers gasped rupert you give them up ill kill you first said burgh setting his teeth and exhausted as he was he struggled with preternatural strength the two men swung and swayed on the edge of the wharf till burgh tripped up his opponent and both fell into the water rupert still held his grip and felt the body of burgh grow heavy he rose to the surface dragging at the buccaneer and as the two had fallen into shallow water rupert staggered on to the evilsmelling mud he was obliged to let go burgh who apparently had been playing possum for he rose to his feet and made a feeble attempt to climb the bank seeing this rupert who was almost exhausted himself with the long pursuit and the cold doche struck out and burgh with a cry of rage fell flat into the mud the next moment rupert was kneeling on his chest the papers you scoundrel he said between his teeth havent got them tungyu you lie give me those papers or ill tear your clothes off to find them burgh tried to utter a taunting laugh but the effort was too much for his strength he stopped suddenly and with a sob closed his eyes the body became inert and as rupert could see no wound he concluded that the buccaneer had fainted at once he removed his knee and began his search he went deliberately through the pockets of the insensible man and finally came across a packet bound in red brocade it was in burghs breast next to the skin rupert with this in his hand rose with a gasp of relief he had the papers after all and now could hope to get the money from the mandarin he slipped the important packet into his pocket and then producing a flask of brandy he forced a few drops between the clenched teeth of his antagonist he did not wish the man to die and moreover he was desirous of questioning him in a few moments burgh opened his eyes you he said as soon as he recovered his scattered senses and he made an effort to rise no you dont said rupert pushing him back youll try and reach for your revolver go slow muttered burgh lying on his back in the mud i give in ainsleigh youve won ive got the papers if thats what you mean they shall be given to lokeong and youll get the five thousand ill get one hundred thousand said rupert keeping a watchful eye on his late opponent huh said burgh with a groan what luck and all i have got is a ducking let me up and give me some more brandy remember i saved your life from forge ainsleigh quite so and you tried to kill me just now said rupert dryly i think we are quits however heres the brandy and you can sit up no treachery mind or ill shoot you and rupert pulled out his derringer the buccaneer gave a grunt and sat up with an effort im not up to a row he gasped theres no fight left in me great scott to think i was so near success ill be poor for the rest of my life i guess youll be hanged for the murder of miss wharf you mean burgh took a deep draught of the brandy which put new life into his veins he actually grinned when he took the flask from his lips i reckon thats not my end said he i never killed the old girl no sirnot such a flat then who did kill her find out was the ungracious response see here burgh said rupert swinging himself on to a pile of the wharf i mean to get to the bottom of this business once and for all the papers shall be given to the marquis and then i hope we shall hear the last of this fan business but i must know who killed therethere said burgh with a shrug and after another drink i cave in youve got the bulge on me but i guess if you want to keep those papers youd best clear out tungyu will be along soon looking for them i leaped into a boat and pushed out but that chinese devil swam after and when i got into trouble with the oars he climbed on board with a long knife i jumped overboard and made for the bank where you raced me down but i guess tungyu will bring that craft of his ashore and hes hunting for me like a dog as he is rodgers and hwei and lokeong and a lot of policemen are hunting for tungyu said rupert coolly so you need give yourself no further trouble tell me why you killed miss wharf i didnt confound you growled burgh then you know who did yesit was forge thats a lie forge wrote to my wife and denied that you gave him the tie then tidman killed the old girl no he was with me on the beach come now you shant get off in this way tell me who is guilty if i do will you let me go i make no bargains out with it burgh looked black but being tired out and at the mercy of ruperts revolver he growled sulkily it was aunt lavinia miss pewseythat frail little womanimpossible frail echoed the buccaneer with scorn shes as tough as hickory and as wicked a little devil as ever breathed why she learned about the fan from forge when he was delirious and gave away the show to lokeong in china i know that and she wished olivia to have the fan that she might be killed thats so you bet but old wharf got it and so was killed but not by tungyu or hwei no burgh took a final drink and having emptied the flask flung it into the river then he took out a cigarette which was dry enough to light when smoking he began to laugh well this is a rum show said he i guess youve got all the fun im sold proper tell me your story said rupert imperatively i want to get back to penters alley to see your aunt oh i guess shes a goner by this time said burgh easily tungyu knifed her you mean hwei i found him wiping the knife no tungyu stuck her and dropped the knife aunty was just passing the packet to hwei when tungyu stabbed her i reckon he intended to grab the packet but i was too sharp for him and caught it away from his hand then i raced out and he after me hwei stayed behind to clean the knife i reckon no he followed you two almost immediately then both chinamen will be here soon youd best cut not till i learn the truth ive told you the truth snapped burgh in a weary voice my old aunt strangled miss wharf yes aunty told me of the tie and asked me to get it for her i didnt know what she wanted to do with it so i did i took it out of your pocket when dalham was out of the room then i gave it to aunty she told miss wharf that tungyu wanted to see her on the steps after eleven miss wharf went there and then aunty followed and sat down beside her on the steps i guess she kept her in talk and then slipped the tie round her old throat and pulled with all her might and shes strong i can tell you added clarence confidentially she nearly broke my arm one day twisting it miss wharf hadnt time to call out and was a deader in two minutes for aunty froze on to her like death death indeed murmured rupert with a shudder well then aunty bucked up round by the front of the hotel with the fan in her pocket and left the tie round the neck of the old girl so that you might hang all went well but the next day i went to aunty and asked for the fan she was very sick as she intended to sell it that day to tungyu but tungyu had cut along with hwei in the yacht both thinking they might be accused of the murder they thought that old tidman did the biznai grinned burgh and i let them think so having my own game to play with aunty well said ainsleigh shortly and what did you do i told aunty id split if i didnt get the fan so she passed it along to me then i learned about the secret from tungyuthe waving in the smoke you know i found out the kind of smoke from forge and repaid him by a lying accusation thats so said burgh coolly there aint no flies on me but lets heave ahead its cold sitting here go on then said ainsleigh sharply well i learned about the picture and guessed about the abbey the picture was plain enough i came that day you found me to see the place and stole the packet then no i waited till night and rigged myself up as the abbot i knew it would make anyone sick who saw a monk about at that hour not me said ainsleigh if i had caught you well you very nearly did confessed burgh candidly i came at night and climbed all four trees before i nipped the box then i prized it open and climbed down leaving the box so that lokeong might get sold when he came to look just as i got down that old housekeeper of yours screeched and cut i was startled and dropped the fan not wishing to leave that behind i began to look for it then you and the butler turned up and i lighted out sharp what happened next well i wanted the money but not knowing the days of hwei and tungyu thought i might get stabbed instead of the money so i took the packet to aunty and asked her to go up telling her tungyu would give her the money she fell into the trap but she knew that hwei it wasnt hweis day said burgh at least it turned out so though i didnt know it at the time and so sent on aunty to get the cash i intended to pull the dollars out of her when she did get them or leave her to die if hwei knifed her you blackguard go slow said burgh coolly aunty was no friend to you i say do you know why aunty wanted me to marry olivia it was because im married already and if he got no further rupert knocked him backwards into the mud burgh leaped to his feet and suddenly cried look behind rupert did so very foolishly and burgh flung himself forward but all the same burgh was right to warn ainsleigh a man was staggering along the wharf he was in chinese dress knife him tungyu cried burgh struggling with rupert ill hold him hes got the papers the chinaman gave a screech and hurled himself on the pair rupert wrenched himself away from burgh and struck out at tungyu at the same moment he heard another cry and hwei came leaping down the wharf before tungyu could turn his enemy was on him and as rupert was again closing in death grips with burgh he had no time to see what was taking place he could hear the chinamen snarling like angry cats on the wharf and was himself fighting in the mud with burgh for his life luckily rupert got his hand free and it was the one which held the revolver he fired at randomthree shots there was a shout in the distance but at that moment the buccaneer seized him by the throat and threw him down rupert with a strangled cry felt himself being forced beneath the water and thought the end had come he could hear the struggle between hwei and tungyu going on furiously and hear also very faintly the deep laughter of his opponent then he lost consciousness everything became dark and ruperts last thought was that all his pains had been in vain he would die and olivia would be a widow chapter xxiv the fulfilled prophecy when rupert came to his senses the surroundings seemed to be familiar he had lost consciousness on the banks of the thames and during a fierce struggle with a treacherous foe he opened his eyes to find himself in his own bed in his own room at royabay but he felt strangely weak and indisposed to talk after a glance he closed his eyes again then after what seemed to him to be a few minutesit was really half an hourhe opened them again and this time he saw olivia bending over him with an anxious face dearest he murmured weakly oh rupert do you know me yes where am iwhat are you doing here you are at the abbey dont speak take this and some beef tea was held to his dry lips ainsleigh drank a little and then fell asleep again when he did so there was an artificial light in the room but when he woke the sun was streaming in through the window but his wife was still beside his bed and still looked anxious however she gave a little cry of joy when rupert spoke in a stronger voice he was beginning to collect his scattered senses have i been ill long he asked four days she replied dont talk darling but the packet the marquis has it safe burgh he has escaped dont talk miss pewsey said rupert faintly she is dead then miss pewsey did strangle your aunt yesyesthe doctor says you are not to talk just one more question those chinamen hwei and tungyu they were drowned rupert smiled weakly and turning on his side went off into a deep sleep the doctor who called later said it was the best thing he could do he has had a severe shock said he to olivia and his nervous system is shaken you may be thankful he did not wake with a disordered brain oh doctor you dont think no no its all right he would not have asked those questions if anything was wrong with his mind in a few weeks he will be quite himself but i think mrs ainsleigh that you should take him abroad for a time olivia gladly promised to do this the more so as she wanted to escape herself from marport for a time the news of miss pewseys death had caused a great sensation and a still greater one was caused by the publication in the paper of her crime everyone now knew that the bitter little woman had strangled miss wharf and everyone was very severe on her the funeral had to be conducted quietly as the mob showed signs of intending to interrupt however the police kept back the irate crowd and miss pewsey was buried in a quiet corner of st peters churchyard where a few weeks before she had hoped to be married but her intended bridegroom was in america and miss pewseys mortal part was in the grave where her immortal soul was and what would become of it was talked over by people who were less forgiving than they ought to have been ainsleigh recovered his strength quicker then the doctor thought he would olivia nursed him with devoted tenderness and often wept as she thought how nearly she had lost him when rupert was better able to hear the recital she gave him a short account of his rescue those three shots you fired brought up rodgers and his men who were searching for hwei and tungyu they came just in time to pull mr burgh off you he was holding you down under the water and mr rodgers thought you were dead however the doctor was called and they brought you round then i was telegraphed for and i insisted that you should be taken back to royabay i had my way although the doctor in london said it would be dangerous so here you are darling in your own home and soon will be all right thanks to your nursing said ainsleigh kissing her but olivia tell me about miss pewsey she made a confession before she died said mrs ainsleigh oh rupert even though she is dead i cant help saying that she was a wicked little woman wicked indeed said rupert recalling what burgh had said she wished you to marry burgh because he was married already in which case he would have deserted me said mrs ainsleigh with a crimson face he was as bad as she but listen rupert if you feel strong enough go on said ainsleigh and held his wifes hand while she talked well then began mrs ainsleigh after the marquis pushed you out of the penters alley room he went and got a doctor who said that miss pewsey was dying she heard him having regained her senses and then began to cry saying how wicked she had been for the sake of everyone lokeong asked her to make a confession as soon as she knew there was no hope of her recovery she agreed to do so a clergyman was called in and he took down what she said the confession was witnessed and signed and mr rodgers has it what did she confess asked rupert oh olivia covered her face it was really awful she said that she was always jealous of aunt sophia and of me she wished to get the five hundred a year at first she thought she would get it by marrying me to her nephew and then she could finger the money when my aunt died but she soon saw that i was not to be guided in the way she desired and cast about for a new plan but olivia if she knew burgh was married oh that didnt matter to her she intended he should marry me and then if i got the money she intended to say there was no marriage unless i gave her the five hundred a year she wished to disgrace me a kind of blackmail in fact yes but i cant understand how she intended to reckon with mr burgh who is not an easy person to deal with well rupert when she found that i would not marry mr burgh she tried to get a new will made she did not succeed for a long time meanwhile she heard about the fan and wrote to lokeong when she saw the advertisement she was alarmed thinking aunt sophia would be killed before the new will was made luckily for her she overheard about our secret marriage and told aunt sophia who made a new will and who intended after the ball to turn me out of the house but your aunt was so kind to you at that time so as to make things harder for me said olivia sadly poor aunt sophia she was quite under the thumb of miss pewsey who really did hypnotise herat least she confessed she had power over her in the confession but i dont think it was difficult to get aunt sophia to alter her will seeing she hated you so and could not bear to think that the five hundred a year should go to the son of the man she thought had scorned her that was not true my father yes yes i know dont talk too much rupert you are weak yet but let me go on added olivia passing her hand over her husbands forehead well then when the new will was made miss pewsey let tungyu know that aunt sophia would have the fan at the ball she didnt know whether tungyu or hwei was to kill the possessor of the fan and when she learned that aunt sophia was to sell the fan next day she was very angry why with her influence she could have got the money not all to herself and besides she wanted the five hundred a year and aunt sophia out of the way moreover that scarf i knitted for you gave her a chance of throwing the blame on you she got clarence to get it and then lured miss wharfmy auntto the steps where she strangled her yes burgh told me i know the rest her nephew made her give up the fan learned the secret and stole the packet then he made his aunt take it to penters alley olivia nodded and miss pewsey thought she would get the money as burgh said it was tungyus hour so it was he spoke truly enough although he didnt risk giving up the packet himself well but tungyu killed miss pewsey after all she asked twenty thousand pounds and refused to give it for less clarence burgh who had come up with her came into the room with hwei who saw the packet pass but could not interfere because it wasnt his hour yes and all would have been well had not tungyu suddenly disobeyed the god kwanghos commands and stabbed miss pewsey of course hwei was released from his oath by this act and tried to get the packet but clarence burgh snatched it from both and ran away tungyu went after him and then hwei followed after wiping the knife then i know the rest i got the packet from burgh yes and he tried to drown you hwei and tungyu were struggling together as tungyu wanted to get the packet from you but hwei stabbed him with the same knife he had used to kill miss pewsey and in his death grip tungyu drew hwei into the water both were dead and still locked in each others embrace when they were drawn out lokeong said that tungyu deserved his doom for having trifled with kwangho but he mourns for hwei it seems to be much of a muchness said rupert and burgh rodgers threw himself on him and he was secured you were taken away and i was telegraphed for but while burgh was being taken to prison he contrived to escape and got away in the darkness but olivia it was a bright moonlight night at first it was but the moon set and darkness came on the police have been searching for burgh but he has not been found and it is supposed he has got away from england i hope so said rupert with a shudder i never wish to set eyes on him again so thats the end of it all not quite lokeong is in the library with mr asher oh rupert you must prepare yourself for the best of news the young man rose and was led downstairs by his wife i am quite ready to hear the good news he said as they descended i have had far too much bad news in my life as olivia said the lawyer was waiting in the library and stood before the fire with an expectant face lokeong in even more gorgeous robes than he had worn on the occasion of his first visit was seated in his stately manner near the window he rose as the master of royabay entered and came forward with a serious smile my young friend said the mandarin i have to thank you for saving my life the papers which would have ruined me and which would have cost me my head have been burnt hwei is dead and tungyu so no one but yourself knows what those papers meant my august mistress will never have proof that i was engaged in the boxer rebellion and hop sing will be degraded for ever and you marquis i shall receive the yellow jacket said the mandarin proudly now i remain but a short time here i go to london in an hour and this evening i leave for the continent on my way to china we shall never meet again mr ainsleigh unless you come to pekin no said olivia instinctively protecting rupert we have had enough of china marquis sit down rupert ainsleigh took a chair and the marquis smiled blandly well well well he said it is natural you should feel rather nervous of my countrymen though i assure you if you do visit me that you will be quite safe and highly honoured no thank you marquis said rupert wearily for he was beginning to feel fatigued i see you are tired said lokeong in his stately manner sol will merely say i hope to send you some presents from my own country and then mr asher can speak he bowed to the solicitor i am glad to tell mr ainsleigh said the lawyer that the marquis has handed me securities which show that the sum of one hundred thousand pounds is invested in your name we can transfer the securities to english investments if you like but ill leave them in chinese said rupert quickly lokeong bowed in a gratified manner you will be wise he said they are safe investments and all my interest at the imperial court will go to make you richer if i can you have done enough marquis said ainsleigh gratefully you have given me back my old home and we will be rich besides said olivia delightedly theres another thing said mr asher looking at the girl miss pewsey made a will in your favour mrs ainsleigh olivia drew back with a red face impossible she hated me well said asher dryly i expect she repented of her evil deeds or perhaps she hated her nephew more than she did you that gentleman wrote from a continental address to mr paster asking if his aunt had left him the money as she promised i expect the address is a false one as mr burgh wont wish to be caught he is a bold man that said lokeong he is assented asher but he wont benefit mrs ainsleigh gets the five hundred a year the freehold of ivy lodge and also the mortgage which miss wharf bought to ruin mr ainsleigh we have everythingeverything cried olivia i am very thankful said rupert mr asher ill see you about the investments when you are stronger said the lawyer meanwhile here is the carriage at the door the marquis is kind enough to give me a lift and mr asher took his leave with a profound bow to so opulent a client as rupert the marquis lokeong came forward with his kind smile before i wish you goodbye and all happiness he said holding out the famous fan will you take this no said olivia preventing rupert from accepting it i hate the very sight of the thing it has blood on it i think you are right mrs ainsleigh said the chinaman gravely and as it has done its duty it may as well go the way of the packet which now is ashes and advancing to the fire he flung the fan on the burning coals it burst into a blaze and in a few minutes all had vanished save the slivers of jade and the beads the housemaid collected these next morning and gave them to olivia who threw them off the marport pier so that was the end of the mandarins fan and now said lokeong bowing goodbye and great happiness to you both rupert and olivia shook hands warmly and thanked him heartily the mandarin walked out of the room in his stately way and they went to the window to see him drive off at the bend of the avenue he waved his hand graciously and that was the last the master and mistress of royabay saw of the man who had owned the fan a chuckle at the door made the couple turn from the window there peering in stood mrs petley who had stuck with her husband to rupert during his troubles her face was shining and old john seemed to be years younger mrs petley for some queer reason threw a shoe at the pair health and happiness she said begging your pardons both but to think of money and happiness and no walking of that blessed monk who he never walked said rupert smiling it was hwei begging your pardon sir hweiwhosoever he is didnt walk all the time abbot raoul did appear as i can testify and so can john here but now the prophecy has been fulfilled perhaps hell rest quiet in his grave drat him the prophecy said olivia who was holding her husbands hand from behind mrs petley came the quavering voice of the ancient butler declaiming the rude rhymes my curse from the tyrants will never depart for a sword in the hands of the angel flashes till ainsleigh poor weds the poor maid of his heart and gold be brought forth from the holy ashes and thats quite true said a jovial voice and major tidman as smart and stout as ever entered how do ainsleigh im glad to see you looking so well yes he added sitting down you were poor ainsleigh when you married and i was poor also cried olivia very good the third line is fulfilled and the fourth was gold brought forth from the holy ashes asked rupert yes master rupert said old john you picked up the fan in the place where the ashes were and out of the fan has come gold the prophecy is fulfilled sure enough and i hope abbot raoul will stop walking for ever of course he will cried mrs petley dragging her husband outside theres no more trouble for you master rupert and miss olivia mr and mrs ainsleigh of royabay said tidman laughing give them their proper titles mrs petley and i think the present occasion deserves a bottle of port the ancient butler went away with his wife to bring forth one of the last bottles of that priceless vintage major tidman gloating in anticipation sat still and smiled with a bland face but rupert drew olivia to the sofa and they sat down where they had often mourned on many a weary day dearest said ainsleigh kissing her we can be happy now said olivia putting her arms round his neck for we are rich we shall take again our proper place in the county we are rich and we are happy echoed the master of royabay ha ha you have one hundred thousand pounds ainsleigh said tidman i have something better whats that my own dear wife olivia ainsleigh the end the anchor press ltd tiptree heath kelvedon essex
