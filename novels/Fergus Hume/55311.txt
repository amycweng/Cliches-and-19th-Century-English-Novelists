silver moon shining serenely in a cloudless sky and over the glittering expanse of ocean steamed the p and os vessel neptune on her way from brindisi to malta every revolution of her powerful engines sent her plunging through the blue waters with the waves breaking in tumbling masses of white foam from her towering sides the passengers numbering about three hundred were all in high spirits having had a most delightful voyage from australia and were looking forward with pleasure to their arrival at valletta on the morrow can there be anything in the world more pleasant than sea life on a steamship with jolly people anyone who is a good sailor will answer no though perhaps ulysses who travelled over these same waters might not agree but then the wandering greek had not a p and o steamer at his command on this charming night a dance was in progress on the hurricane deck and the immense area had been draped with brilliantly coloured flags thus turning it into an admirable ballroom miss kate lester the belle of the shipa position she knew she occupied and by the way took full advantage of all benefits to be derived therefromwas the pianist and was playing the venetia valse to which a number of young people were dancing the white dresses of the ladies the darker costumes of the men and the vivid tints of the flags all seen under the powerful radiance of the electric lights made up a very pretty picture ronald monteith thought so at all eventsand mr monteith was a very good judge of beauty especially if it were feminine he leaned lazily against the bulwarks and surveyed the festive scene with a smile on his handsome face butjoseph liketook no notice of the many glances he received from bright eyes tall and sinewy with fair hair and mustaches blue eyes and a skin bronzed by exposure to the hot southern sun monteith was decidedly goodlooking and by no means undervalued his personal appearance his father was a wealthy australian squatter who owned large stations in the riverina district and being a liberalminded and liberalhanded man had sent his son forth to see the world master ronald nothing loth departed with a goodly supply of money several letters of introduction and a huge capacity of enjoyment so as can easily be seen this lucky young mans lines were cast in pleasant places there were lots of pretty girls on board who would have liked to marry him nevertheless his highness threw his handkerchief to none of them yet flirted with all he was not a clever man by any means but he could ride shoot swim and box to perfection all of which athletic accomplishments found favour in the eyes of women he was moreover an honourable gentleman with a kind heart and a generous spirit as he stood there in a meditative attitude wondering if he could summon up sufficient courage to dance with the thermometer at somewhere about eighty a young fellow who rejoiced in the name of patrick ryan came up and took him by the arm come and have a drink me boy said mr ryan with a slight touch of the brogue im half dead with dancin not to mention the way ive to talk to the girls and tell em enough lies to make me recordin angel take to shorthand then why the deuce dont you stop it retorted ronald as he accepted this bacchanalian invitation and they went down to the bar oh begad think how the girls would tear their hair and mine too if i didnt look after them replied pat its purely ornamental ye are but tis better to be good than beautiful and a mighty poor consolation anyhow pat ryan was certainly not beautiful being short and dark but his lack of good looks was more than made up by the possession of a clever tongue which was generally going from morning till night and as he could sing play write verses and flatter a woman to perfection he was a great favourite on board well im off to the halls of dazzlin light he observed when they had finished their drinks and were once more on deck come along ye lazy divil and ill get you a partner im too hot objected ronald putting his hands in his pockets oh jist hear him said pat in disgust why ive seen ye all day in the saddle under a burnin sun and divil a growl from ye and yet when i offer ye a pretty girl to dance with ye refuse and as for the girl begad her beauty would tempt st anthony himself and small blame to him who is she asked the australian with some show of interest miss lester no less i thought you were sweet there yourself pat im sweet on all the girls me boytheres safety in numbers and i believe in quantity as well as quality youre getting too deep for me said ronald pulling a very black pipe from his pocket so ill go and have a smoke a pipe too echoed pat faith its womans greatest enemy and mans greatest friend retorted monteith as he strolled off pat laughing went away to arrange another dance and to this end asked mrs pellypop to play the lancers mrs pellypop tall majestic and aggressively virtuous was the motherinlaw of a bishop and was on her way home to pay her daughter a visit an event regarded by the worthy prelate with anything but unmixed joy she had an eyeglassvery effective to crush presuming peoplea chilling smile and very strong opinions about her own position in short she was a type of all that was virtuous anddisagreeable while the dancing was thus going on ronald having lighted his pipe strolled up and down the long deck for a few minutes then leaned meditatively over the side and watched the glittering waters sweeping past while thus engaged he felt a light touch on his arm and on turning round saw a man he knew standing near him hullo ventin said ronald removing his beloved pipe for a moment why arent you dancing because i hate dancing retorted mr ventin irritably im sick of the perpetual jangle of that dd piano of miss lesters flirtations and of mother pellypops virtuesim sick of the whole thing and i wish the voyage were over i dont replied ronald taking a seat on one of the deck chairs its very jolly i think yes i daresay said ventin gloomily you are young and rich with all the world before you i on the contrary am old rubbish if not in years at least in experience i have lost all my illusions and have discovered the gold of fancy to be only the tinsel of reality you stand on the threshold of a happy career i can only look back on a ruined life ronald looked at him curiously as he spoke a handsome face certainly but with innumerable wrinkles and hollow cheeks dark piercing restless eyes black smooth hair touched with white at the temples and a thinlipped mouth with a heavy dark mustache yes lionel ventin was handsome but one whom a woman would rather fear than admire for the rest a slender figure highbred manner and in general a cool nonchalant demeanour which but ill accorded with the restless glances of his eyes on this particular night ronald had been introduced to him in melbourne a year previously and then lost sight of him never expecting to set eyes on him again but the first person he met on board the neptune was ventin and a strong friendship soon sprung up between them which seemed quite unaccountable considering the difference in their dispositions but the fact was ventin liked ronalds happy pleasant manner and on his part monteith felt for the other that strong admiration which a young man always has for one who is older and knows more about the world than himself ventin had been everywhere and seen everything he had shot big game in the rocky mountains hunted elephants in africa and tigers in india knew london paris and vienna thoroughly and when he chose to exert himself could be a most delightful companion tonight however he seemed restless and ill at ease which rather surprised ronald accustomed as he was to the cool careless manner of his friend i dont know why the deuce i should trust you said ventin sitting down near ronald and eyeing him keenly we are only fellowtravellers and i am not usually given to confidences but occasionally it does a man good to open his heart to someone fire away old boy said ronald puffing out a big cloud of smoke and settling himself comfortably in his chair you look like a man with a history happy the nation that has no history quoted ventin cynically i suppose the same remark applies to a mans life my history begins in that accursed malta for it was there i met her oh a woman of course most mens histories commence and end with a woman that is why confidences are so monotonous well turning restlessly in his seat i may as well say ventin is not my real name noit iswell i need not tell you my real name as it is quite unnecessary i didnt do much credit to it when i had it and i daresay my present name is not quite blameless bah why do i sentimentalize forty years of life ought to have knocked all that out of me youre not forty said ronald looking curiously at him why asked ventin quickly turning his haggard face towards the australian do you think these wrinkles due to age or dissipationto both im afraid though i suspect the latter has had more to do with them than the former god made man in his own image he cant be very delighted when he sees how hard we strive to mar his handiwork there was silence for a few minutes and the two men could hear the regular beating of the screw the fitful sound of music mellowed by distance and the gay laughter of the dancers the voices of the whist players disputing over some point in their game came from the smokingroom and in the semidarkness extending along the deck could be heard the soft notes of a womans voice or the deeper tones from a man then ventin began to speak in slow measured tones quite different from his former vehement style i was never a good young man he said cynically but i dont think i was worse than the generality of fellows give a boy money and place him amid the temptations of london and in nine cases out of ten hell go to the devil or if he doesnt go it is because some lucky accident prevents him perhaps he has a manoftheworld friend who advises himor he loses his money and has to leave the primrose pathor he may marry a good woman and her influence may save him from his worst enemy himself ah if we only knew the value of a good womans lovehow she can be our guardian angel and keep us pure and honourable in the midst of temptation but we never find out the value of such treasures till its too latebut therewith a weary sighi am sentimentalizing again let me go on with my story i lost both parents at the age of twenty and i went to london with plenty of money and no experience whatever unluckily i had no one to play the part of mentor to my telemachus so i had to gain wisdom by experience and pretty dearly i paid for it i became a hard cynical man of the world for a thirteen years residence in london was a liberal education to me in the nil admirari philosophy of today and thenwell my money lasted longer than my health and i became seriously illso bad indeed that my doctors ordered me to malta to be cured oh heavens how ironical is fateit was merely a case of out of the fryingpan into the firefor my part i prefer the fryingpan it was true the balmy air and bright skies of malta cured me of one disease but unfortunately i contracted another not so easily dealt withthat of love i became acquainted with two charmingly pretty girls of the ages of twentythree and nineteen andforgive my apparent egotismboth fell in love with me it was the choice of hercules over again but unluckily i chose the wrong lady and married the elder hell has no fury like a woman scorned so the younger soon hated me like poison and left malta for england i married the woman of my choice and then my punishment commenced she was a perfect devil with nothing but her beauty to recommend her her father boasted they had arab blood in their veins and my belief is that the ancestor of the family must have been eblis himself often and often she threatened to kill me for some petty thing and i believe she would had not some instinct of danger restrained her if i looked at another woman there was a storm of reproachesif i were away for a day her jealous mind conjured up a hundred infidelitiesin short our married life was a hell upon earth at last after a year of this catanddog existence i determined to leave her and to this course she assented after a good deal of persuasion a deed of separation was drawn up by which i allowed her a handsome income on condition that she resided in valletta she agreed to this and after a stormy parting i went to england and lived there a moody discontented man you did not see the other sister asked ronald no he replied i never set eyes on her again she was a nice girl and i dare say i did treat her badly by leading her to believe i cared for her well i wandered all over the united kingdom and while staying with some friends in the highlands i met the woman who made a better man of mefor a time she was an orphan was elsie macgregor her father had been a soldier who died of consumption contracted in the trenches of sebastopol during the crimean war fair and slender with quiet blue eyes and hair like yellow corni loved her devotedlyyes too well to wrong her innocence and would have gone away in silence but she with a womans keen instinct saw there was something wrong and begged me to tell her all i did so and sheoh monteith what do you think she didleft her home and her friendsdefied the sneers of the world and the scornful looks of her own sex and became my mistress yesshe saw that hers alone was the hand that could arrest me in my downward course so to save me she ruined herself i lived with her for one happy year and always looked back to that time as the brightest era in my life then my devil of a wife found me out and instituted proceedings in the divorce court against me i did not object as i thought i would then be free to marry elsie the decree was pronounced and as soon as i was able i married elsie and took my passage with her to australiathere intending to start a new life in a new land we built castles in the air of a happy future but it was not to be for just as the ship was leaving that maltese devil came on board and then a fearful scene took place i cannot describe to you the terrible way she went on and elsie being in delicate health clung to my arm nearly fainting at last the climax came for my former wife sprang forward and struck elsie on the facethe poor girl fell in a faint on the deck and after considerable difficulty that maltese fiend was removed by force from the ship we sailed and i thought elsie would soon recover but the iron had entered into her soul and before we rounded the cape she was buried at sea here ventin covered his face with his hands and ronald respecting his emotion said nothing after a few moments of silence ventin resumed in an unsteady voice i landed in australia a brokenhearted manheedless of my life and with no hope of happiness in the future i went from australia to new zealand thence to america and travelled all over the new world trying to drown my bitter thoughts in dissipation but without success i went in for gambling drinking racing threw away money on women kept a theatre in fact did everything i could to ruin myself then wearied of the reckless life i was leading i went back to australia and tried to settle down but it was no use like orestes pursued by the furies i had to fly so i took my passage on board the neptune and thus here you find me a ruined cynic at the age of forty and all through a woman and what do you intend to do when you reach england asked ronald who had been listening with the deepest interest england murmured ventin dreamily perhaps i may never see england what do you mean asked the australian a little startled as the thought of suicide flashed across his mind no not that replied ventin guessing his thoughts but when i was in australia i received a letter from my first wife saying she would kill me the first time we met she would never dare oh yes she wouldshe has arab blood in her veins remember and when she is mad with rage she would put a knife in me and take the consequences but are you sure the letter was from her who else could it be from said ventin shrugging his shoulders it was not signed and the handwriting was slightly different from her usual style but then she often threatened to kill me and ive no doubt puts into writing what she often said you have no enemies none that would go so far as to desire my death no my friend the letter was from the charming maltese and shell carry out her purpose if she can is she in valletta i dont know if she is and find me out welli may reach england alive but i doubt it and after all i dont think id care much im sick of life and if one could be only certain that death is an eternal sleepwell with a sneer i think id be inclined for the nap but come rising to his feet ive bored you enough for one night let us go into the smokingroom and have one pipe before turning in ronald assented and walked slowly after ventin wondering at the strange story he had heard and at the strange man who told it to him hes had a queer life mused monteith as they stepped into the smokingroom i wonder if his end will be as queer the dance being over all the ladies had gone below the electric lights were out in the saloon and on deck and only the smokingroom was lighted up for the benefit of the nightbirds here they all came flushed and excited with their exercise and soon all the marbletopped tables were covered with glasses containing different beverages from whiskyandsoda down to a modest squash while the atmosphere resembled nothing so much as a london fog ventin had recovered his spirits and told stories made epigrams and sang songs until ronald could hardly believe he saw before him the same man who had told him such a pitiful story ventin saw his friends eyes directed curiously at him once or twice and guessing the meaning of his looks came up to him to say goodnight ive put on the cap and bells you see he said cynically broken hearts are not in favour with the world and life is only a masquerade after all chapter ii in the strada reale tunisians maltese english italians was there ever such a motley crowd as that collected in the principal street of valletta barekneed highlanders in their picturesque tartans elbowed widetrousered mahomedans from tunis and fez swarthy blackeyed italians from naples jostled against redcoated tommy atkins as he swaggered along and the ascetic face of a priest looking severely from under his long shovel hat was seen close to the piquant countenance of a maltese damsel blushing under her ugly black silk hood as she tripped gaily onward attended by her watchful duenna here and there parties of tourists came laughing and joking along the crowded pavement english ladies lithe and brightlooking in their neatfitting yachting costumes accompanied by smart young gentlemen who had left their clubs and offices for a breath of the invigorating mediterranean air and crowds of ragged beggars were shrieking for money and never satisfied with what they got such a mass of colour such a diversity of costumes such a confusion of tongues and over all the clear blue sky with the hot sun blazing down on the tall white houses and steep narrow streets the neptune cast anchor about two oclock in the afternoon and according to the notice posted at the top of the saloon stairs would not leave till nine oclock at night so all the passengersthe men in flannels and straw hats and the ladies in white dresses with sunshadeswent on shore to enjoy themselves the great ship steamed majestically into the still blue waters of the grand harbour and cast anchor under the massive walls which rose in towering heights from the precipitous rocks and still bore on their weatherbeaten fronts which had withstood so many rude assaults the proud crests of the famous order of st john of jerusalem on each side stood the cities of valletta and the borgo with their square flatroofed houses showing white and clear as they arose in serrated masses against the vivid blue sky and all round the big steamer innumerable boats with canopies erected in the stern to keep off the sun were darting about impelled by screaming vociferating boatmen who had more conversation than clothes down the side of the ship the passengers went in a neverending stream and as boat after boat was filled with a laughing crowd and sheered off there was soon quite a procession to the shore it appeared as if the ship would be quite empty save for the crew but one at least of the passengers remained behind this was lionel ventin who preferred a lazy day on board with a pipe and novel to the discomfort of exploring the steep streets and picturesque buildings of valletta im sick of malta he said in reply to ronalds persuasions i know every hole and corner of that confounded valletta and agree with byron about it besides with a significant glance i might meet my wife against this last argument ronald had nothing to urge so went down to join his party which consisted of mrs pellypop tall and majestic in black silk kate lester and the irrepressible pat ryan as they moved off ventin who was arrayed in a suit of spotless white waved his straw hat to them how sulky that mr ventin is said miss lester as they were pulled rapidly towards the shore he never speaks to anyone shows his bad taste replied mr ryan considerin the pretty girls on board mrs pellypop froze him your remark is flippant she rejoined putting up her glasses its true for all that answered pat bravely and yell see how these foreign chaps will stare at ye today mam no woman is too old for flattery and though mrs pellypop was rigorously virtuous she was also a woman so she received pats compliment very graciously i know all about valletta she began i the deuce ye do murmured pat ye must know some nice things anyhow and continued she will be your guide the other three looked at one another in dismay and with a strong effort pat gasped out a word of thanks i say whispered ronald to miss lester shell be as bad as murrays guide book yes but not so accurate never mind said pat in a low tone answering the last remark shell make up for her mistakes by her obstinacy in stickin to em and perhaps consolingly if weve luck well lose her they arrived on the rocky shore of mount sceberras whereon valletta stands and admired the massive walls and the broad gateway at which several redcoated sentries were keeping guard numerous guides offered their services but mrs pellypop in the purest of englishof which they did not understand one word though her gestures were eloquent enoughsent them all away and marched into valletta at the head of her party of three like a victorious general into a conquered city then they began to climb the steep street leading to the strada reale and under a burning sun the exercise was not pleasant oh those interminable steps how many oaths have they not been answerable for since lord byron abused them so heartily both pat and ronald cursed under their breaths and if miss lester had not been very strictly brought up she also might have been tempted to use a word beginning with d mrs pellypop however clad in her black silkwhich must have been awfully hot but extorted no remark from that excellent womantoiled steadily upward and not a word did this indomitable female say though like the celebrated parrot she no doubt thought a lot capital exercise isnt it observed miss lester as they paused for breath i dare say if we were training for a circus retorted pat dryly taking off his straw hat im like arethusa and will melt into a stream of water if this goes on i believe old pellypop will swear shortly kate laughed and looked at mrs pellypop who unassisted was climbing slowly up the endless stairs i dont think you gentlemen are very gallant observed kate demurely glancing at pat and ronald walking on either side of her or youd offer to help the old lady we prefer to help the young lady they cried in chorus and miss lester blushed not illpleased at this tribute to her charms on reaching the strada reale they found the place already crowded with their fellowpassengers and after a few recognitions and salutations mrs pellypops party went into one of the shops where the ladies bought lace and the young men cigarettes ronald also purchased some lace handkerchiefs in order to pay off certain debts incurred by playing phillipine after dinner with sundry ladies on board and judging from the cost of his forfeits he must have found the game somewhat expensive the next thing to be done was to see the celebrated church of st john the glory of valletta so thither they went and beheld a depressinglooking building not by any means remarkable for architectural beauty but they were amply repaid for their disappointment by the magnificent sight which met their eyes on stepping out of the hot sunlight into the semigloom of the great building the arched roof covered with paintings of scenes from the life of st john the baptist the exquisite tapestries hanging low down on either side the vividly tesselated pavement under which so many valiant knights lay buried and to crown all the wonderful appearance of the grand altar glittering with goldall this made up a marvellous picture which for brilliancy of colour and harmony of effect has not its equal in the world after admiring the splendour of the central nave for some time they went into all the side chapelseach of which was dedicated to a special languageand saw the tombs of dead and gone grand masters and also the famous silver gates one of the few things on the island that napoleon did not carry away fancy how grand and inspiring it must have been observed mrs pellypop seizing the occasion to moralize as befitted the motherinlaw of a bishop when this place was thronged by noble knights all in the different dresses of their orders when yes rather jolly being a knight interrupted ronald shouldnt mind it myself i should said pat flippantly they werent allowed to marry and what is home without a mother miss lester laughed but mrs pellypop was so disgusted by the giddy way in which the young man spoke that she hastily left the church having first reflected however that there was nothing more to be seen that young man would joke at his fathers funeral she said to kate when they were once more in the hot sunshine well theres nothing like making the best of things retorted pat who was just behind and overheard the remark but really the church was grand cried ronald quickly in order to prevent a storm lots of show and very little religion i fancy said the irrepressible pat i dont agree with you mr ryan observed mrs pellypop severely the solemn grandeur of that church would have an effect even on the most frivolous mind with a significant glance at the irishman i daresay the effect wouldnt endure long said ronald lightly religion which appeals purely to the senses is never so strong as that which comes straight to the mind of course not replied pat who knew nothing about what he was talking and only spoke to irritate the old lady id back presbyterianism against catholicism any day for fanaticism its a fight between calvin and petertwo to one on the winner mrs pellypop made no reply being struck with horror at the light way in which the young man treated religion and walked hastily away with miss lester so as to close the discussion hang it pat said ronald as they walked slowly behind why cant you leave the old girl alone because she wont leave us alone retorted pat why the deuce should she come with us to spoil sport two young men and only one girl isnt sport oh begad wed have tossed for her and the loser could have made himself scarce they then went to the capuchin convent and saw the dried monks looking grim and ghastly enough in the dim light of candles carried by their living brethren pats comment on their appearance was original they look like bombay duck he said alluding to the dried fish usually eaten with curry i dont think ill touch any more of it kate lester laughed you are amusing but irreligious she said turning away irreligious certainly observed virtue in the person of mrs pellypop but amusing no i dont think the old things got much sense of humour whispered pat to ronald as they went up again into the light of day well if no one else laughs at your jokes pat you always do yourself retorted the australian consolingly but come along well go to the barraca and see the view they strolled slowly along inhaling the fresh air and going through the ruined barraca which was unroofed by one of the grand masters they stepped out on to the terrace and saw that wonderful panorama which is one of the finest things in valletta a magnificent view of the open sea the blue waters of the quarantine harbour while immediately below are the sultans garden the huge walls of fort lascaris and the fish market away in the distance can be seen fort sant elmo protecting the entrance to the port fort st angelo which is one of the oldest in malta and the angular lines of fortification standing sharp and clear against the vividly blue sky it was a gorgeous panorama and even mrs pellypop was impressed this place is impregnable she said surveying it through her glasses i dont think so said pat in a contradictory tone a few of our new guns would knock it to pieces in no time mrs pellypop deigned no reply to this flippant remark but walked off indignantly wishing that the fate he intended for valletta would befall this intrusive young man suddenly ronald uttered an exclamation by jove what pretty girls valletta its traditions its views its pleasures all vanished to nothing as he saw before him feminine beauty mrs pellypop was disgusted as she considered no man had a right to admire a woman when another was beside him this however was merely the pellypop code and not generally adopted but the two ladies who had caused ronalds exclamation fully justified his remark one was tall and slender with a dark oval face and coils of jetblack hair wreathed round her small head wonderfully dark eyes which had a sleepy look a straight delicately chiselled nose and a full red mouth she was dressed in a loose white gown with a crimson sash round her waist and instead of the ugly hoods generally worn by the maltese ladies had a saucy sailor hat on her head long sude gloves and a tall pompadour umbrella of red silk completed her costume the other was somewhat similar in appearance but evidently older and had rather a repelling expression of countenance she was dressed in black and did not show to such advantage as her companion so after a careless glance at her ronaldwho like all fair men admired dark womenturned his attention to the younger of the two they appeared to have been quarrelling and the younger girl was walking quickly a little in advance of her friend with an indignant expression on her face while the other followed more slowly with a frown on her strongly marked features when they disappeared ronald turned to his companion with a sigh yes awfully pretty i confess observed mrs pellypop slowly i do not think so ronald was discreet and surrendered i dare say not he observed hastily but you see one is so often deceived by a passing glance they wandered all over the citywent to the market and bought fruit and were warned against eating it by an officious maltesesaw the armoury in the grand masters palacestrolled round st georges square and viewed with patriotic pride the flattering inscription to british power over the main guardhousesat in the carriage of the last grand master and then went and had a light afternoon meal at a wellknown hotel it was now getting late so with a farewell glance at the strada reale and its queer crowd they went down to the watergate where they found their boat waiting a crowd of passengers was there full of excitement about bargains made and experiences gained and some guilelessly thought they had got the better of the maltese shopmen a thing quite impossible in this enlightened age they rowed to the steamer through the dark waters with the lights of the city gleaming like stars in the distance and the tall forms of ships looming like phantoms in the gloom at last after an adventurous journey they arrived on board and the first thing ronald saw was ventin leaning over the bulwarks watching fresh arrivals as soon as mrs pellypop and kate escorted by pat had gone below ronald went to ventin have you been on board all day he asked ventin shook his head no i changed my mind and went on shore shortly after you left did you see her i did the devildid she see you i think so oh so she didnt speak to you no i was afraid of a scene and came back to the ship at once well she wont come on board now said ronald consolingly so youll be all right ventin sighed nothing is so certain as the unforeseen he replied mournfully chapter iii found dead the excitement of arrival at a new place is only equalled by the excitement of departure and as the neptune was to leave at nine oclock no one thought of going to bed until the anchor was up the deck was crowded with passengers talking gaily about their adventures during the day and here and there could be seen the strange faces of new arrivals on board all round the steamer numerous boats each bearing a light were cruising about and the water looked as if covered with restless fireflies every now and then the whistle would sound in order to summon heedless passengers who had forgotten the hour of sailing a lot of people had come to see new passengers off and some were having a parting glass at the bar while others were talking together in knots on deck it was a very animated scene and ronald standing by ventin felt amused at the chatter and bustle that was going on ventin however eyed the crowd in his usual gloomy manner and ronald could not help asking him the cause of his lowering looks nothing more than common he answered carelessly ive seen all this sort of thing so often it has become drearyim bored and i detest being bored are you afraid of seeing your wife well i dont know replied ventin pulling his mustache if she thinks she can make a row she certainly will but as i am under another name she will ask for me by my real one and therefore she will be told theres no such person on board and then interrogatively oh as she saw me in valletta today she will think im stopping there and hunt everywhere for mei hope her patience will be rewardedby the way when do we start nine oclock replied ronald looking at his watch its now halfpast eight ill go to bed i think observed mr ventin holding out his hand wont you wait till we start too sleepy yawned the other well if your fellowtraveller enters later you will be awakened i daresay said ventin but ive got a whole cabin to myselfqueer you havent seen some things youd like to look at what is the number asked monteith carelessly fortythree some one pushed against ronald at that moment and he did not hear ventins answer what number did you say fortythree from ventin in a louder tone of voice look me up in the morningat present goodbye and he shook the young mans hand cordially good night you mean said ronald laughing its all the same thing replied ventin idly like kathleen mavourneenit may be for years and it may be for evergood night and he moved away slowly down the saloon steps ronald remained leaning over the bulwarks looking at the stream of people coming up and presently he was joined by pat ryan who made facetious remarks on the late arrivals how much sham jewellery have ye got chester he asked of a fair young man who came lurching up evidently having more on board than he could carry mr chester made some unintelligible reply and pat resumed oh its shampagne ye took instead its a bad pun but a heavenly truth that you bentley how many girls have you mashed today begad if your success has only been equal to your knowledge of maltese its mighty small progress yeve made ah monteith me boy thats a pretty girl in black i hope shes come on board to stop keep your wicked eyes off her ye villain or ill set mrs pellypop on to you the girl in question was neither pretty nor fascinating but pats tongue once started never knew when to stop and ronald was just going to march him off to the bar as the only way of closing his mouth when the last bell was rung and the cry of all aboard for the shore was heard a rush took place to the side and a black line of people streamed down the gangway then the ladder was lifted up the old and new passengers lined the bulwarks and sang out goodbyes to their friends in the darknessthe anchor was trippedthe whistle blew and the throb of the engines announced that the neptune was once more on her way to england i wonder if anyone is left behind said ronald to ryan as they went to the smokingroom they must be deaf if they are retorted pat that divil of a whistle would wake the deadnow me boy what is it to be whiskey and soda for me said monteith when they were comfortably established in the smokingroom through the wide doorway of which they could see the lights of valletta fading slowly away ill follow suit said pat promptly lighting his pipe two whiskeys and soda steward and not too much soda all the ladies tired with their experiences of valletta had gone to bed and the smokingroom was filled with gentlemen whose tastings of the wines of the country had made them more exhilarated than usual being convivially disposed they ordered more liquor and prepared to make a night of it wheres ventin asked pat gone to bed replied monteith knocking the ashes from his pipe the deuce he has said ryan with surprise thats unusual for him tired i suppose was the answer its a pity observed ryan regretfully he is a deuced good fellow for a song give us one yourself pat said bentley tapping his glass on the table mr ryan for a song gentlemen yes a songa songfrom all something jolly from chester who was now quite intoxicated ill sing ye killaloe said pat its got a touch of the brogue about it that will go beautifully with the whiskey so he accordingly sang killaloe to a delighted audience who joined in the chorus with bacchanalian vehemence and who gave the whoop ye divils at the end with a vigour worthy of donnybrook fair then ronald sang wrap me up in my old stable jacketthat old song which is always such a favourite and after sundry other selections had been given by gentlemen with good intentions but husky voices pat was called on to sing his favourite nigger song i love a lubly gal a pleasant voice had pat and he sang the plaintive little melody in a charmingly sympathetic manner i love a lubly gal i do and i have loved a gal or two an i know how a gal should be lubdyou bet i do ronald found himself humming it as he went to bed and then fell to sleep and dreamt the dark girl he had seen that day in valletta was the lubly gal he loved next morning they were out of sight of land afloat on the blue waters with the blue sky above them ronald was up early as he found it too hot to remain below and having had his tub and arrayed himself in his flannels he went on deck to have a smoke before the ladies put in an appearance the lascars were washing down the deck and disturbing numerous sleepers who had been taking their rest all night upstairs for the sake of coolness one of these was pat who came stumbling out of the smokingroom in his pyjama with a fur rug under one arm and a pillow under the other hullo pat said monteith laughing you look as if you were going to the pawnbroker i want to go to bed retorted pat crossly those divils in the smokingroom always commence shyin pillows in the morning and im as sleepy as rip van winkle ill have another forty winks nonsense said ronald looking at his watch its about seven go and have your bath and join me on deck all roight assented pat with a gigantic yawn i daresay cold water will wake me up and i say called out monteith as pat rolled along towards the saloon knock up ventin his cabin is no roight you are from pat as he disappeared ronald took a turn along to the end of the hurricane deck and after surveying the slumbering forms in the smokingroom walked back again just as he got to the captains cabin he saw a steward emerge therefrom with horror and alarm on his face hullo said the australian stopping short whats up oh sir gasped the steward pausing a moment mr ventin sirhes deadmurdered and he ran off to the cabin of the first officer ronald sat down on the nearest seat and let the cigarette drop from his fingers ventindeadmurdered monteith thought of the dead mans story and how he said he would never reach england alive his presentiment of evil was right after all for his wife had fulfilled her promise and killed him but she will not escape punishment thought ronald for in order to commit the crime she must have come on board the news was soon all over the ship and in a short time all the passengers were on deck the captain the first officer the doctor and the purser all went along to see the body after which the door of the cabin was locked while they deliberated over what was to be done the excitement was intense for no one doubted but that a murder had been committed though no official notice had been given and everyone was puzzling over what could have been the motive for such a crime only one man on board had a clue and this was ronald monteith who determined to tell the captain ventins strange story and then have the ship thoroughly searched to see if the maltese wife of the deceased could be discovered after breakfast when all the passengers were gathered in excited groups talking over the affair monteith went along and asking permission to see the captain on the subject told him everything while the doctor went down to make an examination of the body as the weather was very hot the corpse would have to be buried before arrival at gibraltar and captain templeton determined to hold an inquest at once a jury was chosen from the passengers and the captain acted as coroner while the witnesses were the steward who had discovered the body the doctor and ronald monteith the jury having inspected the body went into the captains cabin to hold the inquest and the proceedings were opened by a speech from captain templeton he stated that a crime had been committed on board the ship and it behoved every passenger to use his or her best energies to find out who had committed it the idea of suicide had been talked about but they would hear from the evidence of mr monteith an intimate friend of the deceased that the dead man had distinctly denied having any such idea he went to bed the previous night at halfpast eight and at seven that morning one of the stewards by name matthew dalton had gone to the deceaseds cabin and found him lying dead with a stiletto in his heart the stiletto would be laid before the jury the evidence of the steward the doctor and of mr monteith taken and every attempt would be made to find the author of this dastardly crime the first witness called was dalton who deposed that he had knocked at the door of the deceased at seven as usual but receiving no reply had entered and found him lying in the lower berth with a stiletto produced in his breast he was completely dressed and as all the furniture of the cabin was in order there was no sign of any struggle the stiletto produced was a slender steel instrument about seven inches long with a curiously carved ivory handle representing the head of bacchus surrounded by clusters of grapes captain were the bedclothes in the berth disarranged witness no sir he was lying on top of em captain quite dressed witness yes sir just as if he was taking a sleep afore turning in captain any of his jewellery missing witness no sir his watch was in his pocket and two rings on his fingers captain when did you last see him alive witness yesterday when he came on board at valletta captain how long was he ashore witness about an hour sir he came back at three oclock he seemed upset and asked me to get him a glass of brandy captain do you know what time he went to bed witness no sir captain was there any blood about the cabin witness no sir just a little oozing from his breast the doctor was next called upon to give his evidence and deposed that he had examined the body of lionel ventin deceased it was that of a man of thirtyseven or thereabouts well nourished very little food in the stomach but a faint spirituous odour which showed that the deceased must have been drinking previously to his death the deceased had died from a stab inflicted by a stiletto which had penetrated the heart the stiletto was in the wound when the body was discovered captain at what time do you think the crime was committed doctor that is difficult to say it was quite cold when i felt it at seven this morning i should say at least eight or nine hours captain from the way the wound was inflicted did the idea of suicide occur to you doctor no the stiletto was long and as the body was lying in a lower compartment he could not have lifted the stiletto high enough to have driven it so deeply without knocking his hand against the bottom of the top berth captain if he had managed to do so would there be any bruise or mark on his hand doctor i should say very likely but i did not discover any captain was there much blood doctor very little the stiletto had been driven into the heart and left there so comparatively little blood could ooze out this closed the evidence of the doctor and then ronald monteith stepped forward and told the jury the story of the deceased captain you say the deceased expected to be killed by his wife monteith he told me so several times captain and did he ever say he would commit suicide monteith he distinctly denied having any such intention captain when did you see him last monteith at halfpast eight last night he said he would go to bed early captain was he excited in any way monteith no just the same as usual captain if your theory is correct and the deceased was murdered by his wife as he expected to be do you think she came on board at valletta monteith yes i am sure of it sensation captain will you give us your reasons monteith the deceased saw his wife in malta and she recognised him when he left me at halfpast eight to go to his cabin there was a number of strangers on board if his wife were on board she could easily have followed him to his cabin and killed him captain but she would not know the number of his cabin monteith yes she would he asked me to see him in the morning and told me the number of his cabin twice the second time he spoke so loudly that anyone could have heard and immediately afterwards went away captain then you think the crime was committed before the sailing of the ship monteith i cant say if as the doctor says the deceased had been dead for nine hours this would bring the time of the commission of the crime to nine oclock last night at which time the ship sailed the captain asked monteith a few other questions and then the inquest was adjourned till the next morning chapter iv the new passengers when the inquest had been adjourned and the excited passengers were assembled in saloon and smokingrooms giving their ideas on the subject ronald monteith at the captains request remained to talk over things it is a curious case altogether said captain templeton sitting back in his chair i never knew of such a thing to occur aboard one of our steamers before and your story is a strange one it is rather assented the australian pulling moodily at his mustache but i think it is true poor ventin told me it only too bitterly to leave any doubt in my mind as to his veracity the captain took up the stiletto which still lay on the table and looked at it thoughtfully have you ever seen this in ventins possession he asked no replied monteith casting a careless glance at it but then i never was in his cabin we sat next to one another in the saloon at meals and talked together a good deal beyond the story i told you i know nothing about his life excuse me putting the question to you again but do you really think this maltese wife killed him well of course i cant say for certain but it looks very black against her she wrote and told him she would kill him oh interrupted the captain did he show you the letter no but it might be among his private papers which you will of course take charge of yes i will look over his things tonight but go on well he goes on shore at valletta sees his wife who recognises him comes back she follows hears the number of his cabin and kills him and then well the question is easy to answer she must have committed the crime before nine oclock and escaped on shore in the confusion or well she must be still on the boat what passengers came on board at valletta i ascertained that when i heard your story this morningtwo only maltese or english the former marchese matteo vassalla is the name of one and the other is miss cotonerboth cousins do you think she is the wife of ventin asked ronald eagerly how the deuce do i know said templeton quickly i never saw her before what age should you think she was about twentyfour or five womens appearances are so deceptive what the deuce are you driving at asked the captain annoyed i know the exact age of the maltese wife how so ventin told me he was forty years of age and that he was twenty when he started his career in london he said he had thirteen years of fast living there so in order to be forty now seven years must have elapsed since his marriage but what has this got to do with the age of his wife everything he said his wife was twentythree years of age when he met her first that by my argument must have been seven years ago so today his wife must be thirty years of agenow is this new passenger thirty no im certain she isnt besides the marchese told me his cousin and himself stayed on deck till the vessel started oh said ronald thoughtfully so that disposes of this young lady it cannot be she but the marchese might help us i dont think so he wouldnt know ventin perhaps not but he might know mrs ventin as he lives at valletta and the whole affair might be sifted to the bottom but oh hang it i forgot broke off monteith in dismay ventin was not his real name heavens you dont say so then what was it he did not tell me how vexatious said templeton rising to his feet this involves the affair in still deeper mystery for if ventin were not his real name we cannot find the former mrs ventin and will not be able to ascertain if theres any truth in the story he told you examine his boxes suggested ronald as he followed the captain outside his real name may be among his papers or else a crest you might find out from that the captain jumped at the idea and was going down to carry it into effect when ronald stopped him i say he asked eagerly who is that pretty girl with the dark hair oh that said templeton with a laugh is the object of your suspicions miss cotoner captain templeton turned away and ronald discovered the young lady in question was the very one he had seen on the barraca and of whose face he had been dreaming ever since she guilty of a crime the thought was madness if any one even hinted at such a thing hed throw him over the side and he no longer was astonished at the captains indignation at his suggestion the fact was master ronald was in the first stage of that universal disease called love he approached mrs pellypop as she sat knitting industriously and took a seat beside her of course she commenced on the great subject of the day and expressed her opinion that it was a lascar but what motive asked ronald absently couldnt be robberynothing was stolen then it must have been a steward said mrs pellypop determinedly mr ventin looked like a man with a temper and very likely struck a steward who retaliated by killing himoh its as clear as day to me but where did he get his weapon asked ronald stole it from the plate basket said mrs pellypop whose idea of stilettos was vague it was not a table knife began ronald then broke off suddenly as he saw miss cotoner move away with a tall slender dark man i say mrs pellypop whos that whom asked mrs pellypop putting up her glasses oh the girl from malta no not miss cotoner i know who she is but the fellow oh her cousin the marchese vassalla answered mrs pellypop not that i care much for foreign titles myself but he looks a gentleman and as a matter of fact he was by no means illlooking but when ronald saw him he instantly took a dislike to him why he did not know unless it was on the dr fell principle it might have been instinct perhaps prejudice but the fact remained neverthelesshe did not like matteo vassalla a handsome face certainly with swarthy skin brilliant black eyes and a coal black beard carefully trimmed in his slender sinewy figure there was something of the lithe grace of a panther and what with the graceful movements of his hands and the deferential manner with which he bent towards miss cotoner he decidedly did not impress monteith favourably but the ladywell she has been described before and as ronald looked at her he only found new perfections she had rather a sad expression on her face and her head was a little bent down but for the rest she was as straight and graceful as artemis ronald who had stoutly resisted all the blandishments of the pretty girls on board caught one glance of those brilliantly black eyes and surrendered at once he also caught the glance of another pair of eyes which did not regard him in such a friendly manner and drew himself up haughtily as he left mrs pellypop and went down to the saloon what the deuce did that foreign cad mean by staring at me like that he muttered quite forgetting that the cad in question had a title and was of higher rank than himself i dont suppose he has anything to do with her perhaps they are engagedhang it its impossible shed never throw herself away on a thing like that ill ask old mother pellypop tomorrow shell be sure to know all about her in that time having thus in his own mind satisfactorily settled the affair ronald went down to his cabin to dress for dinner meanwhile miss cotoner and her cousin were having a few words on the subject of mr monteith what a handsome man said miss cotoner following the tall figure of the australian with her eyes bah a beefeating englishman retorted vassalla with an angry light in his wicked black eyes he has no brain youve to find that out yet retorted the young lady who seemed to take delight in tormenting her companion i think hes charming im sure he looks it i saw him yesterday on the barraca remember you are engaged to me replied the marchese angrily by my parents yes she replied coldly but not with my own consent consent bah let wiser heads guide yours carmela well i certainly would not ask your head to take the position replied carmela contemptuously why do you annoy me like this do you think i left my sister only to be worried by you no i dont think so there is too much of the fryingpan into the fire theory in that for me i will get your sister to take you back he said vindictively oh no you wont she retorted turning on him im of agemy own mistress and i have elected to go and stop with my cousins in england if i choose to marry an englishman i certainly will in spite of your threats so goodbye matteo im going to dress for dinner and she walked gracefully away leaving the marchese in a delightful temper bah he muttered angrily to himself she is only a woman patience my good matteo you shall win her yet and then he closed his mouth with an angry snap that did not argue well for the happiness of miss cotoners future life what a flirt that girl is thought mrs pellypop as she looked after the young lady im sure i dont know what the world is coming to i never flirted and to mrs pellypops credit it must be said she never had but then as rochefoucauld remarks some women are safe because nobody seeks after them when ronald emerged from his cabin in evening dress he was caught at the foot of the stairs by pat who in company with a few convivial spirits was having a sherry and bitters come and have something to drink after all your labours he said in a hospitable manner anything new about the affair no i dont think so replied ronald sadly poor ventin to think he was so jolly last night and now dead do you think the person who killed him is on board asked pat confidentially no i dont retorted ronald decisively i believe shes to be found at malta and ill hunt her down and punish her somehow why because i liked ventinhe had a miserable life and a miserable end and a wicked woman like that wife of his is not fit to live stop a bit old boy observed pat coolly you havent brought the crime home to her yet but i will reiterated monteith doggedly im sure its she and if it isnt ill make it my business in life to find out who is the criminal i say monteith said bentley a vacuouslooking youth with no brains and lots of money ventins place was next to you at tablewho are they going to put there i dont know and i dont care growled ronald savagely turning away cursing mr bentley under his breath for his callous way of speaking seems cut up lisped bentley putting up his eyeglass in nowise disturbed well its no joke having a fellow you like murdered said pat finishing his sherry and ventin was a good sort anyhow then they all commenced talking again about the mystery till pat grew weary of the discussion and went on deck where he found ronald leaning over the side looking moodily at the water well old chap said pat slapping him on the shoulder dont take it so much to heart it wasnt that replied monteith i was thinking how we could find out his real name why wasnt it ventin he said it wasnt search his baggage thats been done but without resultall his linen is marked l v all his letters directed to lionel ventin in fact its the only name that can be found then it must be his real name asserted pat not necessarily he told me he changed his name so he evidently did it thoroughly any crestthat might give a clue no nothing oh it seems a deuce of a muddle hullo theres the dinner bellcome down old boy im starving they went below and found nearly all the tables full pat went to his own table and ronald sat sadly down by the side of ventins empty chair he was not there very long when he heard a rustle and on turning round saw that miss cotoner was sitting beside him yes sitting in the dead mans chair so with a sudden impulse ronald arose i beg your pardon he said bowing but would you mind taking my chair instead of that one why asked the young lady coldly becausebecause he stammered confusedly it was mrmr ventins the gentleman who died oh she said and turned rather pale thank yourisingi will accept your offer and she sat in monteiths chair while he took poor ventins of course this little incident was observed by all and by none more so than matteo vassalla who sat at a distant table and looked remarkably savage wait a little he muttered when you are mine ill tame you pat indicating ronald and miss cotoner to kate lester hummed the first line of his favourite song i love a lubly gal i do what do you think he asked miss lester laughed and nodded i think the same as you she answered chapter v a day at gib the inquest on the body of lionel ventin was resumed next day but nothing new was discovered and taking into consideration the strange story told by the deceased to monteith the time of the committal of the crime which according to the doctors showing must have taken place when the ship was leaving valletta there appeared no doubt but that the murder had been committed before the steamer left malta as the deceaseds real name was not ventin and all the evidence was purely circumstantial the jury brought in a verdict of wilful murder against a person unknown the evidence was taken down so as to be handed to the authorities in gibraltar entries were made in the logbook about the affair and poor lionel ventins body was committed to the deep there is something inexpressibly sorrowful and solemn in a burial at sea the body wrapped in a sail with iron shot at its feet was placed on the lower deck near the open bulwarks and was covered with the union jack a number of the passengers were present leaning from the upper deck but many of the ladies among whom was mrs pellypop were reading the service for the dead to themselves in the saloon the captain surrounded by his officers read the service over the deceased and at a signal the body was pushed over the side slipping from under the union jack and fell with a dull splash into the sea then everyone dispersed the engines which had been slowed down during the burial resumed their usual speed and life on board went on as usual there was a gloom however over all the ship for it was not an ordinary death and it was not until the neptune reached gibraltar that the passengers began to recover their usual gaiety meanwhile ronald monteith had become the slave of carmela cotoner and judging from her gracious manner towards him she was in no wise displeased at having him at her feet ronald had hitherto laughed at the tender passion but now he was being paid back for insulting the god of love as he found out to his cost he was always at carmelas elbowcarried her rugs and pillows about for her danced with her read poetry to her and in fact was so constant in his attentions that it was soon patent to the whole ship that monteith was madly in love with the girl from malta and indeed she was called nothing else mrs pellypop not knowing her name at first had given her that title and everyone else followed suit she was the belle of the ship vice kate lester resigned and was always followed by an adoring crowd of young men of whom ronald grew unspeakably jealous and would get quite sulky if she smiled or spoke to anyone else he carried this absurd behaviour to such an extent that pat ryan took him to task one day for his sins you are a jolly old ass ronald observed the candid irishman to go on like this making a fool of yourself i cant help it said monteith ruefully surveying at a distance a group of young fellows standing round carmela just look at her she doesnt care a bit about me of course you say that said pat lighting a cigarette because she doesnt devote herself exclusively to you i tell ye what girls dont like being made faces at because they speak to another fellow hang it ive seen you speak to girls enough that was before ii hesitatingly met miss cotoner before you were in love ye mean retorted pat begad yeve got the disease badly are ye going to marry her i will if shell have me then why dont you ask her ive only known her a few days isnt that rather soon not a bit women like to be taken by storm wisely remarked pat who was just out of the nursery and fancied he knew the sexheaven help himgo in and win my boy by jove i will said ronald eagerly and then fell to thinking what his father would say to the marriage he didnt know who the young lady waswhat she wasknew nothing about her family and yetand yet he adored her why shouldnt he marry her he was his own master and if his father cut him off with a shilling he could workshe was worth working foryes he would ask her to marry himof course she would say yesfor it never entered this confident young mans head that women sometimes say no so master ronald went on building castles in the air all inhabited by himself and mrs monteithno hang it not yetthe girl from malta he was aroused from these golden visions by a touch on his arm and turning round saw his special dislike the marchese vassalla looking at him the marchese detested monteith both for his good looks and for the evident regard miss cotoner had for him he would like to have dropped his rival over the side along with poor ventins body but as he couldnt do this he was excessively polite and watched for an opportunity to do him an injury here was a chance now and the wily maltese took full advantage of it he overheard the conversation between pat and monteith so determined to dash all ronalds hopes to the ground by telling him that carmela was engaged to this end the serpent came into ronalds paradise and smiling invited him not to have an apple but a drink the young man would have refused but then he thought he might learn something about carmela and after all the marchese was her cousin so he consented and went down to the bar with the smiling maltese gentleman as it was about eleven oclock they found the bar surrounded by thirsty souls having cocktails in fact there was a cocktail club on board and it was a very popular drink with the young men particularly if they had been up late the night before cocktails therefore being the prevailing beverage the marchese and his victim each had one and then the former gentleman opened the campaign i shall be sorry when this voyage is over he said carelessly so shall i replied monteith thinking of the chances of meeting carmela in london but i daresay ill meet missi mean you again i dont think so said vassalla coldly myself and my cousin only stay a few days in london and then go down to some friends in the country oh said ronald and looked blank and then pursued his tormentor eyeing him mercilessly i am coming back to london to arrange about our marriage the poor lad turned pale as death whose marriage mine and my cousins did you not know we were engaged ronald finished his drink in a mechanical sort of way and putting down his glass walked away to his cabin and shut himself in the marchese looked after him with a grim smile i think that will give you food for reflection my friend he muttered lighting a cigarette as he strolled away whats up with that maltese devil asked bentley he looks quite pleased with himself its more than monteith did he walked away as pale as a ghost said pat its about the girl from malta you bet said bentley sagely and no one contradicted him miss cotoner was without her attentive cavalier all that day and was much surprised thereat she asked her cousin about him and that smiling gentleman told her ronald was ill and had gone to lie down and indeed ronald was ill not with a headache but with a heartache which is worse and he lay all day in his narrow berth bemoaning his hard fate nor did he come to dinner and miss cotoner was so vexed to think he was so ill that she sent her steward with a little note to his cabin saying how sorry she was and she hoped he would be well enough on the morrow to take her over gibraltar all of which monteith read and puzzled over shes a flirt a heartless coquette cried the poor boy shes engaged to another man and shes trying to break my heart but she wont i care no more for her than this bit of paper and he threw the little note on the floor after a bit howeverwith the usual inconsistency of lovershe picked it up and thought what a pretty hand she wrote and then that he would go over gibraltar with her and he would find out if she were really engaged to that beastly maltese ronalds language was strong but not choice then he sent a reply to carmela saying he would see her in the morning and afterwards drank a bottle of champagne and felt better oh what a queer disease is love with its hopes its fears its smiles and tears its kisses and blisses andits intense egotism the next day monteith arose cooled his hot head with a shower bath donned a suit of spotless white flannels put a straw hat on his curly locks and sallied forth with the determination to save his charming princess from the clutches of the ogre vassalla or die in the attempt hullo cried pat seeing the unusual splendour of master ronalds apparel going on the mash today gad youll knock the gib girls over like ninepins whereat ronald informed pat in confidence that he intended to try his fate with miss cotoner that day and pat informed ronald likewise in confidence that he thought he was quite right and would bet him a bottle of champagne he would be accepted which wager monteith took and went on deck with a light heart and a strong determination to win all this time however in spite of his newborn love monteith never for a moment wavered from his determination to hunt down the assassin of his dead friend and told captain templeton as much how are you going to do it asked templeton dubiously we cannot even find out ventins real name isnt there a portrait of him among his luggage asked monteith templeton shook his head not anything likely to lead to identification he answered but ill have a talk with you after we leave gibraltar for i must confess i would like the riddle solved and the captain went off to his post on the bridge as they were now nearing the famous rock who that has once seen it can forget that enormous grey mass rising up from the blue water into the blue sky with the redroofed town nestling at its base monteith had never seen anything so impressive since aden which he had beheld vague and mysterious in the starlight he realized with a thrill of pride that this was one of the visible signs of englands greatness and he thought with satisfaction that he too was of the race that had conquered it aden malta gibraltar all held by england it made ronald quite patriotic when he thought of the impregnability of these strongholds if he had been a poet he would have burst into verse but as he was not he simply contented himself with a commonplace observation by jove its wonderful the anglosaxon race are rarely enthusiastic the ship cast anchor about a mile from the shore and soon ronald and his beloved were in one of the boats dancing over the choppy water pat also was in the boat and so was mrs pellypop and kate lester ronald hinted to pat that the old lady would be in the way but pat magnanimously said he would look after both her and miss lester so as to leave monteith free to pursue his wooing with carmela when they reached shore they rejected all the offers of carriages made by brownskinned natives of the rock and sauntered leisurely up the dusty street under the massive gateway above which they could see the redcoated sentries and walked right into the marketplace where a lot of buying selling swindling and talking were going on jews with black beady eyes and hooked noses invited them into dingy little shops and produced oriental goods and sedatelooking moors in baggy trousers and large turbans watched them with eastern apathy as they passed along the tall white houses with the striped awnings over the windows the crowd of dirty little brats howling for money the number of red uniforms about and the narrow crowded streets all afforded them much amusement then mrs pellypop inveigled by the wily pat went into a shop to buy some things and was soon engaged in a lively altercation with the shopman who spoke broken english and showed her broken things which he said came from granada and would have had a broken head if mrs pellypop had not reflected that using her umbrella for such a purpose might lower her dignity pat and miss lester looked on and laughed at the scene so taking advantage of the confusion ronald and carmela slipped away and climbed up the steep lanes to the old moorish castle which frowns over the town i dont care much for ruins said miss cotoner putting up her red sunshade and a pretty picture she looked under it theres a good deal of sameness about them but moorish architecture is picturesque yes very assented ronald who would have agreed to anything she said i have arab blood in my own veins observed carmela at least so my father said one of our ancestors was an emir is your father alive asked ronald who saw in this remark a good opportunity for finding out all about his beloved no he died a long time ago she said sadly my mother is also dead and i lived in malta with my sister was that your sister who was with you the first time i saw you carmela nodded yes we did not get on well together so i left her and am going to some relations in england then i shall not see you again said the young man in a moody tone that depends on yourself she replied blushing all the blood rushed to ronalds fair face and it was only by a great effort he prevented himself from taking her in his arms and kissing her does your cousin the marchese go with you he asked eagerly i believe so i suppose you are glad glad she looked at him with surprise why on earth should i be glad becausebecausewelldesperatelyhes going to marry you carmela frowned who told you so vassalla himselfis it true asked the young man breathlessly miss cotoner looked at him in a queer manner for a moment then turned away her head my parents arranged a match between us she answered nervously and you im not in favour of iti dont think there is any chance of my ever marrying the marchese ronald sprang forward with a cry of delight oh miss cotonercarmelai would like to see the fortifications she answered quickly nipping the declaration she knew was coming in the bud i wouldnt let us go down to the almeda she turned away and ronald followed mortified and humbled at his failure but half way down the hill began to pick up his spirits i cant expect her to fall like ripe fruit into my mouth he thought hopefully and its impossible she can love me in so short a time he was wrong there for carmela liked him very muchin fact more than she cared to acknowledge to herself but she would not allow him to speak becausewell because she was a riddle woman is an eternal riddle that man has been trying to solve since the beginning of the world but every attempt has failed monteith however took his failure like the honest gentleman he was and turned the conversation remembering his anxiety to solve the mystery of ventins death he thought he would question his fair companion did you know a lady in valletta called mrs ventin he asked as they walked slowly along in the burning sun no i never heard the name before replied carmela promptly looking at him of course not thought monteith it wasnt his right name who is she said carmela carelessly thats the same name as the gentleman who died she was his wife replied ronald does she live at valletta asked miss cotoner i think so strange i never met her she was married to my friend seven years ago oh said miss cotoner with a slight start no i never heard of her mr monteith they were strolling along the almeda by this time and the grand promenade of gibraltar was crowded many an admiring glance was directed at the pretty girl ronald as escorting and one young officer was heard to declare that that dark girl was deuced good style you know on the almeda they met mrs pellypop and the everlively pat along with miss lester and the whole party were tired and dusty with sightseeing mrs pellypop in fact was rather cross but triumphant as she had secured a number of bargains though truth to tell she had paid dearly for her purchases she was not at all pleased at seeing ronald escorting carmela and observed with some asperity that it was time to return to the ship everyone being weary agreed and they went down the steep street out of the gate and pat ran to get a boat while thus waiting the marchese vassalla came up and addressed himself with some anger to miss cotoner i did not get on shore till you left and have been looking for you all day you ought to have waited for me to escort you thank you replied his cousin languidly mr monteith has been kind enough to relieve you of your duties the look vassalla cast on ronald was not by any means a pleasant one chapter vi mrs pellypop talks mrs pellypop was an epitome of all that was good a happy mixture of hannah more and florence nightingale with just a slight flavour of mrs candour to add piquancy to her character she was an excellent housekeeper a devout christian rigorous in all her social duties a faithful wifeand yet the late mr pellypop must have been glad when he died she was too overpoweringly virtuous and wherever she went showed herself such a shining example of all that was excellent that she made everyone elses conduct however proper it might be look black beside her own the fact is people do not like playing second fiddle and as mrs pellypop always insisted on leading the social orchestra her room was regarded as better than her company her father had been a clergyman and when she married mr pellypop who was in the wine trade and came out to melbourne to settle she never lost an opportunity of acquainting people with the fact mr pellypop died from an overdose of respectability and left his widow fairly well off so she declined to marry againnot having any chance of doing soand devoted herself to the education of her only daughter elizabeth whom she nearly succeeded in making as objectionably genteel as herself elizabeth was good gentle and meek and as mrs pellypop wanted a soninlaw of a similar nature she married elizabeth to the rev charles mango who was then a humble curate in melbourne after marriage the rev charles turned out to have a will of his own and refused to let mrs pellypop manage his household as she wished to do indeed when he was created bishop of patagonia for his book on missionary mistakes he went off with his meek little wife to his diocese in south america and absolutely refused to let his upright motherinlaw accompany him so mrs pellypop made a virtue of necessity and stayed behind in melbourne talked scandal with her small circle of friends bragged about her soninlaw the bishop gave tracts to the poor which they did not want and refused them money which they did and in short led as she thought a useful christian life other people said she was meddlesome but then we all have our enemies and if the rest of her sex could not be as noble and virtuous as mrs pellypop why it was their own fault at last she heard that the bishop and his wife had gone to england to see that worthy prelates parents so mrs pellypop sold all her carefully preserved furniture gave up her house and took her passage on board the neptune in order to see her dear children before they went back to the wilds of south america on board the ship she asserted her authority at once and came a kind of female alexander selkirk monarch of all she surveyed two or three ladies did indeed attempt a feeble resistance but mrs pellypop made a good fight for it and soon reduced them to submission her freezing glance like that of medusa turned everyone into stone and though the young folk talked flippantly enough about her behind her back they were quiet enough under the mastery of her eye when the ship left gibraltar late in the afternoon mrs pellypop was not pleased and sat in her deck chair steadily knitting and frowned at the grand mass of the apes head on the african coast as if that mountain had seriously displeased her she was annoyed with the conduct of miss cotoner who took an independent stand and refused to be dictated to by mrs pellypop or anyone else so the good lady anxious to guide the young and impulsive girl and find out all about her determined to speak to her and subjugate her if possible so she sat in her chair knitting away like one of the fates and pondering over her plan of action for mrs pellypop never did anything in hurry and always marshalled her forces beforehand carmela with the marchese on one side and ronald on the otherboth of which gentlemen were exchanging scowls of hatewas looking at the romantic coast of spain as they steamed through the straits the rolling green meadowsundulating like the waves of the sea with the glint of yellow sunlight on them made a charming picture and turning to the other side she could see the granite peaks of the apes head with wreaths of feathery clouds round it and a little farther back the white houses of ceuta add to this charming view a bright sky a fresh breeze which made the white sails belly out before it and two delightful young men to talk to it was little to be wondered at that carmela felt happy so these are the pillars of hercules she said looking from one side of the strait to the other yes answered her cousin so the greeks said i dont think much of hercules as an architectdo you indeed i do replied carmela enthusiastically what can be grander than gibraltar and the apes head they are not exactly alike said ronald looking at vassalla and the marchese likes consistency of course i do retorted vassalla with an angry flush on his cheek especially in women with a significant look at his cousin then my dear matteo you are sure to be disappointed retorted miss cotoner calmly for youll never get itthe age of miracles is past my friend ronald laughed and was rewarded by a scowl from the marchese and then carmela tired of keeping peace between these hotheaded young men went off to talk to mrs pellypop without doubt there would have been high words between the rivals had not a steward come up to ronald with a message that the captain wanted to see him so ronald retreated leaving vassalla in possession of the field and the marchese seeing there was no chance of talking to carmela went off to solace himself with a cigarette meanwhile mrs pellypop received carmela with an affectation of friendliness and proceeded to question her in a machiavellian manner what a pretty place valletta is said the matron dropping her knitting and rubbing her plump white lands i suppose you know it very well i ought to answered the girl laughing ive lived there nearly all my life yet you speak english well said mrs pellypop sceptically yes there are so many english people in malta and besides my mother was english oh thought mrs pellypop noticing the use of the past tense her mother is dead so you are going home to your mothers people i suppose she asked aloud just on a visit replied carmela carelessly indeed they live in london i presume no at marlow on the thames oh said mrs pellypop sitting up suddenly is that so i am going down there myself on a visit to my soninlaw hes the bishop of patagonia my dear and his parents live near marlow mango is the name i believe they are well known yes ive heard of them said carmela cordially a dear old couple i believe mrs pellypop drew herself up stiffly the parents of a bishop should never be called a dear old couple it savoured of the peasantry may i inquire the name of your relative she asked coldly taking up her knitting sir mark trevor indeed said mrs pellypop impressed with the fact that the young lady was connected with a baronet its a cornish name is it not i believe so he has estates in cornwall but also has a house on the thames where he stays for the summer oh a bachelors place i presume said mrs pellypop artfully not exactly hes a widower and has one daughter nearly as old as i am and they are going to meet me london and then we intend to go to marlow for the summer then i shall probably see you there said mrs pellypop cordially its not unlikely replied carmela rising goodbye for the present mrs pellypop im going to lie down for an hour before dinner goodbye my dear said the matron resuming her knitting i hope i shall meet you on the thames i should like you to know the bishop carmela laughed as she went downstairs shes quite pleased with me now she said gaily and all because i have a cousin who is a baronet heavens how amusing these people are mrs pellypop was pleased with miss cotoner and what she had termed forward conduct before she now called eccentricity this young lady had aristocratic relatives which relatives lived near the place to which mrs pellypop was going so the worthy matron who had a slight spice of worldliness resolved to cultivate the girl from malta as a desirable acquaintance she needs a mothers care thought good mrs pellypop so i must try and look after her what would mrs pellypops conduct have been had carmela told her that her cousin was a butcher just the same of course for how could a good woman attach any importance to such idle things as rank and wealth meanwhile ronald was in the captains cabin talking over the mysterious crime which had takes place on board the neptune and both of them were in considerable doubt how to proceed i want the affair cleared up said templeton if only for the credit of the ship it wont encourage people to travel with us if they think theres a chance of being murdered on board the difficulty is how to start replied ronald thoughtfully you see there is absolutely no clue to follow precisely answered the captain leaning forward let me state the case a gentleman comes on board at melbourne and conducts himself in a rational and sane manner which puts the idea of suicide quite out of the questionjust before we arrive at malta he is restless and uneasy and tells you the story of his life which affords strong grounds for suspicion that his wife wanted to kill himhe goes on shore spies his wife and returns at once on boardhe goes to bed before the ship sails and the deck is crowded with all sorts and conditions of people such a crowd that theres absolutely no chance of knowing any of them he is found dead next morning with an italian stiletto in his breast a weapon which a maltese would probably use in preference to a knife there is no evidence to show that anyone was seen near his cabin now your theory is that his wife came on board before the ship sailed killed him and escaped on shore in the confusion yes that is my theory but only founded on the story he told me very good we then find he told you that ventin as not his real name i search his boxes and papers ad find no other name but lionel ventin and yet he distinctly denied that that was his proper name he diddistinctly i place all the facts and evidence in the hands of he authorities at gibraltar and they are equally mystified with ourselvesthey suggest that it might have been a lascar or a steward impossible there was no motive no robbery certainly answered templeton but do you think there could have been any other motive how could there with the exception of myself he was very reserved with everyone else on board then we dismiss the steward and lascar theories it must have been the wife now i have stated the case how do you propose to unravel the mystery ask me something easier replied ronald with laugh think againhe told you his story did he mention any names one elsie macgregor good now do you see a clue ahronald thought a momentyes i see what you mean if ventin were divorced elsie macgregor must have been joined as corespondent exactly answered templeton i see youve caught my idea now i cant take up this case and though ill have to put it into the hands of the authorities they are sure to make a mess of it so if you want to unravel this mystery you must find out the murderer or murderers of lionel ventin yourself i see said ronald pulling his mustache you want me to find out the divorce case the captain nodded triumphantly but macgregor is such a common name objected ronald there may be dozens of corespondents called macgregor very likely but what about the sex the corespondent you look for must be a woman called elsie macgregor yes cried ronald quickly and then ill find out ventins real name of course answered the captain and once you find out his real name youll soon find the wife and then templeton shrugged his shoulders oh then youll have to prove the truth of his story to you but if i find out all about her the stiletto will have to be put in evidence of course answered templeton and that you can get from the authorities at gibraltar in whose hands i placed it i have a letter of introduction to the son of an old friend of my father said ronald he is a barrister of the middle temple ohyoung about thirty the very man replied templeton rising go and see him and tell him all about it if hes anxious to make a mark in the world which he hasnt done yet interjected ronald hell go in for this case gad i wish i could go into it myself i ought to have been a private detective well said ronald as they went out on to the deck i came for a pleasure trip but it looks as if i shall have to work all the time yes but think of the time you will have of it putting this puzzle together replied templeton it will be most exciting besides if you bring this crime home youll get your reward if not on earth at least in heaven id rather have it on earth said ronald thinking of carmela chapter vii the end of the voyage there is no sadder word in the english language than farewell how many quivering lips have said it with breaking hearts and scalding tearsthe soldier marching away with flying banners and martial musicthe emigrant sitting on deck seeing the blue hills of the land of his birth fading away in the shadows of the nightthe young man going forth into the world and turning once more to see through teardimmed eyes the old house where he was born and the lovers partingnever to meet again yes it is a sad word and has caused more tears and heartaches than any we use now that the voyage was coming to an end those who had been in close companionship for nearly six weeks knew that they must separate in a short time and that the memory of the pleasant company on board the neptune would soon be only a dream of the past no wonder then that as the steamer glided up the thames everyone was a little melancholy the voyage from gibraltar had been pleasant they had seen the famous trafalgar bay where nelson won his waterloopassed cape st vincent in the nightcaught a glimpse of the mouth of the tagus in the early morning and steamed safely through the bay of biscay which did not act up to the reputation gained for it by the song but was as calm as a millpond on arriving at plymouth some of the passengers had gone to london by rail in preference to facing the chance of a collision in the english channel it was ronalds first glimpse of england and chester who was very patriotic asked him what he thought of it its the best groomed country ive seen said ronald with a smile and indeed though the epithet was odd it was very appropriate for after all the barbaric colouring they had seen at colombothe arid rocks of malta and gibraltar and the sandy shore of port said this wonderfully vividly green land with fields and wellkept hedges cultivated down to the waters edge looked as the australian said well groomed they anchored for about two hours at plymouth but there was no time to go on shore so they gazed longingly at the quaint town so famous in english history the hoethe bowling green where sir francis drake played bowls when the armada was descried stretching out like a crescentand mount edgecumbe which the commander of the great fleet designed for his residence when england was conquered ronald stood silent looking at all this beauty when a remark of pats made him laugh i say said pat mindful of colombo and aden to chester who was quite inflated with patriotic pride will the people here come off and dive for pennies chester glared at him viciously and then stalked away too indignant to speak while all around roared at the queerness of the remark well i thought they might explained pat to his grinning auditors the natives did it at all the other places there are no natives here confound you said chester who had returned oh indade replied pat innocently this englands inhabited by foreigners after this chester concluded to leave pat alone it was night when they sailed up the channel and they could see in the distance the twinkling lights of folkestone dover margate and all the other wellknown places and as it was the last night on board there was a general jubilation in the smokingroom after the ladies had retired songs were sung toasts were proposed speeches were made and when the electric light was put out candles were produced and the concert kept up far into the night or rather morning one gentleman said he could play musical glasses and broke fifteen tumblers in demonstrating his ability to do sothen they had more liquor sang god save the queen and went off to bed one by one and everything was quiet and what a curious appearance the deck presented next morningeveryone in his bestno more flannel suits and straw hats but accurate frock coats and tall hats while the ladies came out in dresses of the newest fashions knots of people were talking togethergiving addresses making appointments and promising to write until it was queer to hear the jargon like this you wont forgetthe alhambra you knowbest shop in londonlace veils cheaper thanaddress will always find mepiccadilly circus oncheap hotel just offmargates the jolliestoh the devil take thenicest girl you everset foot on shore and so on until ronald who stood by carmela could not help laughing the marchese was looking after his own things and as ronald had his luggage in perfect order he had carmela all to himself so this is the thames he said looking at the dull leaden stream flowing between the dingy banks the thames of commerce not of poetry she corrected smiling you must come down to marlow and see the real river may i he asked eagerly thinking he detected an invitation in her tones of course you may she answered carelessly i dont control your movements not at present but you might he replied hurriedly there was an awkward pause luckily broken by pat who came rushing along with his usual impetuosity ah miss cotoner an is that you said pat dolefully the best of friends must part and we may niver meet again we might answered carmela with a laugh the world is small begad i wish me heart was said ryan sadly its large enough to hold all the girls on boardyou included much obliged retorted the young lady with a bow not in the least offended for pat was a licensed jester but ill not consent to be one of many yed rayther have one honest heart asked pat looking keenly at her she turned his remark off with a laugh depends upon the owner of the heart she replied gaily ah begad thin im out of it said pat and ran off leaving them in exactly the same awkward situation as he found them what are you going to do when you reach london asked carmela after a pause during which ronald kept his eyes on her face many things he answered calmly first i am going to set to work to find out who killed my friend ventin im sure i hope you will be successful she replied heartily but why in londonthe crime was committed at malta yes but the motive for the crime will i think be found in london they say a woman killed him i think so but it is purely theoretical i dare say for what motive could any woman have for such a crime do you think a woman always requires a motive she looked at him in surprise certainly i do there can be no cause without an effect in some cases yes he replied gravely in this case i believe the woman had no motive in committing the crime then why did she do it asked carmela looking at him that is what i have to find out he answered and so the conversation ended it was one oclock when the steamer got into st katherines docks and on the shore crowds of people were waiting to meet their friends no one however came to meet pat and ronald so their mutual sense of loneliness drew them yet closer together where are you going to stop asked pat linking his arm in that of the australian the tavistock replied ronald the australian cricketers generally stop there so it will feel homelike ill go there too sail ryan promptly well go to the alhambra or the empire tonight and tomorrow call at the langham to see whom oh a lot of passengers are going to stop there miss lester among the number said pat with a slight blush oh pat your heart is lost there observed ronald smiling and what about your own and the girl from malta asked pat whereat master ronald also blushed and the two friends went below to get their stewards to look after their luggage among those who had come on board was a tall elderly gentleman very straight and severelooking scrupulously dresses with goldrimmed spectacles accompanied by a pretty vivaciouslooking brunette who was clinging to his arm i dont see her bell said the gentleman looking inquiringly round perhaps shes below papa said the young lady oh with a little scream there she isthere she iscarmela carmela and with another ejaculation she ran forward to where miss cotoner was standing talking to vassalla my dear bell said carmela kissing her how good of you to come and meet me how do you do sir mark and she gave her hand to the elderly gentleman who now advanced i am pleased to see you looking so well my dear carmela he said in cold measured tones and then turned an inquiring glance on vassalla my cousin said carmela introducing him this is his first visit to england sir mark and the marchese both bowed and murmured something indistinctly we are stopping at the langham carmela said bell brightly looking up in miss cotoners face papa doesnt like our town house you know and were going to stay a fortnight in town isnt it jolly bell reproved her father do not use slang i beg of you i cant help it said the vivacious bell it was born with me andoh my with another little scream what a goodlooking boy who is he the quartette turned their heads and saw ronald looking handsome and highbred in his frock coat and tall hat advancing evidently with the idea of saying goodbye its mr monteith said carmela paling a little at the thought that she might not see him again you are going away she asked aloud holding out her hand yes he answered gravely mr ryan is with me and i am going to explore the wilds of london let me introduce you said carmela despite the black looks of vassalla sir mark trevor mr monteith miss trevor mr monteith the australian bowed in his usual grave manner and then said goodbye to carmela i shall see you i presume in london he said lingering a little if you like to call at the langham hotel i shall be there for a fortnight she answered and his face lit up with a happy smile as he went off why did you do that carmela asked the marchese in a vexed tone we dont want to see him in london you may not i do replied miss cotoner with calm contempt shall we go on shore now sir mark and without another word she went off with the baronet and his daughter leaving him alone so he has not given up the chase yet muttered vassalla as he looked after the luggage well we shall see we shall see mrs pellypop to her disgust found no one to meet her so went off to the langham hotel and wrote a severe letter to the bishop which had the effect of bringing the prelate up to london next day and so they all went their different ways and the happy family on board the neptune was scattered abroad through the streets of london town ronald saw the captain before he left and had a talk with him about ventins death promising to look up his barrister friend on the morrow then he went with pat to the tavistock where they had a capital little dinner after which they patronised the alhambra followed by a supper at the cavour then though pat was inclined to make a wet night of itparticularly as they had met several of the boys at the theatreronald went to his hotel and retired soberly to bed first however posting his letter of introduction to gerald foster of middle temple so that he could call on him on the morrow and speak with him about the mysterious death of his friend ill find out who killed poor ventin he said as he went to bed and then ill marry carmela chapter viii counsels opinion everything comes to those who know how to wait what an excellent proverb for a briefless barrister let mr briefless sit in his chambers surrounded by his law books crammed with learning and ready to undertake anythingif he wait will fame come to him not she fame is a lazy goddess except when she flies away and then it is difficult for even the most industrious to catch her and clip her wings he who would seek the wealth of the indies must take out the wealth of the indies is not that saying a true one in order to gain fame riches and ease must not one bring industry perseverance and knowledge if mr gerald foster barrister of the inner temple had adopted the motto of knowing how to wait he might have done so till the end of the chapter and then have been no better off at the end than the beginning but mr foster was not of this fatalistic creed he did not believe that what must be must and that if a man is to be famous he will be so whether he idles at home or goes out into the world and works no he saw clearly that every day the prizes were fewer and the multitude of competitors greater and so he did not rest idly on his oars after being admitted to the bar but went in for hard study both of men and books books as he knew are all very well but according to pope the proper study of mankind is man and gerald went out into the world and neglected no opportunity of getting fish into his net he went into the theatrical world and knew all the most famous actors and actresses in london he went into the political world and had all the burning questions of the day at the end of his tongue he noted the rising and falling of shares on the stock exchange and knew exactly how the money market stood and he went into society and became acquainted with the follies of the hour all this work was for a purpose for he was a young gentleman who never lost an opportunity and his sprats were all sent forth to catch mackerel as yet in spite of his assiduity to work and his cultivation of the follies and virtues of his fellowmen he had succeeded but little but then he was only twentyeight years of age and fortune is not a goddess to be wooed roughly so he went on keeping his brain cool his eyes open and his mind cultivated and had no doubt in his own mind that he would succeed with such indomitable perseverance gerald knew he must win at last fortune fickle though she he becomes weary of incessant assaults and yields in the end to the persevering suitor so mr gerald foster aged twentyeight with clever brains good health and plenty of tact worked assiduously at his profession waiting for the hour that would bring him fame and riches not a handsome man certainly not that is he was not an oiled and curled darling of society he dressed well because it was part of his business but even his kindest friend could not hove pronounced him handsome a bald head with a thick fringe of brown hair round it a prominent nose a cleanshaven face with a thinlipped mouth and two brilliantly black eyes under bushy eyebrows he would have been ugly but for the wonderful charm of his smile a most delightful smile that changed all his features and turned him from the ugly beast into the handsome young prince of the fairy tale and above all his face was one that inspired confidencean invaluable quality in a lawyer on the morning after the arrival of the neptune he sat in his office in the temple looking over his letters accurately dressed in frock coat black trousers and tie and spotless linen he was turning over his letters when he came on that of ronalds and something in the handwriting of mr monteith senior seemed to strike him for he opened it first reading it over carefully he gave vent to a low whistle of astonishment hum said mr foster surveying the letter thoughtfully friend of your fathersonly sonfirst visit to englandwould like you to look after himexactlylaying down the lettera cub i expect with no looks and less manners brought up in the wilds and cant eat his food properlya delightful aboriginal to introduce into london society well i suppose i must i love my dear old father too well to think of refusing to do a good turn to any friend of his confound it im sure this son is awful well perhaps hell be rich and that will cover a multitude of sins we are fond of whited sepulchres nowadays he put the letter of introduction on one side and proceeded with the rest of his correspondence carefully answering each letter and putting it neatly away then he rang for his clerk and giving him a pile of letters told him to post them and taking up the daily telegraph proceeded to read that paper and wait for clients of course he went first for the money market then he looked over the political news glanced at the law reports and read all the leaders ending with the theatres these principal items being finished he glanced idly over the paper and at last came on something that interested him hum said mr foster thoughtfully a murder committed on board the neptune that is the boat the cub came home in think ill read it that i may have something to talk about when he does come he read the article carefully which told all about ventins murder and the suspicions entertained by monteith after which he laid the paper down and rising from his seat walked slowly up and down the room with his hands behind his back dont think the cub can be so bad after all he said musingly indeed judging from his evidence he seems rather a clever fellow queer case and one id like to have a hand in to unravel a mystery like that would make a fellows fortune but these things dont come my way confound it here he was interrupted by a knock at the door and his clerk a redheaded boy with a large appetite and fearful dislike for work entered with a card held in his grimy fingers genlum waitin sir said the redheaded youth who breathed hard in an apoplectic manner ronald monteith read foster on the card hum the cubshow him in berkles berkles grinned vanished and shortly afterwards threw open the door and announced mr ronald monteith if ever gerald foster got a shock in his life it was seeing the cub of his fancy transformed into the handsome young man of reality there he stood at the door hat in hand tall and noblelooking quite a distinct being from the ordinary lounger of regent street and hyde park accustomed to rapid observation foster took the whole of that stalwart figure and honest countenance in at a glance and with the sudden liking of instinct advanced towards him with outstretched hand mr monteith i believe he said as ronald stepped into the room yes answered ronald grasping the proffered handand what an honest firm grip was that of the young australian i sent my letter of introduction to you last night it is here replied foster pointing to the table as ronald took his seat i am very glad to see you mr monteith my father was a great friend of your fatherslet us hope the friendship will be hereditary it is very kind of you to say so said monteith in some surprise i am quite a stranger to you you are answered the young lawyer but i am a student of lavater and i can read facestherefore i say i hope we shall be friends im certain we shall said ronald heartily holding out his hand which the other grasped again you had a pleasant voyage asked foster in a conversational manner very except for one incident which i know all aboutpointing to the newspaper im glad of that because i have just called to see you about it eh said foster sitting up in his chair by jove hope youll put the case in my way i was just thinking before you came in what a splendid chance was to make a name if one only had the case well mr foster said ronald slowly looking keenly at him i am very much interested in the case ventin was an intimate friend of mine and as no one that i can hear of is going to try and clear up the mystery of his death i am going to take that duty on my own shoulders i see observed foster nodding sagely and you want help i doyour help you shall have it cried foster impulsively a subtle case like this is what i require to make my same at present i am a briefless barrister but give me the chance and im all right archimedes wanted a world whereon to rest his lever and move the earth i am like the greek i have the levervidelicet my brains now i want a world namely a casethis as far as i can gather from the papers will be an excellent chance then you shall have it said ronald heartily and i am only too glad to think i have such an enthusiastic worker so be it now tell me the story in your own way these newspaper accounts are so meagre whereupon ronald told foster all about the case and his own suspicions regarding it to all of which the young barrister listened carefully then leaned back in his chair and put the tips of his fingers together hum he said thoughtfully looking up at the ceiling you have made out a very strong case against this maltese wife i must confess but the evidence is surely circumstantial but who else would have done it a man might have committed the crime but with what motive because he was told to do so but i dont see of course you dont said foster coolly but i will explain from what you have told me mrs ventinwe will call her so as we do not know her real namemust have been a woman of very strong passions now is it likely that such a woman would remain faithful to her husband no i am sure she would not depend upon it she had lovers or else married again in the latter case she might have committed the crime herself as husbands are not fond of endangering their necks for wives however pretty but if she had lovers depend upon it one of them committed the murder for her sake thats all very well said ronald impatiently we must not be content with vague speculations but get a clue now how are we to start i think the idea of captain templeton is best said foster thoughtfully to look up the divorce case you do not remember it not i there are dozens of divorce cases every yearwe are such a moral nation you know i cant keep them all in my head but i will look it up and then then i will see the solicitors who had the case in hand and ask all about ventin you knew the man they knew him and if your descriptions tally we will soon establish his identity so far so good said ronald impatiently but what follows then we must find out where this maltese wife is in malta said ronald abruptly she might not be by the time we find out her husbands real name said the barrister coolly dont hurry my dear toy but when we discover where she is we must set a detective on her to find out her movements on that night when the murder was committed if she can account for them satisfactorily your theory must fall to the ground but if she cant foster shrugged his shoulders then we must be guided by circumstances we can hardly arrest a woman on the existing evidence its a very difficult case and we must be careful when will you look up this divorce case today and let you know all about it tomorrow meanwhile you had better come and lunch at my club thank you very much said ronald blushing if you will let me away immediately afterwards i have to make a call certainly replied foster glancing at his companions telltale face as they went out ill bet hes going to see a woman he thought looking at monteith what a transparently honest man he is chapter ix verschoyle v verschoyle and macgregor business being concluded as a natural thing pleasure followed and having had luncheon with foster at the excelsior a club much frequented by rising young men ronald took leave of the barrister and went off to his hotelthere to attire himself for an afternoon call it might have been the fashion in the past for lovers to become exceedingly negligent in their dress and pass their time in writing amatory odes to chloe and lydia not daring to name openly the object of their affections but nowadays this is all changed strephon puts on his smartest suit wears his brightest smile and shows chloe plainly that he adores her instead of wasting his time in writing poetry he gets chloe tickets for the theatre takes her presents of flowers and music and on the whole conducts himself in a matteroffactfashion so master ronald adopting the modern manner of lovemaking dressed himself carefully placed a flower in his coat and went off in a hansom cab to call on miss cotoner he also got a box at one of the theatres and not knowing his divinitys taste in theatricals judged it by his own and decided she would like to go to the frivolity theatre at which the sacred lamp of burlesque was burning of course he found mr ryan therethat young gentleman having come to call on mrs pellypop and naturally met miss lester alsosuch a delightfully unexpected meetingthe young humbug it is wonderful how people who have travelled together gravitate towards one another on shore and when ronald was shown upstairs he found mrs pellypop miss lester carmela and the marchese all together having afternoon tea sir mark and miss trevor were also present and appeared to be enjoying themselves very much ronalds entrance was hailed with great delight by all except vassalla who scowled at the australian in a way that showed his animosity had not in any way abated carmela came forward with a pretty flush on her cheek and gave him a cup of tea after which they all began to talk and what were you doing last night mr monteith asked mrs pellypop who presided over the teaservice oh said ronald innocently not understanding the violent gestures pat was making to him pat and i went to the alhambra mrs pellypop put down her cup with a look of horror that dreadful place she said looking severely at pat why mr ryan you said you were at exeter hall everyone laughed at this and pat muttered something about a mistake oh the alhambra isnt a bad place said sir mark good naturedly the ballets are very good its more than the young women are retorted mrs pellypop viciously i would not like the bishop to go there no said carmela with a laugh its hardly the place for a bishop im sorry you dont like theatres began ronald to the matron but i do like some theatres answered mrs pellypop and any play of shakespeares ah you see they arent playing shakespeare just now said ronald dryly but ive got a box at the frivolity tonight and thought the ladies might like to come looking straight at carmela everyone looked grave at this the frivolity was such a fast theatre you dont know london very well said vassalla in a sarcastic tone of voice or you would find out that the frivolity is as bad if not worse than many a musichall oh ive erred through ignorance then retorted ronald with a flush but i dont think music halls are so very bad and besides as far as i can judge your acquaintance with london is not so extensive as to enable you to correct me marchese vassalla would have made an angry reply had not carmela interposed what are they playing there she asked a burlesque cried kate lester artful artemis and the shy shepherd kate cried mrs pellypop in a severe tone how can you talk so in my young days girls knew nothing of such things i wish she wouldnt go back into the dark ages whispered pat to carmela she must be a hundred and young at that whereon carmela laughed well said ronald dismally if none of the ladies will come perhaps the gentlemen will im engaged said vassalla promptly thank heaven thought ronald muttering the regrets which politeness demanded i will come mr monteith said sir mark and ive no doubt mr ryan oh ill be all there said pat gaily i adore burlesque the stage educates the people begad and a mighty nice schoolmaster it is that will be three all together said ronald so ill ask my friend mr foster to make a fourth but what are the ladies plans for tonight i am going to take my cousin and miss trevor to the italian exhibition said vassalla quickly not tonight replied carmela coldly i am going to write letters and i am going to wait in to see the bishop said mrs pellypop in fact said bell trevor sarcastically we are going to have a quiet domestic evening i hope youll enjoy yourself whispered pat to miss lester as he rose to go oh bother retorted that young lady crossly i might as well be in a convent the way mrs pellypop looks after me however my father is coming to london this week and then ill go everywhere may i come too plaintively asked pat if youre good yes as ronald said goodbye to carmela he asked her what she would be doing in the afternoon of the next day oh sir mark miss trevor and i are going to the italian exhibition and the marchese hell very likely be there also she replied coldly whereupon he took his leave and determined privately in his own mind that he also would be at the exhibition and would speak to carmela on the subject nearest his heart im madly in love with her he told pat as they went down the street you dont know how much oh begad i do retorted pat havent i got a heart and a girl of my own i wonder what lester pre is like if hes as nice as lester fille it will be all right laughed ronald and they went along to the temple as monteith wanted to introduce pat to foster this being accomplished they all went home to dress for dinner and sir mark also turning up they had a pleasant meal about seven oclock and as all the party suited one another they became quite jolly the baronet soon showed himself to be a capital companion a little cold perhaps but with lots of appreciation of fun and as for foster he kept them all amused by his stories and jokes pat was in his best form and the champagne only made him more exuberant in spirits while ronald forgetting all his love and detective work for the moment was gay as any of them after dinner they all went to the frivolity and arrived just as the curtain was rising on the new burlesque the theatre was crowded as the frivolity invariably was and ronald saw with some amusement that the celebrated masher brigade of whom he had heard so much was in full force in the stalls they looked like rows of waxworks with their immovable faces and phlegmatic manners they look as if they ought to be wound up like clockwork remarked pat gaily oh they only keep going on tick if thats what you mean said foster laughing oh what a pun observed ronald in disgust as if those in the burlesque werent bad enough well they couldnt be much worse said sir mark putting up his opera glass the burlesque of artemis was in the usual style the author had taken the beautiful greek myth of diana and endymion and vulgarised it hopelessly in it artemis the virgin huntress was represented as an old maid in love with endymion who of course was in love with some one else being in his case another mans wife and the other man being an apothecary gives endymion a powder which sends him to sleep in fact the whole burlesque was written to show that women hunt after men and that the most amusing thing in life is to get as near divorce as possible without the actual law business taking place artemis was acted by a celebrated lion comique who sang local songs about the government and the royal family and endymion was given by a little girl with yellow hair and saucy blue eyes who sang and danced like a fairy indeed when she sang her great song slightly on the mash pat fell head over ears in love with her and felt inclined to join in the chorus with these beautiful words slightly on the mash boys dont i do it flash boys altho my incomes very small in fact i guess its none at all ill never go to smash boys while i can cut a dash boys for im a chap without a rap thatsslightly on the mash heavens how they applauded her as she ogled and flirted and winked and smiled to hear her was a liberal educationin slang gad aint she a jolly little thing cried pat enthusiastically dont lose your heart old chap whispered ronald remember miss lester begad my hearts big enough for two said pat with a humorous twinkle in his eye but ye neednt be afraid ronald i have no diamonds to give away no wonder the theatre elevates the masses said gerald to sir mark who was listening to the song with rather a contemptuous smile what with burlesques sensation dramas aid shilling shockers well soon attain a wonderful degree of civilization oh you look at everything from a utilitarian point of view replied trevor as the curtain fell on the first act amid thunders of applause i try to began foster when pat who had caught the last word imperfectly started up yes im dry too he said gaily let us go and worship at the shrine of bacchus you go with sir mark said foster i want to speak with monteith on business right you are replied pat come sir mark im as thirsty as a limekiln and mr ryan went out of the box humming slightly on the mash followed by sir mark trevor who was greatly amused with the young irishman now then said ronald eagerly drawing his chair close to that of fosters what is it good news i think so replied the barrister leaning back in his chair i fancy ive found out ventins real name the deuce you have and what is it leopold verschoyle oh the same initials exactly so that accounts for all his linen being marked l v how did you find out asked ronald after you left me today i went to see a detective called julian roper who is omniscient and knows everyone and everything i told him the whole affair and he remembered something about the divorce i told mm the time it took place about six years ago and we looked up a file of the times and found out the case which was not reported at full length and the information we gained was very scanty we found out however the name of mrs verschoyles solicitors and went therethe managing clerk is a great friend of mine and he let me have the briefs and they correspond in every particular to the story ventin or rather verschoyle told you then you think the identity of ventin with verschoyle is fully established to ourselves yesto others no we have only the bare story told by the deceased to connect him with the case and the argument against that is that he might have read about the case in the papers but what motive could he have for telling me such a story none that i can seei am only putting a supposititious case but if we are going in for this we must get our evidence clear and strong and what is to be done come to my chambers tomorrow and see julian roper then we can have a talk over things we are working completely in the dark at present but ive no doubt that by tomorrow we shall be in a position to make a start you have no photograph of the deceased have you no and none were found among his papers but if i saw one i could tell in a minute if it were ventin he was not an ordinary looking man by any means hum said foster thoughtfully that might be managed if i put roper to work hell soon find out a photograph or with a sudden idea better still you might look yourself but where in some of the big photographers studios from what you say verschoyle as we must now call him must have been a fashionable man and no one in his position would live thirteen years in london without having had his photograph taken its a slender chance very but you must remember the whole case is a very delicate one at this moment trevor and pat came in and immediately afterwards the curtain arose again on a beautiful scene representing dianas home in the moon so foster and ronald had no more opportunity of talking ronald paid no attention to the burlesque but sat at the back of the box thinking over the whole affair and the mystery of the case began to pique his curiosity the other three however looked at the stage admired the pretty girls encored all the songs and generally enjoyed themselves when the curtain fell sir mark invited the whole party to rules to supper and thither they went the room upstairs was pretty nearly full but they succeeded in getting a table to themselves and ordered supper the place looked very pretty with the lights all shaded with green and red shades and the soft glimmer of the candles shining on the diamonds and bare shoulders of the ladies plenty of laughter was going on varied every now and then by the popping of champagne corks and the clatter of dishes aint it a jolly place said pat looking around with delight nice way of winding up the night hullo ronald he went on theres our maltese friend and so it was the marchese attired in irreproachable evening costume was having supper with a young lady beautifully dressed with a loud voice and suspicious golden hair he did not see the others as he was too busy talking to his friend this is his italian exhibition eh grinned pat who wouldnt have minded changing places with vassalla well perhaps he has been there said ronald carelessly lifting his glass hes brought something good away with him at all events replied ryan shes a deuced pretty girl far too good for vassalla what name asked foster with a start vassalla interposed ronald looking quickly at him hum thats odd what is ill tell you all about it tomorrow was the ambiguous reply chapter x a conference of three julian roper was a peculiar character and had a marked individuality of his own he was a man of good family and had been brought up at a public school the intention of his father being to place him in the army but julian objected to his future life being thus mapped out for him and determined to take his own view of things and act as inclination led him this was in the direction of detective work and his greatest delight was in trying to unravel some mystery of real life which for strangeness and complication was far in advance of any work of fiction but his father being an aristocratic gentleman of the old school naturally thought that detective work was not quite the thing for a gentleman and he sternly commanded his son to dismiss the idea at once what was the consequence julian left his fathers house as a prodigal son and went on the way his particular bias inclined him when will fathers learn the great truth that they cannot compel nature and that any strong individuality in man or woman is sure to assert itself sooner or later every child is not formed on the pattern of its parents and therefore the parents cannot judge in every case as to the wisdom or fitness of their childrens choice therefore as long as the bias is in a right direction and the children can earn their bread by honourable exercise of their talents why should they not have free power to display those talents julian would have made but an indifferent soldier as it was he made an admirable detective and was noted in london for the quickness of his perception and the wisdom of his judgments when the countess of darringtons diamonds were stolen was it not julian who traced the robbery to none other than the noble lady herself who had pawned her jewels in order to pay her lovers debts when michael cantwell was charged with poisoning his wife was it not roper who discovered that the wife had poisoned herself and left a letter laying the blame on her husband out of revenge why these stories are the common talk of the detective force and when gerald foster asked roper to take the verschoyle mystery in hand he knew he had got a good man with the sagacity of a sleuthhound and the inflexible determination of a richelieu and indeed when the case was explained to julian by the barrister that astute gentleman had eagerly agreed to do his best in discovering the culprit for it was a mystery which delighted his soul in fact roper was in love with these chinese puzzles of social life and nothing pleased him so much as spending months in adding link by link to a chain of evidence ending in the complete clearing up of a curious case so the three gentlemen sat in fosters office and talked the case over ronald eager and attentive to the views of the others foster quiet cynical and keen and roper calm and unfathomable with his sharp blue eyes bent on both and his acute hearing taking in every word said it is no use sketching ropers portrait for like proteus he had many shapes and what the real roper was no one knew one day he would be a parson the next a sporting gentleman the third day a tramp and so on until the noble fraternity of thieves actually began to suspect each other so ubiquitous and clever was the famous detective its the strangest case i was ever in said mr roper in his soft low voice but one which it will be a pleasure to work at at present we have the merest clue now the great thing is to follow it up first said foster taking some papers from the drawer of his desk let us look at the divorce case verschoyle v verschoyle and macgregor oh we know all about that said ronald impatiently not all of it replied gerald smoothing the brief in the first place what do you think was the name of mrs verschoyle her maiden name yes i dont know then i will tell you cotoner what ronald sprang to his feet as pale as death yes said julian roper pulling out his pocketbook did not a lady of that name come on board the neptune at malta my god cried ronald madly you dont mean to say we mean to say nothing answered foster quietly except that the young lady you know is innocent of this crime ronald gave a kind of strangled sob it is sacrilege even to think of her in connection with it he said in a stifled voice his young face now haggard with pain why the maltese wife was thirty and miss cotoner is only twentysix vassalla her cousin was with her all the time she was on board before the ship started she had no motive for killing verschoyle she didnt even know him when i spoke about him not as verschoyle no from roper do you believe this asked ronald savagely no i dont replied the detective blandly but we may as well look at all sides of the question i daresay miss cotoner is as innocent as you or i of this crime still we must lose no opportunity of getting evidence stop a moment said ronald calmly because the name of mrs verschoyle was cotoner i do not see that miss cotoner is implicatedthere are no doubt more people than one of that name in valletta of course there are said foster quietly but miss cotoners mothers maiden name was vassalla what yes that was the reason of my surprise when i heard the name last night that proves nothing only that her cousins name is also vassalla so it proves pretty clearly that miss cotoner is mrs verschoyles sister ronald groaned for there flashed across him verschoyles remark that his wife had arab blood in her veins and that miss cotoner had made the same statement at gibraltar so it seemed true after all go on he said huskily what is to be done now the best thing to be done said roper quietly is to find out some one who knew verschoyle yes but how can you find out such a person i have done so already yes he has a sister staying in london and i know where to find her indeed yes she is a mrs taunton and her husband is at artist if we could see her and get her to show mr monteith a portrait of the deceased he would be able to recognise it of course i should said ronald eagerly then pursued mr roper without altering his voice there is another bit of evidence we must get hold of the letter sent by the wife to verschoyle saying she would kill him but how can we obtain that well shrugging his shoulders i am going on a forlorn hope mrs taunton may have it nonsense said foster incredulously i dare say it isbut still there is a chance that verschoyle when going to australia left some of his papers behind a man does not care about dragging a lot of luggage all over the world and it is very likely that mrs taunton has some of her brothers things to look after till he returned and if this paper is among the things in that case observed the detective we must get some writing of mrs verschoyle and compare the two if they correspond we shall have strong evidence that she is the criminal and then then i will go out to malta and see if i can ascertain her movements on the night in question by the way to ronald what date was it you left malta i think it was the th of june thank you replied roper noting it in his pocketbook then i want to find out where she was on the th of june between seven and nine oclock pm but instead of you going to malta why couldnt monteith ask miss cotoner i wont burst out ronald savagely what has she to do with itshe isnt the wife no but she might be the wifes sister ronald thought a moment yes she might he answered pale as death but all the same you havent proved that yet and i wont insult her by asking her roper sighed as he looked at this stubborn young man it was no good trying to get assistance from him so he would have to do the best he could very well he said calmly we wont ask miss cotoner anything the first thing to be done is to establish the identity of ventin with verschoyle and then i will go to malta and see about mrs verschoyle but how are we to find mrs taunton asked foster there is a meeting of the society for the improvement of art tonight said roper and she is sure to be there with her husband oh ive got tickets said gerald so myself and monteith will go and well soon find out all about her and her brother will you come monteith no doggedly why not because i dont want to go on with this case any more i can understand your reason said roper you think miss cotoner may be mixed up in it no i dont yes you do sirapologising for the contradiction but if you want to find out who killed verschoyle you had better go on with the case it will be more satisfactory to yourself andhesitatingmiss cotoner she has nothing to do with it of course not said roper soothingly weve only the similarity of name to go by i think i would go to this meeting tonight sir if i were you ronald thought a momentvery well i will he said resignedly and then roper arose to take his leave ill look in tomorrow and see what information youve obtained he said goodday mr fostergoodday mr monteith goodday replied ronald not taking his eyes off the table julian and foster went out is he in love with her asked the detective he is i thought so this case will be harder than you or i think but you dont suppose miss cotoner had anything to do with it no but i think shes the sister of the woman who committed the crime chapter xi an artistic evening the society for the improvement of art was one of the favourite fads of the day and will no doubt hold its own till some newer fad comes to the front and then it will fall to pieces it was organized by three or four enthusiasts who said there was a great deal of latent artistic talent in england which needed development and they proposed to let everybody who thought he or she could draw have an exhibition once a year every picture sent in was hung on the walls of their saloon and some queer things figured there unappreciated geniuses with the talents as they thought of michael angelo sent in hideous productions which were enough to send a painter of any knowledge whatever crazy such was the crudity of the drawing some of the pictures were done in a firm precise manner as if they were the productions of very young people and finished by the governess others had a dashing sketchy appearance as if they had been done in half anhour a not unlikely thing but here and there were some really pretty sketches that were admired yet the whole effect of these walls disfigured in such a manner was depressing in the extreme the fact was the society for the improvement of art was a collection of amiable idiots who made their mad project an excuse for having evenings when everybody who was anybody went on this evening therefore the rooms were crowded with all sorts of queer people some who thought themselves clever but were not and tried to make up for their lack of brains by assuming extraordinary costumes others who were dressed in the height of fashion only came because everyone else was there and critics actors artists and literary men all jostled one another in the crowd and laughed to scorn the feeble efforts of the society to find hidden talent there was weak tea and thin breadandbutter and everybody when they were not looking at the pictureswhich was seldomtalked scandal and abused their friends so it was all very delightful and amusing at least monteith found it so as he leaned against the wall and listened to fosters cynical comments on all who passed along mostly friends of his own but after all what is the use of having friends if one cant abuse them you see that baldheaded old chap there said signor asmodeus foster who was about to unroof his friends houses for the benefit of the australian the one with the gaunt female beside himshe was his daughters governess and married him by force she bullies the life out of him and if he but look at another womana thing by the way the old scamp is very fond of doinghe catches it when he gets home that pretty little woman in white is lady aspasia who was not as good as she might beoncebut now shes married and gives good dinners so society doesnt rake up her little failures in the past we are a very generous people when theres money in the question that young dandy with the simper and the eyeglass is bertie hardup who a year ago had not a shillinghis face was his fortune and a mighty nice income it brought him for he married miss mcnab the scotch heiress who has red hair and a long pedigree he doesnt care a fig about her and keeps musidora of the frivolity out of mcnabs money by jove my dear fellow all these people have their skeletons and if they could only become visible youd see every one of them attended by a bony figure like those in the dance of death rather a ghastly assemblage said ronald absently not at all replied his companion bless you we love our skeletons and in the middle of the night take them out and discuss our private affairs with them then we lock them up in the little dark cupboards again and only hear the faint rattle of their bones during the day ronald laughed you are cynical the fault of the world my dear boy i would like to go through life keeping all my youthful illusions but the world won t let meit has destroyed all my dreams of honour and honesty one by one tillpoufit has made me as disbelieving as st thomas what strange people are here said ronald looking at the restless crowd yesthe dresses are eccentric are they notbut that is part of our trade in london if one cannot be famouswell the greatest idiot can make himself conspicuous let us walk through the rooms to find mrs taunton or well miss her ronald nothing loth went off with his mentor and could not help laughing at the curiously dressed people he saw one lady was arrayed in black velvet trimmed with silver and looked like a firstclass coffin while another in white with large red rosettes down the front of her dress had such square shoulders that she resembled nothing so much as a chest of drawers here and there were some pretty girls but the general impression ronald had was disappointment at the appearance of the ladies theyre so deucedly ugly he said in disgust yes they cant make their faces up properly observed foster putting on his eyeglass theyre all like very badly painted picturesbut thats a pretty woman over there yes by gad she is replied ronald critically who is she the lady we are in search ofmrs tauntoncome and ill introduce you to her so foster followed by ronald pushed his way through the crowd towards mrs taunton who was standing with her husband a tall roundshouldered man to whom she was talking in a vivacious manner a very charming lady she wassmall fairhaired and wonderfully bright and quick in her conversation and actions her face was wreathed with smiles but during a pause in the conversation it was in repose for a moment and then ronald detected a shade of latent melancholy which reminded him somewhat of the sombre expression of his dead friends face how do you do mrs taunton said foster when he reached her side i have not seen you for at leastlet me seea hundred years if that is the case replied the little lady laughing you must have the gift of immortality for you dont look a day older nor you a minute said foster with a bow permit me to introduce to you my friend mr monteith he is come from the wilds of australia to see if civilization is an improvement on savagery welcome to london mr monteith said mrs taunton putting out her hand with a sunny smile i hope we shall be able to make your stay pleasant im sure of that answered ronald heartily in such company it would be foolish not to enjoy myself what they know how to make compliments in australia when they have a worthy object with a bow another really mr monteith you are a sir charles grandison i hope not broke in foster who had been talking to mr taunton he was a prigwouldnt be tolerated nowadays but then shrugging his shoulders how could you expect a linendraper to conceive a gentleman it would be easier to make a silk purse out a sows ear poor richardson said the lady with an amused look how severe you are on him mr monteith pardon my rudeness let me introduce to you my husband the artist bowed and shook ronald by the hand but said nothing he was a man of few words and so left his wife to do most of the talkinga task to which she was fully equal now then said mrs taunton when the introduction had been effected mr foster you can talk art law and scandal to my husband while mr monteith escorts me through the room in order to improve his mind ronald of course was delighted and they strolled off leaving the lawyer in deep conversation with the artist over a divorce case which was then being published in extenso in the newspapers what charming conversationalists some women are they are as happy in their talk as in their letterwriting and mrs taunton was a most delightful cicerone with all fosters knowledge and wit but without his cynicism cynicism like garlic should only be used in moderation and ronald found mrs tauntons bright rapid talk rather a relief after the pessimistic views of his friend the lawyer the lady seemed to know everyonestopped every now and then to talk to people and after leaving them kept up a running fire of conversation about their oddities which amused the australian very much how you do seize on peoples weak points he said laughing of course she replied im a woman and have the instinct of the sex likewise the charms mr monteith i cannot allow you to pay me any more compliments tonight but you may call tomorrow at four if you like and i shall be prepared for your gallantry i should like it above all things he said seriously why how grave your face is i shall have to call you the knight of the rueful countenance is anything the matter i dont know there might be what an ambiguous reply she said glancing at him curiously are you a spiritualist have you had an intimation that all is not right in the other worlds her flippancy displeased him knowing the importance of the matter in question mrs taunton he said gravely looking down at the little figure from his tall height i was introduced to you for a purpose and i am going to take a liberty mrs taunton looked a little frightened and wondered if her goodlooking cavalier were mad he guessed her thoughts dont be afraid i am in my senses then he must be in love with me thought mrs taunton in dismay at this eccentric young man but his next remark caused her to alter her mind you have a brother he said abruptly yes she replied rather puzzled i have one brother i think he is out in australia why a sudden light breaking in on her have you met him i think so what is he doing she asked eagerly ronald parried the question i dont know he replied but ill tell you all about him tomorrow is he ill or in trouble she said quickly please tell me because i am veryvery fond of him mrs taunton he said quietly i am come here for a purpose which concerns my brother yes believe me i do not ask out of idle curiosity but will you answer my questions mrs taunton thought a moment its all so curious she said nervously but mr foster who introduced you is an old friend of mineafter a pause yes i will answer your questions he led her to a seat and took one beside her then began to talk your brothers name is leopold verschoyle yes he was married in malta seven years ago he was and a year afterwards separated from his wife he did and then hesitatingly oh do not be afraid she said coldly he fell in love with another woman and there was a divorce case verschoyle v verschoyle and macgregor you seem to know all about it replied the lady a little astonished he went to australia with miss macgregor and since then i have heard nothing about him what became of them he married her oh drawing down the corners of her mouth then she is his wife now i presume no she is dead dead then my brother is coming back to england that i cannot tell you till i call on you tomorrow what do you want me to do to show me your brothers portraithave you one yes only one taken just before he left for malta good then i will call tomorrow at four oclock and then rising and taking monteiths arm i will tell you everything he replied about what that depends ontomorrow you are a most mysterious man said mrs taunton in a vexed tone as he took her back to her husband you arouse my curiosity and then refuse to gratify itbut tell me at least one thingis my brother well ronald hesitated he dare not tell her that her brotherif ventin indeed were her brotherwas dead so he equivocated i think so he replied hurriedly then i will wait for your promised revelation tomorrow and with a smile she left him and went back to her husband who was still talking to foster take me home george said mrs taunton touching her husbands arm i am tired yes you look pale my dear he answered giving her his arm wed better go at once foster glanced keenly at her and then at ronald who however shook his head good night mr foster said mrs taunton giving him her hand you are to call on me tomorrow at four with mr monteith i will not fail he replied with a smile and taking her husbands arm she moved away and was soon lost among the crowd when she disappeared gerald turned to the australian quickly well i asked her about her brother said monteith quietly and her story corresponds in every particular with that of ventin then you think verschoyle is ventin yes i think so but i will be certain tomorrow oh in what way mrs taunton is going to show me her brothers portrait and then well observed monteith if it is ventin as i suspect i think it will be the beginning of the end chapter xii the missing link what queer old places there are in brocade streetwhy the very name is suggestive of the stately times of the early georges and indeed brocade street was a fashionable locality even earlier when queen anne was ruling and marlborough was winning his brilliant victories and duchess sarah was alternately bullying and coaxing her weakminded mistress a dark narrow street with tall houses of red brick on either side innumerable windows and heavylooking doors which had often opened to let out belinda to her sedanchair or sir plume on the way to wills to have a chat with sterne and addison fancy swift with his dark lowering face walking down this street with his thoughts fixed upon a possible bishopric or dick steele swaggering along in his rich dress stopping to take off his hat to lady betty modish who looked archly at him through the window and then at night when all the streets were in darkness save for the link boys poor lost richard savage wandering about in company with samuel johnson even at that early age burly and contradictory ah yes great spirits were abroad in those stirring times and brocade street could tell a few stories of interest had it a voice but now the tide of fashion had rolled westward and the street was left silent and lonely to think over its past glories all those famous old houses with their broad oak staircases and large stately apartments were now used as lodginghouses for decayed gentlefolk and city clerks found shelter in the rooms which had once reechoed to the brilliant epigrams of swift or the smooth utterances of joseph addison there were also some artists to be found in the street for they loved it for its old associations and the deadworld flavour which haunted all the housesa perfume of past memories of the beaux and belles of good queen annes gay court among these was mr taunton who occupied a tall gaunt grimlooking mansion at the upper end and though his merry little wife tried hard to persuade him to move to a more civilized locality he steadily refused to exchange the dead glories of brocade street for the fashionable quarters of kensington so mrs taunton did the best she could and beautified the quaint oakpanelled rooms with rich tapestries curious old china and bizarrelooking brasses she sat now in her drawingroom waiting for mr monteith and his friend and wondering what could be the reason of their visit the soft light of the day somewhat subdued by the long curtains which draped the windows stole into the room and all the picturesque objects were seen in a kind of semitwilight here a tall column with the bust of a laughing menade in marble looking white and still against a background of crimson plush and there a landscape picture on an easel with some silken drapery flung carelessly over it plenty of easy chairs spindlelegged tables of chippendale cupboards of priceless china great jars from the flowery land which could have hidden the forty thieves and innumerable mirrors all over the walls interspersed with pictures both in oil and watercolours mrs taunton herself in a teagown of some soft clinging material was flitting about here and there like a restless butterflynow arranging some flowers with deft hands and again touching the dainty teaservice of svres china which stood at the end of the room i do wish those men would be punctual said mrs taunton for the tenth time as she stood at one of the long windows and looked down the dismal street i feel so miserable being alone her husband was up in his studio painting so she sat down on the window seat and leaning her head on her hand began to soliloquize i wonder what that mr monteith wants to tell me she said to herself he must have some news of leopold im sure i hope so it is years since i heard from him and then he left such a lot of things with me all those jewels which belonged to mother i hope theres nothing wrong but i dare say its all right leopold could always look after himself ah as the rattle of wheels was heard there they are and she left the window quickly as a hansom drove up to the door in a few moments mr monteith and mr foster were announced and mrs taunton received them with a face wreathed in smiles far different from the melancholy countenance which had gazed out of the window a few moments since a wonderfully pretty woman she looked in her pale yellow teagown as she advanced to greet the young men with the polished charm of a thorough woman of the world its rather chilly today observed monteith when they were all comfortably seated and mrs taunton was busy at the teatable chilly echoed mrs taunton oh you dont know what cold weather is in london wait till you see a fog a nice thick yellow fog with the sun like a ball of red fire glaring thro it then youll say its chilly ugh said the australian with a shudder your description is suggestive of the charnelhouse monteith longs for the blue skies of australia said foster with a laugh as he received his cup of tea from his hostess so would you retorted ronald if you had once been there life in australia is like the prairie fever one is always longing to be back again perhaps thats the reason my brother stops out there so persistently said mrs taunton leaning back in her chair the two gentlemen suddenly became grave whereat the lady sat up again what do you mean by all this mystery she asked impetuously last night mr monteith roused my curiosity to the highest pitch about my brother and then refused to gratify it is anything wrong has leopold run away with another mans wife or found a gold mine or committed a murder or what she tried to speak lightly but there was a ring of anxiety in her tones you promised to show me his portrait said monteith suddenly looking up mrs taunton arose without a word and going to a distant table took up a photograph framed in purple plush which she placed in monteiths hands taken seven years ago she said monteith looked at the dark handsome face of the portrait with a vague expression of sadness in his eyes and handed it to foster with a sigh it is lionel ventin ah said foster with a long breath as he looked at it i thought as much what do you mean by calling my brother lionel ventin asked mrs taunton quickly clasping her hands that isthat is the name of the man that wasthat wasmurdered the last word came out almost in a shriek as she sprang to her feet monteith nodded sadly yes he replied gravely leopold verschoyle and lionel ventin are the same then hemy brother is the man who was murdered on board the neptune she asked in a whisper foster arose in alarm let me get you some water he said advancing towards her but she waved him back was my brother the man monteith bowed and you gave evidence at the inquest he bowed again mrs taunton braced herself up with a mighty effort her charming face looking pale and drawn with horror she walked away a few steps then suddenly wheeled round on the two men who were watching her silently who killed him that is what we intend to find out said monteith slowly and you must assist us mrs taunton sat down and clasping her hands over her knee sat staring at the australian with a rigid face the shadows were falling fast in the street outside and through the gathering gloom of the room the two men could see the white set face of this woman looking like that of a lost spirit do you know what grief is she asked in a dull hard voice do you know what it is to go about with a smile on your lips and a broken heart no of course you dontyou are men and cannot feel pain as a woman can i have lost two children and it nearly broke my heartmy husband is wrapped up in his work and does not care for me except as a useful ornament to his tablethe only two children i had died when i most wanted their love and affection and i thought my heart would breakperhaps it didbuti livedyesi went about with a smiling face and talked gaily with my friendsthey said i was heartless god if they only knew the nights of agony that succeeded to days of apparent joybut i livedyes and i still go about amusing myselfa maelstrom above but a hell below this is another blow i loved my brother dearly though i had not seen him for years and now he is deadmurderedby whomyou do not knowi do what do you mean asked monteith starting to his feet she sprang forward and caught his wrist did he not tell you the story of his lifehow he was ruined by a woman elsie macgregor no she tried to save him it is not her i meanyou knowhis wifehis maltese wife bianca cotoner monteith fell back in his chair and covered his face with his hands heavens was it all true then was the girl he loved the sister of a murderess and yet though it looked so black against her where was the proof he looked up suddenly there is no proof he began proof she flashed out quickly you want proofi can supply it and she ran quickly out of the room what does she mean asked monteith i know said foster sagaciously she has gone for that paper impossible i dont see what other proof she can have said the barrister shrugging his shoulders its impossibleits impossible i tell you cried monteith vehemently his wife might have killed him but she was not a miss cotoner the evidence both of the divorce court and mrs taunton says she was but she cannot be the sister of carmela i cannot say there may be more cotoner families than one in malta but still vassallas name being mixed up in it seems to point out that she might be i wont believe it till i hear the truth from her own lips you will ask her then no thats a mistake youll only torture yourself till you get a satisfactory explanation monteith flung himself back in his chair with a low moan his bright young face looking pinched and haggard in the dim light and at this moment mrs taunton entered the room carrying a desk in her hands this is my brothers she said placing it on a table and turning to the young men he sent it to me about a year ago and asked me to keep it for him as he was going to south america and did not want to take it with him he also sent the key and i looked over the contents they are principally letters she flung back the lid of the box and there were bundles of letters yellow with age tied up with red tape there was also a portraita faded old portrait of a girls face is this the maltese wife asked foster taking it up whereon monteith sprang to his feet and also looked to see if it resembled carmela mrs taunton made a gesture of dissent it is elsie macgregor the young man looked curiously at that facea quiet patient face with love and truth shining through the pure eyesthe face of the woman that had ruined her life to save leopold verschoyle from himself foster laid it reverently down again amongst the old letters she was a good woman he said softly and cynic as he was he meant it but the proofthe proof said monteith impatiently mrs taunton rapidly turned over the bundles of letters and drew from one packet a square slip of yellowish paper which she handed to monteith in silence he took it eagerly and read the contentsonly three lines you have treated me shamefully and i will never forgive you for it we women of the south can revenge ourselves and your life will pay the penalty of your falseness there was no signature or date to this extraordinary document and the two men wondered at it for a minute then foster looked up suddenly how do you know this is from the wife he asked sharply mrs taunton pointed to the letters of course i have not read them she said coldly but you will see the writing on the envelopes corresponds with that in the letter and so it did in every particular so monteith and foster both came to the conclusion that this wife must have killed verschoyle seeing that she had threatened him thus and the crime was committed at malta where she livedthe proofs were so clear what are you going to do asked mrs taunton impatiently i have a detective in my employment called julian roper said monteith slowly and if you give me this paper i will show it to himthen he must go out to vallettafind out where mrs verschoyle lives and ascertain her movements on the night the crime was committed and he must also get some of her writing to see if it corresponds with this said foster pointing to the paper when will he start asked mrs taunton quickly tomorrow by a p and o steamer said monteith and we will hear all particulars from him in a fortnight very well replied mrs taunton quietly you can take the paper and hunt that woman down for she and none other killed my poor brothergoodbye gentlemen i am going to lie down and without another word she left the room and retired to her bedroom where her overtaxed nerves gave way and she broke down utterly she is a plucky woman that said foster as they left the house and drove away what do you think of it all i think said monteith thoughtfully that the case looks very black against the former mrs verschoyle but what i want to be certain of is her relationship to carmela you can find out by asking her no i will not said the australian doggedly but roper can find out in valletta and if it turn out to be so ill speak to carmela about the crime and see what she knows suppose she prove the sister mrs verschoyle a murderess will you give up carmela no he answered curtly i dont see why the sins of the father should be visited on the children nor that one woman should be punished for the crime of another chapter xiii the apple of discord altogether foster was very pleased with the position of affairs as there was now some tangible evidence to go upon in the first place it had been satisfactorily ascertained that lionel ventin was identical with leopold verschoyle and in the second the handwriting of the wife of the deceased showed that she deliberately intended to commit the crime and to all appearances had achieved her object while the steamer was lying at malta the next thing to be done said foster to ronald and roper as they sat in his room is to obtain evidence as to mrs verschoyles movements on that night now my impression is that she came on board to see her sister off to england and while there saw her husband heard him tell you the number of his cabinfollowed him and after committing the crime mixed in the crowd and returned on shore undetected a very feasible theory retorted ronald in a vexed tone but you forgetyou have yet to prove that miss cotoner is mrs verschoyles sister that can be at once settled by asking miss cotoner ronald moved uneasily in his seat i suppose it must come to that he replied but before asking her i think it best that roper should go to malta and find out all about mrs verschoyle i can go tomorrow said roper promptly and as soon as i find out what you want to know ill write at once so it was settled julian roper went out to malta the next day and there was nothing left for monteith to do but to wait and see what evidence could be found against mrs verschoyle he felt very miserable over the whole affair and particularly as it seemed probable that carmela would be mixed up in it and thenwell he did not like to dwell on the thought of such a possibility and carmela she on her part was quite as unhappy as her lover because she could not understand his changed attitude towards herself formerly he had been assiduous in his attendance on her but now he rarely came near her and was always making excuses regarding his absence excuses which she plainly saw were feigned and forced she was too proud however to complain and went about as usual with sir mark and his daughterfrequented balls theatres garden parties picture galleries and all the sights of london never once showing how deeply she felt ronalds desertion cold stately and selfpossessed as of old a keen eye might yet have noticed the dark circles under her eyes and the increasing pallor of her face bell noticed it and told her father who becoming alarmed wanted to take carmela down to marlow at once these london gaieties are too much for you my dear he said anxiously you are not used to late hours oh i am quite well answered carmela with assumed gaiety it is only a little fatigue you must not hurry me away just when i am enjoying myself fancy calling this sort of thing enjoyment said bell contemptuously im sick of these miles of streets and crowded dances and conceited men give me the country with a bright sky and a good horse well go down soon then said carmela kissing her i only want to stay in town another week and then i shall be at your disposal the fact was carmela was cherishing a hope that ronald would see her and explain away the discord which seemed to have arisen between them but though he called occasionally he made no sign but retained the same reserved demeanour the reason of which she could not guess ronald as a matter of fact was torturing himself over the position of affairs was carmela the sister of mrs verschoyle if so she must have been in love with verschoyle as his dead friend had clearly said so in this case heronaldwas not her first love and he felt that such a position was very unsatisfactory another thing was if carmela had been standing beside her sister on the night of departure she also must have recognized verschoyle and therefore when the murder was committed she must undoubtedly have connected her sister with the crime and suppose she knew all about it and was silent in order to shield her sister well he could not blame her for that but if she were doing this she was in a certain way an accomplice and could he marry a woman who was not only cognizant of such a crime but was closely related to the person who had committed it ronald used to lie awake at night and worry over these things till he thought he should go out of his mind he was madly in love with carmela but still he had a certain amount of selfrestraint and determined not to ask her to be his wife until the mystery which environed the death of verschoyle was cleared up satisfactorily therefore he kept away from her as he dared not trust himself in her presence without giving way and marrying her without taking anything into consideration and so these two young people were in a singularly unhappy positionboth in love yet both living at cross purposes carmela wondering at ronalds sudden change of demeanour and ronald trying to solve the doubts which had arisen in his mind concerning the woman he loved as to the rest of the neptunes passengers they were scattered far and wide pat ryan had gone off to look after his irish estates which mainly consisted of acres of bog inhabited by evilminded tenants who refused to pay the rent and as pat was too kindhearted to evict them his income was growing beautifully less every day kate lester and her mother had gone down to hampshire on a visit to a rich bachelor uncle who had fallen in love with kate and determined to make her his heiress a proposal not at all distasteful to that pleasureloving young lady mrs pellypop was down at marlow with her soninlaw the bishop and his meek little wife and was already exercising over the entire household her despotic rule until the whole house nearly arose in rebellion the only one left in london who refused to leave it till carmela took her departure was vassalla for that astute gentleman seeing there was an estrangement between carmela and the australian determined to turn it to his own advantage and was always whispering insinuations against monteith until one day she turned round and asked him what he meant you are always talking against mr monteith she said angrily with a red spot on each cheek but i have never found him other than a very highminded gentlemanbesides hurriedly what is he to me that i should care about him nothing at all my cousin replied vassalla smoothly caressing his carefullytrimmed beard but i knew you liked him and would be sorry if he conducted himself badly his conduct has nothing to do with me she retorted sharply how do you mean he is conducting himself badly cherchez la femme replied vassalla with sardonic smile carmelas heart almost stood still she turned very pale but with a great effort managed to preserve her composure so this was the reason of his coldness to her he was in love with another woman and had merely amused himself with her on the voyage with her carmela cotoner the thought was madnessand she clenched her hands while the hot blood flushed her cheeks rosered i dont believe it she said hoarsely i can prove my words to be true answered vassalla suavely if you come with me to the italian exhibition you will see them there how do you know she asked raising her heavy eyes to his that is a secret my cousin will you come no think it over i will call again this afternoon and vassalla left the house humming a tune he knew ronald would be at the exhibition that afternoon as he had met him in the morning casually and monteith had mentioned that he was going to take a lady to the italian exhibition so the wily maltese determined to turn the incident to his own benefit and if possible rouse carmelas jealousythat once done she would marry him if only out of pique he knew her too well to doubt that she would come and he proved a true prophet for when he called at the langham at three oclock he found her waiting for him dressed to go out he however was too wise to make any comment and stepping into a hansom they drove to the strand and went by the underground railway to the exhibition ronald was there as he had promised to escort mrs taunton for the poor little lady was so grieved and horrorstruck over her brothers death that she never let ronald alone a moment but was always urging him to go on with the case it was in vain he said they would have to wait till the letter came from malta before they could make a fresh move mrs taunton was fiercely impatient and had accompanied the australian not so much with the object of seeing the exhibition as of discussing the case with him they wandered about in deep conversation not heeding in the least the crowds of people around them while thus engaged ronald did not see miss cotoner who was standing by the marchese looking at him with a sad expression on her face you see i was right whispered the marchese i see said carmela in a tone of suppressed emotion but the lady may be only a friend oh yes a dear friend he answered with a mocking laugh why i tell you he is never away from her who is she asked carmela i do not know answered vassalla who knew perfectly well but was not going to reveal his knowledge they are always together at this moment ronald raised his eyes and saw carmela a sudden exclamation arose to his lips and he made a movement as if about to step forward when suddenly he drew back and raising his hat with a bow took his companions arm and disappeared in the crowd this action seemed to confirm carmelas suspicions and with a stifled sob she turned away the marchese following in silent triumph who was that lady asked mrs taunton when they were some distance away a lady i know he answered evasively and love why do you think so that is if you return love for lovei saw it in her face impossible not at all its merely a womans instinct come tell me do you love her yes he answered sadly too well nonsense said mrs taunton rapidly no woman can be loved too well no i agree with you thereif she is worthy of it and is this lady not worthy i dont know how mysterious you areit is cruel of me to keep you trying to solve the riddle of my brothers death when you ought to be making love to that young lady that is just it said ronald with a groan if your brother had not been killed i would not have doubted her what do you mean asked mrs taunton breathlessly who is she miss cotoner what the sister of my brothers wife i dont know he said dreamily you dont knowyou dont know she said with a quick indrawn breath what parrotcry is thisdid she come from malta yes then she must be what i have said ronald sighed i cant tell till i hear from malta does she know anything about my brothers death good god no he answered quickly how could she i dont know she answered between her clenched teeth but there is more in this than i understand you dont think i am playing you false he said sharply no she replied in a kinder tone i dont think thatyou have been so kind i intend to find out who killed your brother and punish him or her he said slowly and though i love miss cotoner more than my life till i discover this mystery i will not speak one word of love to her you promise me i promise and he took her hand they were silent for a moment and then passed out of the garden together both absorbed in their own thoughts the womans will this love prevent him doing justice to my brothers memory the mans is carmela aware that i know her relationship to mrs verschoyle chapter xiv a letter from malta julian roper to ronald monteith dear siri have now been here a week and in accordance with your instructions have lost no time in investigating the case entrusted to me but the results i regret to say are far from satisfactory on my arrival at valletta i took up my quarters at the hotel dangleterre in the strada sta lucia made inquiries as to the whereabouts of mrs verschoyle and after some considerable difficulty found that she was staying at a boardinghouse in the strada cristoforo on learning this i thought my best plan would be to take up my abode in the same house as i could then learn with more precision the movements of mrs verschoyle to this end i went to the strada cristoforo and found the boardinghouse to be a very comfortable one kept by a fat widow whose name is signora briffa i secured very pleasant apartments and took possession of them next day much to my own satisfaction and that of the signora at the table dhte i met the rest of the lodgers who are a queerlooking lot mostly italians with a sprinkling of english people among the latter is a mrs dexter the widow of a colonel in the indian army who has been staying in valletta for the last fifteen years for her health and being a garrulous old person much given to gossip knows everything and everyone she is tall rather thin with sharp featuresscanty grey hair and cold grey eyes in fact she gave me the impression of being a decidedly unpleasant person a presentiment which turned out to be true on my further acquaintance with her she confesses to the age of thirtyfive though i shrewdly suspect fortyfive or even more would be near the mark she has one quality however which is of great service to meshe hates mrs verschoyle with all the intense hatred of a narrowminded woman her reasons are twofold first mrs verschoyle is very handsome mrs dexter is not secondly mrs verschoyle is rich whereas mrs dexter is poor given these reasons can you wonder at the malignity of her feelings towards mrs verschoyle as to the latter she is very beautifuli speak as an unenthusiastic mantall dark skinned with clearly cut features and magnificent black eyes she impressed me at once with an overwhelming sense of a strong personality looking at her in repose she is a fine picture but once hear her talk and the charm is gone yes her voice is very coarse and sounds discordantly in addition to which she is insufferably proudanother cause of mrs dexters dislikeand has a very violent temper she of course did not deign to speak to mea mere english touristsuch of course is my characterbut gave all her attention to lord francis hurlington a young nobleman who hovers round her like a moth round a candle i hope he will not singe his lordly wings seeing me seated in the drawingroom all alone mrs dexter came and sat beside me apparently out of good nature for one so forsaken but in reality to learn all my history and gratify her love of curiosity i told her my historythat is i invented a fictitious story which proved that i ought to have been a novelist in return for my confidence she told me all about the inmates of the house more especially of mrs verschoyle thinking ive no doubt that a skilfully coloured story might injure the lady in my estimation i heard all about the divorce case but as you are already acquainted with the facts there is no need on my part for repetition so i may as well tell you the story of mrs verschoyles life from the time she settled in valletta after the divorce in the first place she has an income from the late mr verschoyle and not caring to take a house lived at first in lodgings but such was the violence of her temper that she was turned out of one place after another till she found a haven of rest at signora briffas as that lady does not regard temper so long as the money is paid regularly mrs verschoyle has a sister called carmela who is at present in england whither she went on board the neptune it appears she was in england before but came out to malta to live with her sister they quarrelled however and carmela in a rage left mrs verschoyle and went to london as you know in the same boat as you did the marchese vassalla who is her cousin also went with her though he has always been and is still good friends with mrs verschoyle and i shrewdly suspect from hints conveyed by mrs dexter that the lady in question is in love with him having thus got a general outline of the life of mrs verschoyle i questioned mrs dexter in detail and here i was even more fortunate than before as i found this excellent person kept a diary which she agreed to show to me you will wonder at my being honoured with such a confidence after so short an acquaintance but the fact is mrs dexter discoveredwith a womans instinctthat my mission was inimical to the interests of mrs verschoyle and she agreed to let me see her diary in order that i might secure anything that could be detrimental to her enemys character i might as well mention that mrs colonel dexter being quite alone in the world and having very little money agreed to accept a sum of money as a bribe or as she put it a loanloan or bribe the fact remains the sameshe took it she likewise promised to observe profound secrecy so having thus secured her allegiance i went to my own room and perused the pages of her diary taking notes as i went along the notes are as follows but i am afraid they are of small value as they seemto my mindto lead to nothing extracts from the diary of mrs dexter april thanother quarrel i knew it would lead to this i wonder carmela puts up with the insolence of her sister no wonder mr verschoyle divorced her no one could live with such a badtempered woman she says she divorced him but of course i know the truth though she doesnt think so she puts me in mind of that horrid major pentons wife at simlathe same bold way about her i asked carmela where mr verschoyle was and she said she did not know of course she did not but i do hes in australia signora briffa told me that carmela was in love with mr verschoyle herself but he preferred her sister no wonder they quarrel may stmrs verschoyle is setting her cap at lord francis and i can see very well is trying to marry him hes a fool i know but not quite so foolish as to make her his wife in fact i think he rather inclines to her sister i believe mrs verschoyle sees this and it makes her none the more friendly towards carmela i wonder how it will end may thsuch a lot has happened lately lord francis is gone and mrs verschoyle is furious i am very glad as she has missed her chance of a coronet i believe he proposed to carmela and went away in a rage because she refused him he has left for constantinople in his yacht and mrs verschoyle would have given her ears to have gone alsothe bold thing the enmity between the sisters still continues and i verily believe mrs verschoyle would kill carmela with pleasure if she could do so with safety i overheard a curious conversation between them and i wonder what it means i was sitting in the drawingroom half hidden by the curtains when the sisters entered the room and began to quarrel as usuala most delightful pair i despise listeners but i could not help myself so had to overhear their conversationunwillingly of course it will be best for me to put it in a dramatic form mrs verschoyle you know you loved him i wonder whom she means carmela yes i did but it was only the fancy of a girl when he married you i did not care a bit about him i see now they are talking of mrs verschoyles husband but he was a good husband to you and you might have made his life happy mrs verschoyle he betrayed me for another woman carmela only after you made his life so unendurable that he had to leave you mrs verschoyle you take his part i believe you are in love with him still carmela i am not and you know it here mrs verschoyle burst into a torrent of such abusive language that as a gentlewoman and a christian i had to interfere carmela left the room and after mrs verschoyles anger had expended itself she relapsed into sulky silence june th such a delightful man is staying heremarchese matteo vassallahe is a cousin of the sisters and is waiting the arrival of the p and o neptune to go on to england i have made a discovery he is in love with carmela and mrs verschoyle is in love with him how strange carmela always seems to stand in the way of her sister and that does not mend the breach between them they went out together and came back quarrellingi suppose about the marcheseand carmela said she was going to england in the neptune june th the neptune has arrived and carmela has secured her passage she is going to sir mark trevor in england and will be escorted by her cousin vassalla i should not wonder if they were engaged by the time they reach london carmela and her sister made up their quarrel and went out together then carmela came back alone almost crying and shut herself in her room mrs verschoyles a minx later on that lady came back in a fearful rage i fancy she must have spoken to some one who differed from her she tried to see carmela but that young lady very properly refused to be further insulted so mrs verschoyle shut herself up in her room carmela went away without saying goodbye to her and mrs verschoyle refused to come to dinner after dinner i went up to her room and knocked at the door it was still locked and i could obtain no answer from her so i went to bed early having a headache june thnext morning mrs verschoyle was not at breakfast and sent down word she had a headache no wonder with the way she lets her violent temper run away with her i saw her later in the day and asked her why she did not answer when i knocked on the previous night she said she was asleep and did not hear me i did not speak to her again she has lost both her lovers and her sister and im not sorry here all extracts from the diary likely to be of any use to us end and if you will read them carefully you will see that according to the report of mrs dexter faithfully given mrs verschoyle did not leave the house on the night of the sailing of the neptune so she could not have been on board and consequently must be innocent of the crime now of course it is a debatable question whether or not mrs verschoyle really did leave the house you will perceive that she refused to come down to dinner and stayed in her own room after dinner mrs dexter went up to her door found it locked and could get no answer now what was easier than for mrs verschoyle to slip out of her room while all were at dinner and the servants away in the kitchen lock her door to lead to the belief that she was still there and go off to the ship commit the crime and come home again unluckily mrs dexter went to bed early or mrs verschoyles return would not have escaped her lynxeyes so if she did go out as i surmiseand mind you it is only a surmisethe servants might have seen her return i therefore questioned the servants but could get no satisfactory answers out of them as they could remember nothing not even money could sharpen their wits in this extremity i bethought myself of boldly asking mrs verschoyle herself and in the drawingroom after dinner i led the conversation round to the excellence of the p and o steamers and asked her if she had seen the neptune she winced and changed colour a little and then answered no mrs dexter then became my ally and the conversation was as follows mrs dexter your sister went to england in the neptune mrs verschoyle yes and so did my cousin the marchese vassalla but for all that i did not see the boat myself whydid you not go on board to say goodbye mrs verschoyle no i had a headache and did not leave my room mrs dexter yes i remember i knocked at your door and could get no answer mrs verschoyle quickly i was asleep myself it was a pity you did not see the neptune she is such a magnificent vessel this closed the conversation and left things as they were you see mrs verschoyle denies that she left the house on that evening so if this is the case she can prove an alibi and thus cannot be accused of committing the crime i however am not satisfied with her denial she winced when i mentioned the neptune moreover i knew that her husband was on board as she met him during the day which by the way explains the passage in mrs dexters diary that she returned in a rage to my mind therefore the only people who can definitely say if she were on board are miss carmela cotoner and the marchese vassalla for even if she went on board secretly to see her husband she could not have escaped notice by her sister and cousin my advice therefore is for you to see either miss cotoner or the marchese vassalla and find out if mrs verschoyle were on board before the neptune sailed if so we can pursue our inquiries if not we must turn in another direction as i have now got all the information i can obtain here i am leaving tomorrow for england and if possible will get the stiletto used in the committal of the crime from the authorities at gibraltar i may add that i have obtained a specimen of mrs verschoyles writing to compare with the paper you gave me and though there is a similarity there is also a distinct difference but then handwriting does alter in five or six years and the best thing will be to submit the papers to an expert who can easily tell if they were written by the same person i will call at mr fosters rooms directly on my arrival in england and report more fully yours obediently julian roper chapter xv marchese matteo vassalla after reading ropers letter ronald went to fosters chambers and showed it to him the barrister read it in silence and then laying it down on the table looked hard at monteith you see i was right he said tapping the letter with his fingers miss cotoner is as i thought the sister of mrs verschoyle yes replied ronald quickly but she has nothing in common with her ah you think notlet me see taking up the letter and glancing over it they both have tempers any woman would show temper living with such a fiend as mrs verschoyle retorted ronald defending carmela they both loved the same manmeaning verschoyle but carmelas love for him was only a girlish fancy as she says herself in mrs dexters diary in short said foster replacing the letter on the table you are so much in love with her that you cannot see her imperfections i am not blind to them if thats what you mean retorted ronald doggedly but all i know is i love her and intend to ask her to be my wife ah well as soon as this mystery is cleared up i understand said foster rising from his chair and walking to and fro but judging from this letter of ropers the elucidation seems as far off as ever i dont see thatfor taking all things into consideration i am inclined to think mrs verschoyle is telling a lie oh so you believe she was on board the neptune that night ronald nodded theres no proof certainly not any actual proof said ronald quietly but i think it is very probable that ropers theory is correct and she did leave her bedroom lock the door and then return without anyone seeing her well the whole affair is easily settledgo and see miss cotoner or vassalla and ask them if mrs verschoyle came on boardthey will certainly know i dont believe miss cotoner knows anything about it said ronald angrily if they quarrelled before leaving the house you may be certain that mrs verschoyle never came near her on the boat but miss cotoner might have seen her sister she might but i wont ask her well my dear boy said foster rather annoyed at this sentimental obstinacy go and see vassalla yes ill do thathell be able to tell me whether she was on board or not no doubtif it suit him to acknowledge it retorted foster dryly what do you mean asked the australian impatiently you think i mean nothingi think nothing replied the other quickly go and see the marchese vassalla and then tell me what you discover and then well then it depends on his answers regarding our next move ronald put on his hat and gloves then taking his leave went outside into the roar and bustle of fleet street through an archway he could see the quiet temple gardens and could not help contrasting their solitariness and charm with the turmoil on the pavements hang it he said to himself as he watched the busy crowds rushing past everyone here seems to live with their watches in their hands i should not like to live here but i suppose ill have to stop till i find out all about verschoyles death and this last reflection putting him in mind of his engagement he stepped into a hansom and drove off to the langham hotel to see vassalla vassalla was upstairs in a private sittingroom enjoying his breakfast when monteiths card was sent to him carmela had gone out with sir mark and his daughter so the marchese felt perfectly secure against the chance of ronald meeting her he dreaded the meeting because disagreeable explanations might be made which would reconcile the lovers and ruin all his carefully prepared schemes as he looked at the card thoughtfully he was rapidly running over in his mind the reasons which might make ronald thus seek him no feasible one however presenting itself to him he told the waiter to show the gentleman up and quietly went on with his breakfast he has some reason for coming he muttered quietly and ill find it out dont trouble yourself mr monteithfriend or enemy im equal to either he arose from his seat with an enigmatical smile on his face as the australian entered and held out his hand the other took it with a slight reluctance which was noticed by the clever maltese gentleman hum he thought not quite friendly i see ronald took a seat declined the offer of breakfast and prepared to talk miss cotoner is out he said coldly yes with sir mark trevor and his charming daughter replied vassalla do you wish to see her no i want to see you me the foreigners eyebrows went up well i am at your disposal it is about that murder that took place on board the neptune said ronald going straight to the point ah indeed said said the marchese quietly a most interesting subject have you discovered anything yet yes many things such as will lead to the detection of the assassin i presume i dont know answered ronald shortly thats a pity can i assist you in any way i think you can then you may command my services replied the marchese politely thank you i will take advantage of your offer said ronald glancing at the impassive face before him vassalla bowed folded his arms and leaning back in his chair prepared to listen in the first place said ronald you knew him vassalla shook his head no i had not the honour of m ventins acquaintance his name was not ventin indeed no it was leopold verschoyle leopold verschoyle repeated the marchese looking at him sharply that was the name of the man who married my cousin yes and from whom he was afterwards divorced exactly said vassalla i see you know the whole story so he is the man who was killed he was and i want to find out who killed him the eyebrows went up again incredulously i hope you will succeed said vassalla politely but in what way can i help you do you know anyone who desired his death no not even hiswife vassalla rose to his feet with a bound and looked fiercely at ronald this is an insult sir he hissed out between his teeth do you dare to accuse my cousin of the murder i accuse no one retorted ronald coolly i merely asked you if his wife would have been sorry at his death vassalla threw himself back in his chair with a short angry laugh upon my soul sir he said coldly i hardly recognise your right to speak to me about such a thing but as you seem so bent on knowing i think she would have beenvery sorry indeed oh then she still loved him vassalla cast his fine eyes up to the ceiling passionately that is curious said ronald sardonically as i have a document in my possession written five or six years ago in which she threatens to kill him indeed and how did you obtain such a document i found it among some papers left by verschoyle with his sister mrs taunton ah vassalla thought a moment so this was the reason monteith was with mrs taunton it was business not love that brought them together well at all events he would not let carmela know after a moments deliberation he faced his adversary with a clear brow very likely it was written in her first outburst of jealous anger at being so betrayed by her husband but i assure you she loved her husband deeply in spite of the way he wronged her and often spoke of him with affection judging from the story told to him by verschoyle and the extracts from mrs dexters diary ronald thought this doubtful but restrained his desire to give an opinion on that point did mrs verschoyle come on board the night the neptune left malta vassalla glanced keenly at him why should she to see you and miss cotoner off suppose she did come on board she might have seen her husband impossible she did not know he was on board yes she did verschoyle told me he met her in valletta on that day vassalla drummed quickly in an annoyed manner on the table with his fingers then answered abruptly she did not come on board oh ronald was disappointed were all his suspicions groundless after all no she was confined to her room all the evening with a headache this statement as ronald knew tallied with mrs dexters diary and he felt that after all it might be the truth and that mrs verschoyle had not been on board in which casewho was the assassin vassalla saw the expression of disbelief flitting across ronalds expressive face and arose to his feet in order to convince you he said quickly i will show you the letter i received from my cousin there is no need began ronald but vassalla interrupted him pardon me there is he said coldly i wish you to be thoroughly convinced that mrs verschoyle was not on board and could not have either seen her husband or have had anything to do with his death i did not say she had interrupted ronald hastily no but you thought so retorted the marchese as he left the room ronald arose to his feet and walked hastily too and fro he was wrong then mrs verschoyle was innocent of her husbands death who then was the assassin for no one else appeared to have had any reason to wish him evil vassalla himself no it could not be he because he had no motive the theory of mrs verschoyles criminality having been thus effectually disposed of there appeared to be absolutely no clue to the perpetrator of the crime vassalla returned with the letter and handed it to ronald showing him at the same time the passage he alluded to i was so sorry said the letter not to have been able to come down and see you and carmela away by the boat but i had a very bad headache and was shut up all the evening in my room ronald handed back the letter in silence but first thoughtfully glanced at the writing it certainly resembled that in the letter written five or six years ago but he could not recollect it with sufficient clearness to satisfy himself you are convinced said vassalla as he placed the letter in his pocketbook yes answered ronald i am convinced goodbye and thank you for your kindness in answering my questions a pleasure said the marchese and bowed his visitor out with smiles which however faded as the door closed curse that meddling fool he muttered to himself why cant he mind his own business but ive baffled him this time and ill baffle him again if he interfere chapter xvi carmela is questioned of course ronald went straight to fosters office and there made his report regarding the statements of vassalla the barrister listened to monteith in silence and when he was in full possession of the facts sat absently scribbling on his blottingpaper much to ronalds disgust at what he deemed his inattention hang it foster said the australian irritably i wish youd say something youve not lost your tongue have you no nor my brains either retorted foster lighting a cigarette youd better have a smoke it will soothe you i dont want to be soothed oh yes you do returned gerald imperturbably try one of these they are real russian cigarettes in order to propitiate his companion ronald took one and smoked away in sulky silence mr foster settled himself deliberately in his chair and fixing his clear eyes on monteith began to talk what do you think of the position of affairs now he asked knocking the ash off his cigarette it seems to me that the games up retorted ronald sullenly on the contrary the game is just beginning to be interesting said foster calmly what do you mean asked ronald sitting up straight in his chair i tell you vassalla not only told me plainly that mrs verschoyle was not on board but showed me a letter in her own handwriting which confirmed it oh yes said foster satirically i must acknowledge its all very beautifully arranged ronald looked at him in amazement what is beautifully arranged he asked shortly the plot plotwhat plot foster arose from his chair and walked slowly to and fro with his hands behind his back i tell you what my boy he said rapidly this thing is becoming more mysterious with every fresh discovery verschoyle had no enemy as far as we know but his wife we have documentary evidence saying she intended to murder him and he was murdered at the very place where she was staying roper says she did not leave the house vassalla says she was not on board her own letter says she was confined to her room with a headache fudge i dont believe any one of them then you think she was on board asked ronald eagerly im certain of it i ask you as a logical man whether a jealous woman like mrs verschoyle knowing her husband was on board the neptune could resist the temptation of seeing him nonsense i tell you she was on board and if vassalla says she was not he has a reason what reason can he have he wants to shield her from the consequences of her crime he is her cousin and blood is thicker than water this is all very well said ronald quietly but all your views are quite theoretical and we cannot obtain a single particle of evidence to prove that she came on board at all how do you know we cannot well theres ropers letterher own letter and vassallas denial who else can prove she was on board miss cotoner oh ronald arose and went to the window i dont think so he said turning round if mrs verschoyle quarrelled with her sister its not likely shed go near her perhaps not but miss cotoner might have seen her youd better go and ask her ronald hesitated a moment then made up his mind very well ill call at the langham this afternoon and may possibly see her but i think its a wild goose chase well see said foster shortly returning to his books while ronald went off to his hotel took a light luncheon then dressing himself carefully ordered a hansom and drove to the langham carmela was in so ronald sent up his card to her and asked for the favour of an interview this however carmela hesitated before granting as she was very angry with ronalds supposed treachery towards herself had she not seen her rival with her own eyes and been told of monteiths infatuation for that detestable woman as she called innocent mrs taunton and now he had the bad taste to ask for an interviewwell she would grant his request and would show him that she was not a woman to be lightly won and thrown over what consummate actresses women are when ronald entered her drawingroom he expected to find carmela pale and anxious through fretting over his long absence from her side and it was rather a blow to his selflove when she came forward with a bright smiling face and outstretched hands how do you do mr monteith she said in her low sweet voice you are quite a stranger ronald muttered something about business as he took her hand and then sat down thinking to himself that this heartless coquette could never have cared for him carmela on her part rang for afternoon tea and then began to talk lightly of the most commonplace topics much to ronalds secret irritation sir mark and miss trevor are out she said gaily leaning back in her chair and it is a mere chance you found me in when do you go to marlow asked the australian abruptly next week i think i must confess i am a little tired of london and vassalla she looked annoyed i do not know what my cousin is going to do ah here is the tea let me give you a cup rising and going to the table thank you said ronald mechanically i want to speak to you on serious business do you indeed carelessly milk and sugar both he answered annoyed at the flippancy of her tone this business is very serious it must be judging from your tone she replied giving him his tea and returning to her own seat by the way what did you think of the italian exhibition what he said with a sudden start oh yes of coursei met you there when i was with mrs taunton carmela winced so her rival was a married woman i do not know her she said idly balancing her spoon on the edge of her cup no he said bending forward but you know a relative of hers indeed carelessly and his name leopold verschoyle carmela let her spoon fall with a crash and turned her pale scared face to ronald quickly leopold verschoyle she said rapidly while her breath came quick and sharp what do you know of leopold verschoyle i know he was your sisters husband was she smiled scornfully you speak in the past tense because of his divorce no i speak in the past tense because of his death death she arose to her feet with a look of horror in her dark eyes is leopold verschoyle dead yes i will tell you all about it if you will answer a question she sat down again pale but composed and the question was your sister mrs verschoyle on board the night the neptune left malta yes ronald sprang to his feet in horror are you sure of course i am she answered raising her eyebrows my sister and myself had a quarrel during the day and i did not say goodbye to her at the house so i suppose she was sorry for she came on board and took leave of me there but vassalla says she was not on board carmela looked surprised why he was with her all the time i was separated from them by the crowd and i did not see my sister again but vassalla told me he had seen her safely down the gangway before the ship sailed ronald sat wrapped in thought so foster was right there was some plot on foot he made another attempt but i saw a letter from your sister to vassalla in which she says she was not on board being confined to her room with a bad headache why should my sister write such a letter asked carmela angrily i dont understand all this mystery there was no reason why she should conceal the fact that she said goodbye to me on board the neptune i hope not he said gloomily what do you mean i mean that your sisters husband was on board what she rose to her feet looking like a tall white lily how is it i never saw him i would know leopold verschoyle among a thousand ronald seeing the deep interest she took in this man became brutal the reason you did not see him he said coldly was because he was murdered and his name was lionel ventin my god a white heap on the floor and ronald bending over it trying to bring her back to consciousness he sprinkled some water on her face and with a low moan she sat up and pushing her dark hair off her forehead looked confusedly at him i must have fainted she said as he assisted her to a seat but the shock was too much god knows i have forgotten leopold verschoyle many long day since but dead oh it is too horrible ronald sat in silence not daring to say anything who killed him she asked suddenly looking up i dont know she clasped her hands over her knees and looked fixedly at him you dont know for certain she said slowly but you have your suspicions and i want to know everything tell me all whereupon ronald told her what had happened and how the links were being slowly added to the chain of evidence that seemed to connect her sister with the crime when he was done she was pale but composed it is very strange she said in her clear voice and i do not know what to say i do not like my sister she is a woman of violent temper but i am certain she would not commit a crime then why does she deny being on board the night the crime was committed i cannot say because she certainly was i must write and ask her i will also speak to vassalla there is something mysterious about this affair but my sister must clear herself it is too horrible that she should be suspected of such a crime and this with a sudden thought is why you are always with mrs taunton yes she is quite distracted over her brothers death vassalla said you loved her ronald sprang to his feet with a cry of anger then he lies the only woman i ever did love and ever shall love is she placed her hand on his lips hush do not mention her name till the mystery of leopold verschoyles death is solved and then he said eagerly catching her hand she drew it away quickly with a stifled cry i cannot say she said wildly wringing her hands god only knows the end my sister must defend herself from this charge i will write to her at once at this moment a knock came to the door and carmela had just time to turn and conceal her haggard face when a servant entered with a telegram and ronald took it while the man retired this telegram is for you he said holding it out for me she said turning and taking it from him what can it be about and she tore open the envelope read the telegram and gave a cry of delight what is it asked ronald anxiously i need not write to malta she said quickly my sister is on her way to england chapter xvii man against woman gerald foster was eagerly awaiting the arrival of ronald in his chambers for he was anxious to know what carmela would say about her sisters movements on the night in question he was pacing up and down his room biting his nails and casting impatient looks at the clock hes a long time away he said aloud i wonder what on earth shes telling him the worst of it is monteith is so transparent that she will see through his motive at once and in order to shield her sister will deny everything they dont like one another but for the credit of her own name she wont say a wordah as a footstep on the stair attracted his attention here is my ambassadori am anxious to learn the new move in the game well as ronald entered the room am i right or wrong ronald threw himself into a seat with an air of lassitude and looked gloomily at the floor you are right foster gave a cry of triumph i knew it things are coming to a crisis my dear fellow and well soon run this woman to earth i hope not you hope notwhy because i am anxious to marry carmela and i do not want to have a murderess for a sisterinlaw whether its made private or public you are bound to have that replied foster dryly my advice is not to marry her but i love her madly said ronald raising his heavy eyes to his friends face it would kill me to lose her men have died and worms have eaten them but love did not kill them said the barrister cynically youll get over this fancy in timebut come tell me all about it so ronald related his interview with carmela to which foster listened attentively i wonder what vassalla will say to that he said when the australian had finished you see mrs verschoyle was on board after all that does not prove her guilty of the murder retorted ronald then why does she try to prove an alibi said foster quickly why everything we find out only makes the case stronger against her i should like to have an interview with her that will be easily managed she is coming to england you dont say so when miss cotoner received a cablegram while i was there said ronald and her sister is on her way now what the deuce does she mean by running her head into the lions mouth observed foster in a puzzled tone she must know that such a crime cannot be passed over in silence ronald looked up suddenly what are you going to do next he asked wearily wait and see roper he is on his way also and i should not be surprised if he came in the same boat with her so he may perhaps give us clearer information than we have already received ronald groaned this is the irony of fate he said in a dull voice had i known how this case was likely to affect the woman i love best in the world i would not have undertaken it and the thing might have remained a mystery for ever possibly replied foster pointedly but you forget others might have taken it up besides when you started in the case you did not love miss cotoner and moreover did not know how closely she was connected with the author of the crime ronald rose to his feet and took his hat and stick i am going to the hotel he said to lie down i feel quite worn out when may i see you again asked foster accompanying him to the door tomorrow when roper arrives and monteith left the room without saying goodbye poor boy said gerald as he went back to his work he is very much cut upand no wonder where will it all end i expect in smoke because the evidence is too slight even to convict that woman well we shall see when roper arrives ronald walked along the crowded street as in a dream and paid no attention to the buzz of voices around and the noise of the traffic so preoccupied he was with his own sad thoughts that he did not see that a man was walking beside him till the latter spoke and then he looked up with a start and saw vassalla looking at him with an amused smile eh my friend said the marchese lightly in what daydream are you lost not a very pleasant one returned ronald coldly i was thinking of our conversation this morning vassalla shrugged his shoulders you might have had more pleasant thoughts he said with a sneer i might returned monteith emphatically i might have thought every word you said this morning true the marchese changed colour a little and drew himself up haughtily is this an insult sir he asked as you please retorted ronald indifferently you will understand my meaning plainly when i tell you that i had the pleasure of an interview with miss cotoner this morning indeed said vassalla his face looking as black as thunder and she said more than you would have cared to hear replied the australian she simply contradicted every word you said and told me that her sister came on board and said goodbye to her and that you the marchese vassalla knew she was there and saw her down the gangway as she left the ship its a lie retorted vassalla livid with rage mrs verschoyle was not on board go and ask miss cotoner she will tell you differently said ronald fiercely you are playing a dangerous game marchese for i have sworn to find out who killed leopold verschoyle and by god ill keep my word you shall answer for this hissed vassalla between his teeth when and where you please retorted the australian if the days of duelling are past in england they are not on the continent and if you care to defend your damnable lies ill meet you anywhere you please you shall hear from me monsieur said vassalla hoarsely and he walked away without another word the black villain muttered ronald as he strode along i believe he knows more about this affair than he cares to tell ive been talking grandiloquently i suppose but ill stick to my word and i think i can hold my own both with pistol and rapier quite a style of conversation of the time of george iii was it not but all young men become romantic at times and ronald brave lad that he was meant all he said being as much in earnest as any periwigged beau of the eighteenth century though he carried a cane instead of a sword the marchese matteo vassalla jumped into a hansom and ordered the cabman to drive to the langham hotel as he was anxious to see carmela and find out all that had taken place between her and monteith it was necessary for him to do this as he was anxious to win her for his wife and the least slip on his part might prove fatal to success he was mad with rage when he entered the cab but by the time it arrived at the langham was quite calm and selfpossessed for he knew he would need to have all his wits about him in the coming interview he dismissed his cab and went up to the drawingroom where he found no one ringing the bell he asked after carmela and was informed that she had gone to lie down but determined to see her he sent up a message that he wanted her immediately on important business and then calmly sat down to think over his line of action the waiter soon returned with a message that miss cotoner would be down shortly and almost immediately after he retired carmela appeared looking white and wan in her long white dress with her dark hair hastily fastened in a dishevelled knot at the back of her head she came quickly into the room and would have spoken but vassalla gave her no time my cousin he said rapidly in french i congratulate you on the success of your interview this morning what do you mean asked carmela haughtily simply this retorted the marchese quietly that i have seen monteith and he told me to my face that you gave me the lie in your conversation with him i did she retorted defiantly my sister was on board and you had no right to say otherwise bah you cannot see an inch before your nose retorted vassalla taking out his pocketbook read this and then see what your truthtelling tongue has done he handed her mrs verschoyles letter which she read eagerly and having finished gave it back to the marchese with a cold smile i see she also denies being on board she said quietly so you are both telling deliberate falsehoods will you kindly explain this riddle to me that will be easy enough my cousin answered the marchese with a sneer i presume monteith told you all about the death of leopold verschoyle well she asked turning a shade paler though heaven knows poor thing she was pale enough before well he echoed mockingly dont you know that your sister was his wife and if it were known she had been on board ugly questions might be asked i understand what you mean said carmela clasping her hands you think that shehad something to do with his death i did not say so no but you hinted as much then accept the hint i give and deny that your sister was on board what deny my own words certainly he replied coolly better than significantly the other thing i dont believe it i dont believe it she cried vehemently bianca did not kill him how do you know he asked pointedly do you also accuse her she said turning fiercely on him i accuse nobody he said coldly i merely tell you to hold your tongue i will justify myself to my sister not to you said carmela proudly she will be here next week whatis she coming here yes my faith what cursed fools women are he cried write telegraph anything only say she must not come why not because there is danger danger yes that meddling young fool of a monteith is trying to find out about verschoyles death if he is successful your sister is lost is she guilty for the second time i sayi did not say so is she guilty yes carmela gave a cry and turned away this answer parted her from ronald for ever in an instant vassalla was at her sideshe felt his hot breath on her cheek but i can save her i can save her he said hurriedlyon one condition and that your hand and he put his arm round her waist never she tore herself away with an indignant cry do you take me for hush money either that or your sister will reap the reward of her crime and our name will be dishonoured for ever think of your name alone she said imploringly you will save her on the condition i mention i dont care for the name i only care for you why will you not marry me you think of the australian he can be nothing to you would you marry the man who is hunting down your own flesh and blood and would he marry the sister of a woman whom he knows is a murderess think again i will save your sister and our family honouron that one conditionyou must be my wife if not she asked defiantly events must take their course i will not interfere if you marry me you will have an honoured name and the satisfaction of knowing that you have saved your sister if you refuse you will lose your honourable name your sister and not even gain your australian lover in return mercy she cried falling at his feet no he stood above her calm and pitiless stroking his beard i will give anything but that she murmured i can accept nothing else you are a devil possibly your answer she sprang to her feet with a face pale as marble and clung to the mantelpiece for support but though vassalla saw she was weak he gave her no assistance your answer he demanded pitilessly yes or no yes she whispered and for the second time that day fainted chapter xviii the secrets of the penny post carmela cotoner to ronald monteith my dear mr monteithi write to let you know that in the interview i had with you yesterday you misunderstood some of my statements my sister mrs verschoyle did not come on board with me to say goodbye when the neptune sailed but did so before i left home you will understand why i write this letter yours truly carmela cotoner poor soul said ronald handing the letter to foster i can understandshe knows her sister is guilty and would shield her yes i can see that said foster glancing rapidly over the letter but how does she know her sister is guilty i dont know said ronald blankly hum answered gerald looking keenly at him let us look into this in the first place did you think she thought her sister guilty when you saw her no eagerly im sure she did not then she must have seen some one in the meantime who told her the truth returned foster now whom did you see in the meantime no one except vassalla returned the australian innocently exactly said the barrister you saw vassalla and told him you knew that he and mrs verschoyle had lied regarding her movements on the night in question well well echoed foster rather annoyed cant you see vassalla knew mrs verschoyle was on board and also that ventin was her husband and told carmela cotoner all about it so to save her sister she has recanted and written a liea white lie poor soul for which she will be forgiven in heaven then what do you think of the whole affair said ronald eagerly i think that vassalla knows more about this affair than we give him credit replied foster shall i answer her letter said monteith after a pause if you like returned the other shrugging his shoulders then i will ronald monteith to carmela cotoner my dear miss cotoneri have received your letter believe me i admire and respect your silence yours truly ronald monteith and what about your marriage asked foster ill wait till i see how this thing is cleared up said ronald and then well whether her sister is guilty or not ill marry her thats a mistake what a mistake to marry a noble woman like that said ronald no foster she has been tried in the furnace and has to my eyes come out pure as gold amen to that sweet prayer quoted foster in his usual cynical voice carmela cotoner to mrs verschoyle i cannot address you as sister till i know the truth of this terrible story your husband was on board the neptune and you saw him there though you denied doing so the question i now ask you is whether this awful thing is true did you have anything to do with your husbands death i know that you are cruel and proud but i do not believe you to be so base as vassalla says before we can meet again i want to be assured that your hands are free from your husbands blood your sister carmela how did she find out asks mrs verschoyle of herself no one could have known that my husband was on board carmela certainly knew i went to see her off but how did she discover that lionel ventin was my husband there must be some traitor in the camp and that traitor is matteo vassalla i will go to him tomorrow and find out the truth if it is as i suspect hell wish he had held his tongue matteo vassalla to carmela cotoner so you are down at marlow i hope you are enjoying the country and getting back the roses to your cheeks for i want my bride to look her best when married to me london is very dull and the only excitement is the arrival of your sister from whom i have a note saying she will call on me tomorrow i will report the result of our interview in some future letter though i hope to deliver it by word of mouth as i am coming down to marlow shortly and will call on you at sir mark trevors place mr monteith is still in town and still on his wildgoose chase from which im afraid hell derive very little gratification i am the only person who can prove absolutely that your sister saw her husband on board and had anything to do with his death and i will keep my own counsel on condition that i receive my rewardyour hand adieu my dear cousin till we meet again yours for ever matteo vassalla so i have to pay the penalty of my sisters crime said carmela to herself on reading this letter in order to save her i have to sacrifice myself oh it is cruel cruel and yet what can i do if she is innocent i am free to marry the man i love but if she is guilty god help me i can do nothing but sacrifice myself to save her ronald monteith to carmela cotoner is it true i ask you is it true this rumour which i hear that you are engaged to your cousin vassalla oh carmela why have you trifled with me in this way you must have seen how i loved you how i worshipped the very ground you trod on and now you coldly throw me on one side and accept the hand of a man whom you do not and cannot care about think of how you are ruining two livesyours and minebefore you take this fatal step once done it cannot be recalled i await your answer and hope you may be able to deny this cruel lie ronald poor ronald mused carmela i am cruel but only to be kind he can nevermarry into a family like ours and the greatest kindness i can do him is to refuse him god knows i love him well enough but he could never trust me once he knows the secret of leopold verschoyles death and that he does know it i am convinced he may blame me now but he will bless me in the future so i had better write and tell him that it is true though my heart may break while i pen the words carmela cotoner to ronald monteith it is true i am the fool of fortune and this match is not of my own making forget that you have ever seen me and your lifes happiness will be the constant prayer of carmela my lifes happiness said ronald with a sob god she breaks my heart ruins my life and talks about praying for my happinessso like a woman so like a woman chapter xix woman against man matteo vassalla was in his sittingroom walking to and fro with his hands in his pockets the maltese gentleman was very well satisfied with himself as all his plans seemed likely to turn out as he wished carmela had promised to marry him and as she had plenty of money this was very satisfactory to the impecunious nobleman she did not love him it was true but then he agreed with rochefoucauld that it is best to begin marriage with a little aversion and then he had the pleasure of taking the prize from under the very nose of his rival the race had been a long one and the prize had been awarded not to the swiftest but to the most diplomatic fate had played into matteos hands and secure in the certainty of his good fortune he strolled gaily up and down the room humming to himself the only thing that troubled him was the coming interview with mrs verschoyle for he knew that lady loved him and if she found out that carmela was engaged to him would do anything to stop the marriage she would fling money character even life itself to attain her ends such was her passionate temper and vassalla knew she was a dangerous adversary the only chance of getting the better of her was to keep cool as she invariably lost her head and gave her adversary time to espy the weak points in her armour so the marchese felt tolerably certain of winning the game but still he had a bad quarter of an hour before him and did not relish the prospect malediction on these women he said stopping in front of the mirror and admiring himself why cant they accept the inevitable and own themselves beaten but no this jade of a bianca will fight to the last i rather admire such tenacity of purpose myself that is when im not the opponent in the game he went to his travelling writingdesk which was lying on a side table and having unlocked it took out carmelas last letter which he read carefully the result of his reading being anything but pleasant to him wants me to release her he muttered throwing down the letter and resuming his walk not igive up the quarry after it has been run to earth my dear carmela you must think me a fool without your fortune youd be a pretty prize but with it my faith its killing two birds with one stonecome in as a knock came to the door mrs verschoyle announced the waiter showing in that lady and closed the door after him leaving the two adversaries face to face with the feeling of battle in the air mrs verschoyle as she called herself though she had no claim to the name being divorced was very like carmela only not quite so handsome while her expression was rather repellent and her lowering eyebrows and firmly closed mouth warned matteo vassalla that she had come with hostile intentions matteo was the first to speak and offered his visitor a chair you will be seated my cousin he asked politely when i choose she said harshly vassalla shrugged his shoulders and produced a silver cigarette case as you please he said carelessly opening it you will smoke no drinkthere is excellent wine here noi tell you she retorted viciously we can dispense with all these formalities marchese eh with a sudden lifting of the eyebrows why so precise my cousin because you are a villain retorted mrs verschoyle bringing her fist down on the table so said matteo with a laugh perhaps you will give me your reasons for calling me such a name the best of all possible reasons you deserve it indeedthe world is not of your opinion bahthe world does not know you ah so you are going to be madame asmodeus and unroof my house for the benefit of my neighbours and vassalla having lighted a cigarette sat down and prepared to listen he had not long to wait for mrs verschoyle burst out into a perfect volley of imprecations in italian to which vassalla listened very quietly youre not improving he said coolly when she stopped for want of breath but all this is talk i want to know the reason of your visit mrs verschoyle took off her gloves sat down in a chair and dragging it up to the table placed her elbows thereon and began to talk rapidly you maltese dog she hissed between her teeth i know allyes alldid i not meet signor clement at the strada cristoforo and did he not tell me that you were as the shadow of my sister carmelo and that you wanted to become her husband speak you traitoris it not true before i answer that question sad vassalla calmly knocking the ash off his cigarette first tell me who is this signor clement that knows so much of my affairs he came from england when shortly after your ship arrived in london did he stop at the signora briffas yes and asked questions he asked me none but ah with a gesture of impotent rage that dexter she gave him all the lies of me i am certain exactly and he told you that i was making love to carmela and advised you to come to england how did you know asked mrs verschoyle looking at him with fiery eyes because i have my suspicions that this clement is a spy a spyfor whaton whom for murderon you mrs verschoyle grew deathly pale she clenched her hands and her two black eyes glared like burning coals at her cousin bah she said at length making a snatch at one of her gloves this is a childs story no upon my honour its not i dont know for certain but i could swear this man is a spy why should he go out to valletta lodge at the same house as you and tell you this about me because he wanted you to come to englandbecause he is employed by an australian devil called monteith to hunt you down and accuse you of the murder of your husband leopold verschoyle vassalla arose to his feet while speaking and went over to the woman who cowered in her chair like a savage beast subdued for the moment by a masters eye its a liea lie she hissed tearing her glove viciously who can prove i was on board carmela carmela she bounded to her feet her face working with fury she would not dare she has done so and told monteith my god my god cried mrs verschoyle stamping up and down the room oh that my fingers were round her throat she has taken my lovers from me and now shed take my life bah with a sudden change they cant prove anything

bloodhound when he thinks his game sure and you will marry me we will go back to our beautiful malta and there be happy this woman wooed with all the caressing fierceness of the south her harsh voice sank to a liquid murmur and her wonderful eyes lost their savage gleam and became melting and tender you will marry me she whispered softly vassalla sneered to himself then rising suddenly removed her arms from around his neck impossible he said coldly i am engaged to carmela mrs verschoyle sprang back her eyes blazing with anger and dashed the fragments of her glove in his face ingrate traitor scoundrel you shall suffer for this not at your hands with a soft laugh yes at my hands i have your letters written when you truly loved me when you said you would kill silence devil and matteo his face set and stern caught her arm i will not be silent screamed mrs verschoyle struggling to get free you shall not marry carmela i shall it is the price of your safety my safety and she suddenly grew calm yes carmela would have married the australian i hated him and wanted her he has been searching for the person who killed leopold verschoyle and the evidence all points to you he asked me if you were on board that night i said no i showed your letter he asked carmela she said yes the fool i made her write a letter denying it she will keep silent for your sake no one but i can prove it i will keep silent on condition that i marry carmela she has accepted me and you will not refuse your consent i will you will not dog let me go not till you consent no vassalla released her and went to the door of his room i will be back in a few moments he said coldly if you consent and promise not to trouble me i will save you if not you must take the consequences and he went into his bedroom and shut the door mrs verschoyle recovered herself by a strong effort and going to the sideboard poured out half a glass of brandy which she drank off this seemed to do her good for she put her bonnet straight smoothed her hair and producing another pair of gloves from her pocket put them on then she went round the room looking at things until she came to the table whereon lay vassallas portfolio she saw carmelas letter and first glancing towards the door to make sure he was safe snatched it up and devoured every word of it then throwing it down she ransacked the portfolio with nimble fingers evidently to see if there were more it is here it is here she muttered glancing rapidly over the papers ah and with a cry of delight she picked up a letter and slipped it into her pocket just as she did this she heard vassallas foot and knew he was returning pushing all the papers back she ran noiselessly to the mirror leaving the portfolio in the same disorder as she had found it and was arranging her bonnet strings when vassalla dressed to go out entered the room putting on his gloves your answer he said sharply mrs verschoyle turned to him with a smiling face i am beaten yes he looked at her suspiciously you mean it on condition that you stop the bloodhound agreed and now let us go out where is carmela she asked as he held the door open at marlow with sir mark trevor do you want to see her no that is not at present she answered going down the stairs where does the bloodhound live why do you want to know he asked sharply you neednt tell me unless you like said mrs verschoyle haughtily i only asked from idle curiosity i believe he is stopping at the tavistock hotel in covent garden oh carelessly as they stepped out to the street this is my cab can i take you anywhere no thank you said matteo helping her in goodbye at present ill see you again soon i hope so replied mrs verschoyle and matteo walked away as the cab drove off mrs verschoyle lay back and smiled you think you have won she murmured glancing at the stolen letter but there are always two to a game my dear matteo you forget that chapter xx julian roper reports julian roper alias signor clement had come to london in the same boat as mrs verschoyle and had made profitable use of his time by inflaming that ladys anger on the morning after his arrival he went to fosters chambers in order to make his report and there found his employer ronald monteith in anything but a joyful frame of mind poor ronald was very much cast down by the news of carmelas engagement to the marchese though foster tried to console him to the best of his ability she is acting under compulsion my dear boy said gerald vassalla has been telling her that mrs verschoyle is the assassin of her husband and has demanded her hand as the price of his silence how does he know that mrs verschoyle is guilty asked ronald fiercely we have proved nothing she may be as innocent as you or i for all we know my dear lad said foster shrugging his shoulders we can only go by circumstantial evidence in this case and you must acknowledge things do look very black against mrs verschoyle oh why did i ever start trying to find out the murderess of leopold verschoyle groaned ronald laying his head on the table rather why did you fall in love with carmela cotoner said foster not unkindly well talk no more of this said ronald hastily rising to his feet till we see roper and hear what he has to say so gerald pitying the young mans sorrow in his kindly heart went back to his musty law papers and signor jiltedinlove looked out of the window in sulky silence yet not sulky poor lad for his heart was aching with the thought of his future life being passed without carmela having with the fine chivalrous feelings of youth vowed hed marry no other lady soon julian roper arrived and was welcomed with heartfelt joy by both gentlemen who sprang with alacrity to their feet to greet him he entered quiet and impassive as ever but his sharp blue eyes took in at a glance the haggard looks of the australian youve been fretting mr monteith he said looking keenly at him bah dont mind me said ronald peevishly im a little jaded with london gaiety tell us all you have learned i have not much to tell said roper smoothly you read my letter yes we read your letter echoed foster quickly that mrs dexter said mrs verschoyle had not been out of the house monteith saw vassalla who corroborated the fact and showed me a letter from mrs verschoyle which proved mrs dexters statement to be true but go on said roger calmly i like butsthere is always a chance of another step being made when but comes into the question what did you do after seeing vassalla addressing himself to the australian i saw miss cotoner burst out monteith humphthere was a world of meaning in ropers voice and she said that mrs verschoyle had been on board i thought so and afterwards denied it indeed ropers eyebrows went up at whose instigation vassallas broke in foster hastily before ronald could speak i thought so said the detective calmly why did you think so asked monteith impatiently in the first place remarked roper complacently i had the honour of coming home in the same boat with mrs verschoyle secondly i made her acquaintance as signer clement and she liked me very much i had frequent conversations with her and told her i was a friend of vassallas but you dont know him said ronald alls fair in love war anddetective work observed roper quietly i told mrs verschoylewho i knew from mrs dexters diary was in love with vassallathat the marchese wanted to marry carmela cotoner her sister thats true enough said foster hes engaged to her now whereat ronald winced the result was i aroused her jealousy and she swore that she would prevent the marriage but how from ronald eagerly fain to cling like a drowning man to a straw thats what i could not find out said roper thoughtfully she said she could stop the marriage and vassalla would have to obey her now what logical inference do you draw from this that vassalla committed the murder said ronald hastily not necessarily replied roper dryly but this that if vassalla knew she was on board that night he also knew she committed the murder and would therefore have a power over her but her determination to stop the marriage shows that she must have some power over him so that either she is innocent or he committed the murder himself and she can force him by fear of exposure to do what she wants and which of these theories do you think is right asked foster i am doubtful said the detective becoming a little agitated but ii have a third theory yes said ronald in a quiet tone looking strangely at the detective roper arose to his feet and took a walk up and down the room for a minute then turned to the young men who were puzzled by his curious manner of course its only a theory said roper nervously butbuti can only tell you what i think tell us in heavens name cried foster rising then i think miss carmela cotoner committed the crime what ronald sprang to his feet and made a spring at the detective but foster caught him and held him back be quiet ronald be quiet he said firmly a lie a cursed black lie panted ronald glaring at the detective who stood quietly looking at him what proof what pro dn you sir where is your proof roper took out of his pocketbook the yellow scrap of paper given by mrs taunton and the fragment of a letter written by carmela to her sister i obtained these through mrs dexter he said quietly placing them on the table look ronald looked for a moment then reeled back into fosters arms my god my god he sobbed my god the handwritings were identical in every particular foster went to a cupboard and got ronald a glass of brandy which he forced him to swallow then leaving the young man in the chair with his face buried in his hands he sat down at his own table and began to speak to foster how did you make this discovery he asked quietly i remembered in mr monteiths story said roper that both sisters loved the husband and i wondered if it were not possible that the younger might commit the crime quite as well as the elder though i confess to you i had no grounds for my suspicion as i told you in my letter i obtained a specimen of mrs verschoyles handwriting and found by comparison with this paperlaying his hand on the yellow sheetthat though there was a similarity there was also a slight difference this began to confirm my theory and by the kind aid of mrs dexter i obtained this letter of miss cotoners by which you will see they correspond in every particular at this moment ronald arose from his seat and staggering to the table produced from his pocketbook the note written to him by carmela before the neptune reached gibraltar laying this down by the other papers with a shaking hand at the first glance it could be seen the handwritings were identical its true groaned ronald my god its true and he fell heavily into his chair again and what is your opinion asked foster my theory corrected roper is this i think miss cotoner saw her old lover on the boat and committed the murder trusting to the presence of her sister on board to shield her from the consequences of her crime i also believe that vassalla knows she is guilty and has threatened to tell unless she marry him yes but what about mrs verschoyle oh i think she knows that carmelas guilty and threatens to expose her if she will not refuse to marry vassalla it all seems clear enough said foster thoughtfully yes but its a dd lie for all that said ronald springing to his feet and oh how haggard and worn his young face looked look here you fellows i love miss cotoner and i dont believe shes guilty i think that cursed vassalla is at the bottom of it all im going to marlow where carmela is and there ill act a part ill see her speak to her and find out everything but i must have your promise not to move in the matter till i tell you we cannot promise said roper whose servant are you asked ronald fiercely will you do what i tell you the law began roper hang the law and you too burst out ronald if carmela is guilty you cant arrest her on the evidence you have but shes innocentinnocent dye hear ill stake my head on it give me a month to clear her and if i dont do it by then the law can take its course agreed said roper for my part said foster i dont care if the case stops now i only want a month cried ronald and ill prove her innocence if i have to tear the truth out of vassallas black heart because of a little superficial evidence you believe her guilty i dont i love her and ill clear her so help me god theatrical no doubt but both the men felt that the lad spoke from his heart ill have another glass of brandy foster said ronald quietly he got it and drank it tis but a step from the sublime to the ridiculous chapter xxi at marlow regatta sir mark trevors family mansion as everyone knows is in cornwall but being passionately fond of the river thames he had bought a place down at hurley where he passed the summer months and there entertained his large circle of friends the idle pleasant life of the river suited the baronet to perfection and being a man fond of books and antiquities he found the neighbourhood quite to his taste much preferring the unpretending house at hurley to his grand hall in cornwall and the pleasant vales and hills of bucks to the wild tors and ironbound coasts of the west country bellfield as it was calledthe name being an invention of sir marks happy combination of his daughters name and the fields which surrounded the housewas not a very large place it had originally been a farmhouse and stood near the high road while beyond arose the sloping hills with a fringe of trees on top and down towards the river stretched broad fields all yellow with waving corn the original portion of the house was built of flint and sir mark had added to it until the whole place looked nothing but a mass of gables covered with trelliswork and overgrown with creeping plants but a very comfortable house it was the favourite apartment being a kind of smokingroom which opened on to a glass porch and beyond a wide lawn a gorse hedge yellow with blossom and a view of tall beeches and glimpses of distant hills the walls of the smokingroom were covered from top to bottom with cartoons from vanity fair only leaving one space where guns daggers swords and other warlike instruments were displayed plenty of low basketchairs soft fur rugs side tables with a generous profusion of pipes tobacco and cigarettes and on the large table near sir marks writing desk a spiritstand always stood ready together with an unlimited supply of soda and seltzer for thirsty boating parties there was a piano in one corner with piles of new music principally it must be confessed of the comic opera and musichall orders and over the piano a foxs head and brush trophies of miss bells prowess in the hunting field off this snuggery was the saddleroom which the young men and indeed not a few of the ladies used to vote awfully jolly in the expressive slang of today there were plenty of bedrooms lowpitched and quaint wide staircases with unexpected turnings and twistings and an oakpanelled diningroom wherein sir marks guests used to wax noisy at meals but the favourite room of the house was undoubtedly the smokingroom and in it on this bright july morning all the guests staying at bellfield were waiting ready to start for the marlow regatta and a very jovial party they were pat ryan having returned from the emerald isle was talking his usual nonsense to pretty kate lester who was stopping at bellfield with her uncle a gentleman who passed most of his time asleep he had declined to go to the regatta and was already lying in one of the low basket chairs pretending to read the times bell was standing by carmela who looked pale and white as she listened to mr chesters chatter giving that brilliant youth the mistaken idea that he had made an impression sir mark was moving about from one to the other with his grave smile and two young ladies arrayed in white serge dresses with jaunty straw hats were flirting desperately with a young oxonian called wellthirp but familiarly known as bubbles from his effervescent flow of spirits wed better start im thinking observed mr ryan to the company its a mighty bad thing wasting all this beautiful morning you wont come uncle asked kate going over to her avuncular relative not today my dear im a little tired begad hes the seven sleepers rolled into one said pat to miss lester as they stepped out into the sunshine come miss lester ill race ye for a pair of gloves against what asked kate as he helped her through the gate a kiss said pat whereupon kate blushed and vowed she wouldnt run so pat set off like a deer by himself along the narrow path which led through the cornfield to the village of hurley how sad you are looking carmela said sir mark as he walked soberly along beside miss cotoner she wants mr monteith said bell mischievously nonsense retorted carmela while a flush came over her pale face then shell soon be gratified laughed sir mark for mr monteith will be at the regatta today carmela clenched her teeth he would be at the regatta and how would he meet her after all that had passed the last time she saw him she was free but now he would see her as the affianced wife of another well she would wait and see their meeting must come sooner or later so why not now the party went through the quaint village of hurley past the old bell inn with its antique gables and wide windowsthrough the remains of the old monastery which was one of the finest in england and along by lady bell place with its old walls and picturesque red roof under which the conspirators of met to mature their plot for driving james ii from his kingdom over the bridge they went and found the river crowded with boats filled with men in flannels and pretty girls in yachting costumes all waiting for the lock to be opened sir marks boats were below hurley lock so they all went down only pausing a moment to look into the lock filled with boats and presenting a blaze of colour a number of young fellows were leaning on the great arms of the lock gate chattering idle nonsense to the pretty girls in the boats below i wonder how many engagements these flirtations at the locks have been accountable for said pat sentimentally to kate as he handed her into his boat im sure i dont know retorted kate and a pretty flush dyed her cheek though to be sure it might only have been the sun shining through her red sunshade why do you ask because id like one more to be added to the number said ryan audaciously whereat kate blushed again and was spared the trouble of answering by bubbles telling the irishman to push off and not talk so much pat consented with an ill grace for versed as he was in affairs of the heart he saw that kate knew his feelings and responded to them kate and carmela sat in the stern of the boat the former steering while carmela sat idly gazing at the gay throng on the river her thoughts far away with ronald monteith they passed temple court embowered among trees and had to take their turn in entering the lock which gave pat and bubbles lots of opportunity to converse and chaff their friends indeed it was really wonderful how many people these young men knew and even carmela smiled as she heard pats witty tongue running riot at last they got into the lock bubbles skilfully piloting them and as the boat sank rapidly to the lower reach several ladies in other boats shrieked but were pacified when the water ceased to fall begad theyre as bad as banshees said pat whereon he was once more told to hold his tongue by bubbles who was captain and soon they were out again on the broad river with the roar of the weir in their ears an would ye like to tow down asked pat persuasively of kate but that young lady declined on the plea of heat so pat had to give up his idea of a flirtation on the towingpath and work hard instead theres bisham said bubbles as they passed the grey old abbey where shelley wrote his revolt of islam floating in a boat under the beeches begad i hope he had a lady with him said pat gaily theres nothing stirs imagination like a pretty girl your imagination is quite vivid enough already said carmela theres marlow church and marlow bridge observed bubbles still in the character of guide book where the bargees ate puppy pie put in ryan but here we are at shawsshall we go on shore or stop in the boat both ladies preferred to go on shore so after making the boat fast among all the other crafts pat and bubbles put on their coats and handed the ladies out sir marks boat was nowhere to be seen whereupon pat proposed to go over to the anglers hotel and see what was doing there i believe you want to drink said kate severely as they walked over the bridge and small shame to me retorted the undaunted pat havent i rowed ye down under a blazing sun i suppose you must be rewarded said carmela with a smile so pat and bubbles nothing loth went into the quaint inn which bears the sign of the anglers and had two tankards of foaming beer xerxes wanted a new pleasure said bubbles when he had finished id have given him a thirsty day on the river with a pot of beer handy pat laughed at this and they went out to join the ladies who were seated under one of the big trees talking to two men hullo said bubbles where did these johnnies spring from but pat did not hear him as he was running towards the taller of the two and was soon shaking him heartily by the hand my dear ronald he said eagerly how are ye im glad to have a look at ye again and foster too oh we are a happy family but neither carmela nor ronald looked very happy pat introduced bubbles who speedily made himself at home and both foster and ronald declining mr ryans hospitable invitation to drink they all went over the bridge again to see the races a bright day gaily dressed crowd the broad blue river crowded with crafts and the green country and picturesque redroofed houses on either sidenothing could be more delightful pat bubbles and foster all ardent boatingmen shouted vociferously as the boats went shooting up the stream their oars flashing in the sunlight and the cheers that rang through the air when the winning crew won by a boats length were as hearty for the losers as for the victors ronald however looked grave and haggard as he stood by carmelas side watching the races he kept glancing at her face and saw that she too was pale and thin while everyone else was bright and gay enjoying the animated scene only those two unhappy lovers were brooding over their sorrows she could not have committed such a crime thought ronald his eyes fixed absently on the bright waters he can never believe that i am marrying my cousin willingly she thought with a sigh he must know that its to save my sister i had your letter said ronald in a low whisper in her ear and you understood my reasons she asked though her lips grew white he bowed thinking she alluded to her crime is it true he asked huskily yes god forgive me it is she replied thinking he was referring to her sisters sin ronald gave a shudder and turned away as white as a sheet from her own lips he muttered it is impossible ill ask her again ah me how often cross purposes mar our lives after that the party went down to the boats to luncheon and sir mark delighted to see the young men asked them to dinner we dine at seven he said hospitably where are you stopping the crown hotel replied foster then youll come and dine with me tonight said sir mark yes answered ronald eagerly for he thought he then could speak freely to carmela we shall be delighted foster saw what his friend wanted so gladly accepted the invitation the more so as he felt a decided inclination to improve his acquaintance with miss trevor whose bright eyes had made an impression on his heart ronald had no more speech with carmela that day and kept aloof from her a fact she attributed to his knowledge of her engagement with vassalla the rest of the afternoon passed rapidly and though there was to be a procession of illuminated boats that night the bellfield party said they would go home and departed up the river in the gathering shadows sir marks cheery voice being the last heard seven oclock my boys he sang out not a minute later chapter xxii the testimony of the dagger ronald and foster went up to the crown hotel which is at the top of the principal street in marlow from which point two streets branch off to right and left one leading to little marlow the other to the village of medmenham a quaint battered old obelisk of stone surrounded by an iron railing stands in what is called the market place and serves as a signpost the hotel itself with its archway in the middle which divides it into two parts was mostly occupied with boating men in their picturesque flannels and as the young fellows went upstairs to dress they saw the bar crowded with thirsty souls ronald was ready first and putting a light coat over his evening dress went down to order a dogcart to take them to hurley and then amused himself by observing the different people with which the place was thronged getting tired of this he strolled through the diningroom to the quaint garden at the back with the red brick walls all softened by time and covered with peach trees its like the song said ronald looking at all the harmonious tints softened under the fading twilight of the sky and he commenced to hum hope temples song the old garden when he heard foster calling him and found that gentleman waiting for him in the dogcart jump up my boy said mr foster weve no time to lose its past six now all right replied ronald pulling out his pipe wait till i light up and having done so he sprang up to the side of his companion and they were soon spinning swiftly down the high street of marlow i know the way said foster so ill drive ronald nodded by way of response as they went over the bridge and they saw the river dim and fantasticlooking below while the lights were twinkling in the windows of houses and the air was full of floating shadows in front arose the great mass of quarry woods with here and there a tall tree standing out sharply against the clear glow of the sky an owl hooted in the distance and then there came the deep sound of a dogs bark as the two young men drove swiftly along did you speak to miss cotoner today asked foster after a pause i did notexactly said ronald hesitatingly taking the cigar out of his mouth but she asked me if i knew the reason she was marrying her cousin i said yes and asked was it true and her answer was god help me it is true humph said foster thoughtfully she might not have been referring to your thought that she killed verschoyle but to her own that she marries him to shield her sister then you think she is innocent cried ronald eagerly i dont know replied foster but i would certainly give her the benefit of the doubt rather than condemn her unheard condemn her echoed ronald bitterly god knows id give my life to prove her innocent it wont be required of you dear boy retorted foster coolly the whole affair seems to be a deuced muddle and its my opinion that vassalla is at the bottom of it however well see what success you meet with tonight ronald did not answer but gripping his cigar hard with his lips puffed away fiercely they drove through the village of bisham up the long hill and down through the temple park each absorbed in his own thoughts until they found themselves in front of bellfield where a groom was waiting at the gate to take charge of the horse the two young men alighted and entered the house where they were welcomed by sir mark who after they had removed their cloaks led the way to the smokingroom where chester bubbles pat and a young oxonian by name hammond were assembled the ladies were not yet in the drawingroom so the hospitable baronet proposed a glass of sherry and bitters which was accepted by all the young men and then they began to talk about the days regatta until the servant announced the arrival of the bishop of patagonia his wife and mrs pellypop the most stately thing in the world is undoubtedly a swan the next a bishop and when the worthy churchman walked in tall and dignified no one would have thought how he quailed before his motherinlaw but such is the superior force of women that they can subdue even the haughtiest natures to their yokeif they go the right way about it my lord bishop was very affable and very condescending and when they went to join the ladies in the drawingroom pat pronounced him a good sort and he whose experience was extensive knew a good sort when he saw one mrs pellypop tall and majestic in black velvet and lace mrs bishop timid and nervous hid herself under the matrimonial wing and all the ladies looked even more charming in evening dress than during the day at the sound of the gong sir mark gave his arm to mrs pellypop he ought to have done so to the bishops lady but then mrs pellypop always insisted on going first the bishop escorted miss trevor as the hostess and ronald found himself walking by carmela they spoke very little to one another carmela talking principally to bubbles who sat beside her and ronald listening to the talk of a young lady next to him who was a girton girl and thought she knew everything whereas she knew nothingnot even what a bore she was ronald thought the dinner was interminable but it came to an end as all things must and the ladies followed bell out of the room the gentlemen left to themselves waxed merry over their wine but were restrained from transgression by the presence of the bishop which that astute prelate quickly perceived and left the room followed by sir mark truth to tell both gentlemen were anxious to escape in order to discuss a high church question then vexing the land mr ryan said sir mark as he left the room you can look after my guests faith i will cried pat taking the hosts chair now then boys fill up and no heel taps ronald my boy youre like a deaths head pass the claret and dont be bringing your egyptian mummies to the feast under the influence of pat everyone woke up and the wine was circulated and also several stories the morality of which was doubtful after they had had enough wine all the gentlemen adjourned to the drawingroom where they found the girton girl at the piano wailing out the last new sentimental ballad called columbine which was very milkandwatery but useful in keeping the conversation going then mrs bishop tickled the piano in a mild clerical way playing the maidens prayer as taught to her by mrs pellypop who learned it in her youth somewhere about the reign of george iii carmela was asked to sing but refused whereupon pat sat down and sang i love a lubly gal the melody of which brought all sorts of memories to ronalds heart as he remembered the days on board the neptune he looked at carmela but saw she had arisen from her seat and had gone out into the moonlight ronald sprang to his feet and snatching up a light cloak ran out to place it on her shoulders you will catch cold miss cotoner he said politely placing it round her carmela accepted his attention passively and they walked in silence round the house until they came to the lawn a ruddy glare of light blazed across it which proceeded through the open door of the smokingroom and it looked so warm and comfortable that they both moved simultaneously towards it and stepped in it will be warmer here said ronald ceremoniously removing the cloak from his companions shoulders while she knelt in front of the fire and spread out her hands to the blaze the australian leaned against the mantelpiece tall and stately and looked sadly at the girl at his feet yes replied carmela slowly it will bewhy do you speak to me so coldly she asked suddenly how would you have me speak he said bitterly you cannot expect me to say much to another mans promised wife this was brutalshe arose to her feet i did not expect that from you she said you are unjust i am forced into this you are not he began but she stopped him i think we will go to the drawingroom mr monteith she interrupted will you give me your arm this is a pleasant room with an effort at gaiety yes very he replied they were both acting a part look at all these guns and daggers said carmela stopping before them and theres a stiletto get it down will you mr monteith ronald took down the weapon overcome with vague emotions a stiletto the very weapon she had used to but noit could not be true its very pretty said carmela taking it to the lamp to examine it i had one once with an ivory handlethe head of bacchus surrounded with bunches of grapes ronald gave a cry she was describing the very stiletto by which verschoyle had been killed great heavens could it be that she was guilty after all head of bacchusgrapes waswas that yours he stammered yes she replied laying down the weapon on the table and looking at him in a puzzled manner when did you see it last oh not for many years it has been lost for a long time was she trying to shelter herself under the cloak of a lie ronald was determined to know the worst he sprang forward and caught her wrist she recoiled with a cry of alarm now tell me the truth panted ronald his eyes blazing fiercely tell me the truth i will not betray you what do you mean did you kill him kill himwhom leopold verschoyle are you mad she flung away his hand and drawing herself up to her full height looked like an angry goddess at the man who thus insulted her but ronald was too excited to heed her and his words came pouring out in one torrent yes i am madmad to believe anything against you who are as pure as an angel im only a poor devil who loves you and want you to tell me all you know about this murder so that i can save you save memurder she reeled a little and caught hold of the table for support look look cried ronald pulling out his pocketbook with the fatal paper which he had brought on purpose look herespreading it outyour writingyour writing carmela glanced at it and a film came over her eyes yes its my writingsevenseven years ago then the stiletto by which he was killed you have described it you were on board you recognised him i did not she spoke the words firmly no until you told me the other day who the murdered man was i had no more idea than you had at malta that lionel ventin was leopold verschoyle i did write that note when i was mad with the treatment i had received i was only a girl and acted foolishly as girls will i did have such a stiletto but i have not seen it for years i gave it to my cousin vassalla about five years ago vassalla ronald looked up suddenly are you sure yes he took a fancy to it and i presented it to him did you believe me guilty suddenly no on my soul i did not can i believe you yesappearances were against you but i swore you wereinnocent i told the detective so detective is a detective employed yes by youdont deny it i see it in your face oh god wringing her hands what am i to do you will ruin my sister ronald suddenly grew calm carmela you know i love you dont speak of love at such a time i must i believe i can save your sister you can yes i think so she clasped her hands with a gesture of entreaty oh if you only could she cried passionately i would not then be forced to marry vassalla that is one of my reasons for trying to save her he said i do not want you to sacrifice yourself in this waybut we must not talk we must act and he struck the bell on the table what would you do she asked you must tell my friend foster all you know about your sisters marriage he is a lawyer and will find a way out of this dilemma the servant appeared tell mr foster to come here the servant disappeared how can you save my sister she asked quickly is she innocent i dont know he replied evasively but even if she is guilty ill save her mr foster entered the room well said that gentleman whats the matter miss cotoner would like to tell you a story said ronald quietly carmela sat down and so did foster who was now all attention while ronald leaned against the mantelpiece and listened eagerly this thought foster as he settled himself is the beginning of the end chapter xxiii a look into the past someone in the drawingroom was playing a valse loves sorrow and in after years ronald could never hear the melody without recalling the scene in the smokingroom at bellfield the eminently masculine characteristics of the room the steady glow of the lamp the quiet cold moonlight outside and those two figures seated before him his friend foster with his keen eyes fixed on carmelathe woman he loved seated in the low chair looking like a statue with her white dress and rigid face and the mockery of that brilliant valse music sounding fitfully at intervals while this bitter scene was taking place i will tell you all i know about leopold verschoyle said carmela in low steady tones clasping her hands before her though i do not know i can throw any light upon the subject of his murder but you can hear and judge for yourselves when i first met leopold he was a fascinating man of the world and i but a simple girl of nineteen my sister was four years older and we both fell in love with him he paid his addresses to both of us and i think it was then my sister first began to hate me though heaven knows she had no cause to do so for he married her and left me to make the best of myas i thought thenbroken heart i have recovered however and now that the scales have fallen from my eyes i see that leopold verschoyle was not worthy of being loved and as long as he gratified his own selfish passions cared nothing for the lives he wrecked when he married my sister in the first burst of passion i wrote that paperpointing to the tablebut it was merely an outcome of girlish anger i wrote it blindly and did not mean what i said indeed i had forgotten all about it till mr monteith showed it to me just now why leopold verschoyle kept it i dont know unless to laugh at my folly and petulance well i went to england after he deceived me and stayed with sir mark trevor but i must tell you that my sister had another lover matteo vassalla but i thought he loved you broke in ronald impetuously now she replied quietly but seven years ago it was my sister and he went nearly out of his mind when he found her married he used to rave to me that he would kill verschoyle but of course this was merely a fit of madness the same as came over me when i wrote that letter he also left malta and travelled in the east and before he went i gave him the stiletto for a keepsake we did not see one another for many years as i lived quietly in england as for the rest you know all about my sisters unhappy life how her husband separated from her and went with elsie macgregor then she found out his infidelity and obtained the divorce he went to australia with elsie macgregor whom i heard he had made his wife and now she is dead said foster slowly unlucky woman replied carmela calmly but then everyone who had to do with leopold verschoyle was unlucky when my sister obtained her divorce she asked me to come and live with her in valletta and as i was alone in the world i agreed to do so but we did not get on well together she hated me and always said that leopold verschoyle loved me best did she threaten him in any way asked foster eagerly not in any special way she raved and stormed but then she was always doing that her molehills were mountains i bore with her as long as i could till vassalla came home and wanted to marry me my sister however fell in love with him and longed for that which she had formerly rejected i did not like my cousin and told him so but he would not be discouraged and of course this only made matters worse when the neptune arrived i had already taken my passage and was much surprised when vassalla told me he was leaving malta also it was too late to go in another boat or i would certainly have done so my sister had a quarrel with me on that day when you to monteith saw us on the barraca and i left her and walked home to our lodgings i never saw her again till we met on board before the boat left then she was on board asked ronald quickly yes it is no use me denying it she was on board and appeared to be very excited she said she had seen leopold in valletta that day but did not tell me he was on board the boat then she together with vassalla became separated from me in the crowd and i never saw her again after the boat sailed i asked vassalla why she had not said goodbye and he informed me that the crowd was so great she could not find me and went on shore as the last bell rang was vassalla excited when he spoke to you asked the barrister thoughtfully no as cool and quiet as he generally is when the murder was discovered did he say anythingmake any remark no except to mention that a passenger called mr ventin had been killed did he see the body said foster turning to ronald i dont think so replied ronald doubtfully very few saw the body but of course he must have known that verschoyle was on board how so because verschoyle was leaning over the side of the ship when the new passengers were coming up and he must have recognised him especially when mrs verschoyle told him she had seen her former husband he would then be on the lookout for him humphyesno doubt replied foster thoughtfully can you tell us anything else miss cotoner nothing she answered rising to her feet except that vassalla told me my sister had committed the crime and instructed me to deny seeing her on board which i didi wrote to you turning to to monteith yes i understood your letter he said gently and carmela flashed a grateful look at him vassalla said he was the only one who could bring the crime home to my sister she went on and made me promise to marry him as the price of his silence but you will not do so cried monteith what can i do she said helplessly i cannot see my sister accused of such a crime when i know it is in my power to prevent it he wont accuse her broke in foster bluntly then you think she is innocent said carmela joyfully i dont know that answered foster the whole affair seems to lie between your sister and vassalla he knows more about this affair than we think your sister is in englandis she not yes you have not seen her no i refused until she cleared herself of this charge do you know why she came here no because the detective we sent out told her that the marchese wanted to marry you and she came to stop the marriage bah said carmela scornfully she knows i dont care for vassalla true enough answered foster quietly but she knows vassalla cares for you what will be the consequence she will try and make vassalla break off the marriage if he refuse well they both cried in a breath my dear young people said foster in rather an annoyed tone dont you see what must happen mrs verschoyle will lose her head and they will quarrel and when thieves fall out honest men get their due but i dont see began ronald of course you dont said gerald with a dry laugh but if that interview has taken place ill bet you what you like one of us three will hear from mrs verschoyle for if her temper is what you say shell move heaven and earth to stop the marriage i hope so said carmela sadly of course she will replied foster cheerfully she will throw away honour fortune life itself to obtain her ends if shes so madly in love when a man starts for the devil he generally arrives but when a woman begins she runs past the deviland goes god knows where now let us return to the drawingroom so after this serious interview they all went back to the drawingroom where they were questioned by everyone about their past weve been in the smokingroom said carmela with a smile her heart now feeling lighter than it had been for many a day oh said pat in mock horror do maltese ladies smoke you ought to know pat retorted ronald you saw enough of the sex in valletta its my kindly heart retorted pat who was never at a loss for an answer sure i didnt like to see the poor things castin such longing glances without responding to em everyone but mrs pellypop laughed at this and she snorted reprovingly with such views mr ryan said that good lady i hope you will never marry why not asked ryan glancing at kate my natural inclination for matrimony is strong i hope your wife will be said ronald with a laugh or shell never be able to keep you in order foster had established himself by bell who did not appear to discourage the advances of the young barrister though her attention was somewhat distracted by bubbles who sat next to her seeing this pat who had a fellowfeeling for lovers drew the young man away bubbles he said was it you that sat for that pears soap picture of course retorted bubbles i was the original infant and indeed he did not look unlike the picture with his beardless face and curly hair faith said mr ryan its a mighty original infant you are anyhow well we cant all be irish said bubbles satirically and a great pity it is ye cant retorted pat calmly the finest nation under the sun did ye ever hear anything that touched your heart like irish music sing us some and then well judge said sir mark suddenly interposing so pat nothing loth went to the piano and sang moores exquisite song she is far from the land in such a pathetic manner that he cast quite a gloom over the company but restored the joyous tone by dashing into garryowen at the conclusion of pats ditties ronald and foster arose to go in spite of a chorus that it was early but mrs pellypop on behalf of the clerical party said it was late begad the nights young and the liquors plentiful said pat impudently i never touch spirits said mrs pellypop majestically mores the pity retorted pat it ud keep the night air out anyhow mrs pellypop deigned no response to this flippancy but sailed out of the room and shortly afterwards departed with the bishop and her daughter ronald and foster had a glass of whisky and soda each while their dogcart was being brought round and then went off ronald promising to call next day and you wont forget what i told you said carmela as he went no replied ronald pressing her hand and mind you let me know when vassalla comes down they drove off in the moonlight in silence for a time and then foster said what a charming girl is miss trevor oh ho from monteith so youve lost your heart and why not retorted foster you are not the only person privileged to lose your heart well i hope your course of true love will run smoother than mine sighed ronald my dear old boy said foster yours will be all right ive got a presentiment that we shall hear from mrs verschoyle do you think she is guilty asked ronald i dont know but whether or no shell not let this marriage take place but she cant stop it cant she she knows more perhaps than we think how is it vassallas dagger was found in the dead mans breast but you dont thinkbegan ronald when foster interrupted him i think nothing he retorted whipping up the horse except that well hear from mrs verschoyle events proved him a true prophet for on arrival at the crown hotel there was a letter waiting for ronald which he opened and read then passed it to foster didnt i tell you said the lawyer when he read it yesi believe the end is nearer than we think the letter said that mrs verschoyle would call on mr monteith at the crown hotel great marlow the next day at three oclock so fosters presentiment was true after all chapter xxiv mrs verschoyle pays a visit next morning when ronald awoke he was very much exercised in his mind as to the reason of mrs verschoyles visit and wondered what she wanted to see him about i wonder if she wants me to marry carmela he thought of course if shes in love with vassalla shell be only too anxious to get carmela disposed of she did not commit the murder or she wouldnt be such a fool as to come to england when he finished dressing mr monteith went downstairs into the diningroom a pleasant apartment that opened by french windows on to the quaint old garden with the redbrick walls he lighted a cigarette and walked slowly up and down waiting for foster to come to breakfast and was speedily joined by that gentleman arent you hungry old chap asked gerald as he came into the garden rather retorted ronald i was wondering when you were going to turn up hungry said foster raising his eyes and he says hes in loveoh cupid what a worshipper youve got ronald laughed and put his hand on fosters shoulder my dear lad he said quietly love is the least of my troubles i want to see carmela free from all this annoyance and then and then repeated foster as they walked towards the breakfastroom youll see as true a lover as ever sighed his soul out to a midnight pillow laughed ronald now come and have some breakfast im starving what time do you think our friend will arrive asked foster as they sat down to the table oh about three i should imagine said ronald attacking a fried sole with a good appetite i wonder what the deuce she wants to see me about humph thats a puzzler said the barrister lightly but i dont think im far wrong when i say it will be all about vassalla ronald laughed and went on with his breakfast he was singularly lighthearted this young man because an idea had entered his mind that all would yet be well if it were not for hope and sanguine expectations where would our pleasure in the future be they finished their breakfast and then went out for a walk saw the house where shelley lived on which is a tablet erected by sir william clayton and interviewed the landlady of the hotel into which a portion of the place is turned dont remember im said the landlady when they asked about the poet i think he was afore my time and this is fame ejaculated foster when they left shelley isnt even remembered by name and he began to spout horace when ronald stopped him dont be classical old chap but look at these old parties the old parties consisted of two old women who informed the gentlemen that they were each eighty years old and had never been out of the town so ronald gave them each a shilling and walked away with his friend i daresay they are much happier than we are he said sighing better to be a butterfly and enjoy life for a day than a tortoise and sleep out a hundred years said foster sapiently depend upon it life is made up of quality not quantity they strolled down to marlow church and then to that tumbledown heap of cottages immortalized by fred walker the picturesque aspect of which struck ronald very strongly i dont know much about pictures said the australian frankly and i havent the eye of an artist but i do admire these mellowtinted roofs so different from the galvanized tin of the colonies then they went across the bridge saw the river full of boats with their lighthearted occupants had a drink at the anglers hotel and looked out over the foaming waters of the weir murmuring like the humming of bees and ultimately went back to the crown hotel up the long street with the old little shops on either side after they had some luncheon consisting of bread and cheese and beer they sat in the diningroom in a kind of somnolent state smoking steadily until a waiter came and said that a lady had called to see them why whats the time asked ronald sleepily tumbling to his feet three oclock sir returned the waiter the devil ejaculated ronald i say old boy heres mrs verschoyle right you are answered foster awake and alert at once im comingwhere is the lady in the sittingroom upstairs sir replied the waiter they went upstairs to the sittingroom and found a lady closely veiled waiting for them she arose when they entered and looked from one to the other in a doubtful way mr monteith she asked i have the honour to bear that name replied ronald stepping forward you are mrs verschoyle the lady bowed and threw back her veil disclosing a countenance so like carmelas that ronald was startled for a moment you will wonder what ive come about said mrs verschoyle resuming her seat so i may as well tell you at onceit is to stop my sisters marriage with the marchese vassalla gerald glanced at ronald and as their eyes met the same thought was in their minds jealousy but why do you come to us said ronald politely we cannot stop the marriage how he fervently wished he could yes you can she replied quietly you are looking for the murderer of my husband both the young men stared what was she going to say my sister and i are not very good friends said mrs verschoyle but i dont want to see her married to a man guilty of a crime guilty of a crime cried ronald springing to his feet you dont mean to say that vassalla is the murderer of leopold verschoyle she said yes i swear it ronald sat down again and looked helplessly at foster who came to his aid this is a very serious charge you make madam said foster gravely are you sure she sprang to her feet in a fury sure she hissed viciously of course i am sure you have been looking for the murderer of my husband and i tell you the man then you doubt my wordbah foster was quite unmoved by her violence i always presume a mans innocent till he is proved guilty he said quietly so that must be my excuse but are you sure vassalla committed this crime i will tell you all about it said mrs verschoyle sitting down again when i married mr verschoyle my cousin matteo was in love with me so your sister said interposed ronald gravely he swore he would kill leopold verschoyle if he got the chance and he has kept his word i was on board and saw him saw him commit the crime not so much as that she replied but i will explain i met my husband in valletta and went on board to see him you denied doing so in your letter to vassalla said foster ah he showed you thatit was to save him i wrote it i am the only witness who could prove him guilty and i said i was not on board so in the case of his being found out i would not have to appear against him how was the crime committed asked ronald i saw my husband on board but did not speak to him i heard him mention the number of his cabin to you and then leave matteo vassalla who was beside me followed him and you i remained where i was but i did not think matteo was going to commit a crime or i would have gone with him when did you see vassalla again i went to my husbands cabin and met vassalla coming out he tried to prevent me from going in but i entered and saw my husband dead with matteos stiletto in his breast matteo implored me to be silent and i obeyed i went on shore at once and wrote the letter you saw i would have kept silent still only i heard that he was going to marry my sister and determined to save her you say vassallas stiletto was in poor verschoyles breast said foster quietly fixing his keen eyes on her face will you kindly describe the weapon an ordinary stiletto she replied with a curiously carved ivory handle representing the head of bacchus surrounded with wreaths of grapes and vine leaves yes that is the description of the weapon said foster but how do you know it was vassallas because my sister told me she had given it to him ronald started and would have spoken as he remembered carmela had said the same thing but foster stopped him you say observed the barrister smoothly that miss cotoner gave your cousin the stiletto may i ask when oh six or seven years ago and it has been in vassallas possession ever since yes defiantly who else could have it foster made no answer so ronald took up the conversation what motive had vassalla for committing this crime he asked in a puzzled tone he would not have nourished revenge all these years ah you dont know a maltese gentleman said mrs verschoyle he never forgets an insult my husband insulted him seven years ago and he swore he would kill him it is like the corsican vendetta with us are you prepared to make this statement in a court of law asked foster eyeing her keenly yes i will swear to it on the cross vassalla will have to be arrested of course she retorted defiantly i want him to be arrested for the murder of your husband at valletta yes good we will go up to london tonight and take out a warrant the sooner the better she said vindictively will you let me offer you some refreshment said ronald as he arose to leave the room yes send me a glass of brandy and soda she replied i feel worn out ronald bowed and then went out with foster to see after their things they sent up the drink to mrs verschoyle and then ronald wrote a letter to carmela telling her he was going up to london on business but did not mention what foster paid the bill got their dressingbags and in a few minutes they were on their way to the station while foster was getting the tickets mrs verschoyle being on the platform ronald took the opportunity to ask his friend a question do you think her story is true he asked if it isnt vassalla can easily clear himself was the ambiguous reply chapter xxv guilty or not guilty meanwhile vassalla quite unconscious of the storm that was about to break over his head was enjoying himself in london and had made arrangements to go to marlow and see carmela he thought he had quite subdued mrs verschoyle and that every impediment to his marriage was removed so he sat in his room at the langham smoking a cigar and moralizing complacently on the state of affairs fortune favours me he said aloud idly watching the blue wreaths of smoke curling round his head i have silenced that devilish bianca and won my beautiful carmelaboth at the same time but how wonderful it is that the death of verschoyle should have been the means of winning me both a wife and a fortune now when i am married i must be quiet i will take my charming wife to malta and live on the estate she does not care for me now but she will grow fondyesshe will grow fond and so he went on building castles in the air and dreaming vain dreams that were destined never to become true for at that moment there came a knock at the door which if he had known its full purport would have alarmed him as much as the knocking at the gate did macbeth but as he did not know he merely called out come in and went on smoking enter a puzzledlooking waiter showing in mrs verschoyle ronald monteith gerald foster and a stranger vassalla turning his head saw them and sprang to his feet in astonishment what the devil he began but mrs verschoyle interrupted him that is the marchese vassalla she said pointing to the dumbfoundered maltese gentleman whereat the stranger advanced and produced a warrant matteo vassalla i arrest you in the queens name arrest me interrupted the marchese for the murder of leopold verschoyle finished the detective is this a joke asked vassalla angrily you will not find it so said ronald it is my duty to inform you said the detective stolidly that whatever you say will be used in evidence at your trial bah snarled vassalla with a gesture of contempt turning his back on the officer of the law who accuses me of this crime i do said mrs verschoyle stepping forward you he cried out recoiling you are mad to do such a thing no i am not mad retorted mrs verschoyle but i would have been if i had let you marry carmela oh he said viciously looking at ronald so this is a plot to rob me of my promised wife she is not your promised wife cried ronald boldly she made the promise under compulsionnow she is free to marry you said vassalla savagely if shell have meyes retorted monteith the marchese turned to foster mrwhatever your name is he said do you believe this charge mrs verschoyle says you committed the murder returned foster mrs verschoyle said matteo contemptuously is a madwoman am i she returned quietly youll find theres some method in my madness i can disprove the whole charge said vassalla moving towards his writingtable come sir said the detective we must be going goingwith you retorted vassalla in an angry tone are you mad i can disprove this charge and he threw open the desk and took his portfolio from it try said mrs verschoyle laconically muttering a curse the marchese opened his portfolio and ran through a number of letters suddenly he turned round with a ghastly face where is the paper he asked what paper said mrs verschoyle calmly what paper curse you he cried you know the paper i meanthe one written by your husband whom you accuse me of killing i know of no paper she said quietly with a sneer this is a fabrication to delay justice i tell you its false cried vassalla in despair i did not kill the man i defy you to press this charge when the time comes i can prove my innocence and i decline to make any statement now prove your innocence she said sarcastically with the missing paper i suppose yes and you know where it is he said maltese dog she shrieked you lie and she would have sprung forward only ronald her back i have to thank you for this said vassalla to ronald as he put on his hat and coat but i do not forget i will repay you and as for you jade that you are ill prove myself innocent and then punish you bah i defy you she said contemptuously youll never marry carmela but hanghang like the dog you are confound it mrs verschoyle leave the man alone said ronald rather annoyed at the way she was behaving vassalla walked to the door with the detective beside him and faced round as he was going out as sure as theres a god in heaven he said proudly i am innocent and that woman only brings this accusation against me to satisfy her absurd jealousy i can prove my innocence and shepointing to mrs verschoyleholds the proof when the door closed foster turned to mrs verschoyle what does he mean asked the lawyer i dont know she said i possess no proof of his innocence and im ready to go into the witness box and swear he killed my husband he says he is not guilty said ronald hell say anything to save his neck but he is guilty ill see him hanged till he is dead there was something so repulsive in the vindictiveness of this woman that both the young men were disgusted and left the room followed by mrs verschoyle who was laughing to herself in a satisfied manner why dont you thank me she said savagely to ronald i have prevented carmela from marrying another man and secured your happiness i dont care for happiness that is founded on the ruin of another man said monteith coldly bah you are a fool he is guilty that said foster quietly has yet to be proved she flashed a look of anger at him then went out of the hotel door and stepped into a hansom i will see you tomorrow she called out and then i can prove that what i say is true the cab drove off leaving foster and ronald looking at one another what do you think asked the australian i dont know what to think said foster the marchese says he is innocent all men accused of a crime say that yes but i fancy in this case its true then who killed verschoyle i believe his wife did what yes i think shes accusing vassalla out of jealousy but he did not accuse her of the crime no he certainly did not said foster musingly its a queer case what was the paper he was talking about i dont know said ronald it is as you say a very queer case im going down to marlow tomorrow what for i want to see carmela and tell her all about the affair yes it will be best for you to do that said foster perhaps she may throw some light on the affair i dont think so we know everything she knows i expect the real reason you want to go down is to tell her she is free said foster quizzically shes not free yet retorted ronald to all intents and purposes she is i want to hear from her own lips that she considers herself free but you dont think shell marry vassalla nowa man accused of murder i dont know said ronald with a sigh women are such queer creatures she may consider herself doubly bound now hes down on his luck ill bet you she dont ill bet you she does very well said foster philosophically the wager will be decided tomorrow night chapter xxvi carmela says yes meanwhile quite unaware of the troubles in which vassalla was involved carmela was enjoying herself very much at bellfield she was in much better spirits than she had been previously as her conversation with foster and ronald had relieved her mind of a great weight and she had come to the conclusion that her sister was not guilty in which case she would not have to marry her cousin everyone stopping at bellfield was in excellent spirits and so carmela felt the influence of merry company and was as gay and joyous as anyone present it being bells birthday they decided to celebrate it with a picnic at medmenham abbey and were all down at hurley lock embarking in the boats pat was especially exuberant as he had discovered beyond all doubt that miss lester was in love with him and he was only waiting for a good opportunity to propose a merrier party were never on the river than the young people from hurley and what a delightful morning it was on the river in this glowing july weather they had no servants with them as sir mark preferred full freedom for once and the young men rowed the boats quickly up passing other gay parties on the way up the placid stream they went past lady place with its quaint old roof and mellowtinted walls under the arched wooden bridge that springs over the thames up through the still waters with the broad green meadows on each side filled with quiet cattle until the gables of the ferry hotel at medmenham came in sight and here they went on shore they found the lawn crowded with young men in flannels and young ladies in boating costumes went to the ruins of the old abbey with all its memories of the hellfire club and the orgies they held therein it is said that the present abbey is a pinchbeck affair and the only genuine ruins of the old abbey are to be found in the solitary pillar which stands at the back near the haystacks but surely the great building with its ruined tower overgrown with ivy its quaint windows scribbled all over with names and its lowroofed door with the famous motto fay ce que voudrais are genuine enough after they had explored the abbey all the party strolled away inland to see the lions of the locality an oldfashioned street it is that leads through the village of medmenham with the flintbuilt houses on either side overgrown with ivy and one can imagine a cavalier after the defeat of unlucky charles stuart spurring swiftly down the lonely road in his wild flight for safety then the church with the square norman tower around which the rooks are always wheeling and cawing casting its mighty shadow over the green grass beneath which the quiet dead sleep soundly as they have done for so many hundred years opposite the church stands the dog and badger a very old hostel with mellowtinted roofs and numerous gables and within lowceilinged rooms with great beams overhead and queer twisted staircases and unexpected cupboards all over the house at the back high up on the hill and commanding a magnificent view of the thames valley stands the sternlooking old farmhouse said to have been mentioned in the domesday book and where charles ii and pretty witty nell gwynne are reported to have stayed for a night then farther on the quiet little village of hambledon through which it is said charles i rode with a brilliant train of gallant cavaliers on his way to meet his rebellious subjects the whole neighbourhood is full of antiquities and traditions which lend a peculiar charm to the place when they grew weary of sightseeing the whole party went down again to the river and getting into the boats rowed up the stream for a considerable distance and ultimately decided to hold their picnic just below hambledon lock with the pleasant murmur of the weir in their ears such a scene of confusion getting out the luncheoneveryone seated round in attitudes graceful and otherwise with the clatter of dishes the popping of champagne corks and a perfect babel of voices this is jolly said pat with his mouth full im fond of arcadian simplicity especially when its accompanied by champagne cried bubbles raising his glass to his lips begad youre not slow in finding out what i mean said ryan laughing and filling his glass imitations the sincerest flattery observed miss lester gaily trying to cut up a rather wiry chicken i believe this fowl was a pedestrian his legs are so tough try some of the breast said sir mark at all events it hasnt got eight legs like the birds you get on board ship thats true enough cried pat everyone seems to get legs of fowls on boardperhaps theyre like manx mengot three legs or a hundred like a centipede said bubbles oh this conversation is frivolous said pat raising his glass so ill propose a toast to the health of miss trevor and many happy returns of the day this was of course drank by everyone with acclamation and then the male portion of the company sang shes a jolly good fellow rather incongruously it must be confessed i wish monteith were here said pat when this was done carmela said nothing but looked much for in her secret heart that is just what she had been wishing at this moment they heard a wild whoop from the river and saw a boat coming quickly up the stream rowed by a single man gad cried bubbles who had the sharpest eyes of anyone its monteith himself speak of the devil hold your tongue said pat dont be personal it was ronald looking happy and jolly in his flannels quite a different being from the gloomy youth of the previous week he soon brought his light little craft to shore and sprang on to the green turf to be welcomed my dear lad said sir mark i am delighted to see you especially as your arrival is so unexpected how did you find us out asked carmela giving him her hand oh easily enough replied ronald gaily i came down to maidenhead drove over to bellfield and finding it was deserted learnt from the servants where you were so here i am hurrah for that cried pat is drink a curse egad im not sure ill try if youve no objection said ronald whereat mr ryan grinned and handed his friend a glass and a bottle all to himself the luncheon was resumed and then the party began to break up into little groups pat of course going with miss lester while bell went under the wing of bubbles though she secretly sighed for the society of gerald foster so in a short time ronald found himself alone with carmela whose eyes turned on him with eager expectation well she asked is there anything new yes ive seen your sister and she is innocent yes and moreover has told us who committed the crime carmela was startled does she know who did it she says so your cousin what matteo rising to her feet oh impossible of course thats what he says also said ronald shrugging his shoulders but your sister accused him and he has been arrested will they hang him if they prove him guilty no doubt but first they must prove the case i cannot believe it of my cousin he had no motive mrs verschoyle says he hadthat he was in love with her yes he was seven years ago said carmela not without a certain feminine spite but that would not have induced him to kill poor leopold verschoyle now maltese gentlemen dont avenge themselves in such a cowardly way well vassalla says he can prove his innocence but theres one thing to be said the whole secret of verschoyles death lies between your sister and vassalla how on earth will it all end said carmela in a bewildered tone but with a sudden thought if vassalla is guilty i am not bound to marry him now of course not said ronald taking one of her hands i want you to marry me she snatched her hand away how can you talk so at such a time she cried her face flushing because i love you he replied and i want to have the assurance from your lips that you love me how can you marry the cousin of a possible criminal i dont care a bit about that i want to marry you wait till this affair is ended oh i dont mind that vassalla will be brought to his trial in a few weeks and then it will be decided one way or another but carmela taking her hand once more when it is all over will you marry me she paused a moment then said simply yes ronald took her in his arms and kissed her chapter xxvii exit mrs verschoyle of course it is not to be wondered at that the arrest of vassalla made a great sensation true vassalla was not a very well known man but then the strangeness of the case which was reported with numerous embellishments in all the papers attracted everybodys notice and then the way the crime had been brought home to him by the divorced wife of the dead manin fact it was quite a romance the curious part of the whole case was that vassalla obstinately refused to say anything in his own defence and his persistent silence was taken as an acknowledgment of his guilt but the marchese only smiled grimly when spoken to and said he could defend himself well enough when the time came and moreover would be in a position to punish mrs verschoyle as for that lady she was quite the heroine of the hournot exactly in a complimentary sense perhapsbut everybody wanted to see a woman with such an exciting history who had divorced her husband and then accused her cousin of being his murderer plenty of papers wanted to interview her but she declined to allow herself to be seen and generally sat at home in a quiet private hotel off the strand where she exulted over the downfall of vassalla he wouldnt marry me she said to herself vindictively well well see how he likes being in prison for murder carmela came up to town and had an interview with her in which mrs verschoyle lost her temper as usual he wanted to marry youhe wanted to marry you she hissed repeatedly i couldnt help that retorted carmela angrily i certainly did not want to marry him and would never have become engaged to him if it had not been to save you ha ha to save me from the gallows i supposebah i do not believe it he would have accused me of the murder of my husband the maltese dog but he shall die for ityes he shall die are you sure he committed thisthis crime said carmela hesitatingly yes i am sure did i not meet him coming out of the cabin on that night was the stiletto in the dead mans breast not the one you gave him years ago am i surebah if he is innocent let him prove it there was nothing to be got out of mrs verschoyle who was simply mad with anger and grew purple in the face till carmela thought she would break a bloodvessel you ought to be grateful to me she said furiously but for me you would have married vassalla and then what of your australian lover you can leave my australian lover out of the question said carmela with great spirit i am only waiting for this unhappy affair to be settled in order to marry him yes do do cried mrs verschoyle and go with him to australia put the ocean between us i never wish to see your face again if it had not been for you my husband would have loved me he did love you said carmela but your temper drove him away at this mrs verschoyle burst out into a storm of anger so in order to put a stop to the scene carmela left the room and went back to the langham where sir mark trevor waited her i dont want to see my sister again she said firmly and she never did of course when the trial came on the court was crowded with the most noted people in london anxious to see the end of this strange case it ended more dramatically than they thought it would vassalla entered the dock in a calm cool manner and glanced quickly round the court of course everyone thinking he was a hardened scoundrel for not exhibiting more emotion he had engaged a famous lawyer to defend him and this gentleman was smiling quietly to himself and by no means looking as if he thought the case a grave one foster was in the court together with ronald and sir mark trevor all listening eagerly to the introductory address of the prosecuting counsel he stated the whole story which had already appeared in the papers but with some slight variations that leopold verschoyle had been married to miss bianca cotoner seven years before with whom the prisoner was also very much in love when she married the deceased the prisoner had sworn he would kill him the prisoner however did not carry his resolution into effect at that time but went travelling about europe and miss cotoner married the deceased they did not live happily together and separated which separation was afterwards followed by a divorce owing to the deceaseds infidelity with another woman called elsie macgregor the deceased then travelled all over the world and was coming to england on board the p and o steamer neptune which stopped at malta while there the deceased went on shore and was recognised by his wife who went on board to speak to him the prisoner was also on board with the sister of the deceased called miss carmela cotoner and thenaccording to mrs verschoyle who was the principal witnessrecognised deceased and heard him tell mr monteith another witness the number of his cabin the prisoner then disappeared from mrs verschoyles side and when she went to speak to her husband she met the prisoner coming out of the cabin and though he tried to prevent her she looked in and saw her husbandor rather her husband that had been lying dead with a stiletto in his breast the stiletto as will appear from the evidence of miss carmela cotoner was given by that lady to the prisoner and was used in the commission of this crime with a few concluding remarks the counsel for the prosecution sat down and the witnesses were called during all the discourse the marchese never moved a muscle but sat in the dock as still as death the first witness called was ronald who repeated the story the dead man had told him and during his examination the paper written by carmela was put in evidence he was followed by carmela who deposed that she had given the stiletto in question to the prisoner and also said that the letter produced was written by her and not by the wife of the deceased mrs verschoyle q you were on board when mrs verschoyle came a yes q was she alone a at first yes afterwards she was escorted by the marchese vassalla q did you see her again a no q when the marchese saw you again what time was it a about a quarterpast nine just after the boat started q did he make any remark a none except that my sister could not find me in the crowd and had to go ashore without saying goodbye q was he agitated a no he was in his usual spirits this closed carmelas examination and the next to go into the witnessbox was mrs verschoyle pale and haggard but who glanced angrily at the prisoner as she kissed the book she repeated the story she had told to ronald and foster that she was with vassalla and wanted to see her husband both herself and her cousin heard him tell the number of his cabin and though she tried to get near her husband she was prevented by the crowd afterwards she missed vassalla and on going along to see her husband in the cabin she found vassalla coming out he tried to prevent her going in but she insisted and found her husband lying dead with a stiletto in his breast q you know to whom the stiletto belonged a yes to the prisoner it was given to him by my sister q what did the prisoner say when you met him a he implored me not to tell and for the sake of the honour of our family i complied q do you know by doing so you run the risk of being taken as an accomplice a mrs verschoyle getting angry i know nothing of english customs i am a maltese lady q did you ever hear the prisoner threaten the deceased a yes very many times he wanted to marry me and when i married the deceased he swore he would revenge himself q that was seven years ago did he do so lately a many times here vassalla shrugged his shoulders this was the close of mrs verschoyles examination and was supposed by the people present to be conclusive evidence of the prisoners guilt there was no evidence for the prosecution and so the counsel for the defence arose to make his speech a speech which considerably startled everyone in the first place he said mrs verschoyle was guilty of perjurysensationgross perjury it was true the prisoner was once in love with her but that was seven years ago and he had long since forgotten his passion the prisoner was on board the neptune on the night in question going to england and mrs verschoyle also came on board she wanted to see her husband and the prisoner hearing the number of the cabin volunteered to look for him he was considerably delayed in the crowd and did not reach the cabin for some time particularly as he met one of the stewards who asked him about his luggage and engaged his attention for nearly ten minutes when he reached the cabin he knocked and getting no reply entered he found the deceased dead sensation having committed suicide and on the washstand by the berth was a letter directed to mr r monteith a friend of the deceased stating that he had committed suicide this paper the prisoner took charge of and was coming out with it when he met mrs verschoyle he told her what had occurred and she was so shocked with the news that she went straight on shore the prisoner was blameable in not producing the paper at the inquest but had anyone been accused of the crime he would have produced it with regard to the stiletto it was once the property of the prisoner but he had given it to the deceased as a parting gift before he left for australia for both the deceased and prisoner were good friends then the wife of the deceased mrs verschoyle knew that the deceased had the dagger in his possession as the prisoner showed a letter to her from deceased acknowledging the gift of stiletto letter produced she was in love with prisoner who refused to marry her being in love with miss carmela cotoner to whom he was engaged to be married mrs verschoyle hearing of this came here from valletta and had a private interview with prisoner during his absence from his room at the langham hotel she stole the confession made by the deceased and it is now in her possessionshe thats a lie cried mrs verschoyle mad with fury rising from her seat silence in the court cried the usher i will not be silent it is an infamous lie that man is guilty of murder he killed my husband and by godby god all at once she stopped speaking her face turned to a ghastly pallor and appeared convulsively drawn to one side as if by a stroke of paralysis every eye in the court was fastened on that solitary figure and there was an awful pause of expectancy another moment and she fell prone on the floor with a heavy thud the court was in an uproar at the strange occurrence and at first it was thought she had merely fainted through excitement a doctor however being present came forward and knelt down by mrs verschoyle who was now breathing stertorously he glanced at her paindrawn face felt her pulse and while he was doing so the heavy breathing stopped what is the matter asked the judge bending forward is it a faint the doctor raised his head no my lordit is death death echoed several voices and the court arose in confusion yesshe has burst a blood vessel in the brain dead dead yes mrs verschoyle was deadin the very moment of her triumph chapter xxviii a scrap of paper the sudden death of mrs verschoyle so appalled everyone that the trial was adjourned a great sensation was created when the report came out in the papers and numerous were the theories as to how the trial would end now the principal witness was dead as a matter of fact according to public opinion the only thing that could prove the innocence of vassalla was the production of the letter written by the dead man and alleged to have been stolen by mrs verschoyle and after the body had been removed ronald in company with foster and vassallas lawyer went to look for it what shall we do if she has destroyed it said ronald as they walked along oh she hasnt destroyed it replied vassallas lawyer whose name was winks she would have produced it at the eleventh hour then you think such a paper is in existence said foster im certain of it and mrs verschoyle knew the marchese was innocent she only accused him out of jealousy but why did he not deny the charge at once instead of letting himself be placed in such a perilous position i dont know said winks he never gave me any explanation but he knew he was safe for even should the paper not be forthcoming the evidence of the deceased that vassalla had given him the dagger would save him if he hadnt the stiletto he couldnt have killed him with it thats flat but verschoyle distinctly denied to me that he had any intention of committing suicide said ronald winks shrugged his shoulders changed his mind i suppose he evidently did it on the spur of the moment but here we are at last they went into the hotel and were shown into the late mrs verschoyles room by the landlady who had heard of her lodgers death and was much scared thereat i knew shed break a bloodvessel she said smoothing her black silk dress the rages she got into were awful they wont bring the corpse here i hope no replied ronald it has been taken to sir mark trevors town house didnt know he had one said foster he stops at the langham oh yes he dislikes his town house immensely and being a student of human nature likes the life of an hotel i dont think hes far wrong myself they went to mrs verschoyles room and hunted everywhere for the paper so much required but in vain ransacked her desk looked through her trunks but without any satisfactory result perhaps shes left it about for greater safety said foster referring to poes queer story of the purloined letter the landlady was called up and questioned but denied ever seeing the paper perhaps she had it with her she suggested as the three gentlemen looked blankly at one another no the body had been searched so they left the hotel in despair looks had for vassalla said ronald not a bit retorted the stouthearted winks the stiletto evidence will get him off but mrs verschoyle evidently intended he should swing and has perhaps destroyed the paper he went off so ronald invited foster to dine with him at the tavistock an invitation which that gentleman accepted all the newsboys along the strand were calling out sensational sentences about the case and ronald bought some papers to read when they entered the hotel the clerk handed ronald a letter that had been waiting for him all day it was addressed in a womans handwriting and monteith opened it carelessly but on glancing at the contents he gave a shout which startled foster whats the matter old chap the missing paper gasped ronald holding it out and so it was foster took it and read it my dear monteithim sick of life and as ive no one to consult about staying in it im going into the next world straight off lionel ventin this puts vassallas innocence beyond all doubt said foster but the signature will have to be provedcan you do it no replied monteith but theres mrs taunton yeswell have to see her said the barrister putting the letter in his pocket but how the deuce did it come to you i dont know said ronald blankly unless she never intended vassalla should suffer but sent me this today and the case would have been squashed tomorrow i believe she was mad foster thought so also especially when they went back to the hotel and found how the letter had been posted mrs verschoyle had placed it in an envelope and directed it to ronald but evidently changing her mind went out leaving it on the table a waiter coming in had seen it so posted it at once thinking it was an oversight on mrs verschoyles part there was no difficulty in proving the document to be authentic as mrs taunton affirmed at once that both the writing and the signature were in her brothers handwriting and supported her assertion by producing his letters to her which put the whole question beyond a doubt this curious ending to a curious case made a great sensation but vassalla took his acquittal very coolly he was more annoyed at carmelas refusal to marry him than anything else as that young lady not only refused to see him but wrote a letter and upbraided him for the falsehood he had told regarding her sisters guilt to gain her hand vassalla did not answer the letter but seeing there was no hope for him went off to america and found among the passengers the bishop of patagonia and his wife accompanied by mrs pellypop who had insisted on coming the bishop yielded in the secret hope that some benevolent cannibal might eat the old lady but she evidently did not look inviting enough as she is still alive and hearty mrs verschoyle whose unhappy fate no one particularly deplored was buried in kensal green cemetery and lies there at rest with all her loves her hates and ambitions carmela could not honestly pretend to mourn but she regretted that the last interview she had with her was such a stormy one ronald went down again to hurley and spent the summer months on the river in the delightful company of carmela who now that the cloud so long overshadowing her life had passed away was perfectly happy they were wrapped up in one another and paid no attention to the other guests at bellfield this was decidedly selfish and would have been resented only it so happened that two other couples under sir mark trevors hospitable roof were doing precisely the same thing in the first place mr patrick ryan had persuaded kate lester to agree to change her name for his own a fair exchange is no robbery observed pat when he proposed i give you my name and you give me yourself and you call that a fair exchange retorted his ladylove i think youre getting the best of the bargainim marrying a poor man of course said pat cheerfully thats where my selfsacrifice comes in i cant support myself so im going to support youwe can live on breadandcheese and well if youve no objection well have an acting charade on the last word they did sir mark was resigned to the infliction of two loving couples staying with him but he did feel rather crushed when gerald foster asked him to bestow bells hand upon him good gracious ejaculated the astonished baronet its a catching diseaseim glad mrs pellypop isnt here or id fall a victim to matrimony myself he liked foster however and moreover saw he was a man likely to make his mark in the world so agreed to the engagement and resigned himself in a christian spirit to the awful fact of living in the same house with three young men engaged to the same number of young women i feel like an elderly cupid he said plaintively the only remedy for this epidemic of lovemaking is to get them married as soon as possible so as soon as possible the marriages took place all at the same time in the church at marlow and the excitement was great over the treble event as such a thing had not occurred in the neighbourhood within the memory of man it will be interesting news to all matrimonial pessimists that none of these marriages have as yet turned out failures or does there seem the least chance of any such possibility foster with the assistance of his fatherinlaw soon got plenty of briefs and is now a brilliant qc cherishing dreams of the bench and the woolsack miss lesters uncle dying left her all his money which pat devoted to restoring the home of his ancestors where he lives now with his pretty wife and is not much troubled except by his tenants who wont pay any rent and ronald oh ronald is in faroff australia and by his side stands the girl from malta
