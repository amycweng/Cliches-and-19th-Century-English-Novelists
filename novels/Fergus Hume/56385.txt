story xxvi the beginning of the end xxvii the end jonah's luck chapter i the adventure of the inn it was the close of a chilly autumn day and under a lowering grey sky the landscape of river and marsh and low lying hills looked forbiddingly forlorn white mists veiled the wet earth the road running between withered hedgerows was ankle deep in mud and the stubbled fields held streaks of water between their ploughed ridges occasionally the pale beams of a weakened sun would break through the foggy air but the fitful light without warmth or power only served to accentuate the depression of the scene the most cheerful of men would have succumbed to the pessimism of the moment as it was the solitary creature who trudged along the miry highway accepted his misery with sulky resignation at intervals he lifted a hopeless face to the darkening clouds sometimes he peered idly to right and left and twice he halted breathing heavily a monument of wretchedness but usually with his hands in the pockets of a thin jacket and with a bent head he plodded doggedly onward bearing submissively a situation which he could not mend in his gait there was the hint of the pedestrian who aims at no goal without eagerness without resolution with slack muscles and a blank expression he toiled like a hag ridden dreamer through those dreary weary eerie essex marshes a derelict of civilisation yet his face when revealed by the wan sunshine appeared young and handsome and refined though sadly worn and lean the skin bronzed to a clear brown by wind and rain and sunshine was marred by unexpected wrinkles less the work of time than of care his closely clipped hair and small moustache exhibited the hue of ripe corn his eyes possessed the fathomless blue of italian skies his thin nose slightly curved his firm chin and set lips revealed character and determination also he had the frame of a wiry athlete the spring gait of a long distance walker and the expansive forehead of a student such a man should not have been ploughing through the mud of a lonely country road with but a threadbare suit of blue serge to protect him from the inclement weather something was wrong and none knew that better than the tramp himself but whatever might be the cause of his misery he kept it in his heart being by nature reticent and by experience suspicious at sunset the air became darker the mists thicker the scene even more dreary still he laboured onward but now for the first time with a hint of resolution in his movements bracing himself as it were for a final spurt to attain a newly guessed at end on the right he could hear the lapping of the thames against its weedy banks on the left a dull dripping of water from leafless boughs saluted his ears sometimes there sounded the cry of a belated bird again would come the shrill whistling of trains and not infrequently the hooting of a siren as steamers passed each other on the blind river and between pauses he could hear his own weary breathing and the squelching of the water in his well worn shoes none of these sounds tended to raise his spirits which were at the moment as low as the tide of the unseen stream only when a dim light glimmered through the mists did he show any signs of interest in the physical and then he heaved a sigh of relief a jingle of money came from his right hand pocket as he moved his fingers and a gleam of satisfaction flitted across his sullen face the light as he surmised must come from some cottage or farm house or inn and there he would be able to obtain bed and board for the night it had been his intention to push on to tarhaven in search of a friend but the rapid closing in of the night and the increasing gloom of the fogs forced him to spend his last few pence in rest and food the evil of to day he could no longer endure the morrow would and must look after itself a true beggar's philosophy and what was he but one of the unemployed the light became stronger as he drew near and he found himself unexpectedly on the outskirts of what he presumed was a small village and within a yard or so of the inn the hostel was pretentious seeing that it consisted of two storeys and yet it was mean in appearance as the walls were merely of whitewashed mud and the roof of sodden grey thatch over the low broad door flanked by dripping benches appeared a sign advertising in rude black letters that the house was the marsh inn through the windows on either side of the closed door gleamed a ruddy light telling of comfort and warmth within obtainable doubtless at a small charge with his hand on the latch since the entry was free to all comers stood the tramp while a shrill voice objurated within without pause or grammar jus' slip out t' git water y' bloomin' silly pope wants 'is tea bein' took with poetry i don' keep y' fur show nohow but thet's fine lydies all over ho yuss i want y' fur a glarse cupboard in corse y' lazy jezebel 'eaven forgive me fur bringin' y' int' 'oly writ es the parsin torks of before the end of this pleasant admonition the door flew open so suddenly that the stranger started back past him shot a girl of small stature with a white haggard face firmly closed lips and defiant eyes she was scarcely a woman and weak in her appearance so the zinc bucket she swung at her side was undeniably too heavy for her frail strength the tramp heard her gasp as she sprang into the mist and with the unconsidered haste of a kindly heart he followed impulsively her laboured breathing guided him to a well encircled with rough stone work and surmounted by an iron wheel down dropped the jangling bucket and the girl breathing with exhaustion strove to bring it to the surface again weighty with water the effort extorted a low heart breaking sob this is too much for you said the tramp in a refined and pleasant voice allow me and he fell to work the girl started when he spoke but she did not cry out evidently she was accustomed to command her feelings in the mist she could scarcely see the face of her assistant but his voice sounded like that of a gentleman and there lurked a quality in its tones which gave her confidence in a moment or so he had the filled bucket in his grip and was walking towards the inn at the door the girl silently took his burden from him with a nod of thanks and entered with a word of gratitude and her voice was also refined by no means the voice of a servant howsoever this girl came to occupy so menial a position the tramp guessed that she was a gentlewoman however he was too weary to weave romances about beggarmaids and was no king cophetua to do so he sighed and walked in the room was small and ancient with a low ceiling and a gigantic fire place in which glowed a noble driftwood fire on either side of this stood settles and in the centre of the room was an oblong deal table upon which appeared pewter tankards and clumsy china mugs the floor was sanded the smoke panelled walls were decorated with cheap hunting pictures vilely coloured and with illustrations cut from the graphic also there was an old horse hair sofa of the ugly albert period a cumbersome chair or two and spittoons a dingy paraffin lamp dangled from the grimy whitewashed ceiling blackening it with smoke and diffusing a dull yellow glare in fact this especial tap room was of the kind usually to be found by the dozen in agricultural districts unlovely dirty cheap and vulgar yet comfortable enough in an animal way on one settle sat a lean loosely knit youth of of twenty with a slack foolish face and a drooping underlip revealing small serrated teeth his hair was long and unbrushed his clothes were of well worn tweed extremely untidy and badly fitting book in hand he stared at the ceiling with lack lustre eyes oblivious to his surroundings opposite to him and watching sneeringly sat an elderly man with a strong square face much inflamed with drink his apparel was disreputable his head bald and his beard untrimmed yet he had the thoughtful eyes of a scholar and his hands though dirty were white and slender and eloquently emphasised the fact to the observant that he worked less with them than with his brain undoubtedly he had been gently reared and the cause of his falling into this mire could be discerned only too plainly in his red nose and shiny skin and in the affectionate way in which he grasped a glass of what looked like water and which was really gin lastly the new comer's eyes wandered to the landlady and in her he beheld the representative whitechapel virago so well known in the police courts of that district she was tall and lean fierce in looks vehement of tongue prodigal of gestures a slattern in dress and a tyrant in manner having chased the girl with the bucket into the back parts of the house she strode forward with the swing of a grenadier and the insolence of a bully to face the new guest an' wot may y' want she demanded harshly scornful bed and board for the night replied the tramp curtly ho an' the money eh d'y think i'm a goin' t'waste five bob the man produced two half crowns a meal now a bed later and breakfast at nine in the morning five an' praps bad money muttered the woman biting one of the coins sevening y' mean five shillings is all i mean to give if you don't he made a motion to take back the money the woman who was really overpaid closed her broad red hand sharply and nodded contemptuously but y' don't git th' bes' bedroom thet bein' taiken by a gent es is a gent an' not a broken down toff 'ow do i know es y're respectable i certify said a grand mellow voice from one settle that mr angus herries is well born and honest then with a sudden plunge into the scottish dialect dinna ding the laddie wi' sic blatter ye fule wumon herries wheeled round at the sound of those trumpet tones and stared at the stout old rascal who sipped his gin with a knowing leer gowrie he gasped quite taken aback mr gowrie ye've a quick eye my laddie michael gowrie it is though ye micht ca' me the reverend michael gowrie an' nae burn the tongue o' ye sit ye doon my mon an' we'll hae a dram togither for the sake o' auld lang syne he hummed the last seven words herries sat on the opposite settle next to the untidy youth who cast sidelong disdainful looks on him but took no further notice i want food rather than drink said the young man wearily aye but drink is the ain an' the tither ye ken mister cried the landlady who had been bottling up her wrath i'd hev y' know es m' naime es 'liza narby an' i comes of genteel folk in rotherhithe don't y' call me a bloomin' fool d'ye see pardon me said the reverend michael in excellent english i did not misuse the word 'blooming' which applies only to young and lovely beings of your sex such es elspeth sneered mrs narby with the venom of an ugly woman haud your tongue ye limmer thundered gowrie evidently irritated and cast a look at the door through which the girl had vanished or nae mair custom do ye get frae me ho shouted mrs narby with her arms akimbo and going at once on the warpath 'spose i kin do without thet any'ow an' she was about to launch out in true whitechapel style when the untidy youth intervened listlessly milton talks of a blooming archangel said he addressing the rev michael gowrie nae in your mither's sense chuckled the scholar but that a bell tinkled somewhere in the back premises mrs narby would have returned to the attack there's thet gent es come this night she said looking at her son for the untidy youth held such a relationship towards this amazon go an' see wot he wants pope whoy he might take a fancy t' y' an' elp publish yer poetry i want no patrons said pope rising haughtily genius stands quite alone all the same he stalked out of the tap room quickly to see why the bell had sounded and was followed by his mother who was heard scolding her servant again herries took no notice of these cockney vulgarities being too weary to enjoy their humour he stared into the glowing fire while gowrie chuckled and finished his gin and water with great relish aye he drawled wiping his coarse red lips with the sleeve of his dilapidated coat yon's wha ye ca a gowk or maybe a stirk poetry quotha the lad hes nae mair poetry nor ma fut an' tis a queer thing herries that you randy quean deems him a genius nae less there's a vein o' verse in yon limmer else she wuldnae hae ca'd her bairn pope after the poet tush laddie pope the wee crooked thing wes nae a poet gi' me glorious robby bur rns aye aye the besom o' a landleddy hes a glimmerin' o' the divine 'tis queer where the speeritual spark as ye micht say taks up its abode i hae a wee bit glimmer maesel an' i thocht ye hed it also herries but ye've come doon sadly puir saul eh the looks of ye drink has nothing to do with them at least retorted herries nettled while to look at you eh an' what ails me laddie drink gin whisky and suchlike ten years ago you had me as a pupil in edinburgh and although a minister without a church you were at least respectable now ye may weel say't laddie drink's the curse o' a' sons o' adaam i wes a stickit meenister foreby and didnae wag ma pow in a pu pit mair's the peety aye aye he sighed whusky's the deil's broth i'm theenking how did you fall so low angus asked his old preceptor whusky whusky said the old reprobate tho' i've tacken to gin as cheaper but 'tis weary wark at times for gin's nae sa quick as it micht be in bringing oot the glorious points o' a mon it doesn't make you drunk enough i suppose you mean joost sae ye micht pit it yon way what a mercy you never married gowrie ca' me meester gowrie be decent to your elders laddie marrit is it he chuckled again and cast a strange glance at herries from out his inflamed eyes ou aye marrit weel weel we're a' son's o adaam ye ken then are you hold your tongue sir interrupted gowrie in fierce english respect the secret of a gentleman you an' me's met in a queer gait he pursued in the homely scotch maister an' pupil an' baith doon on oor hunkers as ye may say it's a waefu' warld i'm theenking herries made no direct reply being occupied with his thoughts ten years before he had been a pupil of the rev michael gowrie in edinburgh and even then the wreck before him now had not been noted for sobriety when herries went to the university he had lost sight of his old preceptor and was therefore much surprised to meet him in these out of the way parts and in such straits how do you live he asked abruptly well said the other in his odd mixture of scotch and english i write for the daily press nature studies ye ken laddie i present the warks o' god in decent language tae an ignorant public as ye micht say it keeps me in drams though the emoluments are nae what they micht be tae a scholar an' a gentlemon foreby an' yer ain history laddie a sad ain i doot not the history of jonah said herries gloomily it was at this moment that the girl returned to spread a half cloth on the table herries would rather have eaten in a less smoky atmosphere but the girl informed him that the gentleman it seemed that his name was unknown had the best parlour and one of the bedrooms so that there was but little accommodation aye aye said gowrie meditatively elspeth is richt it's here i'll sleep maesel an' what's yon gentlemon daeing here lassie i don't know said elspeth shortly and with an averted face he'll hae been benighted maybe she shook her head he came only an hour ago well wrapped up in a fur coat from tarhaven ye'll ken his name no he refused to give his name but said that he expected to see a gentleman here about eight o'clock then he has arranged to go before breakfast in the morning and has paid mrs narby beforehand for his rooms it's queer said gowrie handling his pipe meditatively while elspeth left the room to bring in the food for herries ye see mony queer things in sic hooses as these my mon aye aye poverty maks us acquaint wi' strange bedfellows as wully shakespeare pit it varra weel herries did not reply but sat down to an ill cooked mutton chop and a tankard of very flat ale gowrie treated himself to another steaming glass of gin and water talking while his ex pupil devoured his welcome meal elspeth wandered in and out of the room on various errands mrs narby busy in the kitchen presumably did not present her lovely self and the poet was also absent probably being engaged in fascinating the unknown gentleman in the hope of obtaining the patronage he seemed to contemn and why are ye here laddie demanded gowrie inquisitively i come from pierside explained herries carelessly there i left a tramp schooner on which i had shipped as doctor aye aye that's it i mind ye studied medicine i have studied everything said herries shrugging as you know mr gowrie my parents left me just sufficient to provide me with an education and a few pounds over to start me in life i got my degree and then began to practice in a london suburb i failed there and tried another failed again and tried a third then i went on the stage that refuge of the destitute and could not make that pay finally i joined a gipsy ship as doctor and have been frizzling and shivering in several parts of the world for years since then i have fared no better and my last adventure was in an arctic sealer i left her as i said at pierside being unable to stomach the brutality of her captain any longer now i am on my way to tarhaven to see an old medical friend who may help me that is my history as sad as your own mr gowrie but this with a glance at the dissipated face perhaps more respectable how do you make that out asked the other in his best english i have never been a drunkard said angus significantly it's no decent tae speak to me yon way fumed the elder man wincing isn't it the truth weel ye dinna look varra drunk i'll say that aye i'll say that i am not talking of myself mr gowrie but of you any one can see how you come to be here weel weel cried the ex minister testily there's nae mair to be said ma sin's nae yer sin but i doot ye've a glass hoose of your ain what will ye do now go to bed snapped herries rising wull ye nae stap and hae a crack no i'll see you in the morning man i'll be gone early it's london i'm bound for joost sae tae see an eeditor aboot an article on the modest daisy the young man shrugged his shoulders again on another occasion he would have been amused at gowrie's impudence with his odd changes from scotch to english but the heart was out of him and meeting with an old friend even so fallen a one as mr gowrie he could not help breaking out with his troubles an overcharged heart will speak however reticent may be the nature of its possessor and after fiddling with the door handle for a few moments herries burst out i'm a jonah mr gowrie he cried almost savagely i swear that i have done all that a man could do to earn an honest living but everything has gone wrong with me i am sober honest industrious and as you said clever aye said the sage i'll bear testimony to that nae mair capable laddie ever passed through my varra capable hands then why am i so unfortunate demanded the miserable young man looking up to the ceiling i am cursed in some way whatever i take up fails i try and try and try again i foresee all chances and work desperately yet again and again i fail facing gowrie with clenched hands and desperate eyes herries neither saw nor heard the door into the back parts of the house open and shut suddenly it was just as though someone hearing the raised voice had peered out and then after a glance had retired hastily gowrie looked out of the tail of his eye but saw nothing and shook his head at his unfortunate pupil it's a weary world he said with drunken seriousness the world is all right cried herries it is the infernal folk who live in it that make me hate life oh he dashed his hands across his eyes i could shame my manhood and weep when i think of my sorrow here he became aware that elspeth was in the room gazing at him with pitying eyes a feeling of pride made him close his mouth and with an abrupt gesture of despair he left the room at a run the girl followed to show him his sleeping apartment old gowrie remained and cried to mrs narby for a third glass of gin aye aye muttered the old reprobate breeth we are an' dust we mau' be puir laddie an' sae clever aye a lad of pairts i doot 'tis the drink he wagged his head sadly weel and why should nae the puir wean droon his sorrows in the flowing bowl the which term thomas moore applies tae whusky he's got nae siller an' varra little o' that is in ma purse but maybe he has enow tae help the guid friend whae guided his young footsteps hech he rose and pondered maybe if i flatter the lad he may spare a bittock drink aye drink which maketh glad the hairt o' mon he'll be guid for a shulling at daybreak in pursuance of this plan the rev michael gowrie was shortly on his legs staggering to the bedroom with a stiff jorum of gin and water mrs narby led the way and pointed out the apartment occupied by herries with the unnecessary information that the unknown gentleman now in the parlour would sleep in the next room an' me sleeping in the tap room mourned gowrie is yon gentleman in bed wumon no he's still in the parlour snapped mrs narby bristling at being called a woman he's waiting fur 'is friend as comes at eight it'll be haulf an hoor tae eight said gowrie consulting a yellow faced watch not worthy of a pawnbroker's ticket ow shud i know give yer shady toff 'is drink an' cut gowrie had little difficulty in inducing herries to swallow the hot liquor the young man was worn out and when the drink was finished his head fell on the pillow like a lump of lead his kind preceptor tucked him in and cast a longing glance at his pupil's garments lying disorderly on a chair near the bed but mrs narby glared grimly at the door and gowrie had no chance of examining the pockets as he wished to do it was with great reluctance that he departed with the ogress while herries blind to the world slept heavily but alas not dreamlessly his dreams indeed were terrible for hours and hours he seemed to be flying from some dreadful danger along a lonely road he sped breathless and anguished after him raced a shadow which once caught up with him and enveloped him in cold gloom but out of that egyptian darkness he was drawn by a firm warm hand and found himself under a glimmering moon looking into the face of elspeth she pointed towards the east and there broke swiftly the cool fresh dawn at the sight of which his terrors vanished it seemed to the dreamer that he kissed the girl but of this he could not be sure for the vision dispersed into fragments and he finally fell into the deep slumber of the worn out when he awoke it was daylight and from the position of a faint gleam of sunshine breaking through the still clinging mists he guessed that it was nine o'clock but herries cast no second look through the window when he saw what lay on the patchwork quilt thereon appeared a white bone handled razor crimson with blood and he found that one sleeve of his woollen shirt was likewise stained red chapter ii a recognition after that first startled look herries sprang from the bed anxious only for the moment to avoid contact with that blood stained razor but blood also smeared the right arm of his shirt which he could not part with as he had no other to wear his hands were clean the bed quilt was smooth and the door closed he could not comprehend how the razor and the blood stains came to be there half dazed and unable to grasp the meaning of these weird things he flung open the window it looked down into a small bleak garden and into thick white mists behind which lay those weary marshes he had traversed on the previous evening the inn might have been in the aristophanic cloud cuckoo land for all the signs of earth life that were visible in those dismal fogs herries craning his body half out of the window could hear men and women chattering in the street and at times the shrill babble of children so far as he could see and hear nothing was wrong yet he felt that something terrible had happened it was at this point that he retreated suddenly from the window with one awesome word beating insistently upon his confused brain murder he cried aloud in the empty room murder he sprang towards the door clothed only in his shirt and pulled it open with a jerk half frenzied with fear and possessed by an agonized feeling of terror he shouted the word down the narrow staircase people below were talking quietly and moving about on various tasks intent but at the sound of that choking cry both movements and voices resolved themselves into an uncanny pause shortly the terror stricken creature clinging to the top railings heard heavy footsteps ascending and aware of his light attire he slipped back into his room and into bed the footsteps came nearer and a rough bearded face peered in at the door it was that of the landlord of whom he had caught a mere glimpse on the previous night mrs narby was well matched in her help mate outwardly at least for he was a bulky stout animal with a heavy fist and a violent temper when aroused but for the most part he was too lethargic to become enraged unless some special event demanded the use of uncontrolled passion at the present moment his mild face in repose it was strangely mild exhibited only wonder what are you howling about he asked gruffly and staring with bent brows at the white faced man murder chattered herries shivering and sitting up in bed chin on knees at least he flung the razor towards the man narby by this time well within the room deftly caught the article and examined it closely blood said he under his breath then looked at herries still shivering as with ague but y' ain't dead cut yourself maybe shaving i have not shaved for two days i have no razor with me that is not mine who has been murdered so herries babbled confusedly why no one growled the landlord bristling this is a decent inn this is do you think we take in folks to cut their throats you've had a nightmare and this razor of yours it is not mine passionately interrupted the young man i found it on the quilt when i woke at nine this morning it's nearly ten by now then i mistook the time having no watch but the blood it is queer admitted narby meditatively but there's no one dead so far as i know old gowrie slept in the tap room and went off at seven my wife and elspeth are alive and busy pope too ate a good breakfast and there's no sign of a corpse about me what of the gentleman who came last night he went away at eight as he arranged without his breakfast my wife saw him pass through the tap room in that fur coat of his and no wonder on such a chilly morning he never passed the time of day gentry manners in this country i 'spose then there's nothing wrong cried herries more bewildered than ever not that i know of someone's been having a joke with you though who'd play a low down trick like this is more nor i can tell narby looked at herries and herries stared back at narby both puzzled and both bad tempered whosoever had played this poor joke if joke it was the landlord at least was innocent of the jest the young man shook his head to clear it of cobwebs and signed to the other to leave the room intending to get up and dress the voice of mrs narby in the passage chained him to the bed wot's he 'ollerin' abaout she asked in her vile dialect had the nightmare grumbled her spouse pushing her back as she tried to peep in ho then he'd best cut d'y 'ear you she shouted we don't want no crazy coves 'ere elspeth go an' mek the front room bed the gent hev gorn an' th' room mus' be streight in a jiffy there was an inaudible reply as elspeth's light feet tripped past the noisy landlady shortly herries heard her speak for his bedroom door was still ajar and the worthy couple were discussing his strange cry angrily the door is locked said elspeth nonsense cried mrs narby going to the girl wot shud he lock it fur i'd like to knaow an' 'im gittin' orf th' fust thing in th' mornin' ho herries heard her shake the door violently locked it is blimme if he ain't gorn with th' key 'aving locked the bloomin' door i'll have th' lawr of him elspeth git outside an' up t' th' front winder them trellises mek quite a ledder i'll do it said narby quickly you're too 'eavy ony a light shrimp like elspeth cud git h'up i don' want my trellises mussed up elspeth i'm afraid herries heard the girl say timidly y' ain't wot cause 'ave y' t' be afraid y' mealy mouthed little silly slut up y' go or evidently a fist was raised at this point she shan't growled narby who seemed to have more decent feeling than his wife here stand aside if y' break th' door it means poun's an' poun's screamed the virago the listening man heard a crash and an angry ejaculation from mrs narby at the destruction of her property then came a wild cry from elspeth an oath from the landlord and finally a panic stricken silence with his fears again knocking at his heart herries jumped up and hurriedly slipped into his trousers scarcely were they on before narby burst into the room white faced and savage behind came his wife bellowing like a fury of the revolution elspeth in the meanwhile had fainted in the passage you killed him shouted narby fiercely running towards herries and flung him like a feather on the bed killed killed whom gasped the young man bursting into a cold perspiration the gent as came last night he's lying next door with his throat slit you murdering devil oh shivered herries the razor your razor it's not mine let me up and he struggled to rise no you stop here until i send for the police 'liza ah would you herries realizing his dreadful position had begun to resist violently and narby held him down with brawny hands as the two swung in close grips on the bed there was a tinkling sound and a shout from mrs narby who was red faced and furious th' key th' blessed key she screeched picking it up from the floor whence it had fallen off the bed oh the bloomin' jack th' ripper cove he's ruined th' cussed 'ouse it's a lie a lie breathed herries weakly narby with his knee on the other's chest laughed grimly you'll have to prove that to a jury my lad the razor the key of the next room the the why here he broke off to snatch at the stained shirt sleeve more blood you reptile and he shook the young man with unrestrained anger 'ow 'ow 'ow mrs narby began to exhibit symptoms of hysteria he killed the pore gent pope pope me darlin' boy 'elp 'elp let me up gasped herries you're stifling me i'll leave the hangman to do that sonny i i won't try to to escape you bet you won't said narby in quite an american way and seeing that there was really a chance of the young man becoming insensible under over rough handling he released his hold dress yourself he said sternly but out of this room you don't go till the police come 'liza i say 'liza there was no reply mrs narby had hurled herself down the stairs and they could hear her harsh voice clamouring for her son and for drink to revive her shortly the murmur of many voices swelled out evidently the woman had summoned the neighbours and herries shivered at the snarl of an enraged mob i never killed the man he wailed utterly broken up i know nothing about him i never saw him i didn't shut up snapped narby roughly and pushed him back again on to the disordered bed i've known a man lynched down 'frisco way for less than this i reckon you'll dance at the end of a rope before the month's out see here he went to the window glanced out and returned to shake a large and menacing finger more american in speech than ever you try an' light out that way sonny an' i shoot you straight i keep my derringer for use not for show d'ye see you stop here i am perfectly willing retorted herries now beginning to recover his courage since the worst of the shock was over i can easily clear my character narby smiled grimly and shook his head better say no more he advised what you say will tell against you surely you don't believe me guilty you make me tired said narby sharply you are in the next room to a murdered man you show me a blood stained razor and you have blood on your shirt and the key of the next room believe you guilty well i guess i do say your prayers sonny for you'll hang as sure as you're a living man which you won't be long and without another word the burly landlord left the room locking the door after him with an eminently human impulse to seek immediate safety the prisoner ran to the window but there was no escape that way he could easily drop into the garden climb over the low fence and fly across the marshes hidden by the kindly mists but the palings which parted the garden from the village street were now lined with curious and horrified spectators men and women and children stared insistently at the mean house with that fascination begotten of a morbid love of crime no such exciting event had happened in the dull little essex village for many a year if indeed ever before and the whole population was agog with excitement mrs narby was haranguing her neighbours and fiercely pointing at intervals towards the house crying wildly that the inn was ruined catching sight of herries at the window she shook a large fist and a sea of faces looked upward then came a howl of execration from that terrible sound herries though courageous enough shrank back and closed the window in a panic then he staggered to the bed and lying down tried to reason calmly the stranger in the next room whosoever he was had been murdered the key of that room had been found in this one also on the bed quilt had lain the weapon with which presumably the dead man's throat had been cut then there was the damning evidence of the bloody sleeve herries examined this and found that the stains streaked downward from the elbow as though someone with reddened fingers had drawn them down the woollen fabric on making this discovery the unhappy man regained his feet scenting a conspiracy some enemy has done this he argued trying to keep himself cool and composed i have fallen into a trap the assassin after committing the crime must have come deliberately into my room in order to implicate me in the matter i was sound asleep so he could easily have smeared my sleeve and left the razor and key but who could have done it and why was it done i know no one in these parts i arrived here alone and unknown and he stopped as a sudden thought flashed through his brain michael gowrie knew his name and gowrie had come to this very room on the previous evening with a glass of toddy could it be that gowrie had murdered this unknown man and had then arranged the snare so that a perfectly innocent being should bear the penalty of his wickedness it was credible and yet from what herries remembered of the old scamp gowrie was not the man to commit so dreadful a deed in his degraded state the ex minister would steal at a pinch in order to procure money for drink he would lie glibly he would blackmail and bear false witness to serve his own ends but herries could not think even so base a man capable of murder for one thing he would not have the nerve seeing that drink had shattered his system no it would not be gowrie and yet if not gowrie who could have an interest in implicating a stranger in the awful tragedy again as herries reflected when his brain became clearer mrs narby said that the gentleman who had occupied the bedroom next door had departed in his noticeable fur coat at eight o'clock if it was he who had passed through the tap room it certainly could not be him who was lying dead in the next room the affair was puzzling and not the least mysterious thing was that no one in the house knew the dead man's name he had come to see someone and had duly retired to bed next morning he was found dead if this was the case who then could be the man who had visited him on the previous night who was the man who had left at eight in the morning disguised in a fur coat belonging to the dead there could be but one answer he was the assassin again herries looked out of the window and saw that two men yokels apparently were guarding it below he stole to the door and strained his hearing to listen many people were coming and going in the passage and he heard the faint murmur of voices what was going on in the death chamber he could not think the partitions of the inn doubtless constructed long ago for smuggling purposes were unusually thick and even had a man spoken loudly in the next room the listener would have heard nothing but the sound in that case as he argued he could not have saved the dead man even had he been awake probably the poor wretch's throat had been cut in his sleep and who had killed him and why had he angus herries a stranger a wanderer on the face of the earth been dragged into so hideous an affair these questions he asked himself constantly while the slow hours dragged onward the village desleigh was its name as he heard later was a long distance from the nearest town whence a police inspector could be called and the local constable without doubt had two or three of such villages to attend to it was quite four or five hours since he had been shut up in his room and no one had been near him to pass the time and escape from the terrible thoughts which tormented his brain herries dressed himself as neatly as he could on leaving pierside he had taken nothing with him as his enemy the captain had detained all his luggage he had nothing but the clothes he stood up in and a few shillings say ten on arriving at the marsh inn he had possessed fifteen but five of these he had given for bed and board he cursed the inn had he not halted here this trouble would never have come upon his already over burdened shoulders and yet he could not be sure of this he had always been jonah the unlucky and jonah he would remain so far as his limited vision could see until the end of his life throughout five and twenty years of existence he had suffered nothing but trouble everything went wrong with him this new disaster was all of a piece with the rest of the pattern that was being woven against his will it would seem on the looms of life he wondered with a sigh why god permitted so many troubles to befall him since he could see no good reason for their coming to him so persistently then out of sheer desire to do something he searched his pockets for the remains of his poor fortune the ten shillings had vanished yet herries knew that he had counted them on the previous evening immediately before he retired to bed and he had placed them in the right hand pocket of his trousers eight shillings and four sixpences alarmed at the loss which meant everything to him he felt in every pocket looked under his pillow examined the floor but could find no trace of the money how on earth can i get to tarhaven he asked himself and then it came upon him with a shock that he was not a free man shortly a soft tap at the door roused him he told the person who knocked to enter and a key turned in the lock elspeth her face white and her eyes red entered carrying a tray laden with coarse food this she set down then impulsively she rushed forward and caught his hand you never did it she panted eagerly and staring at him with burning eyes you never never did it of course not i can prove my innocence no he made a gesture of despair as the full terror of his situation rushed upon him i say that to comfort myself i am in a perilous position that a kind man such as you are should do such a thing the girl went on almost to herself it's ridiculous you helped me with that bucket you would not murder a poor soul in his sleep that i did not i swear by all that i hold sacred said herries grateful for this true sympathy but you see how i am placed you know the strong evidence against me elspeth nodded mr and mrs narby are talking of it she whispered with a significant glance at the door behind which no doubt some one was watching the police will be here soon they have sent to tarhaven for the inspector and the doctor what is the time now it is close upon three o'clock said elspeth armour who is the village constable is on his rounds at some other village and although they have sent out to get him he cannot be found but pope has gone by train to tarhaven to bring the inspector i expect he'll return every minute and i cannot stop long they will miss me but i want to be your friend she added again catching his hand tell me is there anyone i can send for who will help you there is my friend dr james browne of tarhaven i have not seen him for a couple of years but i daresay he'll remember me write and ask him to come or perhaps you could procure me writing material no they she alluded to the narby's will allow you nothing then send the letter yourself to browne you kind little soul he may say a good word for me is there no one else herries' head drooped there is one i should not like to hear of my disgrace he said faintly ah the girl's dark eyes lighted up with a jealous flame and her name mr herries the young man looked surprised how can you guess that i am thinking of a woman i guess because because oh you would not understand what is her name i'll see her if you like her face grew red as she spoke and had herries been more experienced in the other sex he might have seen that her feelings towards him for his simple act of kindness were such as to make her hate anyone doing things for him save herself however he saw nothing of this and gave the information with all frankness maud tedder she is a cousin of mine the daughter of sir simon tedder a famous manufacturer you may have heard of elspeth nodded i've seen his name on jam tins and such like she said rapidly he has a great house at tarhaven i know i have been there once a couple of years ago but he quarrelled with me and turned me out because of miss miss she could not say the name yes i wanted to marry my cousin sir simon would not let me and she she she obeyed her father as a daughter should said herries bitterly but i do not know why i talk of these very private affairs to you but if you would hush elspeth placed a silencing finger on her lips the police hardly had she left the room when the inspector as he evidently was from his smart uniform entered in an abrupt manner he was a kindly red faced man with a military moustache and an official manner which made him assume a severity which herries guessed was foreign to his nature two policemen were visible in the narrow passage as the inspector entered the room after a word or two with the girl to learn why she had been with the prisoner your name demanded the officer sharply and taking in herries' looks with a shrewd and observant eye angus herries i am innocent said the accused man hurriedly then anxious to exculpate himself he talked on vehemently and thereby did the worst thing possible i do not know the dead man's name or the man himself i have never seen him i was fast asleep all the time i found the razor and stop said the inspector peremptorily anything you say now will be used in evidence against you hold your tongue until i am ready to examine you and follow me and with that he turned his back to march out of the room herries saw that it would be as well to be circumspect and walked silently after the representative of the law the official turned to the right and opened the door of the death room at which narby was standing this was the first time the inspector had been inside and he wanted herries to be present to see what effect the sight of his supposed victim would have on his nerves the young man was glad to enter he wished to face the worst at once the room was similar to the other bare cold looking and sparingly furnished with the flotsam and jetsam of auction rooms everything seemed to be disordered but the bedclothes were smoothed out and thereon lay a stiff figure covered with a sheet the police officer turned down the sheet and beckoned herries to approach the very next moment the young man staggered back amazed great heavens he gasped thunderstruck it is sir simon tedder chapter iii circumstantial evidence sir simon tedder inspector trent as the red faced official was called relaxed his stiffness so far as to display astonishment the millionaire who made his fortune out of jam and pickles who has a house at tarhaven yes faltered herries weakly and sinking into a chair near the door he covered his shameful face trent seeing tears trickling between the nerveless fingers felt convinced with the assurance of the shortsighted that his experiment had proved successful the guilty man's self control had given way at the sight of his victim so thought a jack in office who was unable to see farther than his nose by reason of natural and official limitations but the truth was and a medical man would have surmised it that herries with his long tramp his weakened frame his despairing outlook and the surprising sight of his relative lying dead by violence suddenly became as unstrung as an hysterical woman the tears relieved him and had they not broken forth he would have become insane at the mere thought of this terrible disaster falling upon him after years and years of cruel misfortune he felt and very naturally like a tormented rat in a trap and could see no means of escape sir simon tedder repeated trent with a gratified glance at the still white face of the dead the millionaire he rolled the agreeable word on his tongue this will be an important affair and throwing out his chest he swelled with triumph at the thought of the fame and praise which so notorious a case would bring him why did you kill him young man herries ashamed of the momentary weakness dropped his hands and dashed the moisture from his eyes i did not kill him he declared with emphatic slowness trent grew red and indignant at what he conceived to be a shameless denial i have heard the landlord's story he retorted pompously and have therefore made up your mind without hearing the other side that i am guilty said herries bitterly is it the custom of the english law to hear only the accuser i am now prepared to listen to the defence announced trent hastily and in spite of the strong evidence and his own belief he felt sorry for the wreck before him although red tapeism condemned the too purely human feeling leaving a stolid policeman to guard the door of the death chamber pending the arrival of the doctor trent led his prisoner down the stairs and into the stuffy back parlour which sir simon had occupied on the previous evening mrs narby glared at the unfortunate man whom she accused of having ruined her inn and pope's weak silly face alive with morbid curiosity could be seen over the brawny maternal shoulder herries shuddered in spite of many misfortunes he had always been popular in his bohemian world and it was both new and unpleasant for him to see venomous looks cast upon him last night he had been merely an object of contemptuous interest now he was like a tiger prisoned behind bars at which everyone looked with dread and hatred as the short autumnal evening rendered even more immediate by the still prevailing foes was rapidly closing in trent lighted the cheap lamp which swung over the round table the light and the oily smell came simultaneously as both door and window were closed and the room was crowded with frowsy furniture the atmosphere was sickly and malodorous and herries never entered a stuffy apartment in after years without recalling that hopeless evening when his misfortunes culminated in nothing less than a waterloo the inspector seated himself at the round table in a magisterial manner and produced a portentous pocket book he permitted herries to sit down in an antique arm chair slippery with horse hair and marvellously uncomfortable with an antimacassar of berlin wool work having moistened a pencil with his tongue he proceeded to ask what questions occurred to his not over clever brain what is your name angus herries your occupation i am a doctor a ship's doctor and i came last night from pierside where the arctic sealer 'nansen' is lying why did you come to this almost unknown inn i walked from pierside intending to seek a friend at tarhaven my strength gave way and i stayed here to eat and sleep trent took down these answers thoughtfully then looked in what he fondly thought was a piercing manner at the suspected man you told me that you did not know the deceased i did that is perfectly true until you showed me the corpse i was quite ignorant that sir simon had been killed i did not even know that he was in this house you knew sir simon tedder then yes herries hesitated then looked boldly at the officer i have nothing to conceal he declared loudly sir simon is my uncle trent looked at the shabby prisoner with great surprise the reply amazed him as coming from such a tramp it is impossible he said sharply sir simon was wealthy and much respected he would not allow his nephew to go about in rags herries looked sullen my uncle and i quarrelled oh said the inspector in a peculiar tone do you take that admission as a sign of guilt inquired herries ironically i take it to mean that you had bad feelings towards the deceased the prisoner shook his head you are wrong i had no bad feelings and yet you quarrelled violently take care what you say may be used against herries rose with an angry gesture an innocent man such as i am does not need to be careful of his words he cried my life history is miserable enough certainly but there is no page of which i need be ashamed for an educated man to be in such a plight the prisoner again interrupted do you know what jonah's luck is i know that the person you mention was swallowed by a whale said trent with dignity i am not entirely a heathen in spite of his misery herries could not help smiling i give you the whale he said sarcastically in spite of my sojourn in the arctic regions i have escaped the gullet of that animal i allude to the prophet's luck everything went wrong with him as it has done with me do you know what it is inspector to be unlucky to try your hardest to earn bread and a roof in the face of circumstances too hard to conquer have you ever found doors shut against you has your family ever regarded you as a hopeless black sheep because you had not the money to wash your wool white i have been hungry starving almost without clothes certainly without fire on freezing days life has crushed me into the mire and every struggle i made to rise was met with a fresh blow such miseries as these said dogberry sapiently lead men to commit crimes in my case no cried herries striking the table heavily i can look any man in the face as i look into yours now and can say that i am honest in thought word and deed his clear blue eyes looked into those of the inspector and it was the official who first gave way turning over the leaves of his pocket book to disguise the impression which herries' frankness had made on him he took refuge in irritation a sure sign that he had no feasible reply to make this isn't what we are here to talk about he said testily i wish to know what defence you have to make to the charge brought against you by the landlord what defence that i am innocent on what grounds on the grounds that i never expected to find sir simon here that i did not know he was in the house that i have no grudge against him how do i know that asked trent cunningly because i tell you that such is the case said herries haughtily and if you will listen to a short account of my life you may be able to conquer the prejudice against me which the couple who keep this miserable inn have instilled into your breast i am not prejudiced snapped trent nettled say what you have to say and let us end this business as speedily as possible i am only too anxious to do so said herries coldly and folding his arms still standing i am the son of sir simon tedder's only sister he was a hard man always and when she married against his will he would never help her my mother and father both died when i was in my teens they left enough money for me to gain an education and secure a doctor's degree i practised on shore with bad success and so went to sea i have been away from england for about two years and since then i have never set eyes on my uncle until you showed me his corpse just now when did you see him last two years ago i was doing badly and called upon him to learn if he would help me he might have done so but that i was in love with his daughter maud i had met her at the house of some friends in edinburgh and saw her frequently we loved and when i saw my uncle i told him this he became angry and turned me out of the house by his order maud sent back my letters and since then i have had nothing to do with either of them why then i ask you should i kill my uncle seeing that i cannot benefit in any way by such a crime i landed here two days ago unknown and friendless as i said i was on my way to tarhaven to see a friend when i put up at this accursed inn last night who is your friend dr james browne of elgar avenue tarhaven we were fellow students i know him said the inspector taking down the name can he vouch for your respectability herries smiled bitterly respectability and myself parted company long ago said he with a shrug but browne knows all that i am telling you now even to the courting of my cousin maud what did he think of your quarrelling with your uncle he approved of my leaving the house as to the quarrel browne knows that i have a fiery temper oh interrupted trent in his peculiar tone and thinking that he had chanced upon something suspicious so you have a fiery temper yes admitted herries not dreaming of what such an admission might mean to him but only when it is aroused by injustice and insults last night it was not so roused i went to bed shortly before eight o'clock ignorant as i have said several times that my uncle was in the house had i known that i would have gone on to tarhaven weary though i was rather than have slept under the same roof with a man who insulted my mother and myself shamefully trent shook his head all very fine but the key of sir simon's room was found on the floor of your bedroom the razor with which his throat was cut was in your possession and there is blood on the sleeve of your shirt the young man hastily stripped off his coat and held the right hand sleeve of his shirt under the lamp close to trent's eyes there are the smears he said quietly and you will see that they are made by fingers dipped in blood having been drawn down the sleeve could i have done that myself also when i found the razor on my quilt when i awoke i called up the landlord to ask him what it meant i knew nothing of the crime at the time neither did narby as he will tell you were i guilty would i have acted in so foolish a manner oh yes you would said trent dictatorially criminals are very artful as i have often found it was apparently impossible to convince a man so bent upon finding proofs of guilt where none existed so herries abandoned persuasion and turned away with a shrug i have nothing more to say yes you have insisted trent stupidly why did you conceal that sir simon expected you last night he did not he never knew that i was here or even in england as we had not corresponded since he turned me out of his house at tarhaven two years ago the maid elspeth said that sir simon expected a gentleman i was not the man you were the only stranger who came last night said trent digging his pencil thoughtfully into the book no the expected visitor must have come last night and have slept here mr narby will tell you that mrs narby saw him pass through the tap room at eight this morning did he not stop to pay the bill mrs narby thought that the man was sir simon the inspector rose quickly what he asked in an amazed tone i am only telling you what narby told me before either of us knew that a murder had taken place said herries tartly he declared that his wife had seen the gentleman who occupied this parlour last night and he was sir simon as we know pass through the tap room at eight as he had arranged as he had arranged yes he paid for the rooms and a meal last night so i was told but if he was killed he couldn't have passed out not unless he was a spirit said herries with a shrug but the man whom mrs narby took to be sir simon certainly according to her story had a fur coat on that belonged to my uncle the same in which he arrived here last night trent wrinkled his brow perplexedly what herries said quite upset his calculations and he found himself face to face with a criminal mystery such as had never before come into his official life the accused man saw his advantage and followed it up why should not this unknown man have murdered my uncle he said quickly and have entered my bedroom to implicate me in the crime why should he have done that i cannot say but my bedroom door was not locked and i was fast asleep being quite worn out the assassin left the razor and the key he drew his bloody fingers down the shirt sleeve of my right arm which probably lay outside the quilt these are his marks and herries again shook his stained sleeve in the officer's face by this time trent was more himself and aggressively official it is not for you to teach me my duty he said his self love wounded the people who keep this inn must be examined before i can come to any conclusion you might also examine mr gowrie suggested herries quickly that is if you can find him who is mr gowrie an old tutor of mine whom i found in the tap room last night he went away to london i believe at seven upon my word mr herries said the inspector sarcastically for a man who merely chanced on this inn he emphasised the word you seem to have met not only with relatives but with friends i met my uncle on his death bed and gowrie in the tap room said herries heatedly it is strange i admit since i came here so very unexpectedly extremely strange said trent scoffingly i don't believe in coincidences myself every word you say seems to connect you more and more with the crime this gowrie may have been your accomplice if so he has left me in the lurch said herries sitting down wearily and with all the fire gone out of him there seems to be a kind of fatality haunting my steps jonah's luck i expect trent tried to keep up his official dignity as he went to open the door to call mrs narby but on passing herries the young man looked so dejected that he clapped him on the shoulder cheer up he said in rather a shamefaced manner the evidence is very black against you i admit but you may be able to clear yourself yet find out the man who passed through the tap room this morning at eight and my character will be cleared said herries rather ashamed of his momentary yielding trent opened the door i will thank you not to teach me my duty sir he said in a dignified manner and herries shrugged his shoulders it was terrible to think that his liberty and life should be in the power of so obvious an idiot in the presence of herries the inspector examined mrs narby who from being voluble now became tongue tied mrs narby's youth had brought her into frequent contact with the whitechapel police and she knew the value of silence everything had to be clawed out of her by persistent questioning and all her answers went to prove that herries was assuredly the guilty person as her vernacular was vile and harsh it will be as well to give the gist of her evidence in decent english sir simon tedder she said had arrived about half past six on the previous night just before herries came he said that he wanted a parlour and a bedroom as he was expecting a gentleman to call about eight o'clock but the expected visitor never arrived and sir simon he had not given any name nor had mrs narby asked him for one seemed much annoyed at ten o'clock he had retired to bed after paying the score and announced that he would depart without breakfast at eight in the morning mrs narby confessed that she saw him as she believed pass through the tap room in his fur coat about that hour he said nothing to her and she said nothing to him being well pleased with the liberal sum he had paid her she thought that having come to the inn secretly he wished to preserve his incognito so let him pass out without a word but at ten o'clock that is two hours later the real sir simon had been found dead in his bed without doubt the man who escaped through the tap room could not have been the millionaire but surely said trent who was taking copious notes you must have guessed that the man who went away was not sir simon mrs narby placed her stout arms akimbo and raged i never know'd es 'is naime wos sir simon or anythink else said she shrilly an' th' gent es parsed through th' tap room wos tall an' stout same es this sir simon y' torks of he wore the same fur coat es sir simon wore wen he come inter this very parlour overnight so 'ow wos i t' know es the gent es slung 'is 'ook at eight this mornin' wasn't th' same es come et harlf past six in th' evenin' are you sure it was the same fur coat yuss said mrs narby stoutly there ain't no fur coat lef' in' th' bedroom of th' gent es lies a deader i looked fur it added the landlady defiantly es i sawr th' value an' wanted summat fur my bein' ruined by 'im and she pointed towards herries i never killed him muttered herries wearily it seemed scarcely worth while to contradict those who seemed certain that he was guilty ho but y' did cried mrs narby shriller than ever y' wos a pore tramp with no money and thet gent sir simon es y' calls 'im hed 'eaps an' 'eaps trent looked up quickly how do you know that i took in 'is tea said mrs narby nodding vigorously an' pope me son took in th' toast which the gent ate he wos settin' at thet there table with a 'eap of notes an' gold beside 'im and a big morrocker pocket book int' which he shovelled the money wen he saw pope an' me come in look fur the blue pocket book mr policeman an' if it's gorn it's that there cove she again pointed to herries who again shook his head as 'ave it you can search me said the accused man opening his arms trent took him at his word and ran his hand down the young man's sides but nothing could be found he then marched him and the landlady upstairs and into the bedroom herries with his hands in his pockets sat wearily by the window while trent examined the room aided by mrs narby the lady was extremely active she pulled the clothes from the bed removed the wardrobe from against the wall and wrenched up the carpet but all to no purpose then while trent looked up the chimney mrs narby with surprising activity scrambled under the bed she emerged in a minute or so with a smothered exclamation covered with grime and fluff and held in her large hand a blue pocket book of morocco the money cried trent darting towards her mrs narby shook out the pocket book triumphantly empty she cried vindictively he's the thief an' assassing and she flung the book at herries' head chapter iv what happened next mrs narby's discovery convinced inspector trent that his prisoner was guilty the razor the key of the dead man's bedroom the smeared sleeve and the pocket book all pointed to herries as the assassin and to this material evidence could be added several serious admissions after an early denial herries had admitted that he knew the deceased he had acknowledged him to be a relative with whom he had quarrelled and he had stated that his temper was fiery finally the presumed murderer arriving at an unknown inn on the particular night on which sir simon had slept there had occupied the room directly adjoining that of his victim in the face of such strong circumstantial evidence it was scarcely to be wondered at that herries looked upon himself as lost weaker proofs had hanged men just as innocent it was close on five o'clock when trent came downstairs to see if the doctor had arrived he locked herries in the bedroom intending to take him personally to tarhaven prison when the doctor had examined the body in the meantime there was no chance of herries escaping from this solitary house surrounded by marsh and fog no one without being well acquainted with the neighbourhood and herries was a stranger could hope to get away without endangering his life the two yokels still watched under the window and three or four policemen were in and around the house trent felt that his valuable prisoner was perfectly safe and went back to the stuffy parlour to examine narby and to question the landlady about the man called michael gowrie to whom herries had alluded the heads of the household being thus employed elspeth and pope attended to the many customers who thronged the tap room a great number of people had been drawn to the inn by an account of the tragedy and as some hours had elapsed since the discovery of the body the news was pretty widely known never before in its sordid history had the marsh inn done such a roaring trade and pope put his poetry and dreaming on one side to deliver pots of frothing beer to thirsty labourers who lethargically discussed the crime elspeth looking more miserable and white faced than ever moved like an unquiet ghost about the room fulfilling her duties in a mechanical way while her thoughts were busy with the prisoner overhead with the unreasoning affection of a woman she was sure in her own mind that herries was innocent not because of what he said but for the simple reason that he had been kind to her that episode of the bucket at their first meeting had established a silent understanding between the two unlucky people and each recognised in the other a kindred spirit never before had elspeth met with an unsolicited act of kindness and she was prepared to think of the man who rendered it to her trodden down self as a god moreover the tones of his voice the refinement of his face the kindly look in his eyes and perhaps his handsome exterior appealed to her feminine nature moving about with steady eyes and firm lips she was wondering all the time how she could help her hero to prove his innocence but there is always one who loves and one who is loved herries was the latter for as yet and very naturally his heart was untouched shortly a picturesque figure entered the crowded tap room in the person of a short thick set man dressed in a coster costume of the ornate type he wore bell bottomed trousers of grey cloth a short tailed jacket of the same hue and texture a yellow waistcoat and a flaming red scarf twisted round his brawny throat the dress was profusedly decorated with buttons mother of pearl buttons which appeared in every place where a button could be sewn on his brown bowler hat was trimmed with a large ostrich feather and his feet were shod with elegant thin soled high heeled brown boots more suited to a london street than to the mud of the essex marshes this unusual figure unusual at least in the country attracted much bovine attention but the man pushed his way towards elspeth and saluted her by touching his hat and kicking out his right leg sailor fashion sweetlips said elspeth looking surprised at seeing him sweetlips kind himself replied the man in a pleasant and rather cultivated voice just come into this smoky engine house as the fogs make it with the caravan and the missus ill oh elspeth's voice was full of sympathy is rachel ill diphtheria poor lass and what's a cheap jack like me to do with a sick wife in a caravan he drew the sleeve of his jacket across his kind shrewd grey eyes and must have scratched himself with the many buttons is there a doctor about he asked huskily the nearest doctor is ten miles away explained the girl in a sympathetic manner he comes to desleigh only on saturdays can't wait till then my girl the missus may die at any moment if the stuff ain't taken from her throat it's hard to lose her after all these years of fair and foul weather i want you to come to her elspeth and i'll ride my horse to that doctor if you'll tell me where he is to be found i can't leave the inn just now said elspeth thinking of herries upstairs depending upon her assistance we're in dreadful trouble a pot of beer please said sweetlips quickly what's up there's been a murder lor you don't tell me so yes an old gentleman has been killed and the murderer is shut in a bedroom upstairs finished pope with a leer he is not the murderer said the girl indignantly and turning a shade paler i don't know who killed sir simon tedder but i am quite sure that mr herries didn't sir simon tedder said kind dropping the pot of beer from his mouth the millionaire cove is he a deader his throat has been cut said pope eagerly not by mr herries retorted elspeth lor said kind again why i've got some of his jam stuff with the name on the tins here's a go i could do a bit of business on this here he went on his lip trembling folk always crowd to places where a murder's been committed but i've rachel to think of come elspeth he ended entreatingly come to the missus and lemme go for the doctor a doctor will be here soon from tarhaven to examine the body said pope filling another pewter the inspector and the police are in the house and the doctor is to follow two doctors will be here corrected elspeth struck with a sudden thought i sent a telegram from the station to dr james browne who is a friend of mr herries you'll get into trouble with the police pope warned her what do i care for the police so long as mr herries is proved innocent cried the girl passionately but if you will wait for a short time she continued addressing the mournful cheap jack one or the other of the doctors will come soon i hope one of 'em will be in time to save my rachel said kind with a sigh lor what a go it will be if i lose her she's been the sun and the moon to yours truly for years pope sniggered if you're in such a hurry he said in an unkindly tone ask mr herries to see your wife mr gowrie told me that he is a doctor and he's on the spot elspeth's pale cheeks flamed and she clasped her hands oh she cried passionately do you think the police would let him go and see mrs kind not much snapped pope and giggled he's got to see old ketch young man said sweetlips sternly i've knocked down a cove for speaking more politely than you do not so much of it do you hear pope did hear and being a rank coward changed colour after an uneasy attempt to assert his dignity he was quelled by the cheap jack's stern eye and moved away hurriedly in response to an imaginary call kind turned to elspeth who was thinking if them two doctors don't come said he slowly an' the police won't let this chap as is accused see the missus she's a deader elspeth covered her face for a moment and thought where is your caravan she asked hurriedly sweetlips pointed a careless thumb over his right shoulder just outside the village he replied come an' let us see the inspector chap he might listen to me and let mr herries come to see the poor missus i fear not sweetlips you don't know the police don't i my girl kind gave a conscious laugh i know them better than i do myself but quite in an honest way mind you i've been other things than a cheap jack in my time but the missus the missus he said impatiently while i'm talking she's dying come and see her elspeth the girl stood irresolute she thought of mrs narby's temper and of mrs narby's heavy fist of herries upstairs in danger of his life and finally of the poor woman dying in the caravan some angel passing must have whispered courage to her at the moment for suddenly her cheeks flushed a brave red her eyes sparkled and her mouth grew firm i'll come she said quickly but first tell me what you had to do with the police kind hesitated then lowered his lips to the level of her ear i was a detective once he whispered hoarsely used to look after chaps like this dr herries you talk of and hang 'em if i could you beast said elspeth in low tones drawing back dr herries is quite innocent then let him save the missus and i'll save him can you she asked her breast heaving yes if he really and truly is innocent he is i swear he is she cried passionately wait till i get my hat and shawl and we'll see the inspector and afterwards go to mrs kind don't tell this police chap of my being a detective said kind in an anxious tone i've cut that business and if folks knew what i had been they wouldn't come and buy things all the patter in the world wouldn't help a cheap jack who had once hanged criminals you'll save this one only he isn't a criminal said elspeth and glided away up the stairs while kind boldly went towards the parlour and knocked mrs narby opened the door sweetlips kind explained himself in a few minutes and asked that the prisoner guarded of course should be permitted to see mrs kind certainly not said trent sternly the prisoner is in his bedroom and there he must remain until he is lodged in gaol but my wife will die said kind faintly i am sorry replied trent blandly and uneasily for his own inclination was to permit the visit but i cannot exceed my powers then you won't sir if you knew the police my man you wouldn't ask that i know the police for the biggest set of fools on earth cried the cheap jack passionately you'll never hang this man if i can clear his character i'll save him to spite you that would let my poor wife die for your cursed red tape business and before the astonished trent could express the indignation he felt kind was out of the inn waiting in the foggy street for elspeth she joined him shortly in a state of intense excitement and heard kind's openly expressed wrath against trent and his minions then you'll help mr herries she said squeezing his arm won't i you bet i just will said kind heartily let us get the missus out of danger first and i'll remember enough of my old business to hunt down the real murderer always provided added the ex detective cautiously that this man is innocent he is he is i'll tell you all about it as we walk to the caravan no my dear said sweetlips gently until rachel is safe i can't think of anything else come quickly he dragged her along into the fog she may be dead poor soul come and the two figures vanished in the mist which was thicker and darker and colder than ever the cheap jack's evil star must have been in the ascendant at the moment for twenty minutes after he had turned his back on the inn dr james browne of tarhaven arrived hotfooted he came by train to the local station a quarter of a mile distant and had walked to the inn through the fogs at once he asked for his friend and inspector trent was informed of the fact he immediately terminated his examination of mr and mrs narby from whom he had learned nothing new and had the new comer shown into the stuffy parlour to be questioned your name demanded the inspector curtly official dr browne i have come from tarhaven and wish to see my friend mr herries who is i understand accused of murder who told you so browne took a telegram from his breast pocket and passed it in silence to the officer it was unsigned and contained but a few words which were as follows angus herries accused of murder marsh inn desleigh come immediately when trent read this he laid it on the table and scrutinised the doctor carefully browne was short and stout and imperative his hair was red so was his moustache and short beard and he had choleric blue eyes apparently he had a temper but recognising the majesty of the law and knowing that it would be needful for herries' sake to stand well with its representative he kept himself in hand experience had taught him the necessity of being cool at critical moments and the present was critical if not for himself at least for his friend what do you know of this asked trent when he had taken in the exterior of his visitor as much as you see in that telegram retorted browne pointing to the table i was a fellow student of mr herries in edinburgh and have not seen him for quite two years i know him well enough to say that he is not guilty of murder the evidence is strongly against him circumstantial evidence has hanged an innocent man before now it will not hang mr herries if he can prove his innocence by the way did you see dr harkness in the train no why do you ask i sent for him to come here and examine the body if he does not arrive soon perhaps you will take his place certainly i'll do anything to help herries i don't see how a post mortem can help him retorted trent sir simon tedder's throat has been cut sir simon tedder browne started and looked dismayed you know him yes he is herries' uncle i attended him at tarhaven where he has a house for an attack of influenza and tried to make peace between him and his nephew ah trent assumed an air of satisfaction then you know that the two had quarrelled i see no reason to conceal the fact that i do know snapped the doctor sharply but that was two years ago herries went to sea and it is incredible that he should return to murder his uncle yet you must admit that it is strange uncle and nephew should both have been at this inn i admit nothing until i know the facts mr inspector here they are between ourselves doctor i should like to save mr herries who seems to have had a hard time he has poor soul but added trent cautiously it will be difficult to save him in the face of the evidence what is it inspector trent detailed all that he had learned from the people of the inn and from the prisoner himself dr browne with his keen blue eyes fastened on the official listened intently weighing the evidence in silence only when trent ended did he speak and then curtly you have captured the wrong man indeed said trent sarcastically perhaps you can tell me the name of the right one not being omniscient i cannot it is for you mr inspector to learn the name of the man who passed through the tap room at eight you accuse him of course he is the assassin and has implicated herries by placing in his room the razor the key and the pocket book this unknown man must have been the one whom sir simon expected on the previous night how do you know that because by your own showing sir simon could not have known of his nephew's presence here the unknown man did not arrive at the time he was expected but when the inn was closed he must either have been admitted by sir simon and taken to the bedroom or he must have got in by the window the window is on the first floor browne cast a look upward at the low ceiling i don't think an active man would have any difficulty in climbing there is certainly some trellis work outside against the window of the room sir simon occupied said trent half to himself but this is all theoretical so is the evidence against herries do you call a razor a stained shirt the dead man's pocket book and the key of the dead man's room theoretical these things were placed in herries' room by the assassin to implicate him in the crime said browne obstinately why should the unknown man take that trouble argued trent he could not have known that my prisoner was the nephew of sir simon and it would have been easy for him to have left as he did after as you say committing the crime without taking the trouble to throw the blame on an innocent man i don't see what the assassin gains by taking such trouble he provided for his own safety in case his name was discovered but went on the inspector how do we know that this unknown man saw sir simon at all the landlady's evidence makes that clear replied browne in a decisive way she saw him wearing the fur coat of the deceased it might have been the man's own fur coats are very much alike there i disagree with you but presuming this to be the case have you found the fur coat of sir simon in his room no the landlady searched and could not find it then its disappearance proves what i say to be true said browne in a triumphant manner what happened is this the assassin could not arrive at the appointed time and sir simon retired to bed later the man came and either obtained admittance through the front door opened by sir simon when all were in bed or climbed up by the trellis to which you allude the two had a talk and a quarrel and the visitor cut the old man's throat then he waited until the morning knowing how his victim was to leave the inn he boldly walked out leaving strong evidence against herries but why asked trent persistently oh i cannot tell you the motive for the commission of the crime mr inspector you must learn that from the man who passed through the tap room in sir simon's fur coat and i think added browne shrewdly that you will learn that the assassin implicated herries to save himself in the event of his being suspected i don't agree with you said trent doggedly and rose to show that the interview was at an end herries is guilty i should have been surprised if you had agreed retorted browne herries is innocent question the man yourself then snapped the inspector not in the best of tempers his suspicious behaviour and lame explanations will shake your belief never retorted the loyal friend i would as soon suspect myself as herries who is the best as he is the most unfortunate fellow in the world what infernal luck he has had trent stiffened his erect figure and still obstinate strode out of the room followed by browne who looked like a very pugnacious bull terrier the two proceeded up the narrow stairs and into the passage leading to the two rooms round which all interest in the little hostel centred since one contained a corpse and the other the presumed criminal policemen guarded each door and both of them reported to trent that everything was going well taking the key of herries' room from his pocket trent opened the door and entered abruptly as though to catch the prisoner unawares the room was naturally in darkness as it was now late and no candle had been allowed the suspected man in case he should set the inn on fire trent expected to find darkness but he did not expect to experience a chilly clammy feeling as though he were without and not within to be plain the bedroom was filled with mist and a sudden suspicion struck the officer herries mr herries he called and when there was no reply he turned towards browne in the darkness of the passage bring a light bring a light the constable who had guarded the door more ready than his chief instantly struck a match and the blue glimmer served somewhat to dispel the gloom as the lucifer flamed up trent darted into the room with an oath and a cry of rage the prisoner has escaped it was true the window was open the room was empty as he had come out of the mist to that unfortunate inn so had herries vanished again behind the grey veil which still hung over the marshes chapter v hue and cry gone cried trent both enraged and amazed how did he escape by the window replied dr browne who was not ill pleased to find the room empty and he struck a second match to make certain yes by the window anyone can see that retorted the officer sorely annoyed for the position of affairs reflected no credit on his brains holl fairburn what is the meaning of this the two policemen protested that they were not in fault fairburn on guard at the door of the death chamber exonerated himself by pointing out that the corpse which he had been set to watch was still in the room while holl vehemently stated that he had heard no sound likely to lead him to believe in an intended escape i did not hear the window being opened said holl decisively why didn't you station a policeman under the window asked browne while the inspector fretted and fumed and wondered inwardly what the authorities would say to his negligence two men villagers were posted there he said angrily i'll see them at once he ran hastily down the stairs and out of the front door into the side garden where the two men had been stationed finding no one there he returned to the tap room and discovered the watchers busy with pots of beer why are you not at your posts men he asked in a loud domineering voice we got tired said one bovine agriculturalist explaining on behalf of himself and his friend and the damp was giving we the blamed rheumatics what the devil does that matter you fools you should have remained where i placed you you bean't our master grumbled the spokesman and there weren't no money given to we trent stamped but could not gainsay this speech it was his own fault as he recognised plainly enough for it was his duty to have posted official guards how long have you been here he asked twenty minutes to half an hour said the yokel drawing his sleeve across his mouth as he set down an empty pewter bill here and me 'ull go back if it be as you'll give we money you can save yourself the trouble retorted trent sharply swinging round on his heel the prisoner has escaped immediately the tap room was in commotion and everyone rose in consternation it was not pleasant to think that a murderer was at large and in the neighbourhood narby from force of habit felt for his revolver guess he can't hev gone far said he in his nasal american way th' fog 'ud stop him the fog will save him more like said dr browne quickly he'll have time to get away before the mists lift and i'm glad oh you are mister and for why may i ask because the man is innocent innercent shrieked mrs narby shrilly an' me findin' the pocket book and narby the razor an' key wot's yer torkin' of anyhow here cried trent impatiently while we chatter the prisoner is escaping twenty pounds to the man who finds him the yokels needed no further incentive to action they made a rush for the door and in a few minutes the lands surrounding the village were dotted with lanterns each carried by a man eager to earn the reward trent remained behind to ask questions did anyone see the prisoner he asked holl the constable saluted sulkily no sir you gave orders that no one was to disturb him and locked the door yourself that girl he pointed to elspeth who was an attentive spectator came up to see him and went on her knees at the very door itself that i should let her in i told her that i could not and that even if i would the door was locked did she speak through the door no sir but the prisoner must have heard her asking me to let her enter returned holl smartly and having saluted was dismissed abruptly now then said trent beckoning elspeth to approach why did you wish to see the prisoner the girl was quite ready with her reply to tell him that according to his wish i had sent a message to his friend in tarhaven ah cried browne nodding his thanks that was me you sent the telegram yes sir mr herries said that you would help him i intend to do all i can my girl but matters look black against him all the same he is innocent you had no right to send the telegram without telling me said trent to elspeth in angry tones mr herries was kind to me she returned steadily and i was quite right in returning his kindness and herries was within his rights in asking to see me said browne sharply the poor devil needs a friend seeing how you have already judged him i do not judge him said trent very irritated the jury will do that dr browne you'll have to catch your hare first mr inspector trent would have made an angry reply and there is no knowing to what lengths the quarrel would have proceeded only that browne's attitude was so sturdy and his blue eyes so unflinching in their gaze that the inspector thought it would be best to leave the fiery little doctor alone he was as much in the right as trent himself was in the wrong however the inspector was determined to vent his wrath on someone and chose elspeth who remained in the room with himself and browne everyone else even mrs narby was out hunting the miserable man whom they insisted was guilty what do you know of this asked trent tell the truth i never tell lies replied the girl quietly i know nothing i went up over an hour ago to inform mr herries that i had sent the telegram and the policeman who has just gone out would not allow me to see him i then put on my cloak and hat and came down to go with sweetlips kind to his caravan why did you go there to see his wife who is dying if you remember mr trent yes yes snapped the inspector rather ashamed of himself and addressed browne a cheap jack came here over an hour ago asking that a doctor should be sent to his wife your friend herries is a medical man but of course i could not let him go and there was no one else is the woman very ill asked browne sharply she was but she is better now replied elspeth i looked after her it is not a matter of life and death now in that case i may as well see the corpse upstairs said the doctor briskly will you come with me mr inspector trent agreed readily enough as there was nothing else left for him to do his men and the villagers were out hunting the mists for the escaped criminal and it was useless for him to join in since his presence was required in the death chamber he went upstairs with the doctor and elspeth was left alone she heaved a sigh of relief when they departed and sat down before the fire to snatch a few moments of quiet before her tyrant returned and to think over the position of affairs there could be no doubt that she loved this fugitive for her heart ached to think of the peril he was in the poor girl's life had been a hard one and now at the age of twenty there did not seem much chance of improvement overhearing somewhat of the story told by herries to gowrie she thought that his bad luck was very much like her own since her cradle she had been the victim of misfortune and nothing had gone well with her yet had elspeth been better fed and better dressed and loved as a girl of her age should be loved she would undoubtedly have bloomed into a pretty damsel but cares had aged her and want of good food rendered her lean if herries was jonah she was mrs jonah as this quaint thought came into her mind she smiled and blushed much as she would have liked to be mrs jonah there was small chance of her achieving her desire the man she loved was a supposed criminal flying from justice and even had his case been less desperate he could not marry her for lack of money and again even had he possessed money he would not have made her his wife as he was not in love with her as she was with him the future looked very dark to this poor cinderella seated by the fire and thinking of her sorrows the tears ran down her cheeks although she had plenty of pluck but the most plucky person gives way at times she was aroused from her musings by the entrance of pope in a state of excitement he carried a lantern and was covered with mud his face was red and his eyes flashed brightly elspeth started up in alarm fearing the worst have they caught him she asked laying her hand on her breast to still the loud beating of her heart not yet but they soon will said the poet everyone is searching the marshes all around and the lanterns are dancing like will o' the wisps in the foggy air i have tried to find him but i cannot oh i hope mother or father will and then i'll have the twenty pounds to publish my poems would you sell that poor man for twenty pounds pope why not elspeth if he is guilty but he is not declared the girl vehemently you and everyone else have made up your minds that mr herries killed sir simon i don't believe that he did and i hope that he has escaped then if he is innocent mr gowrie must be guilty elspeth rose angrily and darting forward shook the long shambling lad furiously how dare you say that she cried why should mr gowrie kill sir simon sir simon had money stuttered pope much ruffled and backing before the small fury who faced him he slept in this room and could easily have gone upstairs when everyone was quiet to kill sir simon he did nothing of the sort pope i know mr gowrie better than you do and he is incapable of such wickedness it was mr gowrie who brought you here wasn't it elspeth yes said the girl listlessly and all the light died out of her eyes a year ago i was away at that time chattered pope setting down his lantern and producing a cheap cigarette mother placed me in an office but i could not stand so sordid a life he added with an affected shudder it was not the life for a poet so i came back and here i can write glorious verse so you think said elspeth who had read pope's productions and thought very little of them but you would be much better earning your own bread and butter than living on your mother they have brought a genius into the world and it is their glorious duty to support him said pope grandiloquently when i am poet laureate i'll make it up to them elspeth shrugged her spare shoulders and went resignedly about her work it was impossible to make pope think himself any other but the most famous poet in the world and his conceit amounted to a positive mania even as elspeth moved away the young man commenced to mouth one of his bombastic poems devoid of grammar or sense and elspeth felt inclined to stop her ears so vile was the rhythm this she did not do having a vivid recollection of having suffered at pope's hands when she had once betrayed disgust the poet was mild enough usually but when his vanity was touched he grew positively dangerous and went as the saying goes baresark knowing his eccentricities elspeth therefore paid no attention to the verses but worked on quietly while pope fancying himself a homer at the least walked up and down declaiming turgid blank verse finally finding that elspeth did not applaud he stopped and looked at her spitefully genius is wasted on you elspeth entirely she answered coolly why didn't you wipe your boots before you come in pope they are covered with red mud you have been to the creek at the back of the house why shouldn't i have gone there asked pope with a snarl and his freckled face grew red i don't think mr herries would try to escape in that way pope cooled down and re lighted his cheap cigarette well he didn't go that way although i hunted all along the banks he said have you any idea of where he has gone elspeth if i had i shouldn't tell you pope you must you are only my mother's servant that is not true pope said the girl but her eyes flashed angrily as she turned on him sharply mr gowrie brought me here a year ago and as he could not pay for his board and lodging he left me in pawn so to speak to your mother i have been a drudge ever since well and what is a drudge but a servant snapped pope cowering over the fire to warm his lean hands is mr gowrie any relation to you elspeth yes she replied with an averted face don't ask questions i want to know what your last name is then you won't does my mother know she does not she knows me as elspeth and that must content her and you together why do you wish to know about me pope leered at her and his eyes flashed i thought that if you were washed that you might be pretty well said elspeth unmoved and that i might marry you the girl flushed i would sooner kill myself she cried in a spirited tone my life is hard enough but marriage with you she shuddered and cast a look of loathing at this creature who dared to present himself as her lover oh very well miss said pope shrilly his voice invariably grew shrill when he became angry i'll tell mother about you and she'll make it hot for you you piggish drudge he raged stamping up and down the tap room you ugly cat you nasty beast i wouldn't marry you if you were set with diamonds like like he stopped abruptly like what inquired elspeth sarcastically like the king's crown ended the poet lamely and then his wrath died down as suddenly as it had arisen i say elspeth i didn't mean what i said make me a cup of tea do do do the creature was like a naughty child and elspeth made every allowance for his nerves quarrels of this sort were frequent between them yet pope in his own half mad way was in love with elspeth and when things went awry with him would always come to be comforted by her this did not make her position any the more easy with mrs narby who was like a tigress with her cub when pope was in the question mean as was the inn and lowly as was the position of herself and her husband mrs narby would have gone out of her mind with rage at the idea of her darling marrying elspeth that the girl was indubitably a lady mrs narby never recognised she looked on elspeth as a drudge and would have broken her neck sooner than call her daughter in law to keep pope quiet elspeth made some tea and the poet retired to his favourite settle there to compose poetry in a few moments trent came down with browne and they went into the parlour when the poet was busy with his verses and abstractedly sipping the tea elspeth crept to the door of the parlour and listened she blushed at the idea of eavesdropping but in the cause of herries she would have dared to do a deal more unlucky as the hunted man was he had at least two friends dr browne and elspeth who had no surname until i make a proper examination i cannot be quite certain she heard the doctor say but i think the old man was killed somewhere about twelve o'clock last night was no cry heard none replied trent at least the landlady told me so and as the bed is covered with blood i expect that he was attacked when he was asleep probable enough mused the doctor well mr inspector you had better get your doctor from tarhaven and have the body officially examined i suppose the inquest will take place here i think it will be best doctor i'll send to sir simon's house and break the news to his daughter let me go urged browne i know her well and will be able to tell her the tragedy in a more gentle way than you would i am not exactly wanting in tact said trent annoyed and he stopped at hearing a shout outside the inn and elspeth had only time to glide away from the door and back to the tap room before the alert inspector was at the front door just as he was about to open it mrs narby entered with a rush hugging in her arms a bundle of cloth i've got it i've got it she shouted got herries asked trent sharply the fur coat shouted mrs narby who was red and perspiring and threw down the coat on the floor see the fur coat sables as i'm a living woman that cove es parsed out wore it sir simon's coat said trent what do you think of this doctor much the same as i did before replied browne tartly the assassin wore this coat to facilitate his escape and flung it away to prevent discovery chapter vi the caravan all search for the escaped criminal proved vain herries had vanished as completely as though the earth had swallowed him up after the fashion of korah dathan and abiram apparently he had noted the departure of the amateur guards from their post below the window and had seized the chance of getting away unobserved certainly he did not know the neighbourhood and in that treacherous marsh land ran every chance of missing his way in the fogs to fall into some water hole but it was better at least the accused man appeared to have thought so to risk even so stifling a death rather than face the more judicial and merciful one of the gallows herries had chosen to fall into the hands of god who knew his innocence rather than into the hands of man who judged him guilty before trial but be this as it may it was certain that he was gone for although every square inch of land in and around desleigh village was minutely examined nothing could be found likely to afford a clue to his hiding place perhaps to his grave many of the rustics returned to the marsh inn swearing that the man must be dead in them fogs and with them dratted water holes and him knawing nothing said the yokels each and severally he be dead surely trent did not agree with popular opinion herries was half a sailor and accustomed to fogs he argued to browne in some way he could take care of his skin and would not run away to meet death he ran away to escape death replied browne dryly however should he come to me i shall certainly persuade him to surrender the man would be doubly a fool to come to you and then give himself up said the inspector energetically not if he is innocent his flight looks like innocence browne shrugged his shoulders herries evidently lost his head for the moment when he thinks over things he will return to prove that he has nothing to do with the crime i doubt his being such a fool said trent gloomily you have no idea of his whereabouts i suppose he ended anxiously the irascible little man clenched his ready fists and answered in a voice choked with anger i have been with you all the time and i told you that i had not seen herries for two years how then can you ask me of all people where he has gone inspector trent are you a clever man or a there there interrupted the other before the odious word could be pronounced i made a slight mistake your mistakes as you call them may send herries to the gallows we have to catch him first retorted trent snappishly and the conversation ended for the time being decidedly the inspector was in the wrong and no amount of raging or arguing on his part would prove him to be right he had failed to take proper precautions to guard the prisoner and the bird had escaped the snare thinking again of the social importance of the victim trent cursed himself for having missed such a chance of improving his position he knew well that the authorities would take no excuse and at the moment he could do nothing to repair his error herries was missing and the whole police force would not be able to find him of course there might be a chance when the mists lifted but the question was when would they lift not for days perhaps if the weather wise rustics were to be believed and thus herries would have ample time to make his way to pierside or even into the jaws of the lion at tarhaven and get on board some outward bound tramp once out of england and trent's chance of making a sensation and of getting a rise in his salary would be gone he did the best that he could under the circumstances that is he left a policeman in charge of the cage whence the bird had flown and stationed several in the village itself the local constable armour had not yet shown his face and trent was puzzled as the man was bound during the day to come to desleigh but armour was not visible so the inspector did what he could with the men he had brought from tarhaven judiciously disposing them about the place it might be he hopefully thought that one of them might chance upon herries wandering lost and miserable in the fogs then he placed the written depositions of mrs narby and other witnesses in his pocket and started for tarhaven before leaving the inn however he inquired if browne was coming also no said that gentleman shortly i shall stop here and see that poor woman in the caravan not your friend herries then asked trent artfully if herries returns i'll send a wire to you at once i can't believe you that is both rude and unnecessary retorted browne the veins swelling in his high forehead but i quite see that you cannot grasp my meaning it is useless to explain good day and browne turned on his heel sharply leaving trent furious at being thus addressed the hide of your jack in office is extremely thin left behind dr browne turned his attention to a meal after which he decided to visit the sick woman in the caravan in spite of mrs narby's masculine exterior she was feminine enough to have an attack of nerves owing to recent events dr browne won her gratitude as much as she was able to spare by prescribing for her and as he announced his intention of stopping at the inn for the night on the chance of meeting again with herries the landlady before retiring to bed gave him the stuffy parlour to eat in the bedroom of herries to sleep in and ordered elspeth to attend on him consequently dr browne found himself devouring a badly cooked meal in the parlour somewhere about six o'clock and within half an hour of trent's departure elspeth waited on him and cast furtive glances at him as she was aware that he was her hero's friend and indeed had heard the doctor champion the accused man browne sensitive as a woman to occult influences became aware that she wanted to speak to him but feared to do so by reason as he thought of shyness well he said abruptly when she brought him a cup of coffee yes sir said elspeth with a start you wish to speak to me i don't know why you but i know you have been watching me closely you sent the telegram and know that i am herries' friend you are his friend likewise why i don't know and you wish to speak about him i am his friend said the girl steadily because he is the first human being who has been kind to me there is nothing i would not do for him save his life then said browne caustically i intend to retorted elspeth quickly the doctor turned in his chair and looked at her keenly she was not exactly pretty but there was a delicate and fascinating air about her which meant more than mere physical beauty elspeth had a way with her as the saying goes and browne sensitive as has been said felt her influence at once are you a lady masquerading as a servant he asked bending his shaggy brows i am a drudge left in pawn by a relation said the girl simply what do you mean a year ago i came here with a relative he had not enough to pay for his bed and board and moreover wanting to get to london he did not wish to be encumbered with a girl to settle his bill and get rid of me he left me behind to be mrs narby's servant she pays me nothing and i do all the work and how long is this slavery to last elspeth made a gesture of despair i do not know until my relative makes sufficient money to take me away i cannot go myself as i have no money and only these clothes i wear now here at least i have a bed and food hard though the situation is so i have made up my mind to stay who is your relative i decline to say just now what is your name elspeth a scotch name elspeth what i cannot tell you at present said the girl haughtily humph said browne quite puzzled and also fascinated by this odd creature who was a kind of titania in domestic service you are a mystery well it's none of my business i have always kept clear of women thank god as they complicate life too much for a plain thinking man but herries what about him he is innocent i know that but how do you propose to prove his innocence sweetlips kind can do that so he says and who is sweetlips kind a cheap jack whom i know very well he was a here elspeth paused and looked hard at the red faced doctor go on i am herries' friend well then sweetlips kind was a detective and says that he will try and find the real murderer why should he take this trouble over herries for my sake because i have been waiting on mrs kind poor rachel and why should you take the trouble elspeth flushed mr herries was kind to me and she related the incident of the bucket browne hemmed and hawed i shall never understand the reason why women exaggerate said he with a shrug and finishing his coffee herries only did what any man would do for a woman so far as this woman is concerned no man ever did as much said elspeth dryly hum hum i say you are educated yes i was at a very good girls' school eighteen months ago what is your age nineteen you might be fifty by the way you talk well then you want to help herries and so do i between us we may best that fool trent sweetlips kind will do that where is he in the caravan attending to rachel browne rose quickly by the way i nearly forgot that woman and she needed immediate attention judging from what you said i he made as to move to the door elspeth intercepted him not just now she said hurriedly rachel is better and is now asleep i attended to her pooh you are not a medical man i must go if only out of charity what elspeth would have said must remain a mystery but she apparently was not anxious for the doctor to go on his errand of mercy at all events she did not move away from the door just as she was about to speak the door opened slightly and a head topped by an ostrich feather trimmed bowler hat was thrust cautiously in elspeth she turned at the cautious whisper and opened the door wide come in sweetlips dr browne was just thinking of seeing your wife dr browne repeated the cheap jack with a shrewd glance and who may he be i am mr herries' friend explained browne rather taken with the man's lean clever face he wanted me to come and help him he needs help muttered kind rubbing his bristly chin he's in a hole if ever a man was can you get him out of it i the cheap jack feigned surprise pore cove like me i told him you were a detective put in elspeth oh my gal and arter wot i said to pooh pooh broke in the little doctor good humouredly what is the use of doing things by halves we three want to help an innocent man so it is just as well we should understand one another you are mr herries' friend asked kind cautiously i'm sure he is said elspeth fervently well then kind rolled his hat round and round in his large hands 'spose we get to business if you mean well by the cove as is under suspicion take me up to see the corpse's bedroom why asked browne somewhat startled by this blunt request i want to have a look at the room before the peelers disarrange things if the cove in the fur coat killed sir simon he might have left some evidence behind him which the police overlooked now added kind measuring browne with a keen glance you've seen the corpse i've heard and can get into that room again by saying as you want to do some doctor's work with me to assist once let me get in and i'll look round browne made a cup of his hand for his chin and pondered i can do it he said at last in a brisk manner but will we not go and see your wife first not just now rachel's asleep alone in course said kind stolidly only me and she lives in the cart i'll go and see after her while you search the bedroom said elspeth about to leave the room but your missus my gal she's in bed and won't know pope will attend to the customers and i'm too useful to him to be betrayed to his mother this plan was agreed upon and elspeth with a shawl over her head slipped out of the inn with a hasty excuse to pope browne sought out the constable left in charge who had the key of the death chamber and madetapta his request the man fairburn it was knowing that browne was in the confidence of his inspector as he thought made no objection and readily accompanied the two to the room but he allowed them to enter alone and thought that he was doing his duty by yawning at the door looking up and down the dark passage in a listless manner kind carried the sole candle which the officer allowed to be taken into the room the corpse lay quiet and rigid under the sheet and the feeble candle light made the room look quite funereal to keep up appearances as fairburn was casting occasional glances from the doorway browne turned back the sheet and examined the corpse telling kind to bring water and towels and various other things so as to give him a chance of moving unsuspected round the chamber in this way sweetlips by using the keen eyesight with which nature had endowed him to say nothing of his clever brain saw a great deal i'll open the window he said aloud and went to the dressing table which was immediately before the casement here he remained for a little time examining the position of the glass and the table both of which he noted had been moved then he moved round the room apparently still under the doctor's orders to quell the suspicions of fairburn and when the constable was not looking stooped to pick something off the floor near the bed was a small table covered with a red cloth and on this were writing materials which kind also examined finally he came to the bed and looked at the corpse at the crimsoned pillow and sheets and at the heavy rep curtain which draped the couch a nudge told browne that sweetlips had seen all that he wished to see and the two departed it's all right constable said browne giving the key to the man who yawned on receiving it the regular doctor will come to morrow and you can tell him if i am not here that i have seen the corpse twice yes sir said fairburn saluting and tramped down the passage after locking the door still yawning kind was perfectly satisfied that the inattentive policeman had guessed nothing of the real reason for the visit to the death chamber he turned to browne who was holding the candle what of the room herries slept in he asked in a low voice and with more of the detective's peremptory manner than the cheap jack's careless ease it is mine to night replied the doctor and opened the door of the adjacent room why do you wish to i might find something here also wait taking the candle he entered the room and browne marvelling at the sudden assumption of authority by the man waited in the passage he was impressed by kind's resolution and careful handling of the situation and began to think that here indeed was an ally worth having even the cheap jack's language had changed and he spoke a tongue considerably removed from the slang vernacular which he affected as the proprietor of the caravan when he came out browne on fire with curiosity asked him what discoveries he had made i've found much but much remains to be found said kind shaking his head when we reach the caravan i'll tell you what i think that is he hesitated looked anxiously at browne's open face and then abruptly descended the stairs elspeth was already in the tap room and apparently had just returned on seeing kind she glided up to him and said something in a low voice he nodded rachel is awake he remarked aloud turning to the doctor 'praps you'll come along and see her willingly answered browne starting with alacrity for the door so long as you'll help my friend i'll do anything that's all right said kind meditatively and refused to speak further nor did the doctor worry him with questions the man seemed to be sunk in deep thought and tramped along the muddy village street apparently turning over his late discoveries whatever they might be in his own mind it was still misty and the stars were veiled by the thick white fog so that the night was as dark as the pit but kind seemed to know his way as well as a swallow flying south and unhesitatingly steered the doctor down the street and into the outskirts of the village here in a sloppy meadow stood the caravan at least kind by a gesture intimated that it was there for in the pitchy darkness browne could see nothing the cheap jack kept well alongside the fence and began to whistle garryowen in a lively manner this was evidently a signal to warn his wife that he was approaching so that she might not be scared by footsteps suddenly kind turned abruptly away from the fence and browne following close at his heels almost ran his nose against the vehicle which which was kind's migratory home it loomed up unexpectedly blacker than the blackness if that were possible out of the fogs and the doctor stumbled up the steps which could be discerned by the thread of light which formed a brilliantly bright line at the foot of the door when the door itself opened which it did in response to a triple knock by the cheap jack such a flood of light poured out into the foggy gloom that browne was dazzled for the moment when he entered blinking his eyes and the door was closed he glanced round the interior of the caravan and his gaze rested first on the sick woman who was lying in a narrow bed at one end then browne looked at the person who had opened the door and beheld angus herries chapter vii kind's opinions you cried the doctor staggering back and scarcely able to believe his eyes good lord herries yes herries said the accused man with a swift glance at the door to see that it was well closed but don't speak too loud my dear fellow we never know what ears may be about oh we're safe enough here remarked kind who was bending over his wife what with the mists and the rain and the cold no one will venture out this night into so dismal a meadow that peeler at the inn was half asleep when we came away you speak quite different to what you did said browne puzzled i'm a detective for the time being rejoined kind coolly and recall some of my decent lingo when i'm a cheap jack again i'll slip back into the whitechapel vernacular i've been an actor in my time and know how to suit my language to my rle for the time being and again he bent over his sleeping wife you here muttered browne taking herries' hand and devouring his thin haggard face with his eyes i am glad and yet he shook his head in a doubtful way recalling his promise to trent you think that i should not have run away it looks like guilt herries what do you believe would i take your hand if i believed that you were guilty interrupted the doctor sharply that i am here should show you that i have the most implicit confidence in your innocence ah said herries rather sadly but you came to see mrs kind and you wouldn't have come put in sweetlips over his shoulder if elspeth had not whispered when we came out that mr herries wanted to see you you can trust me said browne rather huffily and in any case i presume you would not have sacrificed your wife's life to save herries' neck he has saved her said kind looking at the young man with his heart in his honest eyes what do you mean asked browne coming to the bed side and stooping over the woman who seemed to be in a sound sleep mr herries is a doctor he came here and sucked the stuff from her throat in the nick of time but for his bravery my poor rachel would have been dead kind wiped his eyes with the sleeve of his jacket and again looked at herries i'll give my life up to finding the man who killed your uncle so that you may be saved can you do that asked herries sadly it seems to me that the evidence is so strong so it is so it is but i have been searching the death chamber and your room at the inn i have found other evidence which may be of value oh herries clenched his hands eagerly what is it one moment interposed browne in a low voice so as not to disturb the patient let us do things in order what about mrs kind she's all right and will be much better when she wakes up said herries the stuff is out of her throat it's a diphtheritic case what have you done herries in an undertone rapidly gave details of his treatment and the other doctor approved with nods she would have been dead but for you he said emphatically but how did you manage to escape elspeth said herries and would have explained but that kind beckoned them to the far end of the caravan near the door and pointed to a couple of stools let us talk low murmured the ex detective for after all there may be spies about and besides i don't want rachel disturbed fancy telling that to medical men laughed browne softly kind relieved in his mind that rachel's life was safe smiled also and placed two stools and an old chair close together when the doctors were seated he got out glasses and a bottle of whisky and the three had drinks which under the circumstances they very much needed while kind was preparing his hospitality browne glanced round the narrow space of the caravan it was oblong with a high roof and excellently fitted up something after the style of a cabin at sea that is with a due regard to economy of space the arched roof and deal walls were painted yellow from the former dangled various articles of merchandise such as kind sold and the latter were decorated with pictures cut from various papers and pasted on the wood in every available corner at one end was a door divided into two pieces so that the upper or lower half could be opened at will facing this and placed sideways was the bed or rather the bunk in which rachel was sleeping it was comfortable enough and gay with red curtains against one wall was the leaf of a table fastened with iron rods and the other wall supported a cupboard in which food was stored two hooks immediately above the heads of the trio and near the door showed that kind slung a hammock for his own sleeping accommodation the whole place was clean and neat and browne thought that many people were worse housed than these imitation gipsies they followed the example of the tartar tribes and in their wheeled dwelling moved about from place to place at home everywhere and picking up their living in all quarters but said browne thoughtfully sipping his whisky if anyone enters the caravan herries will be discovered we can hide him said kind cunningly where asked the doctor staring round the confined space i don't see any hiding place nor does anyone else or it wouldn't be a hiding place but we can trust you doctor and kind stooped and gave a hard twist to one of the iron rods which supported the side table at once the floor of the vehicle parted in the middle and displayed an oblong shallow space where a man with some discomfort could lie at full length i had that made added the cheap jack after my own design i haven't been in the detective force for nothing and thought that it wouldn't be a bad idea to have a place where i could hide things from thieves all my best goods were stowed there but i shifted them when mr herries came while he was being hunted for far and wide he was lying there as snug as a pig very ingenious said browne while kind closed the hiding place in the same manner in which he had opened it but i don't know how herries did come here elspeth saved me bless her said the young man his blue eyes lighting up when she heard how ill mrs kind was and trent refused to let me see her even under escort she came out and interviewed my friend here he indicated the cheap jack and said that she would bring me then she returned to the inn and went up to my room to she didn't see you interposed browne recalling the policeman's account of elspeth weeping at his feet for admission no that would have given her design away she pretended to weep and knelt down to ask the policeman guarding the door to let her in then she slipped a note under the door and went away without suspicion the note said that the two rustics on guard under the window would be taken away in half an hour that i was to drop from the window and go to the fence there kind would be waiting to guide me to a hiding place i expect elspeth got the two watchers to go into the tap room by promising them drink when the coast was clear i opened the window softly and dropped kind was at the fence and grasping my hand hurried me away in the mist to this place here i first attended to mrs kind and and saved her life said the cheap jack bursting with gratitude he sucked the stuff from her throat doctor then i hid him under the floor having first shifted the goods he came out to see that rachel was getting along all right and i whistled 'garryowen' to let him know i was coming with you how did you know that i was coming browne asked herries elspeth came here to ask me if i would like to see you explained the young man of course i did as i knew that i could trust you then she went back and told kind and oh that was what she whispered to you in the tap room said the doctor glancing at the cheap jack h'm well i suppose you may trust me herries all the same i told trent that if i chanced on you i would persuade you to give yourself up and send a wire telling him that you had done so browne would you betray me no of course i wouldn't snapped the doctor savagely all the same this running away will not do you any good browne said herries much agitated if i had stopped i would have been condemned on the evidence which trent discovered that man will never let me have a fair trial he is dead against me because he can't see further than his nose retorted the doctor he is sorry for you in a way but he seems to have made up his mind that you are guilty and that being the case how can i hope to get free you can prove i can prove nothing interrupted herries despairingly i was in the next room and my uncle was murdered the razor the pocket book and the key of sir simon's bedroom were in my possession and stains of blood were on my shirt sleeve in the face of such evidence how can i prove my innocence i have nothing but my bare word but cannot anyone give evidence in your favour michael gowrie might humph i hear that the old scoundrel was at the 'marsh inn' trent told me i remember him in edinburgh ages ago i wonder if he no said herries emphatically gowrie is an old scamp but he would not commit a crime well i don't know it seems that sir simon brought some money with him in gold and notes gowrie was always a money grubber yes but even he would not have the nerve to cut a man's throat and then incriminate me who had done him no harm a man will do much to get money and to save himself said the doctor sententiously what do you think mr kind the cheap jack who had been in a brown study woke up at the direct question i have never met the man you call gowrie he said after a thoughtful pause but he is as innocent as mr herries here how can you be sure of that because from what i discovered in the death room i am sure that sir simon was murdered by the man who passed out in his fur coat and who masqueraded as him to get away what did you discover asked herries quickly several things the window was open mrs narby might have done that to air the room said herries people don't generally air the room with a dead body within it said kind dryly and certainly a close fisted woman like mrs narby would not risk her furniture being spoilt by the incoming mist no that window was opened by the man who climbed up to murder sir simon and as the dressing table was before it no one looked until i did how do you know that a man climbed up how else did the man who escaped in the fur coat the true assassin enter questioned kind sharply sir simon expected him he might have gone down to the front door of the inn and let him enter after all were in bed no sir simon had his own reasons for keeping the appointment with this man dark and knew also that this man gowrie as i learned from trent slept in the tap room to have admitted his friend in that way would have aroused the suspicions of gowrie and there might have been trouble gowrie might have seen the admission of the stranger and have been bribed to go away suggested the doctor who still held to the belief that his old tutor was implicated in some way no said kind again and i'll tell you why i found a red silk handkerchief pinned across the window of sir simon's bedroom as a sort of signal eh yes from what i have gathered this is what happened sir simon came to the 'marsh inn' from tarhaven to meet someone who was blackmailing him but kind said herries quickly i knew very little of my uncle and did not get on well with him but he was an honest man and not the kind of person to be blackmailed and i who knew sir simon intimately as his doctor added browne can add my protest to that assumption sir simon was a straightforward man if a trifle close fisted he certainly would not lay himself open to blackmail sir simon was a millionaire said kind in his driest manner and those sort of people do not invariably make their money honestly my uncle was perfectly honest insisted herries resolutely i admire you for sticking up for him said kind sarcastically especially as he was so hard on you mr herries all the same if it was not a case of blackmail why didn't sir simon see this man at his own house why should he come to a lonely little inn with a large sum of money why should he be so anxious to see this stranger that having retired he placed a red handkerchief in the window and put a candle behind it by way of a signal answer me these questions it does seem strange muttered browne thoughtfully so strange that there can only be one explanation retorted the cheap jack decisively this man whomsoever he was could not get to the inn at the appointed time which was eight o'clock he came very late before twelve in fact why not after twelve asked herries because as dr browne here will tell you the millionaire was murdered somewhere about midnight i cannot be quite sure put in browne hastily i made only a superficial examination of the body well we'll say midnight as you cannot be very far out of your reckoning i certainly think that either at midnight or shortly afterwards sir simon was killed then that fixes the time the stranger must have arrived before midnight as the pair might have had a talk before the murder no said browne quickly sir simon was i think from the orderly way in which the bedclothes were placed murdered in his sleep good said kind quite unruffled let us say that the man climbed up to the window which was left open by sir simon with the signal of the red handkerchief and killed the millionaire there is no difficulty about climbing said herries thoughtfully for when mrs narby found that the door was locked she insisted that elspeth should climb up the trellis work ah said kind with satisfaction that makes the mode of entry more certain i have not seen the trellis work as i have not visited the inn for more than nine months mrs narby must have had it put up later but the man must have been a light active fellow to climb up so slight a ladder he got in at the window for the table was moved aside as if to let him enter perhaps by sir simon unless he was asleep but why couldn't sir simon go to the downstairs front door i told you said the cheap jack with a gesture of impatience he wanted to keep the man's visit dark and knew that gowrie was in the tap room of course all this is theory but to morrow i'll examine the trellis work and if i find it broken for the lightest and most active man might break parts of it i'll be certain that my theory is absolutely true we'll take it as true said browne well well echoed kind reflectively the stranger enters and finds as you say sir simon asleep he sees the money on the table or perhaps guesses that it is in the pocket book how do you know that i found a table with writing materials near the bed said kind and several sheets of paper had been used as some were torn up sir simon had been making calculations i know that because some of the torn pieces had figures on them sir simon evidently was trying to calculate how much or how little he could give his blackmailing friend the man however saw the gold and at once made for it sir simon woke and would have made an outcry but the stranger seeing him awake does not give him time to cry out but cuts his throat at once how could the stranger see in the dark asked browne sarcastically you forget said kind gravely that the candle was on the dressing table sir simon left it there lighted to shine through the red handkerchief else what was the use of the handkerchief at all yes yes i see that said herries eagerly go on the deed being done the stranger waits in the room until daybreak and then knowing how sir simon was to leave the inn put on the dead man's fur coat and boldly walked out with his plunder why didn't he escape again by the window ah that is one of the things which i wish to find out and what about the incrimination of herries asked the doctor sceptically do you smoke cigarettes asked the cheap jack turning suddenly on herries yes sometimes did you smoke one at the inn no i haven't had a cigarette in my lips for quite three months i hadn't the money to buy them and so took to a pipe why then the man who murdered sir simon entered the room your room to incriminate you after emptying the pocket book he took that and the razor into your room you were sound asleep worn out as i was told by elspeth that's quite true and old gowrie gave me a glass of toddy to make me sleep the sounder oh said kind in a peculiar tone and considered after a time he went on but did not say why he had made the exclamation well then the murderer smeared your shirt sleeve and left the razor on the bed and the pocket book under it then he retired to the death room and waited till dawn when ready to go he locked the door of the room in which the dead man lay and put the key in your room but how do you know that he was in my room at all asked herries somewhat annoyed by all this theory kind asked another question did sir simon smoke no said browne he never smoked in his life in that case kind fished out the stump of a cigarette what do you make of that i found it in your room mr herries the young man took the cigarette which was burnt down half way and examined it carefully then he smelt it periquette tobacco said he thoughtfully comes from france from algiers from tangiers interposed kind taking the cigarette see this cigarette is marked 'tangerian' i have never seen one like that in england it might have come from france or from algiers or tangiers but one thing we can be certain of that the murderer came from foreign parts only a short time ago a man doesn't keep cigarettes for months unless he has a large quantity the murderer may have had a quantity but the chances are that he hadn't in fact kind leaned back with the air of a man who has made up his mind i believe that the man came from a ship and was a sailor else why should he have displayed such activity in climbing up to a window it's all theory said browne shaking his head disconsolately the cigarette isn't no all the same i don't see how you are going to find this man that must be your task doctor mine browne jumped up yes mr herries must stop here for the present later when i have found the man he can give himself up you doctor know miss maud tedder the daughter of the deceased yes then go and see her at tarhaven ask her questions for in sir simon's past life will be found the reason for his murder but if it was blackmail and i am bound to say that it looks like it and if the meeting was kept secret i don't see what miss tedder will know ah i must leave the hunting of the man to your cleverness said kind you have the entry of the house at tarhaven and can prosecute your enquiries without suspicion i can't do that but while you are working at tarhaven i'll search round here and i daresay i'll learn something worth knowing browne nodded i'll do my best he said i'll call and see miss tedder to morrow and question her and tell her said herries in a low voice that the man who loved her is in danger i daresay she'll know that to night from trent said browne calmly do you love her now herries no she treated me very badly just what a girl like that would do she has no heart she is a penny doll full of whims and fancies with a passion for rank and fine clothes humph she'll be able to indulge now as she will undoubtedly have something like fifty thousand a year but perhaps for the sake of auld lang syne he added clapping his friend on the shoulder she may spend some of the money in saving you i'll do that said kind sharply and with a glance in the direction of his still sleeping wife nothing i can do is too much for the man who gave me back my rachel you will stay here of course browne asked herries looking at the floor where the hiding place was concealed yes i am guided by kind who thinks it best meantime i do said the cheap jack later when we are sure of our ground you can give yourself up but to surrender now would be to put a rope round your neck trent is a blundering ass i quite agree with you said browne heartily well good bye herries i must return to the inn and to morrow i'll see miss tedder at tarhaven and gowrie i'll find him said kind quickly he certainly may be able to help and he will too elspeth will make him how do you know elspeth said that she was gowrie's daughter said kind briefly the man is unknown to me but elspeth will find him chapter viii miss maud tedder tarhaven as everyone knows is a town of recent origin as it is within a reasonable distance of the metropolis and the railway fares are not too high trippers come down every bank holiday to the number of thousands likewise owing to the facilities for reaching london many clerks and business men make their abode there and the town thanks to improved locomotion may be called a suburb of the great city and as the streets of tarhaven are wide and the houses comfortable and there is always plenty of amusement the place is invariably full of people there is a floating as well as a resident population of no small number consequently tarhaven is able to rank as a seaside resort along with brighton bournemouth and scarborough on the outskirts of the modern town sir simon tedder had built a palatial mansion or rather he had added largely to the ancient manor house which he had purchased from a decayed family who were lords of the place long before tarhaven sprang into notoriety the town itself grew out of the nucleus of a tiny fishing village below the cliffs and now spread out far into the country pushing back the woods swallowing up the villages and turning old highways into modern streets with smart shops the moated hall sir simon kept to the ancient name because there really was a moat although the same was devoid of water stood on a slight eminence one mile from tarhaven in the middle of a well wooded park and was as shut in from the world as was the palace of the sleeping beauty restored and added to by an artist the place maintained its old world air and resembled one of those delightful houses which appear in the middle pages of country life when dr browne entered the grounds through the scrolled gilt iron gates and proceeded up the ancient avenue between elms and oaks and beech trees and ash trees he emerged into the wide space in the centre of which elevated on its mound rose the antique fabric of warm hued red brick he acknowledged that it was hard on the owner of such magnificence to meet his death in an obscure inn sir simon had sprung from nothing and by his own unaided endeavours had attained to this splendour only as it would seem to finally depart this life in the mire out of which he had crawled and who knows by what questionable means mused browne as he mounted the shallow steps which led to the terrace and strolled leisurely towards the huge iron bound door there may be something in kind's blackmailing idea after all pound added to pound in the orthodox way would not have bought this fairy palace who knows through what dark and miry ways sir simon walked to arrive at such a goal well he pulled the bell if the mystery of his death is to be solved we will have to grope in those same ways a stately footman who looked like a disguised bishop admitted the doctor into a large and lofty hall paved with black and white tiles and surrounded with marble copies of celebrated statues directly before the visitor on entering the door rose the antique staircase wide and with shallow steps splendidly carpeted on the first landing was a huge window of stained glass blazing with crests resplendent to use keats' gorgeous image as the wings of a tiger moth the light filtering through this made a kind of coloured ecclesiastical twilight and accentuated the severe beauty of the architecture but browne did not linger here long as he knew the place well and was more anxious to see the daughter of the house than the house itself the stately footman conducted him to the drawing room a long wide lofty apartment crowded with expensive furniture and here he remained while the man went to tell his mistress that her visitor was waiting as the servant was departing browne stopped him with a word parker he said looking directly at the man i suppose miss tedder knows of this terrible affair meaning sir simon's murder yes sir she does sir and has been taking on awful i doubt if she'll see you sir tell her that it is absolutely necessary that i should see her parker bowed his powdered head in a jovian manner and made his exit while browne walked up and down the magnificent room wondering how he could begin a very difficult conversation he could scarcely put the theory of blackmail as crudely as kind had done and it was not probable that the girl herself would suggest such a motive for the murder maud tedder as browne knew was not a thoughtful young lady and he was quite prepared for a scene he half regretted that he had not asked to see mrs mountford the girl's former governess and present chaperon who was a gloomy self possessed female given to pessimism but always perfect mistress of her emotions however he had no time to consider what should be his first move in this so to speak game of chess for almost at once the door flew open impetuously and maud tedder ran into the room with outstretched hands oh doctor doctor she cried emotionally i am so glad you have come i do want someone to talk to about poor papa's death if you hadn't come i should have sent for you i should indeed but now that you are here she dragged him to a louis quinze sofa all carving and brocade we can talk over everything freely hasn't mrs mountford no mrs mountford hasn't interrupted the girl producing a flimsy lace handkerchief which was more for show than for use she does nothing but groan poor papa dead oh she shuddered isn't it too awful for words inspector trent a horrid stiff thing i think came last night and told me i wondered that papa hadn't come home and i fancied that something might have happened but i never never never she was emphatic never dreamt that anything so terrible as murder had taken place so she ran on not allowing browne to get a word in edgeways he sat looking at her while she chattered and acknowledged that although this feminine butterfly was extremely pretty she was scarcely the girl to gain the love of a serious minded young fellow such as he knew his old school friend to be maud tedder was slight and fair haired and delicate and resembled nothing so much as one of those dresden china shepherdess ornaments which are dear to china maniacs her complexion was pink and white her features insignificant her hair insipidly golden and her eyes pale blue a very pretty doll to come out of a bonbon box but scarcely the daughter for stern faced grasping bullying sir simon tedder who had won his wealth and knighthood by sheer brain strength what is to be done asked browne when she gave him a chance of asking a question oh mr trent said that the inquest would take place to morrow at the 'marsh inn' then poor papa will be buried and the lawyer mr ritson you know will tell me what i am to do with the money as soon as everything is settled i shall go away to switzerland with mrs mountford and stop there for a few months i'm a foolish little thing and never know what to do but it seems that i must act in this way poor papa and she wiped her eyes with the flimsy handkerchief and shivered browne was surprised at the sensible way in which she talked and the cut and dried programme she had sketched out he would not have credited her with such foresight as miss tedder decidedly took after her mother a frail brainless beauty of old descent who had died three year previously but perhaps she had more of her father's brains than he had believed and now that she was in a position to use them had summoned them to her aid the programme was sufficiently reasonable but browne noted that she did not say a word about the accused man and with him she had been supposed to be in love over two years ago before he had taken to the sea at once browne who was nothing if not blunt reminded her of this oversight in his gruff way what about your cousin maud gave a little scream and flung herself back into an angle of the sofa to cover her eyes with the handkerchief angus oh don't talk about that wretch she said sobbing that he should have killed poor papa it's too terrible he did not kill him said browne rather disgusted by the speech she seemed to judge him without evidence but he is said maud sitting up and flushing a violent red i'm sure i wish he wasn't as he really was a nice boy and i liked him very much two years ago inspector trent told me that the razor i know all about that interrupted the doctor quickly the evidence is against herries all the same he is innocent i'm sure i hope so it would be so horrid to have a cousin hanged for murder i don't know that bruce would marry me if that took place bruce who is bruce i thought you had met him said miss tedder opening her pale blue eyes to their widest extent captain bruce kyles who was such a great friend of papa's oh yes browne suddenly remembered that was the fellow who commanded a war ship belonging to one of those tin pot south american republics he is an officer in the indiana navy replied maud much offended so i believe rejoined browne not at all disturbed that shabby little republic down patagonia way they've got about five second and third rate ships i believe and the germans propose to wipe them out or annex them i don't know why you should talk of the indiana republic as 'them' doctor it's an 'it' and the germans won't annex it bruce has come home to get more war ships and papa intended to do business with him did papa intend you should marry him asked browne shrewdly miss tedder drew up her small person to its full height which was not much i don't know why you should be so familiar doctor of course i look on you as a friend as papa did all the same we are not such friends as to warrant you i see i see broke in the medical man impatiently i am less a friend than a doctor yet i thought that your greeting was a warm one and so perhaps have trespassed unduly i beg your pardon sir simon he emphasised the title approved of your marrying this this captain kyles oh yes he saw that i loved him and bruce comes of a very old scotch family quite as good as our own the doctor suppressed a smile bruce has rank in indiana and some day he might become the president of the republic papa intended to announce our engagement shortly but now he is dead and she began to sob again humph you love this man with all my heart although i don't see why you should ask me i beg your pardon once more said browne dryly but i am the most intimate friend of angus herries who is in dire peril and i understood that you loved him miss tedder let fall her handkerchief to accentuate her denial with hard indignant eyes i never never did she said almost shrilly of course i met him in edinburgh and thought he was good looking over two years ago then he was my cousin and clever but papa did not approve and angus was poor so i obeyed your father and threw him over eh it was only a girlish fancy doctor i love bruce and bruce is the man i intend to marry so as to be madame la president i suppose well with your fifty thousand a year i have no doubt that captain kyles will be able to buy your republic right out however this is none of my business i should think not said maud who looked cross but the peril of herries is my business he has escaped but may be captured at any moment what do you intend to do offer one hundred pounds reward browne jumped up for his capture oh maud stuck her fingers in her ears i wish you wouldn't shout when i'm in such grief inspector trent advised me to offer one hundred pounds i wonder he didn't suggest a thousand as no doubt he hopes that the money will go into his pocket but surely you don't want your cousin hanged no of course i don't but if he is guilty he is not i tell you then who killed papa a man with whom sir simon had an appointment at the 'marsh inn' on the night of his death listen and browne detailed all that he had learned suppressing certain facts that bore on the escape of herries seeing that maud believed her cousin guilty and was in close communication with trent it would not do to place the safety of herries in her untrustworthy hands oh i do hope that what you say is true and that angus is not a murderer cried maud clasping her hands would i tell a lie asked the doctor angrily no but then you are such a friend of my cousin's that you might colour the thing a little and you who loved the man who are a relative of the man ought to colour likewise instead of that you offer a reward to hang him terrified by the good doctor's vehemence maud broke down sobbing i am sure i want to do what is right she cried from behind the flimsy handkerchief no one would be better pleased than i to think that angus was guiltless you ought to clear his character and marry him marry him maud's handkerchief dropped in amazement yes he is your cousin and should share in this wealth which is too much for you alone and then he would make you a much better husband than this man kyles who comes from no one knows where and is a rank adventurer if ever i saw one you had better not let bruce hear you say that threatened maud he is in the house now with mrs mountford ah where the carcass is there the vultures gather i would say to him what i say to you with the utmost confidence miss tedder i wish to be your friend and as i am not a marrying man you can see that i have no eye to your money but you are a young girl and have no one to counsel you but mrs mountford who does not always give good advice you should believe in the innocence of your cousin against all evidence and clear his character and and marry him finished miss tedder tapping her small foot no i certainly will not anything i can do to save him from the consequence of his wickedness he is not wicked he is innocent then let him prove his innocence she rose with a dignified air as if to intimate that the interview was terminated but i must do what inspector trent says even though angus is my cousin my papa is rather was my papa and i must offer a reward for the apprehension of the murderer who is herries inspector trent says so and you believe it well browne shrugged his shoulders if this is woman's love give me man's hate did you know that your father had an appointment with anyone two nights ago no papa never said anything about it he went away in the afternoon and said he would return next day i knew nothing of his whereabouts until inspector trent came and told me that angus had killed papa browne shrugged his shoulders again it seemed impossible to impress this butterfly with the fact herries was innocent she seemed a heartless sort of creature he took no further trouble to contradict her but went on with his questions do you know why your father took so large a sum of money with him no i did not know that he had taken any money how much was it i can't say but the landlady's son at the 'marsh inn' saw a considerable sum in gold and notes on the table that has disappeared along with angus sneered maud i think not you make out your cousin to be a thief as well as a murderer he is neither so you know nothing of the reason of your father's visit to the 'marsh inn' i didn't even know that he was going there good day then and browne turned on his heel stop doctor maud ran after him and laid a detaining hand on his arm i don't want you to think badly of me i do hope that angus is not guilty indeed i do if you know where he is how should i know asked browne warily well i thought you might as you were at the inn i went there in response to a telegram calling me i arrived to find that herries had escaped but presuming that he did communicate with me browne put it this way to see what she would say and at the same time to guard herries what do you wish me to tell him that i will give him a sum of money to leave england and so confess that he is guilty thank you for nothing maud clenched her hands and bit her lip i don't mean what you mean she declared angrily if i can prove his innocence i should be glad to do so but i know nothing of my father's affairs or what led to his death mr ritson the lawyer may know ask him and perhaps he will help you to prove my cousin's innocence but things look black against angus inspector trent says so it would be wiser if he went away why do you wish him to go away maud stamped her foot i don't want a cousin of mine to be hanged for the murder of my father she said irritably can't you see how unpleasant that would be for me i am engaged to bruce but he is proud and haughty if angus was hanged bruce might refuse to become my husband not while you have fifty thousand a year said browne grimly you don't know bruce not well as i have only met him once but at the first glance i saw that he was an adventurer he is the very model of those soldiers of fortune who abounded in europe in the middle ages and like them he may carve out a kingdom for himself doubtless since money now a days is more necessary than a sword to procure such a kingdom retorted browne however that is your affair what sum will you give herries always presuming that he will communicate with me one thousand pounds did inspector trent advise that sum he advised nothing because he knows nothing and he says added the girl decisively that when the policeman is found he may be able to prove my cousin's guilt what policeman the constable called armour who looks after desleigh and two other villages in the marshes he has disappeared humph i heard something of that trent was expecting him every minute but he never turned up but i dare say he is on his rounds as his beat is a wide one no doctor the inspector declares that armour has to visit desleigh village at least once a day for two days he has been absent so mr trent thinks that that herries murdered the policeman as well as your father browne laughed what a mare's nest he has found well miss tedder i wish you every joy as the wife of the future president of the indiana republic and he bowed good day this time the girl did not attempt to stop him and browne opened the door himself however she followed him into the hall i really wish to help angus she repeated and i am sure bruce will do his best for my sake what has captain kyles got to do with the matter i have asked him to help me to find out who killed my father that is captain kyles is hunting for poor herries oh i don't mean that but why here is bruce she turned towards the passage that ran beside the stairs and smiled bruce in response a tall dark man with deep set eyes and a reckless bearing advanced into the hall he held out a telegram to miss tedder it has just come from the inspector he said with a stealthy glance at the commonplace looks of dr browne maud ran her eye over the paper and passed it to her visitor that may help either to save or condemn my cousin she said quickly armour the policeman has been found bound hand and foot in a ditch near the river read browne humph what does that mean i take it to mean that armour killed sir simon said kyles in a deep voice and very composedly chapter ix the solicitor browne surveyed the buccaneer with some curiosity he had met him twice or thrice before sir simon joined the majority but beyond a casual glance had not taken much notice of the man now that he learned of maud tedder's engagement he was interested in the adventurer who by his marriage with the heiress would become the possessor of immense wealth also it would seem that kyles had something to do with herries' fate since he could to all appearances influence that young lady in her judgment after an exhaustive glance browne confessed to himself that the scamp he believed him to be a scamp was an extremely good looking man and romantic enough to win the heart of an even less sentimental girl than miss tedder captain kyles met the gaze of dr browne serenely enough and evidently guessed that he was being weighed in the balance of the little doctor's opinion his personality was perplexing as he appeared to be a cross between a sailor and a soldier an amphibious animal of the jolly class his slim figure was very erect and military yet when he walked he had the rolling gait of the quarter deck his face was immobile as though his features had been drilled into a set expression of perfect blankness yet his gestures were free and easy as though he possessed the open mind of a jack tar in looks and bearing he resembled one of those dare devil filibusters who dominated the spanish main in far off days and in his swart complexion not unlike that of a spaniard he proclaimed his highland blood with his graceful figure his sparkling dark eyes well moulded features and drooping black moustache he looked the beau ideal of a bow bells family herald hero that miss tedder loved this handsome fellow dearly could be seen from the way in which her colour came and went and her bosom heaved at the mere sight of him tragic as had been the circumstances of her father's death a father who had adored her she appeared to think more of love than of her irreparable loss the doctor not being a romantic school miss did not approve of captain kyles in spite of his alluring exterior in the smartly dressed suave cool person before him he saw the typical adventurer who would win maud and her thousands a year by sheer cajolery mixed with scarcely concealed bullying and then would probably neglect her when the babyish beauty of her looks was gone at the same time to do him justice he was surprised and pleased to hear captain kyles defend the accused as he was certainly doing in a manner when he accused armour i should have thought remarked the doctor sarcastically that like everyone else you would judge my friend herries as guilty kyles shrugged his square shoulders and brushed some fluff from the breast of his blue serge coat from what inspector trent says it would seem that herries that is the name isn't it is the criminal he drawled and his voice was not the least attractive thing about him but that makes me believe the man to be innocent had herries killed sir simon i fancy he would have arranged things better to secure his own safety perhaps he lost his head suggested maud maliciously criminals do you know even the cleverest dear said kyles so grimly that the adjective was robbed of its value i have told you before and i tell you again that your cousin is innocent oh said browne quietly then you know that herries is miss tedder's cousin i know all the family history replied kyles lazily as i am to marry miss tedder i considered it my duty to learn it it was my place boomed a heavy gloomy voice coming from the back of the hall to inform captain kyles of the tedder history the stout and stately female who approached in this dramatic way was mrs mountford the ci devant governess who had improved maud's young mind and who now acted as her somewhat cheerless companion she was of the fleshly type with a firm jaw and a heavy jowl and a pair of cold grey eyes the face was that of a hanging judge and she would have looked well in a wig and gown seated on the bench before that stony eye and impassive countenance the most hopeful prisoner would have collapsed at once invariably arrayed in deepest black she glittered like a starry midnight with jet beads and jet trimmings with bugles and chains and ornaments she wore jet bracelets to match a jet brooch and jet earrings of the albert period lengthy earrings like the jet chain which was wound like a cable round her fat neck mrs mountford only needed a plume of feathers to resemble a hearse horse and her mere presence darkened the none too cheerful hall dr browne did not like this female mute for in spite of his cynicism he could be cheerful on occasions which mrs mountford in mourning for her neighbours' faults never was how maud tedder light minded frivolous and gay could endure the wet blanket society of this raven was more than the doctor could understand and he prided himself on understanding the feminine character i should have thought that sir simon could best have informed captain kyles of all that there was to be known he said in reply to the gloomy lady that is he added pointedly if sir simon approved of the engagement of course papa approved broke in maud smartly though as i have already said i don't see what business it is of yours did you come here to make yourself disagreeable my child croaked mrs mountford in her bass voice this is not the time or place to say such truths nor the time for dr browne to make remarks about things which do not concern him snapped the younger lady pertly i beg your pardon said the doctor ceremoniously i have no right to interfere i should think not cried the irrepressible maud and was again frowned down by mrs mountford who seemed to be the mistress of all the proprieties i merely came to assure miss tedder that her cousin is innocent finished dr browne and moved towards the front door so i think observed the captain who had taken no part in the war of words and anything i can do you can do nothing cried miss tedder who seemed anxious to place her cousin in the dock if angus is to be hanged he will have to be hanged though it is hard that i should suffer from such a disgrace but papa's murderer must be punished i tell you herries had nothing to do with the murder said dr browne violently and his face becoming suffused with blood i wonder at your persistence in accusing him i go by what inspector trent says and see here remarked the sailor in his lazy drawl i don't like to see a fellow go to the wall if i can help him miss tedder he bowed to maud has consented to be my wife but i do not think that either one of us would care to have a relative hanged for a capital offence besides to my mind the evidence is so clear that i believe herries to be guiltless i shall therefore go along with this gentleman and learn what i can likely to help the poor fellow dr browne he bowed to the medical man and in a somewhat foreign fashion by clicking his heels together i understand also wishes to prove mr herries' innocence i do said the doctor doggedly and wondering why the captain was so anxious to assist and i intend to in that case kyles extended a small and shapely hand we may as well work together browne took the hand indeed he could do nothing else but i should like to know why you are so certain that herries is innocent are you not certain inquired kyles gravely yes but then i know herries well and although appearances are dead against him i hold on remarked the sailor in a somewhat american fashion it is because appearances are dead against him that i assist both in the states out west and in mexico i was nearly lynched for horse stealing the evidence was plumb against me and but that good luck came my way at the eleventh hour i should have been a goner can you wonder then that my sympathies are with herries i see you have a fellow feeling you might put it that way the hall boomed mrs mountford once more is scarcely the place to discuss these matters i entirely agree with you said the doctor with emphasis so i take my leave if you have any influence with miss tedder ma'am i advise you to induce her to be less bloodthirsty me cried maud in a shrill and angry tone like an infuriated mosquito me bloodthirsty none the worse for that said her lover genially we don't stock a cotton wool civilisation in indiana browne laughed he rather liked kyles and his abrupt way of dealing with miss tedder when they were married it was easy seen who would rule the house for all maud's airs and graces and feminine wiles seemed to make very little impression on the rover no doubt so good looking a fellow had been much run after by the fair sex and had learned how to govern women good day captain said the doctor heartily i am glad you can see further than your nose in this case i presume i'll meet you at the inquest to morrow bruce will take me said maud hastily and i chimed in the mistress of the proprieties with the toll of big ben will be there to chaperon miss tedder this being settled browne took his departure and walked down the avenue wondering why maud should be so vindictive towards the man to whom she had once been engaged and that man her very own cousin he could not understand for there seemed to be no reason that she should desire herries' death which she certainly seemed to do browne asked himself whether she dreaded lest herries should insist upon renewing the engagement when maud became possessed of her millions or perhaps as he again thought the engagement had never been broken in that latter case since maud desired to marry kyles she might think to cut the gordian knot of an entanglement by sending her cousin to the scaffold but even in such a case it seemed incredible that she should behave so wickedly browne had always deemed maud to be a butterfly now it seemed that she was a tigress he resolved to lay the case before herries when next he visited the caravan and see what his opinion was of her behaviour the thought of the caravan brought up the image of kind who was sheltering the fugitive and as is often the case scarcely had the name passed through browne's brain when he ran up against the man himself at the gates of the park kind in his odd dress and chewing a blade of grass was seated on a stone with his hands in his pockets and a pondering expression on his shrewd face mornin' he said rising as soon as the doctor emerged from the park beastly weather ain't it did you come here to tell me that asked browne looking up at the leaden coloured sky in a humorous manner no i came to see you about this man armour the policeman who yes interrupted the doctor strolling towards tarhaven beside the cheap jack i know all about that who told you well to be precise i don't know everything but while i was talking to miss tedder a telegram came from trent saying that armour had been found bound in a ditch yes trent's there and is making more mistakes than ever he is still hunting for mr herries ended kind with a grin he hasn't found him i hope asked browne hastily kind turned the blade of grass in his mouth not much chance of that said he contemptuously mr herries' hiding place is too easy found for trent to find it were i in his place added kind wagging his head until the ostrich feather shook in his bowler the first thing i should do would be to search the caravan why asked browne puzzled because it's a likely place if a man bolted and came across a caravan he would ask its owner to hide him but trent doesn't believe that mr herries would be fool enough to hide in so suspicious a place it sounds rum i know doctor but that's human nature you argue something like captain bruce kyles and who may he be he is a captain in the indiana navy and that's a republic in south america i understand that he has come to england to arrange about buying new war ships for the republic so in this way he was brought into contact with sir simon who speculated in other things beside jam and pickles consequently captain kyles who is a romantic looking scoundrel has induced miss tedder to fall in love with him and will undoubtedly become the master of her money and he argued in the same way as i do doctor yes he declares that the evidence is so plain against herries that he believes the man to be guiltless oh kind gave a shrewd glance at his companion and became meditative he argues in that way does he it does him credit no fool i should say but why asked kind wheeling round does he take the trouble to defend mr herries that's what i have been asking myself said the doctor dryly does he know mr herries no he has never set eyes on him queer murmured the cheap jack with his hands in his pockets and his eyes on the ground i must have a look at this captain you will see him at the inquest to morrow along with miss tedder and mrs mountford who is the young lady's companion kind nodded absently being still occupied with the problem of kyles' unsolicited defence of the accused man where are you going now doctor he asked as they neared the town to see mr ritson the solicitor of sir simon i wish to ask him if he has any knowledge of what took sir simon to the inn he won't know rejoined kind shaking his head decisively if sir simon had intended to let mr ritson know he would have made the appointment at his office the 'marsh inn' and his giving no name and carrying a large sum of money and the kidnapping of armour all hint at blackmailing the kidnapping of armour echoed browne stopping short amazed i forgot you only know that armour was found in the ditch said kind a railway porter on the way home this morning found him he was taken to desleigh where he lives and trent was sent for but i know mrs armour who is an old friend of mine and i saw armour before the inspector saw him then trent arrived and sent that telegram to miss tedder and what explanation does armour give he had gone his rounds and arrived at desleigh about one in the morning he rested on the bench outside the tap room door until two o'clock or rather between two and three then he says that some men he could not guess how many suddenly came out of the mist and gagged him and bound him and wrapped his head in a shawl they carried him to a ditch some distance from the railway station and left him there the poor chap was nearly stifled when he was found as all the time his head was tied up in the shawl but why was he kidnapped ah that is what i want to find out kind looked at browne you have given me a clue what is the clue i'll tell you after the inquest said kind turning away then when he was some distance off he called back see mr ritson doctor and come to the caravan after the inquest but you wanted to see me about i have seen you called back kind and have said what i wanted to say about armour browne ran after the man who still walked on we have come to no conclusion he panted for the doctor was plethoric i have said the cheap jack you have given me a clue i tell you and i'll explain when we are together with mr herries and so saying he walked off quickly browne although anxious to question him further had not the breath to follow him and moreover saw that kind would answer no more questions at the moment this being the case he went to seek out mr ritson wondering greatly why armour had been kidnapped and wondering still more what clue kind had obtained from him browne could recall nothing in his conversation likely to afford such a clue mr ritson had an office in the high street of tarhaven a most imposing office next door to a bank there was nothing of the pettifogging lawyer about mr ritson's office as it was all mahogany and brass plates and plate glass windows ritson was well known as the legal adviser of half the county and was supposed to be extremely wealthy he was a tall thin severe old gentleman with silvery white hair and a parchment hued face and a dry manner as a rule he was not given to speaking much but usually waited to hear what his clients had to say that they might commit themselves but when dr browne who knew him very well was admitted into the lofty airy apartment which was mr ritson's sanctum he was surprised by the warmth and volubility with which the usually silent lawyer greeted him i am very glad to see you doctor said he advancing with outstretched hands had you not come i should have sent for you humph said browne the cynic i seem to have become a person of importance miss tedder greeted me in the same way you have seen miss tedder yes i should have thought that you would have seen her also about what asked ritson quickly and returning to his desk about her father's death and the will and the will interrupted ritson vehemently that is exactly what i fear to see her about you fear yes doctor he caught browne's button hole some time ago when we were talking of sir simon's wealth you mentioned that you knew his nephew yes poor herries who is accused of the murder ah ritson wiped his high bald forehead although he was usually a cold blooded man that's the difficulty i must speak speak away said browne more and more surprised in confidence of course in confidence assented the other ritson sat down suddenly and began to fiddle with his papers and browne straddling his legs with his hands behind him watched it was strange that so quiet a lawyer should be so moved certainly the death of sir simon was very terrible and naturally ritson who had known him for years was startled by the tragedy but it seemed to the doctor that there was something more behind the mere fact of the murder something having to do with the dead man's will well he said impatiently while ritson kept shifting pens and sealing wax and paperweights as though he were playing chess yes yes ritson threw himself back and thrust his hands into his trouser pockets i never speak of my clients' affairs to anyone no nodded browne everyone is aware that you are trustworthy then you will be surprised that i am about to betray no that is not the word that i am about to forestall the reading of the will made last week by the late sir simon tedder is it necessary to ease my mind it is what do you mean why should sir simon make such a will said ritson almost to himself i thought that it was strange at the time but now when this nephew has murdered him and herries did not cried browne growing red yes he did said ritson determinedly and to get the money the money browne leaned forward his hands on the desk and stared into the agitated face of the solicitor the money sir simon has disinherited his daughter in favour of angus herries who now has fifty thousand a year chapter x the inquest you must be mistaken stammered the doctor staring as well he might considering the astounding news which he had heard i don't make mistakes either in or out of business replied mr ritson haughtily last week i drew up sir simon's will which was short and to the point in it he disinherited maud tedder and left all his money and property to his nephew angus herries good lord browne collapsed into a chair near the desk he found it difficult to believe that herries the outcast was now herries the millionaire fifty thousand a year gasped the doctor his red hair almost standing on end what will he do with it buy his freedom i expect said ritson grimly what do you mean by that well the lawyer took up a quill pen and began to play with it mr herries is certainly entitled to fifty thousand a year but he has to do something to earn it do what asked browne more and more perplexed ritson bent forward he has to find out who killed sir simon and thereby earn his freedom and the money i am still in the dark will you explain i have told you enough you will have to tell me more said browne determinedly my duty to my dead client see here the little doctor jumped up and slapped his hand down on the desk there was no need for you to have told me anything so it is too late to talk of your duty to your dead client but as you have told me so much you must tell me everything yes ritson nodded his silvery white head you are right i have committed a breach of legal etiquette miss tedder should have been the first to hear the will which has to be read after the funeral at 'the moated hall' but then mr herries who inherits should also be present and he is accused of the crime he has escaped the immediate consequences said browne meaningly do you know where he is good lord how should i know cried browne explosively he was not quite sure as to the truth of ritson's statement and thought that it might be a trap to lure herries from his hiding place you are a friend of mr herries and you went to desleigh as inspector trent told me quite so but i was with inspector trent at the time herries escaped out of the window of his bedroom then you do not know where he is no said the doctor lying manfully ritson looked depressed that is a pity he muttered for unless i can see him i don't know how to put things right explain them to me the lawyer turned on his visitor in the twinkling of an eye you do not know where he is browne was not at all disconcerted having had one moment in which to think of a plausible answer if herries communicates with anyone it will be with me he said quietly as he knows that i am his firm friend and believe in his innocence you do you really do certainly herries did not even know that his uncle was in the inn and certainly could not have known that he was the heir no no ritson rapped his teeth with the feathered end of the quill pen yet the evidence is dead against him i am with you there all the same here browne shamelessly pilfered kyles' ideas the evidence is so clear that i believe my friend to be innocent hum hum hum ritson cleared his throat and settled his old fashioned black satin scarf quite so quite so then you think doctor he leaned forward confidentially that this very clear evidence was got together to implicate mr herries in a crime of which he has no knowledge i am sure of it inspector trent has given his version which is coloured by the belief that herries is guilty let me tell you the other side mr ritson i am all attention said the lawyer placing the tips of his fingers together and looking up at the ceiling browne thereupon detailed all that he had heard and seen at the inn but he did not yet trust ritson so far as to relate how herries had found a refuge in kind's caravan nor did he state that kind himself was an ex detective sworn to assist the accused man out of gratitude ritson listened in profound silence and when the recital was finished he did not commit himself to a statement on the contrary he again began his game of chess with the sealing wax pens and paperweights and asked an irrelevant question and you saw miss tedder yes she believes on trent's authority that her cousin is guilty consequently she is much disturbed suggested the lawyer browne smiled cynically you place too much faith in human nature mr ritson miss tedder seems most anxious to get her cousin hanged hey hey ritson sat bolt upright with his hands on the arms of his chair say that again my good sir browne did say it again and said more he gave a detailed version of the interview of the coming of the telegram announcing the finding of armour in the ditch and of the opinion of captain bruce kyles which was so much at variance with miss tedder's ritson stared hard at the little doctor as he told his tale dramatically and when it was ended he rose and went to look out of the window this is very remarkable said ritson turning from looking at the busy high street to look at dr browne very assented the medical man saying as little as he could and what is your opinion asked ritson returning to his seat i have none save that herries is innocent then you don't think said the lawyer again playing chess that miss tedder in some way has heard of the will which disinherits her and is anxious to have her cousin hanged so that she may get back the money will she get back the money if he is hanged asked browne artfully why yes i pleaded for the girl it seems that maud i have known her from a baby so i can call her by her christian name well then it seems that maud insisted on marrying captain kyles a man of whom sir simon did not approve i don't wonder at that the man is an adventurer so sir simon thought however his looks the scamp is certainly handsome captured the affections of miss maud and she declared that she would marry him sir simon told her that if she did he would disinherit her he carried out his threat by leaving all his money to the nephew whom he treated so badly but i pointed out that maud ought to have enough to live on sir simon disagreed and said that maud should have everything or nothing finally he yielded in a way in what way he left the money to herries for life and afterward to maud meantime she gets one thousand a year i see then you think that maud wishes to see her cousin hanged so that she may inherit the money at once ritson did not reply at once to this question it is difficult to say he observed at length i cannot make up my own mind and that is why i have consulted you why i have violated the confidence of my client it is enough to get me struck off the rolls and very rightly too anything you say is safe with me said browne sympathising with the lawyer's desire to act rightly you see continued ritson still defending himself as the circumstances of the case are so dreadful time is of every value therefore i thought it best to anticipate in confidence of course the reading of the will what do you advise ah i don't know all the circumstances of the case said browne cautiously what for example do you mean by saying that herries would have to buy his freedom with his money well said ritson nursing his chin if he is guilty he is not we will presume for the sake of argument that he is pursued the solicitor well then if mr herries is guilty he will have to use his money to get the best lawyer in england to defend him or else ritson hesitated i am aware that i am suggesting the compounding of a felony he said nervously but mr herries might employ this money to escape that is he might bribe people to hold their tongues until he is beyond pursuit i don't think herries would do that said browne vigorously he knows that he is innocent and will prove his innocence in some way he is not the man to lie idle under such a stigma he is unlucky very unlucky a perfect jonah as he is fond of calling himself well his luck has turned seeing he has inherited the money i don't agree with you mr ritson he has to remain in hiding because he is accused wrongfully of murder and again you told me that he does not get the money until he has found out who killed his miserable uncle quite so but if he does he will at once prove his entire innocence and gain a fortune that is good luck luck which is yet to come why did sir simon make it a proviso that herries should seek for his assassin did he then expect to be murdered yes and for that reason along with the other maud's love for captain kyles he made the will did he tell you whom he expected would kill him no i asked him as the proviso was so strange but he told me as little as possible you gained no clue to a possible assassin i did not is there anything in his past life which made you guess that ritson interrupted there is nothing so far as i know sir simon was perfectly safe and there was no reason to think that his life was threatened by anyone apparently it was however since he made such a will and it is stranger still added the lawyer meditating that he should have made me write a letter setting forth the fact that he had left the money to herries browne jumped up so quickly that he overturned the chair what it is as i told you said ritson composedly when the will was signed and witnessed he asked me to write a letter have you a copy certainly i insisted on keeping a copy although sir simon was none too pleased but i refused to sign my name to a letter unless i had a copy especially added ritson slowly as i did not know to whom the letter was written you should not have written it then snapped browne annoyed at seeing his hopes of clearing herries dashed to the ground ritson touched the bell and when the clerk appeared gave him instructions to bring in the letter book while the boy was absent he turned again to browne you don't know how determined sir simon was he said quietly and moreover when you read the letter you will see that there is no reason why i should not have written it he asked for an envelope and addressed the letter himself my clerk copied it and brought it in sir simon slipped it into an envelope the one he had directed secretly and went away that was several days ago and i have never seen sir simon since i never even heard of him until inspector trent knowing that i was his lawyer called to inform me of his lamented death and to invite me as the late knight's legal adviser to attend the inquest you did not see the address no i caught sight of one word however quite by accident what was the word well hesitated ritson fidgetting it certainly might throw some light on the mystery of his death although i scarcely think so but to betray a client's business relations is the affair is too serious to admit of a tender conscience said browne imperiously herries is in danger of his life and i believe maud tedder knows much more than she chooses to tell seeing what her attitude is i am determined to save herries and prevent her getting the money surely you don't think that maud knows who killed her father and is deliberately sacrificing her cousin i don't know what to think answered browne impatiently we can talk of that later tell me what word you saw tarabacca what does that mean asked browne puzzled i can't tell you but the word i saw was certainly something like that i can't be sure of the spelling but it conveyed something like tobacco to my mind tarabacca repeated the lawyer as his clerk entered with the letter book it was certainly a name like that perhaps the name of a town it sounds like a foreign name it certainly is not the name of any english town retorted ritson opening the book here you are a short letter as you can see the little doctor advanced to the desk and ran his eye over the few blotted lines almost illegible on the tissue paper used for copying dear sir he read aloud this is to inform you that my client sir simon tedder has left all he possesses to his nephew angus herries and that he has formally disinherited his daughter maud tedder of everything save one thousand a year yours obediently j ritson well said ritson when browne closed the book the doctor shook his head i cannot understand he said helplessly nor i what is to be done there is nothing to be done save to wait my advice to you mr ritson is to be silent until the inquest is over when herries hears of his good fortune he may give himself up you advise him to do that asked ritson anxiously i certainly do good day we will meet at the inquest and browne in a state of great perplexity left the office he certainly was perplexed as he had never before had such mystery to deal with browne was a straightforward man and liked everything to be done openly but the underhand dealings connected with this death puzzled him sorely he could not see his way to any solution and went home to pass a restless night again and again did he ask himself whether maud tedder had anything to do with the crime and again and again did he mutter to himself the strange word tarabacca but to neither question did he obtain any answer when he rose next morning to go to desleigh he looked very weary and red eyed but browne was not fated to be present at the inquest for just as he was starting he received a message from a very wealthy patient saying that she was dangerously ill and insisting that he should come to her at once the patient was too rich to lose and moreover was extremely irascible so browne went to her house and as she proved really to be dangerously ill he was forced to remain there for the greater part of the day it was quite three o'clock when he found himself leaving the desleigh station to walk along the straight muddy road which led to the now celebrated village the weather was much better for although the sky was still grey and sunless the mists had vanished browne walking smartly towards his goal cast a musing eye on the dismal flats and wide marshy lands which environed the village he wondered how anyone could live in such a place and wondered still more why sir simon had come to so dreary a locality to meet with his terrible death as he drew near desleigh he met an outcoming throng of human beings of motor cars and bicycles and carts and horses coming towards the station apparently the inquest was over and the reporters and those morbid people attracted towards the inn by curiosity were returning to the railway that they might be taken to their various destinations a close carriage with the arms of sir simon on the panels drove past at full speed and browne had no doubt that maud and her chaperon along with captain kyles were within he felt sorry that the blinds were down as he wanted to see how maud looked and whether her expression was one of triumph he guessed that it was as he felt pretty certain that the verdict of the jury had ticketed angus herries as a criminal of the worst type strange to say he was so sure of what the verdict was that he did not stop any of the hurrying people to ask questions at the entrance to the village he perceived the sloppy meadow wherein stood the gaily coloured caravan of sweetlips kind and he smiled to himself to think of what would be said did anyone know that the accused man was snugly ensconced under the flooring of the vehicle he then recognised how true it was what kind had said regarding the safety of the hiding place no one much less trent suspicious as he was would credit herries with being such a fool as to remain so near the scene of his supposed crime and therein lay the man's safety as browne sent a second stealthy glance in the direction of that refuge for innocence he stumbled against a woman who was coming swiftly along the road with her shawl up to her eyes in her blindness she had run up against him where are you going oh it's you elspeth it was indeed elspeth she had run out of the inn with a shawl over her head and a fringe of this was pressed to her tearful eyes as the doctor spoke she let the shawl drop and he saw that her eyes were red with weeping and that her small white face looked smaller and whiter than ever yes it's me she said nervously glancing at the many men and women who were hurrying past to the station i am going to see rachel who is still ill she is alone this with a meaning glance at the doctor and apparently uttered for the benefit of the public sweetlips is drinking at the inn what is the verdict asked browne eagerly although he knew very well what answer he would get the only one that could be given said elspeth leaning against a barbed wire fence on the side of the road the jury say that mr herries murdered sir simon there is a reward offered by miss tedder yes she offers five hundred pounds oh said browne biting his nether lip he saw in this increase of the reward a fresh proof of maud's vindictive feelings towards her cousin apparently she was determined to leave him no chance of escape and again browne wondered as he had wondered through the long night if maud tedder was cognizant of the assassination of her father inspector trent has been congratulated on the evidence he has collected sobbed elspeth and also he has been blamed for letting mr herries escape i don't wonder at it said browne the wonder is that he should have been congratulated at all i never knew of such a bungling piece of work herries has not been caught yet no neither of them looked toward the caravan as they spoke but many people intend to stop here and search the district there are three detectives one of them knew sweetlips do these detectives believe herries to be guilty oh yes and they each intend to search for mr herries what do they think of kind's opinion he told them that he thought mr herries was guilty said elspeth in a meaning tone browne quite understood her sweetlips was posing as an enemy to herries so as to save his life and kind is also going to try for the reward said elspeth with a glimmering smile on her lips the doctor rubbed his hands and laughed there was a suggestion of comedy in sweetlips kind's attitude notwithstanding that he was playing with the issues of life and death however he had learned all that he wished to learn since he now knew that the verdict had been given adverse to herries that the reward had been increased and that the accused man himself was still safe in his hiding place the stream of people and vehicles grew thinner and it would seem that very shortly the village would again be left to its desolation now that the sensation was at an end elspeth supplied the doctor with more information sir simon's body is to be taken to tarhaven to night she said and he is to be buried in three days miss tedder agrees to give one hundred pounds to mrs narby for the damage done to the inn by the murder having been committed there the doctor smiled inwardly thinking of his interview with ritson and of the small chance maud tedder had of paying six hundred pounds however he did not wish to complicate matters further by explaining the disappointment awaiting the presumed heiress and merely answered the question in the same vein i should think that the crime had increased the popularity of the 'marsh inn' said he with some grimness probably mrs narby has never had such good customers since she took up the trade it's an ill wind that blows no one any good elspeth she has sold out nearly all her liquor the girl informed him and as there was scarcely anything to do she allowed me to come away and visit mrs kind i wish you would come also doctor rachel is still weak i'll come replied browne mechanically as he was keeping his eye on a tri car lagonda make which was slowly surging past them the next minute he swore loudly for although there was ample room the chauffeur insisted on crushing both himself and elspeth against the barbed wire fence with painful results here confound you cried the doctor irritably look out where you are going the occupant the sole one besides the chauffeur was a dark complexioned woman in the prime of life with a haughty face and quite an aristocratic air she was richly and fashionably dressed in some lustreless black material which she wore with infinite grace from her large melting dark eyes and her olive complexion together with the strange fact that she was smoking a cigarette in public browne thought that she was a spaniard a foreigner at least but she appeared to understand english for on hearing his none too gentle language she turned her proud face in his direction and taking the cigarette from between her full red lips flung it fairly in his face then at a word from her a foreign word the car shot forward down the road leaving a vile smell behind in another minute the lagonda was speeding towards the station so rapidly that browne was unable to follow much as he wanted to however he shook his fist and picked up the stump of the cigarette which had fallen at his feet i wish i had caught sight of the number of that beastly machine snapped the irascible little man i'd bring that woman into court and have her fined good lord to think that this this he shook the cigarette stump in elspeth's face should be thrown at me i wish i could hullo he stopped and examined the cigarette earnestly tangerian tangerian as i'm a sinner what do you mean asked elspeth astonished at his expression mean bellowed the doctor seeing that no one was within earshot why i mean that this is a foreign cigarette unknown in england well well kind picked up a similarly marked cigarette stump in herries' bedroom and it was dropped there by the murderer that woman is she is i say stop stop and dr browne brandishing his umbrella ran in a wild manner after the vanishing tri car shouting like a red indian on the warpath chapter xi lovers naturally enough elspeth could not understand the hurried explanation of the doctor and could not guess what an important clue the little man was following up for a moment or two she watched him puffing and panting down the dreary road and then with a sigh she entered the spongy meadow wherein the caravan was standing it looked bright and gay in its coat of yellow paint although a portion of it was covered with tarpaulin to preserve from rain various brooms and brushes and mats and baskets which dangled on all four sides the day was still fine but already the sky was darkening with the coming night and the vehicle looked rather lonely in that wide bleak meadow the horse which usually drew the caravan seemed to know this for it kept as close as possible to its perambulating home as elspeth approached she began to sing garryowen since she was unable to whistle so as to let herries know that a friend was coming also when she climbed the steps she gave the triple knock on the door and waited with a beating heart for a sight of that dearly loved face the door was cautiously opened and she hastened to breathe her own name shortly she was within and the door was again locked herries stepped across the gaping space of his cramped hiding place which was open he usually kept it ready so as to slip in and cover himself with the boards which he could do by touching the spring as speedily as possible one never knew what stranger might come to the caravan either in the way of business or out of curiosity to see the sick woman rachel herself looking much better and with a flush on her formerly pale cheeks was sitting up she received elspeth with a rather knowing laugh and held out a large hand covered gipsy fashion with silver rings i am glad to see you my dear she said in a hearty tone i can talk now as my throat is getting rapidly well thanks to dr herries i am not exactly a doctor said the young man smiling you can call me mr herries the surgeon oh you're a doctor right enough said the proprietress of the caravan with a nod no one could have cured me so quickly as you have done and sweetlips will help you doctor as you have helped me see if he doesn't you'll walk a free man yet what is the verdict elspeth asked herries anxiously but i need not ask he added smiling bitterly wilful murder eh and angus herries the murderer i thought so elspeth nodded and leaned against the wall of the vehicle as her heart was too full to speak mrs kind strove to cheer the poor young fellow who was dreeing so hard a weird come come she cried in a hearty good humoured voice you're no worse off than you were before ah but i think he is said elspeth clasping her thin hands there is now a reward of five hundred pounds offered herries started and flushed and bit his lip by whom miss tedder my cousin by the girl who said that she loved me after that after that he flung himself down on the broken chair and gnawed his fingers she never loved you said elspeth with a tremor in her voice and a high colour in her cheeks how do you know i have seen her a doll a soulless woman a selfish girl she could never love a man as a man ought to be loved do you think that i would have doubted you that i here she became conscious that she was revealing her secret and became violently red mrs kind touched herries' arm i told you so said she in an undertone what do you think now herries sat mute with loosely clasped hands and stared at the shrinking girl elspeth was clinging to the caravan wall utterly confused and although her face was turned away she felt that the eyes of the man she loved were upon her striving as it were to read her very soul and why should he not since that soul was clean and pure and ready to give itself to this man who was under the ban of the law as the knowledge of this came to her she lifted her head proudly and sent a glance in the direction of herries which showed plainly all she thought all she was trying to conceal good god murmured herries under his breath and hid his face in his hands what have i done to deserve love like this in a flash he comprehended the nobility of the girl servant though she was he recalled how she had aided him to escape how she had searched out this place of refuge how her eyes never left his face and how she seemed to hang on his words hitherto he had been blind but now in a hundred ways he knew that this poor shabbily clothed drudge loved him with surpassing strength he raised his eyes to look at her delicate face at her beautifully poised head and into her wonderful eyes pools of liquid light irradiated by purity and by a love half wifely half maternal she was gowrie's daughter according to kind but he could see nothing of gowrie in her in looks and nature and principles she was as far removed from that easy going old sinner as the earth was from the sun all that was of her was beautiful and gracious she needed but love and care and artistic surroundings to blossom out into a lovely serene radiant woman he had been blind not to have seen this before he had never dreamed that she loved him but mrs kind had opened his eyes to a certain extent being woman enough to read elspeth's secret now the single glance from the girl's soulful eyes revealed everything she loved him adored him him the outcast the accused murderer the man on whom fortune had turned a chilly back i never thought of this said herries raising himself with some difficulty for his tumult of thoughts made him weak elspeth no she flung out her hands and her face flamed say nothing i am i am your friend you are the sole woman who has looked at me in such a way said herries hoarsely and regardless of the patient he bent forward across the narrow space of the caravan to catch impulsively at elspeth's cold little hands i never guessed i never dreamed of such joy but now i know i feel that you love me as i love you mrs kind clapped her hands and laughed with glee it's as good as medicine she cried with the ready tears in her eyes i was right i was right i saw i knew oh these men these men how little they understand us women but it's impossible murmured elspeth snatching away her hands you cannot love you you know nothing about me you i know your soul i have seen it in your eyes i know that it seems strange to you it does to me he drew his hand perplexedly across his forehead i never thought that romeo and juliet was true to nature that sudden love that passionate romance seemed impossible incredible i could not believe that true love could be born of a single glance but now i understand and you have taught me to understand it is the love of soul and soul that springs up thus rapidly like jonah's gourd in a night jonah ah yes for years i have compared myself with that unlucky prophet for everything has gone awry with me these many days i looked forward to a miserable future similar to the miserable past this accusation of murder seemed to be the climax of bad luck but now i know that it is but one of those evils out of which comes infinite good you love me there is no more to be said tit tit cried the onlooker from the bed there is heaps to be said doctor tell her how you love her how pretty she is and i am not pretty interrupted elspeth vehemently no one can say that mrs kind you are not pretty assented herries gravely for he guessed that an overstrained compliment would make her think him shallow but you have the beauty of the soul which shines through your face it is that loveliness which has caused me to recognize and return your love maud tedder attracted me by her beauty by her external beauty and so the love i had for her if it could be called love was not lasting but you dear you he exclaimed ardently it is your soul i worship and adore you may be mistaken stammered elspeth it is so sudden no more sudden than is your love for me ah she smiled faintly but i am a woman and impulsive does that mean you may be mistaken no a thousand times no i love you with all my heart and nothing can lessen or do away with that love then you would not have me less fond would you dear if i do not love you as you love me then am i but a mere animal unable to recognise the higher things of life i did not recognise them until you looked at me until the veil fell from my eyes and the warmth of your affection kindled a flame in my heart but my soul has spoken to your soul and if we had met and wooed for years we could get no nearer the one to the other than we are ours will be a marriage made in heaven the ideal heavenly marriage marriage she murmured confused marriage yes although i admit that i am a poor husband for you i have no money i am under the ban of the law my life is full of misfortunes ah dearest heart think how deep must be my love when i asked you to become my wife at this juncture bless me cried mrs kind not following this reasoning i should think it was the other way about a chap as loves a maid shouldn't drag her down to poverty you are wrong you are wrong said elspeth passing swiftly to the side of the bunk and mr herries is right were we both rich and careless of the deeper things of life which poverty alone can teach then we might marry without knowing each other's souls but now when we are in the depths when fate is doing her worst when there is no earthly gain on either side now is the time that we know our love is heavenly and lasting then you love me indeed said herries coming up to her she turned and put out her hands all that was womanly in her came to the surface in this hour when both were at the nadir of their fortunes i love you said elspeth simply and there was no need to say more as her eyes spoke far more eloquently than did her tongue i will be your wife when and where you will herries was not an emotional man but the tears came into his eyes as he bent forward to kiss those virgin lips this sudden love so new so wonderful so heart inspiring was so simple in its genesis that for the moment he could scarcely think that it was actual fact i ask nothing further of fortune now said the young man and his strong voice quavered i have gained the love of an angel ah said mrs kind shifting uneasily on her pillow that's what all men say before marriage but afterwards there will be no afterwards cried herries impetuously the beautiful present will be always with us beautiful present doctor and you being hunted down i am not caught yet said herries gaily for the rest i can afford to wait with elspeth but if you are captured she asked her head resting unresistingly on his breast i shall not be captured said herries forcibly though it may be that i shall give myself up mr herries angus well then angus you would not give yourself up the young man sat down again on the broken chair and drew the slight form of his beloved to his knee dear he said gravely i have thought over matters in my solitude and i see how wrong i have been in not facing the worst this flight of mine almost admits guilt if i am innocent people ask themselves why should i fly because appearances were against you burst out elspeth because you were in the hands of inspector trent who would not give you a fair trial innocent men have been hanged before for crimes which they did not commit and if you give yourself up to these policemen who are misled by false evidence you may be hanged no dear i will not be hanged the god who has given me a pure woman's love in my hour of deep distress will not forsake me in my need your love given unasked marks the turn of my fortunes so low as i have sunk even so high will i rise and you with me and come what may your heart can never prove false to me never never my said mrs kind with a sigh don't he talk lovely sweetlips never pattered in this way to me it's as good as a play and play it is she added raising herself anxiously don't forget that you have to save your life before you can marry we can be married quietly said elspeth it ain't so easy to get tied up retorted mrs kind wisely that doctor now his name's in all the papers by this time and if he wanted a licence or went to put up the banns he'd be nabbed as soon as looked at oh angus elspeth's eyes filled with tears he drew her tighter to his breast leave it to me darling what mrs kind says is perfectly true but there is a way out of the difficulty let me consult browne and sweetlips and oh said elspeth starting dr browne is here i left him running after a motor car what for elspeth explained the episode of the insult and what the little doctor had said about the cigarette stump herries knowing the theory of kind became quite excited as he guessed that if this clue was followed up it might lead to serious developments likely to secure his safety but i don't see what a woman can have to do with the murder he said perplexed leave it to sweetlips said mrs kind seriously he's the chap to find a needle in a haystack yes but a woman of fashion ho snorted rachel rubbing her nose did you ever know a case where there wasn't a woman she glanced merrily at elspeth there's two in this affair three said elspeth quickly you forget miss tedder by offering this reward angus she blushed as she shyly pronounced the name i can see that she wants to hang you well then i will put my wits against hers and save her cousin save your husband that is to be whispered herries fondly elspeth took hold of the lapels of his poor jacket do you really mean it do you really mean it she asked earnestly think of what i am as sweetlips told you the daughter of michael gowrie who was left in pawn by him to be a drudge at the 'marsh inn' you are a lady the lady of my love and the sweetest woman in the wide world well said rachel staring at elspeth while this was being whispered into her ears if she don't look reglar slap up pretty it was true a lovely pink blush was over spreading the pale face of the girl a smile of ecstasy parted her lips to show perfectly white teeth and the whole worn weary body seemed to be suddenly rejuvenated by the power of the loving word it was like the sun on a gloomy day emerging from behind a cloud a promise of that hidden loveliness which would reveal itself when she became the wife of the man she had dared so much to save mrs kind beckoned to the lovers who wooed so boldly in her presence and smiled y' don't know that i'm a gipsy of sorts she said taking herries' hand let me read the lines doctor i've read elspeth's before ain't i ducky lor i read misery and sorrow and folks as wished her harm all of 'em to skip when the man came the man queried angus submitting his palm to the sibyl you're the man i knew it the moment i saw her blushing like a true maid aye here's evil days behind you she traced the lines with a lean brown finger evil folk too and hardship by land and sea see the crosses deary in the early part of life you've had 'em oh my gentleman what a time you've had jonah's luck said herries with a sigh and to comfort him elspeth raised his disengaged hand to her lips aye but luck of that sort is too bad to last hard rain don't last long my pretty ones bad luck to elspeth and bad luck to you my gentleman deary she caught elspeth's hand and examined it turn and turn about with herries' palm why here's the coupling the cross of marriage do you call it a cross asked herries laughingly it's the sign i speak of said mrs kind simply here in your hand and her's on the verge of the criss cross lines and all plain sailing before she dropped their hands and clapped her own dearie both the worst is over you'll win free my gentleman and have money galore and marry the pretty one who held to you in tribulation as she will in wealth good health good luck and good hearts and may the dear lord have you both in his keeping amen to that said herries solemnly but how can you tell that i am to have good fortune two 'no's' make a 'yes' my gentleman your bad fortune and hers make one good one past believing when you marry duvel mrs kind became more gipsy like than ever as she plied the trade peculiar to the gentle romany it's a true dukkeripen brother said she and sank back exhausted with the effort now you must not talk more said herries covering her up as your doctor i should not have allowed you to chatter when your throat is still weak elspeth he turned to the girl when mrs kind was quiet go to the inn and tell sweetlips to come to me along with browne if he is there i want to hear everything up to date and arrange my plans angus she whispered imploringly you will not give yourself up not unless browne and sweetlips advise i place myself in their hands good bye dear good bye elspeth was just receiving his kiss when a thundering knock came rattling at the door the sick woman raised herself much startled and the lovers sprang apart garryowen had not been whistled or sang and the triple signal had not been given this was some stranger perhaps some enemy gathering her wits together elspeth pointed mutely to the still gaping hiding place and herries lay down without a single word in a twinkling she had touched the spring and the flooring hid him from sight the knock came again chapter xii the strange word as soon as the noise of the second knock died away sufficiently to permit speech elspeth raised her voice crossly with a glance round to see that nothing telltale was about all right all right she said in angry tones and opening the door who is there what do you want mrs kind is ill don't disturb her it's only me said pope narby who was standing long and lean and chilly on the steps i've come for you elspeth as mother wants you and she says she'll have the hair out of your head if you don't come up sharply and i want writing paper for myself there's none at home or in the shop so i thought i'd get it here you might have knocked a little more gently said elspeth relieved to see that pope had no suspicions poor mrs kind is so ill you startled me rarely lad said the sick woman taking her cue and why do you want elspeth i can't be left by myself your husband's at home explained pope that he isn't said mrs kind grimly i mean he's at my home drinking and talking about the inquest oh he is cried the sick woman with pretended wrath then just you tell him that i'm all alone and that if he doesn't come back i'll clip him over the head all right come along elspeth oh wait the paper mrs kind pointed to a shelf over her head the box is up there my dearie the best writing paper and dirt cheap elspeth reached down the box and spread out the contents but mrs kind delighted to be in her old element did the bargaining herself not that it was much pleasure as pope was a fool over money and gave her what she asked of course mrs kind was glad enough to despoil the fool of his cash but she would have preferred a hard bargainer however that pleasure was denied her and she handed over the paper and took the money meantime elspeth with her shawl over her head waited impatiently for pope thinking meanwhile of her poor hunted lover who was being stifled under her feet she could have knelt and kissed the flooring above his head come along come along she said impatiently pope shambled ungraciously out of the caravan while she closed the door after them both you won't be in such a hurry to get home when you know the tantrum mother's in he grinned elspeth did not vouchsafe a reply but walked swiftly across the splashy meadow and out on to the muddy road she was determined in her own heart to bear no further insults from mrs narby the woman who was engaged to marry angus herries must not submit again to outrage and the knowledge that she had won this wonderful love made her feel brave she was no longer the ill used drudge but a self contained resolute woman who could fight the whole world for the sake of her man aye fight the universe itself i say babbled pope as he shambled homeward beside her i wish i could get this five hundred pounds elspeth blood money never did anyone good pope yes but this man is guilty no she stopped and pressed her hands against her loudly beating heart that i'll never believe but the verdict of the jury it is a mistaken one and his own cousin who should defend him is the one to offer that iniquitous reward i say pope looked at her curiously through the gathering gloom you do talk first rate at times elspeth i have been to a good school she answered shortly you might help me with my poetry suggested the poet well i will if you'll promise to give up trying to get this reward no i shan't snarled the uncouth creature if i can get that money i'll be able to publish my poetry you don't know how my genius longs to spread its wings i know that your genius as you call it is perfectly capable of hanging an innocent man to get blood money she flamed out everyone has to look after himself returned pope sulkily and if this mr herries is not guilty who is that man who escaped in sir simon's fur coat mother's got the coat and intends to keep it from the police if she can observed pope complacently dr browne just asked to see it before i came to fetch you is dr browne at the inn yes he came in a quarter of an hour ago all puffing and blowing and covered with mud now he's talking to sweetlips kind who wants to earn the reward but he shan't he shan't cried pope clenching his lean hard fist i'll get it i'm going out to morrow with some bread and cheese in my pocket and will not come back until i find the man who killed sir simon then find the man in the fur coat no it's that mr herries and i'll ask armour if he saw him you know armour's ill in bed elspeth inspector trent went to see him before he left for tarhaven armour sticks to his story of being carried away by men they were sailors sailors echoed elspeth stopping short in front of the inn how does armour know that he saw just for one moment before they muffled his head that one had on a pea jacket with brass buttons i heard inspector trent say to sweetlips kind that he expected they were sailors from pierside and that he is going over there to morrow i don't see what sailors have to do with the matter said elspeth half to herself and now standing directly before the door she must have raised her voice unconsciously for mrs narby heard her words and flung open the door with a volley of bad language come in come in yelped the gross landlady 'ow do y' do me fine duchess stravaging abaut win there's work t' do i'll pull th' bloomin' 'air out of yer 'orrid 'ead she made as to do it but elspeth slipped under her extended arm and flew into the tap room stop she said in a commanding voice which drew every eye to her as the infuriated mrs narby flung forward to enjoy her favourite pastime if you lay a finger on me i'll give you in charge to the policeman who is watching the dead body upstairs the landlady was so amazed at the turning of the worm that she fell back against the wall and gasped dr browne who was talking in undertones to kind in a corner looked approvingly at the girl who was thus defying her bully narby turned and stared in surprise as he was handing a pewter of beer to a yokel and every man in the tap room and it was quite full waited with bated breath to see what the redoubtable landlady would do she gasped like a cod fish and opened her mouth to speak twice and thrice only to be quelled by the calm gaze of the girl she had tortured for so long i had your permission went on elspeth oblivious of her startled audience to visit mrs kind who is seriously ill and you did not mention any time for me to return i have been your slave and your drudge long enough and to morrow i intend to leave if you drive me to it i'll leave to night you you slut shouted mrs narby almost too furious to speak stop calling me names mr narby while i remain here i appeal to you for protection she doesn't mean it said the landlord uneasily he did not like this sudden revolt and these outspoken speeches which would damage the none too good reputation of the inn ho don't she screamed mrs narby and darting forward gave elspeth a swinging slap on the cheek an' she means thet too y' hussy git back to yer kennel y' what she would have said what she would have done it is impossible to say as she had quite lost her head but while elspeth sick with pain and shame leaned against the wall sweetlips kind caught the virago's arm and swung her round she scratched his face with a volley of bad language and narby saw that it was time to interfere 'liza 'liza stop he said in a low firm voice lemme go lemme git at thet thet rage choked her elspeth will come this night with me to the caravan said kind and the girl started half with joy half with fear she would have liked to join the vagrant life of the kinds which would be better than the dog's existence she was leading at the inn but then herries was there and kind did not know that now she was engaged to herries no no it's very good of you but she sha'n't go shouted mrs narby only restrained by her husband's strong arm from falling bodily on elspeth she's mine her father lef' her in my charge she daren't go daren't echoed the girl raising her head dauntlessly if that is what you say mrs narby i go now my father left me here to pay off by my work a miserable week's lodging i have slaved for an entire year and now i am free to leave she walked to the door stop her stop her cried the landlady thinking and very rightly that never again would she get so obedient and willing a slave no one dare stop me said elspeth turning at the door i leave your service at this moment where are you going on this wet night asked narby gruffly that is my business and when next you get a servant i advise you to stop your wife from ill treating her as she has ill treated me that's hactionable cried the landlady savagely make it so and take me into court my evidence would do you no good mrs narby the virago saw that she had gone too far and that the sympathies of the room were with the frail girl who thus faced her so boldly she fell back on whimpering and arter wot i've done fur 'er whoy 'er mother couldn't 'ave she got no further with a disdainful look elspeth pushed open the door and went out into the rain which was now falling fast mrs narby would have followed but her husband held her back you've done quite enough mischief with your tongue and fist he said in her ear get into the kitchen or else i'll choke the life out of you you she demon mrs narby stared at him and then went off into a fit of crying and kicking and grovelling on the floor narby lost no time in arguing the point but picked up the struggling squealing woman and half carried half dragged her into the back parts of the inn and all this time pope stared open mouthed as much at the daring of elspeth as at the downfall of his hitherto redoubtable mother and his feelings were shared by the company in the tap room who had long looked on mrs narby as a model virago who ought to be brought to her bearings i'd best see after that girl said sweetlips in a low voice to the doctor she can't be left to wander about these marshes all night what can you do for her questioned browne following the cheap jack to the door she can come with me in the caravan to colchester i'm starting for that place to morrow what will you give up hush don't speak so loud of course i'm still on the job but i want to place a certain person in safety before moving further in the matter i think it would be best for him to give himself up and stand his trial said browne quickly especially as he has inherited this huge fortune he hasn't got it yet replied sweetlips grimly nor will he until he clears his character and hangs the assassin of his uncle come along they were hurrying up the village street through the drizzling rain in the direction of the caravan we'll lose that girl she'll go straight to your wife i daresay she no there she is kind pointed to a slim girlish figure which was gliding slowly before them i say elspeth elspeth the figure stopped and when the two came up she paused under a villainously bad oil lamp which cast but a feeble gleam so dusky was the atmosphere with the rain and swiftly coming night i knew you would come she panted not having yet got over her encounter with mrs narby and so i went towards the caravan but ain't y' going there my girl questioned kind startled no i can't stop in the caravan thank you all the same sweetlips you forget that mr herries is there what difference does that make my missus can play society elspeth drooped her head under the shawl i am engaged to mr herries what shouted browne catching her by the arm speak lower urged kind glancing uneasily around you never know who may be eavesdropping but it's impossible said the little doctor sinking his voice you have only known him for a day or so all the same he loves me and i love him don't be foolish girl how can he brown was careful not to mention herries' name how can he support you when he hasn't got a penny it's sheer madness you forget the fortune whispered sweetlips in the doctor's ear you forget your own words he has to earn that yet then allow elspeth to help him to earn it she's a sharp girl and already has done him a service let the engagement stand until the chap gets out of this hobble then you can talk all right grumbled the doctor but it's ridiculous meantime elspeth feeling that it was impossible to explain her changed circumstances to the pair had turned on her heel and was walking in the opposite direction where are you going asked kind gaining on her rapidly with his long stride to armour the policeman's she answered in a fatigued tone his wife is my good friend and will take me in hum murmured the cheap jack perhaps that will be best for the present at all events and i want to see armour myself come along doctor there's work to be done browne followed at once as he also was anxious to see the kidnapped policeman and learn from his own lips exactly what had taken place but he was not pleased at this fresh entanglement of herries since as he thought the girl would only hamper a man already in difficulties however he guessed that what elspeth had said was true enough and that she really was engaged it is creditable to the doctor's understanding that he comprehended how this change in the girl's circumstances had enabled her to face the marsh inn bully extraordinary creatures women thought this philosopher shortly elspeth came to a small red brick cottage standing some little distance from the village street and within a tidy garden well cultivated a light burned in the left hand window which showed that armour and his wife were still sitting up certainly it was yet early but browne had thought that the policeman would have been in bed however the whispered information of elspeth conveyed to his ear that the light shone through the sitting room window who is there asked mrs armour opening the door an inch or so i am here said elspeth in a soft voice i have had a quarrel with mrs narby and she has turned me out of the inn or rather i have given up my situation can you put me up for the night surely surely oh my poor girl said the comely woman taking the shivering bedraggled girl by the arm and who's with ye elspeth dr browne from tarhaven and sweetlips kind they came to see me safely here good night doctor good night sweetlips no no said the cheap jack i'm coming in to see armour what about asked the wife sharply i'll tell him when i get in mrs armour hesitated if it's a doctor you have with you she said at length opening the door wide enough for the trio to enter perhaps he'll give my man some medicine certainly answered browne briskly and she led the three into a small sitting room crowded with old fashioned furniture on the horse hair sofa lay armour in plain clothes a heavy sullen looking man whose head was bound up what's up now he asked with the groan of a rebellious titan elspeth from the 'marsh inn' has come to stop here the night explained his wife and a doctor's here to see you i feel very bad grumbled the policeman my head's aching where them there villains gave me a clump let me see it said the doctor and having moved the lamp he began to undo the bandages with deft fingers come elspeth me and you'll go to the kitchen you'll be wanting your supper poor lass i'm glad ye've come here augh that woman at the inn i'm fair glad you've left her good night sweetlips said elspeth again and in an utterly worn out tone you'll see me to morrow yes come along to the caravan and speak with my missus she's a rare one for managing is my rachel mrs armour bore off the weary girl and when the pair were out of the room kind turned his attention to the policeman who had stopped his groans browne had bound up his head and he confessed that the wound felt easier my missus is a good soul said armour but her fingers is all thumbs drat her he looked as though he expected his visitors to take their leave but when browne sat down and sweetlips followed suit the policeman half rose from the sofa in astonishment you'll be wanting to see me gentlemen yes said kind making a sign to the doctor to hold his tongue i want to ask you about this kidnapping what for asked armour suspiciously this gentleman kind indicated the doctor is a friend of mr herries who is accused falsely of having killed his uncle sir simon he has asked me to see into the matter but what can a cheap jack do i was not always a cheap jack armour formerly i was in the london detective force were ye now armour's face relaxed then maybe ye could put me on to earning this bit of money by telling me where the man we want is hanging out i'd rather earn it for myself said sweetlips coolly but if you'll tell me all about this kidnapping i may be able to make it worth your while but i don't see what this has to do with that ah you can't see far that's a fact rejoined the cheap jack scathingly but it's this way your kidnapping has to do with the murder the man who killed sir simon climbed in at the window somewhere about midnight i wasn't there then said armour swiftly i know that or you would have seen him getting in but he had not left by the time you came and when you sat down on the bench you prevented his escape but kind broke in the doctor the assassin departed through the tap room next morning disguised as his victim that's true enough but the men who kidnapped armour may not have known that probably they were set to keep the coast clear and when armour blocked the way of escape they rushed him aye that they did said armour forgetting all caution in his desire to tell his woes i was sitting there with a pipe quiet like and they came up i can't say how many with a dash one thumped me in the head and threw a shawl over me and have you the shawl asked kind here it be armour fished under the sofa and drew forth a yellow shawl striped glaringly with scarlet while kind examined this he went on with his story they carried i away where i nivir knowed being half insensible like when i come to my senses quite i was lying in a muddy ditch with the shawl still over my head and bound hand and foot like a parcel of goods hours and hours passed and then the porter come and got me free and i ask you cried the policeman if there was anything in that as showed i hadn't done my dooty no said browne to whom the policeman appealed for kind was turning over every inch of the shawl you were the victim of circumstances see here you needn't say that you have told us anything as i want to assist my friend secretly hold your tongue and i'll give you twenty pounds well sir armour scratched his head seems to me as i may be chucked the force if my superior officer inspector trent don't cool down so be it as you'll ask me nothing which will be against my dooty kind rose threw down the shawl and interrupted his eyes sparkled and browne was sure that he had made a discovery we ask you nothing more he said putting on his hat but whether you leave the force or not you'll get the money and more you will be doing a kind thing in helping dr browne to clear his friend's character but my superior officer ses as this herries is guilty your superior officer is several kinds of ass that he be assented armour vigorously he swore as i'd not kept my eyes open and i ask you what more could a man do as was rushed by sailors you are sure they were sailors well one of 'em wore a pea jacket with brass buttons as i've seen sailors wear were they foreigners asked browne quickly they might ha' bin but i nivir had no time to see their faces and they nivir did talk to me nohow that's all good night said sweetlips walking to the door and you'll bear in mind the twenty pounds said armour letting them out into the tidy garden yes yes come some day to tarhaven any one will tell you where dr james browne lives i'll give you the money only hold your confounded tongue nivir fear nivir fear said armour and shut the door with a chuckle they left quite a different man behind to the grumbling suspicious creature they had found nursing his wounds on the horse hair sofa well asked browne when he and kind were well on their way to the caravan what have you found do you remember that name 'tarabacca' which the lawyer spied on the envelope directed by sir simon in the office yes what of that it's on the shawl on the shawl yes that's a foreign shawl and a woman's shawl comes from italy or egypt or tangiers maybe kind you don't think aye but i do we're bringing home the crime to that lady in the motor car who insulted you that insult will cost her dear she smoked the same kind of cigarette as i found in mr herries' bedroom and this shawl evidently belongs to her and the name is the same as that on the envelope addressed secretly by sir simon tedder we're getting on doctor that woman must be found but you don't think that she killed sir simon why not i said that a light nimble person could have climbed the trellis why not this lady however we'll have a talk to mr herries and tell him all we have found out he may know if his uncle was acquainted with this dark lady but herries did not know they approached the caravan whistling garryowen and gave the signal herries was seated by mrs kind's bed and was more than glad to see his friend browne related what he had discovered and then kind followed with the story of the policeman's kidnapping when he mentioned the name on the shawl the doctor harked back and explained the episode in ritson's office which he had forgotten to tell in detail then it was that the accused man started tarabacca he cried much excited why that's the name of the steam yacht lying alongside my boat at pierside chapter xiii a mexican beauty early next morning sweetlips kind was talking to dr browne in the consulting room of the latter at his tarhaven house on tracing the connection of the mysterious word tarabacca with the shawl which had to do with armour's kidnapping and which consequently was of a piece with the tragic incident of the marsh inn crime the cheap jack had postponed his departure eager as he was to leave the dangerous neighbourhood of desleigh where one and all were on the alert to capture herries he thought it well to see what sort of crew manned the yacht referred to by the accused man beyond the fact that the oddity of the name had struck him herries knew nothing when the arctic sealer nansen came to pierside the yacht was already berthed by the wharf and herries had left his ship so immediately owing to the persecution of the captain that he had made no enquiries as to the nationality of the strange vessel nor had he remained on board the nansen would he have so enquired since the tarabacca did not interest him in the slightest now however that the yacht's name was on the shawl and a letter had apparently been addressed to someone on board by the dead man the subject became one of vital importance dr browne very hopeful as to the future had returned to tarhaven by a late train from london that fortunately stopped for a few moments at desleigh railway station and had taken leave of kind with the understanding that the cheap jack was to proceed next day to pierside for the purpose of making enquiries about the tarabacca the doctor was therefore surprised when sweetlips arrived somewhere about nine o'clock in the morning to continue the conversation broken off on the previous night he appeared to be in a hurry and lost no time in explaining it's a rum word is 'tarabacca' remarked kind when the maid had left the two alone in the severe looking apartment browne nodded it sounds like an indian word said he judiciously why not an indiana word suggested the cheap jack might belong to south america agreed the doctor there's a sort of peruvian ring about it why kind asked an irrelevant question do you remember how i said that you had given me a clue when we met outside the gates of the 'moated hall' park yes i could not understand i can recall nothing likely to hold on a bit doctor i'm going to explain now that kyles cove who is engaged to miss tedder well kyles explained sweetlips with his keen eyes on the medical man is an adventurer and is after miss tedder's money i should say he certainly doesn't seem to be crazy about her no that sort of chap's only crazy about one person himself i know and you know from mr ritson that sir simon didn't approve of the engagement yes yes yes go on when you talked of kyles defending mr herries continued kind thinking out his case i thought it strange that he should go out of his way to help a chap on whom as you told me doctor he had never set eyes i guessed that there must be some reason for that a reason connected with the murder surely you don't think that kyles has anything to do with the crime don't i just that's what i'm driving at he's a sea captain and the coves as kidnapped armour are sailors pooh pooh armour wasn't sure on that point he saw that one was brass bound retorted sweetlips and merchant officers usually go about in their swagger togs to get the women after them i'm certain that the brass bound cove was officering a relief party of sailors if my guess is right that connects kyles with them i don't quite see oh it's all theory of course but we've got to grope in the dark before we fetch the light doctor kyles is a sailor and those men who captured armour are sailors very good then the case stands something in this way sir simon's only daughter and heiress is engaged against the will of her father to kyles and sir simon is unexpectedly murdered beforehand evidently expecting to be killed he wrote a secret letter to someone on board a boat called the 'tarabacca' disinheriting his daughter tarabacca is as you think an indian word suppose we learn that it is an indiana word we've connected kyles who is in the service of the republic closer with the matter the marked shawl and the secret letter form the connecting links don't you see humph assented browne somewhat struck by this lucid reasoning of course it's all theory however he crossed to the book case the matter of the name is easily settled i have an atlas here i doubt if you'll spot it doctor however we can but try and the doctor did try turning over the pages until he came to the map of south america he searched the portion coloured yellow to the far south of the continent which represented the tiny republic of indiana but no name could be found even distantly resembling the one they were in search of hold on said browne as sweetlips shook his head with a disappointed air i'll turn up the index often names that are not set down on the map are catalogued there he ran his finger down the page ta tag tap tar here you are kind tarabacca map lat long e again he reverted to the map yes it's certainly in indiana for here is the republic in the latitude referred to tarabacca isn't set down here but as it's in the same latitude you may depend that it's a town or a lake or a mountain in the indiana republic and the yacht's been named after it which shows that kyles is connected with the crime hold on that woman i saw in the motor car may have done the deed it was a woman's shawl remember that was used to stifle armour she smoked too and being light could have climbed the trellis so that yes yes but there's usually a woman in every case and where a woman is a man is certain to be found captain kyles on the authority of the word the shawl and the cigarette knows this woman and this yacht therefore he must have something to do with the crime as she has i believe they are accomplices why not see captain kyles since he is in tarhaven what and have him deny everything not me doctor i'm not sufficiently sure of my facts sir i'll go to pierside on a selling excursion and spy round that yacht if i can get speech with the woman of the lagonda tri car i'll shove the shawl under her eyes the shawl i got it from armour but he had no right to part with it i daresay rejoined kind dryly but he fancies that trent will fire him out of the force and expecting money from you on behalf of herries he is willing to do anything to save his own position well said browne rising and glancing at his watch it's a chance that something may come of the matter if you want me send along and i'll come if i can no you make some excuse and call at the 'moated hall' so as to keep an eye on kyles and miss tedder i don't like spying you'll have to if you wish to save mr herries remember those two the girl and the captain will do a lot to stop herries from inheriting the money he doesn't inherit until he learns who killed his uncle ah well he'll have to do that to save his own skin so he has a double motive so long doctor keep your eye peeled with this somewhat colonial farewell the cheap jack took his leave and made for the railway station fortune favoured him for he caught a train to pierside within ten minutes and boarded an empty compartment so that he could think out the complicated case at his leisure kind's heart beat the quicker as he remembered that he was once more on the warpath man hunting he almost regretted on experiencing the old thrill that he had given up thief catching in deference to the prejudices of rachel but on reflection he came to the conclusion that it was better to wander a free man in the country breathing fresh air than to be tied to an official post in town following criminals through the miry ways of crime besides in his unofficial exploitation of the present case which was about as difficult a mystery to unravel as he had ever chanced upon he had a perfectly free hand he therefore felt in very good spirits and hummed a coon melody as he turned over in his pack a few feminine articles which he thought might open the purse of the woman he wished to see for apart from the case kind was naturally anxious to make a trifle of money if only to pay his expenses pierside is a busy shipping port thronged with sailors of all nationalities the streets of the town are narrow but there is ample space by the waterside where the great docks are crowded with shipping kind shouldered his pack and strolled easily down to the river banks at the dock gates he was stopped by an official and forbidden to smoke also his pack was examined to see that he had no contraband goods about him this should have been done when he came out and not when he went in and sweetlips was rather disgusted at the zeal of the customs official in charge however the inspection was a mere matter of form and was made by the jack in office just to show his authority so sweetlips was speedily on his way to the wharf where he was told the tarabacca was lying very quickly he found her and stood for a few moments looking at the smart vessel which was berthed immediately longside she was a rakish dissipated looking craft gaily painted blue and white and flew an ensign which he had never seen before it was a red wheel on white ground and probably was the totem of the indiana republic the yacht herself was three hundred tons lloyd's measurement schooner rigged fore and aft with twin screws kind was a landsman but guessed that this graceful piratical looking craft could slip along at a surprising speed when she wanted to show a pair of clean heels there was more of the blockade runner than the cargo boat about her nor did the crew inspire kind with confidence as they were as dark and villainous a set of ruffians as ever shipped along with captain kidd most of them were mixed spanish indian blood and wore silver earrings and picturesque garbs with the inevitable sheath knife belted at the back but here and there the cheap jack saw fair haired englishman and also he espied a red haired scotchman who was certainly the engineer since he came along with an oil can in his hand finally kind caught sight of a small motor launch and wondered if it had been used to take a portion of this pirate crew down the river to within kidnapping distance of the marsh inn however he did not take long to conclude his examination and began a swift patter as he displayed his goods the pirates crowded to the taffrail and grinned as his saucy words poured out they apparently did not understand what he was saying but the gay tints of his goods attracted them and he was invited in dumb show on board here he shortly arrived and spread out his pack keeping an eye meanwhile on everything that was going on the crew examined beads and gaudy scarfs and cheap jewellery and suchlike things while kind made his observations there didn't seem to be much chance of getting information from these men seeing that they were ignorant of english and in desperation kind hit on an expedient to force his way into the state room in order to get speech with the lady of the motor car always provided she was on board to learn her whereabouts he addressed an english sailor who was lounging on the bridge overhead hi cried kind giving his hat a cock is there a lady on this here ship what do you want with her growled the man removing his pipe i've got goods to sell she don't want rubbish like that mate rubbish be blessed cried the cheap jack resolved to make a row and draw the lady from her shell now that he knew she was on board rather than lose his chance you come down and i'll show you if this is rubbish the sailor leaned over the iron railing of the bridge and jeered you go to kingdom come said he not using those precise words give me any of yer lip and i'll chuck you into the water before he ended kind active as a cat was swarming up the steps and the astonished sailor found himself shortly grappling with an exceedingly active opponent it was a rash thing to do as kind did not know the strength of his antagonist and moreover ran a chance of being imprisoned for starting trouble all the same he ran the risk and swung and swayed with the now enraged mariner while the swarthy crew hooted and yelled and stole all the articles they could find in the pack as kind guessed the noise brought out a man in authority and also the tall dark lady who had insulted browne what's all this inquired the officer looking up at the struggling men kind heard the voice and saw the lady with an effort he flung his antagonist on the deck and leaped like a kangaroo from the bridge down on to the lower deck the fall was a dangerous one but kind managed to alight like a cat on his feet and almost beside the lady scrambling up he began to explain i came along to see this lady he said taking off his hat and gasping for breath and my civil inquiry only met with sauce i was teaching that pirate there some manners here get on you swab shouted the officer advancing sweetlips whose eyes were on all sides saw that the sailors were stealing his property and bounded for his pack he arrived just in time to knock over a man who was seizing the red and yellow shawl which was his passport to an interview with the lady with this in his hand he ran back dodging the enraged half caste he had bowled over miss ma'am he gasped flourishing the shawl in the eyes of the lady i want to see you i've come from desleigh i've the lady interrupted to rattle off a speech to the officer in spanish whereupon that gentleman knocked down the half caste who had drawn his knife and was making for kind come here with me said the lady in english and swept into the cabin followed by the cheap jack who did not at all like the looks of his adversary he had secured his purpose but at the risk of being knifed when he came ashore now then said the lady in excellent english have you a message for me no ma'am but i found some of your property and came to return my property what do you mean kind twisted the gaudy shawl in his hands and pointed out the name on the border it's the name of your boat ma'am said he with pretended humility so i thought that it belonged to you the woman did not reply at once but fixed a pair of dark imperious eyes on him as though she would read what was behind his speech but the cheap jack was not going to be hypnotised by anyone and let his eyes wander round a spacious and luxuriously furnished cabin this unknown lady was evidently rich for there were evidences of wealth on all sides the walls of grained wood were panelled with pictures between the port holes the doors of the various berths were draped voluminously with rich eastern stuffs the floor was covered with a carpet of royal colours and the furniture was upholstered in gaily tinted silks the whole was a blaze of colour as vividly hued as a rainbow nor was the lady in her royal beauty unworthy of the place she was tall slim stately and bore herself in an imperial manner her skin was of a deep olive and her eyes were dark large and liquid what with her beautifully shaped hands and feet her haughty face and refined features kind accustomed to sum up people guessed that she was a lady of rank although of what position he could not guess but as his eyes returned to her lovely face and he saw the piercing gaze of her eyes and how she tried to dominate him he saw that it would be necessary to be on his guard again he avoided her intense gaze and glanced ostentatiously at the opposite wall against which stood a small ebony table fretted with gold on this rested several photographs in silver frames with a start kind recognised the most prominent one as that of captain kyles the lady saw his start and her eyes followed his why do you start she asked sharply i saw that gentleman at the inquest at desleigh he answered feeling his way for he could not quite understand the situation and you saw me there also she asked quickly yes madame i mean yes ma'am i am neither french nor english my name is donna maria guzman you can address me as seora why have you come here to restore this replied kind displaying the shawl where did you find it the cheap jack thought that it was necessary to lie if armour had been abducted by her sailors it was not likely that she would admit such a breach of the law i picked it up on the road to desleigh station said he glibly ah yes she replied with an air of relief i fancy it must have dropped from my motor car when i was at the inquest so she was lying also kind hesitated about speaking further as he did not quite know what to say he wished to ask her why she had come to the inquest and why she had permitted her sailors to abduct armour she saved him the trouble of asking the questions by answering at least one of them i went to desleigh she said and kind thought that the speech was somewhat unnecessary to see if the murderer of sir simon tedder would be found why ma'am i mean seora sir simon was doing business with me in connection with the republic of indiana through she glanced at the portrait through captain kyles ventured sweetlips bluntly what do you know of him she questioned with some asperity i saw him at the inquest he was there by my request this death of sir simon has thrown all my business into confusion you seem to be a sharp fellow and i am obliged to you for returning the shawl it belongs to the ship and was marked to prevent its being lost these shawls are of indian manufacture and are somewhat expensive my maid marked it again kind wondered why she should make unnecessary explanations to him seeing that she thought he was merely a hawker and could not possibly guess that he was employed in detective business she saw something of his wonderment in his face i daresay you are surprised at my telling you all this she said quickly well ma'am i don't see why you should tell me your private business as i am only a poor cove as gets his living hard seora guzman sat down and resting her cheek on her hand looked at him thoughtfully you seem to be a sharp fellow she said again and as you have come here rather opportunely i wish to make use of you yes ma'am i mean seora i'll pay you well she continued on condition that you hold your tongue i don't talk much ma'am that's good well then this death of sir simon's has thrown all my business into confusion i said that before i am the daughter of the president of the republic of indiana and i have come on this boat to buy ships as it is probable we may engage in war captain kyles commands this boat and was dealing with sir simon i believe that sir simon was murdered by an emissary of a political party at variance with my father the president and ' then this chap herries is innocent said kind with well affected simplicity of course he is i went to see if the inquest would clear his character it did not i am sorry for the young man and i wish to save him if possible do you know where he is no seora he has vanished i thought you might have seen him she muttered with her eyes on the carpet and a look of perplexity on her face i am placed in a very difficult position i'm only a poor cove ma'am and can't help you yes you can find out where mr herries is and bring him to me i will save him then you know who killed sir simon ma'am no i wish i did she rose and stretched her arms over her head but that seems to be a mystery still i can guess this much that someone from indiana killed him it's a political murder so as to stop sir simon from supplying ships to indiana but sir simon was a jam manufacturer he dealt in other things also whenever he saw that he could make money he did business if he had lived she stopped and clenched her hand the position is very difficult kind thought so also she was frank enough with him much franker than she need have been especially as she had no guarantee that he would not blab all she had said to others but her speech about sir simon's dealings with the republic supplied him with a motive for the assassination perhaps after all it was a political murder for the emissary of the republic who had dropped the cigarette in herries' room might also smoke that especial brand but why should herries have been deliberately implicated in the affair he might find out if he served this lady's ends since she also was bent upon saving herries and hanging the real culprit if the murderer was a political adversary she would certainly be doing a good service to her father what do you wish me to do seora he asked search for the real murderer and bring mr herries to me that is if you can find his whereabouts i want to get at the truth of this matter so as to explain to my father who will certainly blame me for what has taken place but why should you think that i am able to help you asked the cheap jack with open suspicion donna maria laughed oh i am accustomed to judge men she said in a light tone and your ruse to get speech with me was very clever kind was taken aback do you think that i my friend i am perfectly certain that you quarrelled with those sailors to bring me on deck she responded and that being the case i see that you are a man of resource serve me and i pay you well and she added bending towards him with a fierce look i do not fear your talking if i employ you i employ others also and if you talk a knife thrust will soon silence you this is england and not lawless indiana retorted kind all the same you have had your warning replied seora guzman in a careless tone here she took out a gold net purse and produced from it a couple of sovereigns this is for bringing back the shawl i will pay you well if you will keep your eyes open and find this missing man i can do nothing until he tells me what really took place on that night kind felt inclined to explain that herries was perfectly ignorant of what had taken place but he did not wish to let this very vehement lady know his real position and therefore accepted her gratuity with thanks but before withdrawing he wished to learn one thing was donna maria in love with kyles he believed she was from the glances she threw occasionally at the photograph if she did love the buccaneer did she know that he was engaged to miss maud tedder if she did not here would be a chance of putting as the saying is a spoke in captain kyles' wheel sweetlips did not doubt but what captain kyles had something to do with the crime although to be sure his doubts were founded upon uncertain evidence he put the matter to an immediate test will i report to captain kyles seora he asked with simplicity no certainly not why should you report to captain kyles she asked quickly and with sudden suspicion well ma'am since he is in command of this he is the captain but the political business of indiana is in my hands said she haughtily you know what you have to do go and do it but if you talk she looked so significantly at him that kind although not over imaginative shivered it was ill work dealing with this tiger cat at first sight it seemed as though she had trusted a man unknown to her very rashly but now that he saw she was prepared to stick at nothing to secure any necessary silence he became aware that there was method in her rashness all the same he had not yet learned if she loved kyles and ventured again to feel his way well seora i daresay the captain will be glad enough not to be bothered with me while he's better employed what do you mean asked donna maria abruptly and her eyes narrowed like those of a cat there was a cove at desleigh went on kind watching her face a chap as is a doctor and a friend of mr herries at that dr browne he is and i did hear him say that the dead man's daughter is engaged to marry the lady flew across the room and grasped kind's arm fiercely not to to she could not proceed to captain kyles ma'am it's a lie she muttered and her face went white while her lips tightened and her eyes flashed fire do you mean to say that anyone anyone she clasped her throat as though she were choking that anyone dares to to report this this engagement dr browne says miss tedder is to marry the captain seora donna maria's hands clenched themselves and she spoke more to herself than to her companion that would account for for but no he would not be such a villain besides there's manco capac's treasure and he loves me i am certain he loves me the treasure will tempt him and here she became aware that kind was listening eagerly and stopped abruptly to ask a question will miss tedder be rich she demanded calming herself with difficulty yes replied kind promptly and lying advisedly she inherits fifty thousand a year from her father seora guzman passed a lace handkerchief across her mouth it's a great deal of money she is pretty too a doll though not like she glanced in the near mirror at her splendid face and drew herself up proudly oh she flung the handkerchief across the room it's impossible quite impossible here she turned on him energetically you are one who wanders about the country i saw you at the inquest and was told that you so wandered that is why i have been so frank you may chance on mr herries bring him to me but why why if i find you trustworthy i will explain now go kind went and was glad to go for his head was whirling chapter xiv an unexpected arrival sweetlips kind returned to desleigh with his head whirling he could not quite understand seora guzman and herries when the conversation was reported to him likewise expressed his inability to comprehend the two men talked the matter over earnestly and tried to arrive at some conclusion but the whole matter was so enigmatical that they could decide upon no course finally they concluded that notwithstanding the danger of the neighbourhood to herries it would be best to wait for a few days and see what action donna maria intended to take there's nothing like waiting said sweetlips if this spanish lady or rather this mexican as i believe she's a creole if she has anything to do with the murder it is on account of captain kyles and should she think him false to her which he certainly is she will make trouble do you believe that she sent the sailors to kidnap armour asked herries who was sorely puzzled and could see no light of course she did since she lied about the shawl but they may have been sent to kidnap a political person who was menacing sir simon and made a mistake in collaring the policeman but his uniform pooh the night was dark and foggy mr herries and armour wore a great coat which did not look very official besides these greasers foreigners remember wouldn't know a policeman from a civilian let alone the fact that they may have thought the political person might have disguised himself to get at his prey why do you say 'his prey' because i am inclined to believe that the murder is a political one after all sir simon evidently was mixing himself up with the politics of the indiana republic to make money over the sale of ships the man he expected was an emissary of the republic who got in at the window how would he know the particular window you forget the signal of the red handkerchief mr herries with a candle behind it that would show very plainly well then this political person got into the bedroom and killed sir simon afterwards he went out in the morning disguised as his victim why did he wait until daylight and run such a risk because he would have run a bigger risk by leaving immediately he had killed his man the sailors from the 'tarabacca' were outside and if he had fallen into their hands he might have been killed himself seora guzman is not a woman to stick at a trifle armour whom they thought was their man was not killed quite so but probably they learned their mistake and so left the wrong man in the ditch then perhaps they returned to watch the inn hoping that the real man might come out he evidently saw them waiting and so remained until he could escape in the morning herries fingered his chin all very feasible said he wearily but why should i have been implicated ah we'll never learn that until we chance upon the assassin and how will we find him ah kind shook his head you have me there seora guzman knows are you sure demanded herries sitting up as sure as anyone can be with so puzzling a woman seora guzman must certainly know the members of the political party opposed to her father one or more of those members may have come to england to thwart her mission of buying battle ships and so may have tampered with sir simon such a person this lady may know and that was why she attended the inquest then why will she not accuse the right man and save me she will do so i really believe if you will go to her herries shivered no he said quickly i can't trust her she might give me up to the police well she might and she might not i don't pretend to understand but the best thing to do will be to wait developments here kyles is still at 'moated hall' with miss tedder yes and they know the truth about the will by this time hum murmured kind caressing his chin i expect so if the funeral has taken place sir simon was to be buried to day i fancy will you make sure and learn what has taken place get browne to see ritson kind nodded i'll go to tarhaven to morrow then elspeth is at armour's and can remain there for a time as soon as we know what seora guzman intends to do we can go to colchester in this here caravan and you'll be safe trent can hunt about as he likes he'll never think of looking here for you ah said herries glancing towards the bed where mrs kind was placidly sleeping that reminds me elspeth brought me a local tarhaven newspaper he produced it from his pocket see he indicated an advertisement read that kind did so it was a paragraph offering a reward of fifty pounds for the discovery of michael gowrie and a full description of his somewhat noticeable personality was given if found he was to be brought to the tarhaven police station ha said kind laying the paper aside trent is not such a fool as i expected he knows that gowrie who slept in the tap room may be able to give evidence as to what took place on that night why if he slept in the tap room and the crime took place up the stairs you know how well built the walls of the inn are any row overhead would not be overheard by a sleeping man that is if mr gowrie was sleeping said kind dryly that old cove's a blackguard and knows more than we think didn't you miss some money from your pockets yes but gowrie took it of course he did he knew that you had money and that you would be sound asleep worn out with your tramp he therefore when he fancied you were in deep slumber must have gone up the stairs and turned out your pockets if he did so he might have overheard a noise or voices in sir simon's room i know enough of gowrie to be sure that he would listen what he overheard may have warned him to make himself scarce at any rate trent is well advised to search for him i never knew that trent had so much sense here the conversation ended for the time being herries remained in his hiding place and kind strolled round the neighbourhood selling goods and keeping his eyes open armour contrary to his expectation was not dismissed and elspeth stopped with him and his wife paying visits ostensibly to mrs kind but really to herries at the caravan the lovers grew fonder of one another every day and elspeth urged herries to leave the neighbourhood lest he should be captured but this he would not do as he wanted to find out how maud tedder took the news that she had been disinherited and also he desired to learn what difference her disinheriting would make to kyles' affections if he was after the money solely he would probably break the engagement and return to seora guzman and the tarabacca if however he really loved the girl he would undoubtedly try and get herries hanged in order that she should get the fortune but kind could learn nothing as after the funeral and the reading of the will ritson had gone to paris for a few days and miss tedder went up to london together with mrs mountford and the captain without doubt they had gone to see if the will would hold water as the saying is and were taking counsel's opinion on the matter at least that was sweetlips' surmise the marsh inn had settled down to its old ways mrs narby procured a slip of a girl in place of elspeth and treated her just as badly once or twice she met with her former slave in the village and scowled viciously but she neither spoke to her nor made any assault which elspeth quite expected her to do seeing what a virago the landlady was perhaps the fact that elspeth boarded at armour's had to do with mrs narby's meekness for the woman and her husband were highly suspicious characters and were suspected by more than one person of smuggling goods at the back of the inn was a waterway known as the red creek from the colour of the mud on its shores and here it was reported boats used to come up from the river laden with contraband goods armour had often watched but as yet had not been able to implicate mr and mrs narby in wrongdoing all the same the couple kept quiet and did not cross the policeman's path lest ill should come of their doing so it was certain therefore that mrs narby's avoidance of elspeth lay in the fact that she was under armour's roof and she was very glad of the refuge meanwhile seora guzman made no move either to see sweetlips or to seek out the political assassin perhaps she was waiting until such time as kind would produce herries and then when the accused man was in her presence she might have made up her mind to speak out several times the two men discussed the advisability of trusting the mexican lady but elspeth always insisted that her lover should remain where he was until her father should be found the girl had got it into her head that mr gowrie would be able to produce evidence likely to save herries from the scaffold and was certain that her father would appear before long but although she had written twice or thrice to the address he had given her in london the old man never replied and never appeared it would really seem as kind sometimes thought that the old scamp was himself the guilty party and had murdered sir simon for the sake of the money the papers had been full of the crime but now that sir simon was safely buried and no trace could be found of his assassin as herries was believed to be the interest in the case died away to a great extent it was revived somewhat by the advertisements about michael gowrie for trent not finding the local papers of sufficiently wide circulation had placed notices of the reward in the london journals every paper in the metropolis seemed to contain an inquiry for michael gowrie so that herries began to think that it was not so much trent who was seeking for the man as maud tedder guided by the advice of captain kyles these two wanted the money and by the will if herries died the girl would inherit it was therefore probable that thinking gowrie would be able to substantiate the guilt of herries miss tedder had offered a reward likely to bring the old man on the scene but as the days went by and no gowrie appeared it seemed as though the truth would never be made manifest by reason of the absence of the chief witness and herries was growing very weary of his confinement one evening a couple of weeks after the burial of sir simon tedder when the weather was still damp and dreary kind suggested for the hundredth time the advisability as he put it of herries facing the music in other words he really thought that the young man should give himself up mrs kind had now quite recovered and had gone to the marsh inn to do some sewing for mrs narby the accused man was seated in the gap of the hiding place ready to lie down and be covered up as soon as any suspicious knock came to the door kind himself smoking a short clay pipe guarded the door and elspeth in cloak and hat sat on the bed the girl looked ever so much better in spite of her anxiety as the improved food she was enjoying at mrs armour's and her freedom from being struck and knocked about enabled her to put on flesh she was really becoming rarely beautiful and no doubt the love which she had gained was helping her to become more of a woman and less of a drudge she looked very different to the pale faced miserable creature whom herries had helped on that memorable evening when he had first set foot in that unlucky hotel the case stands this way said kind after a pause and using his little finger as a stopper we can't do anything as matters are now i have seen ritson and he says so sweetlips surely you have not told the lawyer that angus is here not such a fool my dear but ritson returned from paris to day and i saw him by chance in the street we went to his office and i asked him on dr browne's behalf as mr herries' friend mind you how matters stood well asked herries anxiously well echoed the cheap jack he said that miss tedder was mad to find that she had been disinherited and was still in london with mrs mountford and the captain seeing if the will could be upset has she any money demanded elspeth oh yes her father left her one thousand a year to get along on and she is using that to ruin me said herries bitterly you can't blame her retorted kind quickly one thousand a year is a drop from fifty thousand however she and her lover and mrs mountford are in london so that disposes of them for the present ritson is holding the property until such time as herries turns up to claim it i can't claim it until i learn who killed my uncle quite so and you can learn that from seora guzman is she still at pierside of course i sneaked along there the other day and learned that the 'tarabacca' was still alongside the wharf i didn't go down to the docks as i thought that greaser i knocked down might knife me oh she's there right enough and keeps on board most of the time i wonder she doesn't go to london to see captain kyles i wonder also seeing that she believes as is really the case that kyles is engaged to miss tedder but perhaps she's got something up her sleeve what can it be mused elspeth well said kind after a pause i really think she is waiting until i bring herries to her you see she went on without heeding the exclamation of the girl she wants to have a yarn with herries to see how she stands in what way asked herries puzzled well drawled kind again filling his pipe if seora guzman knew that you get the money if the real assassin of sir simon is discovered she would make it her business to tell who he is because in that way she would keep miss tedder out of the money and kyles whom she loves from marrying miss tedder so if you'll take my advice mr herries you'll slip along to pierside to morrow and see this lady it's to her interest not to split on you it sounds like it i confess no no said elspeth getting off the bed and looking very anxious it would be wrong to tempt providence in that way better wait until my father appears he must have heard something when he was sleeping in the tap room and perhaps he'll know the truth seora guzman knows the truth also and she is at hand while your father isn't retorted the cheap jack are you sure she knows the truth certain replied kind positively she hinted to me that the murder was a political one and if that is the case which mind you i am inclined to believe she will probably know the assassin her father occupies a difficult position as president of that republic hold on said herries quickly i found out something about the indiana republic from some of those old newspapers which your wife gave me have you read them no since giving up thief catching i have given up reading the newspapers which don't interest me rachel doesn't read them either but we buy up old newspapers to tie up the goods in and sell them also as waste paper well well then mrs kind gave me a few dozen of those old papers to wile away the time i found some of a few months ago nine or ten months to be exact which gave an account of a revolution in indiana president guzman was deposed and fled with his daughter and captain kyles whom it seems commanded the navy humph said kind in that case the yarn of buying these war ships is all rubbish no i don't see that the president and his daughter may procured money and have come to get ships under the advice of captain kyles so as to replace the president over the republic might be the yacht certainly looked like money but from what you say i should think that kyles will marry miss tedder it's better to get fifty thousand a year in england than marry the daughter of a deposed ruler if guzman were still the president i should say his daughter would get the captain but as matters stand i think kyles is making for the tedder cash and he'll marry the girl he won't get the money however said elspeth quickly he will unless mr herries joins forces with seora guzman and learns the truth it's all politics and she alone can put us on the track of the real assassin see her mr herries and at once no no wait till my father comes cried elspeth at that moment by one of those odd coincidences which often occur in life a trembling knock came to the door in a moment herries was lying full length and elspeth had replaced the boards while she put a chair over the hiding place and sat down shaking with nervous fear kind spoke gruffly through the door who's there demanded the cheap jack eh laddie lat me come ben whimpered a voice quaveringly my father cried elspeth jumping up kind opened the door exultingly enter mr gowrie said he jubilantly you're just in time chapter xv a friend in need elspeth sprang forward to welcome her father as she had confessed once or twice to herries she had no great love for him since he had not treated her as he should have done all the same he was her father and the sole relation she had in the world so when she beheld him stagger into the caravan looking more or less a wreck all the woman's heart of her went out to the old reprobate on his side also gowrie seemed glad to meet his deserted child and patted her hand as he sank into the chair vacated by kind neither the cheap jack nor the girl thought of telling the new corner that herries was stretched at full length under his gouty feet as they feared lest the greed of money should lead mr gowrie into betraying the young man herries likewise recognising the voice and hearing kind's boisterous welcome knew that the long sought for witness was seated overhead but he also declined to trust himself to so slippery a gentleman he therefore lay still and stiff listening to the conversation anxious only to hear if his former tutor could throw light on the subject of the murder weel weel muttered gowrie while his daughter and kind stared at him in silence it's a braw welcome ye've given the auld mon mae ain flesh an' bluid's kinder nor the warld i'm theenking aye aye and there'll be whusky aboot maybe sweetlips seeing that the old creature was more or less exhausted poured him out a glass of glenlivet and while gowrie smacked his lips over the unaccustomed luxury for that it was since he appeared to be as poor as the proverbial church mouse elspeth stared at the parent she was ordered to love honour and obey he did not seem to be the sort of father to whom the text applied his hand shook as he sipped the strong drink and his white head quivered as though he had the palsy the fringe of silvery hair round his bald head gave him a patriarchal appearance and his beard was one aaron might have envied so long and venerable had it grown his clothes were still dirty and disreputable and his face was still inflamed with drink on the whole the rev michael gowrie looked like a man with whom the world had gone badly and elspeth shuddered when she reflected that this wreck had the right to call her his daughter however she was sorry for him so old and weak did he look and tended to him silently will you have some food nae nae my lassie it's the gude barley bree that's needed a bite an hoor or twa later wud dae me nae hairm i'm theenking but we'll dae wi' the whusky at preesent aye aye this is a hoose o' refuge elspeth ye mauna turn yer puir auld faither oot into the confleect o' the elements ice snaw an' rain all praisin' providence forebye it's but rain ye ken where do you come from asked kind impatiently as he had no patience with these maunderings ye may weel ask that i've been walking up an' doon the arth like satan in holy writ but wi' less success i'm theenking nae siller in ma pocket and a price as ye may say on the heid o' me you know that you are wanted then said elspeth with eagerness aye but no for daeing wrang dear losh me he chuckled being revived by the drink there's fame for ye me being asked for in a' the papers o' the three kingdoms how is it you never turned up before asked kind weel said gowrie winking one eye and holding out his glass to be replenished i wisnae very sure it wud be wise tae gang tae those in authority the reward wudnae gang into ma pockets i lay low in great babylon the which ye ken is london and got ma bite an sup fra the few shullings i got from mr herries' pockets finished elspeth father you acted shamefully robbing angus angus is it snapped the old man ignoring the accusation and for why dae ye ma ain child ca' him angus that's my business retorted the girl flushing gowrie watched her cunningly aye aye young life and young luve ma dearie weel and shall nae a wumon depart fra her faither and be one wi' her husband an' i never said that cried the girl angrily hoots lassie i'm nae blind foreby yon limmer at the inn tauld me ye'd taken a gait o' yer own an' me cried gowrie raising his voice in indignation coming tae the inn for a bite and a sup wi' nae siller tae pay believing my ain child wud wark off the bill she's had enough of that said kind roughly she was quite right to leave she is stopping with armour the policeman and goes with me when we leave this place and wi' herries we don't know where he is said kind smartly seeing that elspeth hesitated to tell the white fib an' hoo then can ye luve him demanded gowrie cunningly i loved him when he slept at the inn returned the girl he helped with the bucket the first person who was ever kind to me eh romeo and juliet o' wully shakespeare chuckled gowrie the bard wisnae sae far wrang in his gab o' luve at first sight wull yon lad marry ye elspeth dae ye theenk what makes you think that we are engaged she asked evasively my lassie said the old man chuckling i ken the waiys o' wumon none better in the patmos in the weelderness where i wis hiding i read the papers and saw aboot yon escape thinks i elspeth hes mair to do wi' this nor meets the eye didnae i see the blink of yer een when herries wis chatting in the tap room he couldnae ha' escaped by himsel nae nae where there's a mon there a wumon sae i joost pit twa and twa togither aye he's yer mon lassie elspeth glanced at kind and he at her the old man had guessed all that had taken place by shrewd observation and they dreaded lest this preternatural cunning for so it seemed should lead him to guess that herries was quaking under his feet but his next observation reassured them in some measure i'm ganging tae save the lad said gowrie finishing his glass what cried his daughter and herries suppressed a gasp with difficulty the remark was like a gleam of light in a clouded heaven aye pursued gowrie leisurely ye taunt me yer ain faither wi' taking a few bit shullings fra the laddie's pocket it wis the best thing that happened tae him that same for by daeing what i did i can save the lad and who's he my ain pupil to grudge his auld tutor a bit of siller kind glanced nervously at the floor he knew that herries was overhearing every word the old reprobate uttered and dreaded lest he should reveal himself prematurely but herries held his peace until he learned more of mr gowrie's intentions he did not trust him an inch until he could see how the old man proposed to benefit by saving him elspeth knowing her father of old had similar thoughts in her brain and spoke her mind pretty freely what the reprobate had guessed she confessed thinking that if he knew herries was her lover he would be more inclined to save him sweetlips remained silent as he was anxious to let gowrie talk so as to learn exactly what he had up his sleeve father said the girl laying her hands on gowrie's shoulders can you really save angus yes said the reverend gentleman in his best english if he will be guided by me and what do you expect to get out of this ma ain child said the patriarch relapsing into scotch dae ye nae theenk but what a mon micht dae good wi'out conseedering himsel' you wouldn't rejoined elspeth curtly gowrie wiped a tear from his inflamed eye with a ragged handkerchief and raised his face to heaven ma ain child said he in a pathetic tone aye it's a lear i am nae less look here father said elspeth placing her hands on her hips and speaking almost as sourly as mrs narby whose favourite attitude this was it's no use your talking like this you took me from that excellent school where my godfather was educating me and turned me into mrs narby's drudge just that you might have a place to go to in the 'marsh inn' without paying i was a child when you last saw me and did what i was told but love the love of a good man has changed me into a woman i have become engaged to angus and i helped him to escape he's far away from here and in a place where you won't find him i have seen him several times since he got away from the inn and we are engaged to be married it warrums ma hairt tae hear ye say so lassie mumbled gowrie in a thankful voice aye aye ye'll be able tae gie yer auld faither a warrum seat by the hearth we haven't got a hearth said elspeth bluntly aye but ye'll hae a braw ane i doot not said gowrie cunningly and watched the effect of his remark out of the corner of his wicked old eye it was kind who replied as he was beginning to have an inkling of why mr gowrie had put in so opportune an appearance i don't know if you guessed that elspeth had a hand in mr herries' escape said he looking steadily at his visitor but you came down here to see if you could force her to become engaged to mr herries there's nae force required chuckled gowrie you didn't know that god has brought these two unlucky people together i verily believe so that they may be happy in the long run you guessed at least i can't think how you could know in any way you guessed that elspeth saved mr herries from immediate arrest and probably as you say you saw when herries came to the inn that elspeth liked him luved him luved him dinna use weak worrds well then loved him you thought to come here and see if elspeth would marry him and i went to the inn cried gowrie speaking english and in a most indignant manner mrs narby promised to give me house room always so long as elspeth worked for her and i found that elspeth had insulted that most excellent lady and i was turned out of my patmos my refuge in the wilderness mrs narby sent me here to your house on wheels saying she was here well then i am here what do you want dae ye ken i'm yer faither demanded gowrie wrathfully only too well she replied bitterly had you not been my father i should never have slaved for mrs narby but i agree with sweetlips you came here with some scheme in your head what is it i know said sweetlips interposing contemptuously he intended to get you to find herries and ask him to marry you out of gratitude i should never have done that cried the girl flushing there is no need to as things have turned out retorted kind bluntly but your father here wants you to marry mr herries aye aye mumbled gowrie i'm gey auld and ma child weeckedly as she talks to her puir auld faither must nae be left wi'oot a protector when i'm in ma lang hame the which is the grave you have no idea of going to your long home for years said kind coolly you lay low and did not come forward to save mr herries until you saw that it would be to your advantage as how asked gowrie politely but his face grew red you saw in the newspapers that herries inherited his uncle's money on condeetions mind ye chuckled gowrie so that is why you have come asked elspeth angrily gowrie rose to his full height which was tall enough nearly to touch the roof of the caravan and thrust one hand into the breast of his ragged frock coat in quite a napoleonic attitude that he said in his grand mellow voice and now quite restored to his native impudence by the whisky that is my reason whether i guessed that you had assisted herries to escape or not matters little i may have guessed from your betraying eyes at the inn that you had fallen in love with him at once or i may not let that pass but i am a good father and it went to my heart to think that one of my blood should slave at a poor inn when she should be occupying a lady's position seeing that she i allude to you elspeth is a lady born and bred i therefore said when i saw that herries was likely to become a millionaire i said to myself that it would be as well to be his father in law and i charge you elspeth as you are my daughter to marry this man and keep your father in comfort in his old age 'honour thy father and thy mother' says the book of books and do not this episode of the devil quoting scripture to gain his own ends was cut short by a choking laugh which came from under mr gowrie's feet the old man jumped up as though a bomb was about to explode and elspeth began to explain it's the dog she said in a hurried tone it's the no no cried herries' voice from below and gowrie whose nerves were weak with drink jumped again let me out i'll trust him whaur the deil have ye pit the mon inquired gowrie affrightedly kind shrugged his shoulders and lifted the flooring after he had swept gowrie to one side he did not think it was wise of herries to reveal himself to so untrustworthy a personage but the mischief had been done and shortly herries red in the face from suppressed laughter sat up in the gap wiping the tears from his eyes i couldn't help it he gasped looking from elspeth to kind and from kind to his old tutor to hear that fraud talk about the bible was too much for me ma ain laddie cried gowrie not at all taken aback and recovering the colour of his shiny skin which had vanished in his recent alarm here's one who will help you i know that one is here who won't betray me said herries rising and taking a seat guard the door kind elspeth don't look so alarmed it's to your father's advantage to hold his tongue i should not have revealed myself else eh said gowrie lifting his eyes to heaven ma ain pupil taks me for a judas you're quite right said herries dryly you'd sell me within the hour if you thought you'd make money but i am of more value to you alive than dead or the rope would be round my neck if my father did that gasped elspeth clenching her fists pooh pooh interrupted kind seeing from the brightness of herries' eye and the resolution of his look that he was quite master of the situation let the guv'nor speak the governor queried herries smiling yes i see you've made up your mind to act so there's no chance of my guiding you any further and i'm glad of it guv'nor added the cheap jack heartily you have plenty of resolution and only need to exercise it now then we're tiled in all right so fire ahead and find out what this old i'm the rev michael gowrie saving your presence said that gentleman in an aggrieved tone you are whatever pays you best retorted kind here have some more whisky and answer the guv'nor's questions straight or i'll wring that blessed old neck of yours elspeth i agree with sweetlips father said the girl with resolution if you don't act straightly i'll accuse you myself of having murdered sir simon even though you are my own father i gasped gowrie turning pale all but his nose which everlastingly gleamed a bright crimson i murder it looks like it put in herries who had been watching the old trickster you've run your head into the noose mr gowrie i'm i'm innocent damn ye very good then explain what took place on that night i'll no dae that until i see ye marrit tae my dochter she deil as she has been tae her auld faither but how can i marry her in my present position eh ye can leave yon tae me angus i'll ca ye angus seence ye're tae be bane o' ma bane and flesh o' ma flesh as it micht be when i can ca' my dochter mistress herries and have the promise of the pair o' ye tae gie me enough tae leeve like gentry i'll save the life o' ye aye that i wull and tell us who killed sir simon nae said gowrie with real regret i canna dae that for i dinna ken wha committed the weecked deed that's a lie cried kind it's the truth sir said gowrie in his best english for all i know herries here may have killed the man you said that you could save me i did and i can said gowrie rather disconcerted but only if you marry elspeth i don't require your command to marry her said herries taking the girl in his arms i love your daughter with all my heart and soul as a good true woman i'll marry whenever i am free ye'll mairry before that said gowrie sharply can't you trust me asked herries angrily i trust nae one he judges all by himself said kind well then tell us how the marriage can take place you know that mr herries is being searched for and if he gets the banns put up or procures a special license he will be arrested i know that snapped gowrie with a leer and i want him to be arrested what cried elspeth placing herself before her father with a look of dismay would you betray him no no said herries beginning to see the drift of the old man's plot mr gowrie wants to earn the five hundred pounds reward from my cousin aye i do that and save you from being hanged also i don't understand said elspeth in bewilderment i do said kind quickly for he also saw what was meant i'll take mr herries to some less dangerous neighbourhood where he will not be arrested so immediately say to some midland town where the news of the murder will scarcely have penetrated mr herries' name will not be so known there and then i'll get a special license and you can marry him elspeth that's it that's it cried gowrie exultingly meanwhile i go to miss tedder and say that the marriage will take place on a certain day in a certain town she'll tell the police and you angus will be arrested i'll thus get the reward which we'll employ to hunt down the true assassin and place you in command of the fifty thousand a year he smacked his lips but angus may be hanged cried elspeth terrified and clinging to her lover lassie said gowrie solemnly not a hair of the head of him will be hurt i can exonerate him entirely but how i don't see neither do i said herries looking hard at gowrie all the same i'll trust my future father in law as i am quite sure that he has more use for fifty thousand a year than for five hundred all told the reprobate rubbed his dirty hands together and chuckled i'll hae some mair o' the glenlivet said he gaily aye ye neednae stint pouring oot the gude drink this is a joyful occasion i've gotten mae dochter a gude doonsettin' and wull save a desarving laddie fra the rope o' doom deil tak' them as wove the same will you trust him asked kind aside to herries while gowrie sipped his whisky joyously yes answered herries in the same tone he's a clever old sinner and has some scheme in his head whereby to save me the money i'll inherit will make it worth his while gowrie he said raising his voice if you pull me through i'll settle one thousand a year on you honour bright i'll dae it i'll dae it the old gentleman smacked his leg losh me there's a power of drink in a thoosand a year lave it tae me laddie and i'll be a faither tae ye bless ye mae bairns hoo happy ye mak me auld hairt oh take him away cried herries disgusted with the man no no said kind imperatively when he goes it will be with elspeth if he's alone he may get drinking and let out that you are here nae when a thoosand a year's tae be got said gowrie joyously and in his glee began to sing a scotch ballad in a cracked voice 'the day may daw the cock may craw but aye we'll taste the barley bree' aye robbie burns robbie burns weel did ye ken the joys o' life chapter xvi mr gowrie's plotting have you found him have you really really found him aye he's rin tae earth like a tod young leddy oh maud tedder clapped her hands and a bright light came into her tired looking eyes i'm so glad i'm so delighted now he's caught the law will hang him for killing poor pa and i'll she was about to add that she would inherit the money but thought it wiser not to reveal her private business too minutely and ended differently i'll have done my duty said maud tedder virtuously an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth boomed mrs mountford the three two ladies and one gentleman were seated in the drawing room of moated hall enjoying a most interesting conversation until herries fulfilled the conditions of the will and came forward to claim his inheritance mr ritson as the executor permitted miss tedder to dwell in her old home she had only lately returned from london in company with mrs mountford and her jaded looks may be accounted for by the fact that it had been found impossible to upset the will of the late knight also there was another reason for maud's drawn face and lack of colour but this she did not impart to mr michael gowrie the old reprobate sat comfortably in the most comfortable chair which his eagle eye could have chosen when he entered the room and he was here with the intention of carrying out the little plot entered into between himself and kind and herries ritson was also cognisant of the scheme to have herries arrested after the marriage ceremony as kind and gowrie had called to inform him that herries was ready to give himself up at that interview with the lawyer a long conversation had taken place and ritson had been made acquainted with all that had happened from the time that angus had set foot in the marsh inn he could throw no light on the darkness of the case even after hearing the facts but approved of herries surrendering himself to the law as until he stood his trial or at least until he appeared before the magistrate nothing in mr ritson's opinion could be done he had therefore supplied gowrie with a trifle of money to procure some new clothes and pay a proper visit to the disinherited heiress in the meantime herries still hiding in the caravan had departed with kind and elspeth chaperoned by rachel to a quiet midland town whereto the details of the crime had not yet penetrated with sufficient publicity to make the name of herries notorious thus all chance of immediate arrest was avoided and not only had ritson in the interests of his client the accused man financed gowrie but he had provided the money to procure a special license for the solemnisation of the marriage it must be confessed that there was some difficulty over the procuring of this latter or at all events after it had been procured the clerk had given the license readily enough as he never thought that a hunted man would seek to marry but afterwards it crossed his mind that angus herries was wanted by the police in connection with the marsh inn murder and he had forthwith informed scotland yard but a description of the man who had procured the license it was kind led to nothing and as the license was given it was probable that the marriage would take place the only thing to do was to keep a look out throughout england for the church where the ceremony was likely to be performed inspector trent was communicated with and came up to london to make personal enquiries but he could learn nothing likely to trace the man who had taken out the license this was the more difficult as kind had disguised himself to procure the same but the fact remained that angus herries who stood in the shadow of the gallows was so little impressed by his terrible position that he intended to marry trent who was wanting in imagination could not understand gowrie had also interviewed trent at tarhaven while kind was getting the license and told a very straightforward story he had been asleep in the tap room he said and had departed at seven in the morning according to his intention as told to the landlady on the previous night he had heard nothing and had seen nothing and would have come forward before only he had been travelling in the midlands for the last few weeks and had not seen any paper likely to inform him that he was being asked for having told all he knew that is all he chose to appear to know mr gowrie left the tarhaven police office stating that he would hold himself at the disposition of the police and would be found at any time at the marsh inn where he had again induced mrs narby to take him in in the face of this plausible story inspector trent whose intellect was none of the brightest did not see how he could arrest gowrie and the old reprobate won clear of a rather difficult position so here he was in the very citadel of the enemy arrayed in a brand new broad cloth suit with a new tall hat and a pair of new black gloves to say nothing of highly polished boots looking as neat as a new pin and enjoying himself immensely and no wonder since he was telling lies by the yard gowrie should certainly have been a novelist as he had a most lavish imagination and should have put into print what he uttered by tongue at the present moment in his endeavours to entrap maud tedder into parting with five hundred pounds he was wasting marketable stuff in a most prodigal fashion at the same time he was keeping a look out for captain kyles but as yet that buccaneer had not appeared on the scene the reason of this non appearance gowrie learned later aye young leddy he'll hang as high as haman i doot not and wit ye say me'em this to mrs mountford is tae be fund in deuteronomy or the beuk o' leviticus i no mind the which i am glad to see sir that you read your bible it's bread an' life to me said the sage lifting his eyes that is he lifted one in appeal to heaven and kept the other on maud who was pacing the long room in a state of high excitement she already saw the fortune within her grasp and was quite prepared to hang her cousin so that she might secure her rightful inheritance and then he'll come back he'll come back she murmured aloud eh what's yon inquired gowrie wha wull come back young leddy captain she began unthinkingly then warned by an ostentatious cough from the watchful mrs mountford she stopped short i was talking to myself she said haughtily hoots i ken that but we tell tae oorsel's muckle that we wudna tell tae ithers ye ken language groaned mrs mountford who looked more like an undertaker's lady than ever was given us to conceal our thoughts aye aye me'em ye'll have been takin' a wee bit look at the end o' the dictionary jameson's for me cried the enthusiastic scotchman and nane o' yer johnson's an' webster's maud shook her head impatiently and came to sit by the old man for the purpose of gaining information you have merely told us that you have found mr herries she said looking at him with her pale blue eyes and in an inquisitive manner where is he aye yen's a lang story replied gowrie folding his hands and settling himself comfortably an' maybe a glass of sherry wine wud help me to tell it mair lifelike anxious only to hear the truth maud crossed to the bell and touched the ivory button but mrs mountford groaned what did lemuel's mother say to him concerning strong drink she inquired but gowrie for business purposes knew his bible as well as she did if not better give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts he quoted likewise 'it is not for kings to drink strong wine' she snapped aye but i'm nae king ye ken me'em retorted the old scamp then added under his breath deil tak' the wurnon she a parfect lamentations o' jeremy the prophet mrs mountford worked no more in the cause of temperance but sat glooming like a thunderstorm in her corner while gowrie tasted with approval the hot yellow wine which had been brought almost immediately when he had finished two glasses he began to relate a perfectly mythical story but none the less interesting because it was invented out of his own clever head i'm a mon o' letters he began would you mind talking english interrupted maud nae nae young leddy ye canna get the pow'r in english that ye can in homely scotch an' i'm like an eastern story teller aboot tae babble o' strange maitters i'll hear them in english which i know you can speak said maud who was as obstinate as gowrie himself or i won't listen at all then ye'll nae find the mon ye want oh yes i'll tell inspector trent that you know where he is gowrie did not relish this speech as trent entertained some suspicions of his honesty notwithstanding the plausible story he had related also he might lose the reward therefore he made a virtue of necessity and turned his glib tongue to english i am a man of letters miss tedder he said smoothly and have fallen on evil days to be precise i have not earned that reputation which my talents deserve consequently my emoluments are not large at one time i was tutor to angus herries your unfortunate cousin but evil speaking people drove me from the metropolis of the north to wander on the earth proceed said mrs mountford heavily and thinking from the looks of the narrator that strong drink had much to do with his wandering on the face of the earth i have wandered far and wide said this modern ulysses and the records of my travels may be found in various journals i have been but badly paid for the same said the sage sighing and it behoves me to gain money in some other way he cast a cunning look at miss tedder i hear there is a reward offered for the man who can find angus herries yes i am not rich said maud coolly but i'll willingly pay five hundred pounds which i can do through mr ritson the lawyer as soon as mr herries is in gaol aye murmured gowrie maintaining a bland face a sprat tae catch a mack'ril what's that asked maud hearing indistinctly naething a blessing a blessing but to continue he added reverting to english i chanced upon the 'marsh inn' while i wandered and there i have stopped frequently indeed my daughter elspeth remained at the inn as a companion to the landlady i was told about her said miss tedder abruptly she was a servant i believe nae nae a companion young leddy but that's neither here nor there ye ken weel i mean well young lady i stopped at the inn on the night your father was murdered and we know all about that sir boomed mrs mountford inspector trent informed us of what you had told him in the interests of justice he is keeping miss tedder advised of all matters likely to lead to a detection of her father's murderer then i need not go over the same ground again said gowrie readily and laughing in his sleeve at the way in which he was deceiving these women who doubtless thought themselves extremely clever sufficient it is to say that i was asleep all the night and departed early in the morning ignorant that a crime had been committed when i returned many days later i found that my daughter whom i had left in the charge of mrs narby as a servant interpolated maud spitefully as a companion persisted gowrie obstinately i found that she had fled with angus herries with my cousin maud rose excitedly did she know where he was no lied the reprobate skilfully she saw him at the inn and then he escaped afterwards she received a letter from him written from a buckinghamshire village asking her to join him and why asked mrs mountford curiously because it seems the two loved one another absurd cried maud her small face working with anger why she only saw him once quite long enough to enable her to love him and he to love her said gowrie rather pleased to witness this disgust but it's impossible angus loved me she insisted and a look of wounded pride passed over her face so he told me responded gowrie dryly but that was two years ago he said that he never really loved until he met elspeth oh did he cried miss tedder in disgust then she won't have him for long he'll be in gaol before many hours pass i hope so said gowrie playing his part extremely well i do not want my child to become the bride of a criminal what do you mean by that exactly what i say miss tedder when i found that my daughter had fled to herries in buckinghamshire how did you know she was there i found a letter waiting for me at a london address telling me that she was going to marry herries why was not the letter waiting at the inn it was not for the simple reason that gowrie was too clever to give himself away mrs narby certainly would not depose that such a letter was waiting at the inn therefore he placed the address at a safe distance where the police could not find it i have a home in london to which my child always writes said he evasively and she wrote to me there after i had found the inn empty of my jewel oh go on said maud impatient of this high flown language i then went to buckinghamshire to what village do you say i'll not tell you that until i have your promise in writing to pay me the five hundred you shall have it before you leave this room but you will only get the money if herries i mean my cousin is arrested i ask no more said gowrie rubbing his hands and chuckling if inspector trent will come with me we can interrupt the marriage ceremony which takes place to morrow in the village church so soon and the village wait till i have your handwriting said gowrie smartly but to proceed with the epic i went to this village and saw herries and my daughter he told me that he was innocent and that he had procured a special license to marry my child i objected as i wanted him first to clear his name he says he cannot do that and no wonder said miss tedder scornfully seeing that he is guilty of the crime do you really believe that of course i do would i want him hanged if i did not believe him guilty weel said gowrie scratching his head and applying himself again to a now nearly empty decanter wumen are kittle cattle not miss tedder chimed in mrs mountford she is not one to bear false witness well then to make a long story short said gowrie beginning to feel weary and finding there was no chance of further strong drink my pride objected to my daughter wedding a criminal and i came to ask you miss tedder to pay me the reward and come with me to inspector trent to morrow we can go to this village and arrest this man and heaven grant added gowrie piously that we may be in time to prevent the marriage whether angus is married or not matters very little said his amiable cousin i want him tried by jury weel chuckled gowrie becoming scotch again now that his story was ended ye canna have him tried ony ither way ye ken but are ye sure that the mon is guilty certain he was at the inn and so was my father i wis there also yet i'm innocent said gowrie dryly you had no reason to kill my father angus had and what may that be he knew that he would inherit the money if my father died how did he know that captain kyles told me that he knew an' hoo did captain kyles ken you had better ask him snapped maud who seemed to regret having admitted as much and who had been frowned upon by mrs mountford is he in the hoose no he is in london nae nae chuckled the old man prepared to throw a bombshell i ken weel where he is a chield ca'd sweetlips kind tauld me having been to the bit ship of him to the 'tarabacca' aye at pierside the captain's on board her wi' the leddy he's gaun tae marry maud jumped up wrathfully he's engaged to me she cried and her baby face became convulsed with anger nae nae young leddy kind tell't me he wis tae be the joe o' a mexican lady o' of donna maria guzman said miss tedder angrily that is untrue captain kyles is to be my husband donna maria is simply the daughter of the ex president of indiana and came in the yacht to pierside to do business with my father and maud maud warned mrs mountford rising quickly do not say more than is wise i shall say what i think that is no matter but it's a lie a lie mr gowrie captain kyles is engaged to me aye said gowrie presumably to himself angus herries wull be glad he wantit tae see ye marrit an' oot o' his way maud uttered a cry of anger which was precisely what gowrie wanted her to do since his object in making the speech was to inflame her against her cousin as perhaps as he thought in her rage she might let out what she knew of the crime but mrs mountford laid her hand on the girl's arm as she was about to burst forth into furious speech and after a moment's struggle with herself miss tedder rushed from the room followed by her governess left alone gowrie rang the bell and ordered another decanter of sherry which was brought since the servant fancied that miss tedder must have left instructions it never struck the man that gowrie would have the impudence to give an order on his own authority but then he did not know the sage gowrie sipped the sherry and chuckled over the success of his plot but he was puzzled to think why maud should be so angered against angus herries a wumon scorned i'm theenking said gowrie meditatively she's wants tae marry the captain and yet hae her cousin deeing for her luve but ye canna hae yer cake and eat it young madam nae nae i ken fine ye canna i doot this captain's playing the deil wi' ye as ye played the jade wi' herries weel herries wull marry my child and the captain his mexican fly away and ye'll be left greeting the which is nae mair nor ye deserve his meditations were interrupted by the return of mrs mountford with a sheet of note paper on this miss tedder had written a promise that she would pay michael gowrie five hundred pounds when herries was safe in gaol i'm obleeged tae ye me'em said the sage folding up the precious document awa' wi' this tae the poleece station and invite yon jack in office tae gang wi' me tae the salubrious village o' anderfield in bucks is that the name of the village sir aye that's the name noo i hae the promise o' the siller ye may ken the place where the marriage wull tak place an' noo he caught up his brand new silk hat i mau' be ganging ma ways one moment said mrs mountford laying her hand on his arm are you sure that captain kyles is engaged to this mexican lady i am as sure as sure me'em then he's a villain cried mrs mountford heavily for he told miss tedder that he loved her alone but he had better take care for maud can she can can what asked gowrie struck by the significance of her tone she can ruin him said mrs mountford coldly the deil she can if captain kyles marries this donna maria said mrs mountford in a quiet and deadly tone you tell mr herries that i can save him gowrie was so astonished by this speech that he would have asked for further information but mrs mountford conscious perhaps that she had said too much pushed him out of the room and shortly he was hurrying towards the police station as fast as his wicked old legs could carry him sorely puzzled as to her meaning maybe the captain killed the auld mon thought gowrie but for why hoots there's a deal o' deevilry in this case yon lassie wi' the bairn's face kens mair aboot the death o' her faither nor she'll say but if this don giovanny and that kyles is no less plays her false a' the fat wull be on the fire weel the mair necessity for me tae hurry up wi' the arrest and get the siller meanwhile maud tedder was shut up in her room lying on her bed and raging as only a woman scorned can rage of late she had noted and especially since the death of her father that kyles was not so attentive as he had been now she learned that he was engaged to donna maria guzman when he had explicitly stated to her that he did not care for that lady apparently it was the money he was after and this thought made the jealous heart of maud burn within her she loved kyles and would have sacrificed a thousand cousins to make him her husband that could be done she thought if she recovered her fortune by getting herries hanged and if he was arrested he certainly would be hanged therefore she was quite willing to give half a year's income to bring about this result all that day and the next she lay in bed denying herself to everyone longing for news late in the afternoon of the day following gowrie's visit she received a wire from anderfield sent by the old man herries arrested ran the wire he was already married married said maud to herself smiling cruelly his honeymoon will be spent in gaol and will end on the gallows chapter xvii maud's inheritance there was a lull in the political and social worlds when herries was captured the newspapers had said all that they could say regarding past events and nothing especial was happening worth prattling about the marsh inn case with its strong element of mystery and its spice of romance proved to be a godsend in the way of copy consequently hordes of eager reporters poured into tarhaven whither inspector trent had conducted his prisoner after the arrest at anderfield in bucks the facts that herries was sir simon's nephew for the late knight was no unimportant figure in the commercial millionaire world that he had inherited fifty thousand a year and that he had been taken by the police when issuing from the village church immediately after his marriage made the whole case immensely interesting also the mystery of the murder lifted it out of the category of ordinary crime it was well known that the prisoner declared himself to be innocent and everyone wondered what possible defence he could make trent himself did not know as by the advice of shrewd headed kind the young man preserved an irritating silence and the rev michael gowrie wishing to make a dramatic announcement at a dramatic moment kept his own counsel that herries might be exonerated never entered the inspector's head for one moment and he gathered together all procurable evidence so as to secure the committal of the prisoner by the local magistrate and as various hints which might have been traced to gowrie were given to the public that strange revelations might be expected everyone was on tip toe with excitement sir simon had been a great magnate in tarhaven and it was natural that his death should arouse the deepest interest the more so as it was now commonly reported that far from explaining the facts of the death and the motive for what looked like a purposeless crime the evidence at the magisterial trial would probably deepen the mystery in their frantic efforts to get at the truth and narrate highly coloured tales to their readers several reporters attempted to interview mrs herries formerly miss elspeth gowrie by the advice of sweetlips the girl saw one of these enterprising young journalists who belonged to a half penny paper with the very largest circulation in the world kind instructed her to tell the truth even to the concealment in the caravan as he thought that if public sympathy could be awakened for the lovers herries would stand a better chance of acquittal there was some risk in being thus explicit as the cheap jack ran a deadly chance of being arrested as an accomplice after the fact were herries condemned he would probably be so arrested and elspeth along with him but before instructing elspeth sweetlips had privately interviewed the old scotch tutor and from him had extracted the evidence which as he averred would save herries from the gallows at the eleventh hour elspeth herself did not know what this evidence could be but the fact that kind was willing to risk his liberty on the strength of it made her very cheerful as it pointed to the certain discharge of angus when the unvarnished tale came out in the morning planet it made an undeniable sensation and elspeth became the heroine of the hour the sudden love of the girl the way in which she had proved that love by rescuing the man she believed to be innocent from the hands of the prejudiced police the strange wooing in the caravan and the saving of rachel kind from a terrible death by the timely arrival of herries all these things smacked of romance and people now began to believe in spite of all evidence to the contrary that angus herries was innocent no man so loved could be guilty no scoundrel could awaken such devotion in the heart of a timid unformed girl one and all the women high and low of the three kingdoms ranged themselves on the side of mrs herries and not a few men followed their lead as was natural kind's belief proved to be right after the publication of the statement in the morning planet the case became more interesting than ever and everyone sympathised with the unlucky married pair dr browne invited gowrie and his daughter to stop at his house and his servants were occupied to the very day of the trial in keeping away people from the door and when elspeth walked abroad she was pointed at snap shotted admired and discussed in a way which showed that her heroic conduct as the morning planet called it had won her a warm place in the heart of the public in several papers her portrait appeared she was asked to write an account of her early life there was some talk of getting up a subscription on her behalf since it was known that she was horribly poor and in every way people showed their sympathy mrs herries was the lioness of the hour and had she been single would undoubtedly have received many offers of marriage as it was her devotion to her unfortunate husband made her the talk of england ireland scotland and wales elspeth did not like this publicity as she was retiring by nature but she bore it all for the sake of angus undoubtedly it would aid him in his defence and probably would help to save his life to do that she would have sacrificed herself ten times over and in a much more terrible way but further sacrifice was needless herries was now so to speak under the protection of the british public and everyone was certain that he would have a fair trial many even went so far as to say that he would be acquitted but inspector trent laughed these prophets to scorn herries was guilty the evidence proved that he was guilty and in assisting him to escape both his wife and the cheap jack had thwarted the ends of justice when the prisoner was committed for trial said trent he would see about arresting kind as an accomplice after the fact but even trent did not dare to hint that elspeth might be arrested to put her in prison would have provoked a storm from the public which no one in authority would risk one person was intensely disgusted at the elevation of young mrs herries into a heroine and that was maud tedder on hearing of the arrest of her cousin she had expressed great joy and in his condemnation she saw the chance of recovering her father's property not only did she want the money but she also desired to re capture captain bruce kyles a wary bird only to be lived by golden grain after he had heard the will read and had discovered that it could not be upset he had returned to the tarabacca at pierside and beyond a few cold notes had refrained from paying her any attention in effect he showed that now she was poor he did not intend to marry her and after gowrie's hint maud was certain that the captain was engaged to seora guzman she had been made a catspaw of and if herries was not hanged and kyles re captured to be her husband she had fully made up her spiteful mind to revenge herself however since there were difficulties in the way she called to see elspeth and propose a compromise it might be as maud argued that angus would not be condemned especially after the statement of the morning planet therefore it was worth while to gain half if not the whole fortune mrs herries was alone in the doctor's drawing room a very masculine looking apartment unworthy of the name browne was absent seeing his patients kind who usually haunted the house was taking rachel round tarhaven to buy goods for the caravan and the reverend michael gowrie was where he often was in the nearest public house drinking at other people's expense and advertising himself as the father of the famous mrs angus herries the old man managed to procure many cheap drinks in this way but no one ever got out of him even in his most convivial moments what evidence he proposed to give in order to save his son in law elspeth remained within doors for a certain reason after hearing kind's account of his visit to the tarabacca she became certain that seora guzman was in possession of facts which might help to prove the innocence of her husband since sir simon had written that mysterious letter to someone on the yacht why not to this captain kidd in petticoats then there was the hint of the treasure manco capac's treasure which kind professed himself unable to understand and kyles himself might know something by awakening the jealousy of the mexican beauty the truth might be arrived at concerning the kidnapping of armour and that as elspeth argued was in some way connected with the death of sir simon tedder after all as seora guzman had hinted to kind it might be simply a political crime in which case donna maria would have the less hesitation in telling the plain facts of the assassination taking all these facts into consideration mrs herries had written to seora guzman asking her to call at tarhaven and have a chat and the mexican lady had graciously assented to the request when miss tedder's card was brought in elspeth saw in her arrival much more than a mere chance providence had brought the two women who loved bruce kyles into contact and the possible quarrel between the two might result in the truth becoming known of course elspeth was groping in the dark as she did not yet see what maud or seora guzman or bruce kyles could have to do with the murder but that they had something to do with the death of the millionaire she was very certain and therefore was ready to take every advantage of miss tedder's visit maud came alone as she did not wish even mrs mountford to hear what she had to say to the woman who had married her cousin when she entered the room and elspeth arose to receive her she stopped short in surprise was this frail delicate looking girl with the white face and the pathetic eyes the heroine about whom such a fuss was being made she did not look as though she could plan anything much less carry out a daring scheme yet it was owing to her that herries had escaped at a critical moment but maud judging by the flesh and not by the spirit looked at the shrinking girl contemptuously and promised herself an easy victory she sat down with an insolent air and stared hard at her rival on her side elspeth was eager to see maud knowing that angus had once loved her mrs herries admitted the doll like prettiness of the millionaire's daughter but could not understand how a man like her husband could have loved so soulless a being miss tedder was beautifully dressed and looked extremely pretty but she certainly was not a girl to awaken passion of any sort in a man in a way elspeth was as contemptuous of maud as maud was of her and so the two commenced their interview with a mutual misunderstanding i am angus herries' cousin said miss tedder sharply sitting bolt upright and keeping her hands in her muff then when elspeth simply nodded she added and you are his wife elspeth bowed again why have you come here she asked quietly the dresden china beauty laughed to see the woman who has taken my leavings she said insolently you see her replied mrs herries calmly well this behaviour disconcerted maud she would have preferred elspeth to have risen in a royal rage but the girl was perfectly calm and would supply no fuel for burning i don't think much of you she snapped with a hard stare really did you come to tell me this partly and also to congratulate you that angus will be hanged elspeth started and clasped her hands tightly to prevent herself getting into a passion why do you think that is a matter of congratulation she demanded in a choked voice because he's a beast burst out maud losing her temper in the face of this coolness he was once engaged to me and treated me shamefully no he did not he treated you only too kindly what do you know about it all that angus could tell me ah he had to make his own case good there was no need to with me said elspeth coldly but a spot of vivid red burned on each cheek i know angus well but not so well as i do cried miss tedder anxious to break down her companion's composure angus made me love him and then left me all alone he broke my heart this with a truly effective sob rubbish said elspeth rising quickly say that to a man and not to another woman angus had a passing fancy for you and you threw him over at the bidding of your father he had more than a fancy he adored me then why did he leave you papa would not let me marry him but if angus had remained true to me i should have remained true to him instead of taking up with captain bruce kyles i suppose sneered elspeth resolved to sting in her turn maud started to her feet in a fury how dare you talk to me like this you who are no better than a servant and who will soon be a murderer's widow no cried mrs herries imperatively and facing the other girl boldly i intend to save my husband's life you can't do it without me you elspeth turned like a tigress on her visitor what do you know about it maud felt rather afraid when this fragile girl flashed out in this way i know that angus is guilty she said obstinately then how can you save him i can get some one to give evidence that he is innocent who i'll tell you on conditions oh on conditions and what are they my father explained maud calmly left all his money save a miserable thousand a year to angus that is not fair i can offer no opinion on that point rejoined elspeth in an equally cool manner the will was none of my making but if you wanted to inherit the money you should have given up this captain kyles as your father wished i won't and i didn't i would rather lose every penny than give up bruce it seems to me that you have lost every penny said mrs herries rather cruelly but you have got your lover no i haven't cried maud her eyes very bright and her cheeks very red then suddenly broke down oh elspeth do help me or i'll lose him altogether he won't marry me unless i have the money and i haven't got it but elspeth was not going to yield to a few crocodile tears you can get the money when angus is hanged she retorted maud dried her eyes viciously very well she cried with a stamp you're a hard hearted girl and a beast i hate and detest you i came here to save your husband but now he can hang very good now you can go but this was not what miss tedder wanted see here she said becoming business like and speaking in a hard voice if you and angus will promise to give me half the income i'll save him can you you asked that before yes i can elspeth recalled what the other had said a few moments previously by getting someone to declare his innocence she repeated no said maud coming closer and whispering by getting someone to plead guilty to the crime what is the name of this someone i shan't tell you you shall you must no if you and angus sign a paper saying that i am to have half the money then i'll save him by denouncing the real criminal oh i didn't say i knew about that you do i believe you know the truth and wish to get angus hanged simply to get this horrible money and before maud could evade her she caught the girl by her wrist you'll tell me the name of the assassin before you leave this room leave me alone cried miss tedder in a cold fury how dare you in answer elspeth gave the wrist such a twist that maud screamed aloud with pain tell me tell me you're hurting me ow ow cry away taunted elspeth i intend to have the truth maud set her teeth and tried to wriggle free but she might as well have attempted to extricate herself from a blacksmith's vice oh you are hurting me i'll break your wrist before i've done speak and elspeth shook her as a terrier does a rat no maud fastened her teeth in elspeth's wrist and received a box on the ears then she burst out crying and dropped to the floor with mrs herries still holding to her prey oh you are cruel elspeth shook her again and went on shaking as she spoke tell me tell me i'm not sure whimpered miss tedder now really frightened of the other's blazing eyes i can prove nothing you must let me judge of that who killed sir simon will you give me half the money if i tell you you must ask angus that i don't dispose of his property maud began to scream but it was all of no use she had ventured into the lion's den how ill bred you are she sobbed ah said elspeth contemptuously you thought to come here and taunt me you thought to find a weakling but you see with another vigorous shake my love for angus makes me strong i'm afraid of nothing when he is in danger you rejoiced to hear that he was arrested very good then you shall be the one to release him now then out with it out with it and again came the shaking until maud was quite sick she was terribly afraid of this reckless girl who dared to lay hands on her there was nothing for it but to tell the truth so far as she knew it seora guzman murdered my father she cried grovelling mrs herries was so surprised that she released her hold and stepped back a pace to see if maud was speaking truly how do you know papa wrote a letter to her saying that he would disinherit me if i didn't give up bruce and asked her to meet him at the 'marsh inn' to see if she could take bruce away from me it might be true murmured elspeth recalling that seora guzman smoked the brand of cigarette found in herries' room but why did she kill your father he took a lot of money with him and she wanted it to fit out an expedition to find manco capac's treasure who told you this bruce he fears her and loves me there maud rose and smoothed her skirts i've told you the truth but you can prove nothing without me give me half the money and you shall have half the money if you save angus said elspeth chapter xviii a surprising defence elspeth lost no time in relating to kind all that she had heard from maud and also confessed that she had promised the girl half her father's fortune if she saved angus sweetlips was rather annoyed that such a promise had been extorted which it really had been as miss tedder certainly did not deserve one single penny however said the cheap jack you made the promise and not mr herries therefore if he refuses miss tedder can say nothing angus will do what i want replied the girl quickly i know that but you won't want him to reward iniquity and oh maud is not so bad as that she's about as bad as they make 'em grumbled the ex detective grimly to get that money she is quite willing to see her cousin hanged and is only hedging at the last moment as she fears lest your father should save him do you think my father really can yes i know what he is going to say and it will settle the matter therefore miss tedder not having saved mr herries can expect nothing moreover the fortune will not be your husband's until he discovers the criminal oh there are many reasons why your forced promise to miss tedder need not be kept but if she is right in saying that seora guzman is the guilty person she will have done everything towards getting the fortune for angus so that she may secure half of it if he is not hanged and if he escapes it will be no thanks to her do you think she is telling the truth i really can't say murmured kind nursing his chin of course she is jealous of seora guzman and would do anything to get her out of the way it seems to me that captain bruce kyles is trifling with both these women tell me again exactly what miss tedder said elspeth thought for a moment she said that her father wrote the letter which mr ritson mentioned to you to seora guzman asking her to come to the 'marsh inn' she came and sir simon proposed to pay her enough money to fit out some expedition on condition that she the seora that is took captain bruce kyles away from england removed him from maud's path in fact humph i remember seora guzman's reference to an expedition in search of some treasure it might be that her real reason in coming to england was to get funds but if this mexican lady loves kyles and sir simon was willing to pay her for loving him why did she murder him to get the money maud says but she could have got the money in any case argued kind who was much perplexed by the present aspect of the affair why commit a useless crime i don't believe she did it but you remember elspeth reminded him you remember that you found the stump of a tangerian cigarette on the floor of yes yes and seora guzman smokes that brand but other people may smoke the same sort of cigarettes for instance captain kyles and sweetlips looked keenly at elspeth do you think that he no mrs mountford whom i have seen told me that captain kyles was with maud tedder on the night of the murder he could not be in two places at once could he but then that kidnapping the crew of the 'tarabacca' certainly kidnapped armour under the impression that he was some spy that looks as though their mistress was in the hotel at the time and they were removing danger from her path and again seora guzman could easily swarm up those light trellis spars under the window of the bedroom in petticoats pooh a daring woman like that is quite capable of assuming a sailor's dress to carry out her object then you think she was there that she is guilty i think on the authority of the cigarette stump that she was in the hotel but i don't say that she is guilty she did not kill sir simon for i can see no motive for her committing the crime nevertheless urged elspeth as the cigarette stump was found in my husband's bedroom she must have been there well drawled the cheap jack with his eyes on the ground as i said other people may have smoked such a brand one of the officers on board for instance kyles is innocent and i am not prepared to say that seora guzman is guilty but she certainly might have implicated your husband in the crime by placing the razor on his bed and hiding the pocket book under it the best thing to do will be to question her and inform her of miss tedder's accusation i thought she was coming to see you so she was yesterday and i expected to see her about the time maud called however she never came humph she will be at the trial no doubt you will see her to day then i'll question her oh by the way kind came back after taking a few steps towards the door i have found out from trent who is a fool and can't keep his own counsel that sir simon drew two thousand pounds from his bank the day previous to his death that is two hundred in gold and the rest in notes trent learned this from ritson who should have told me by the way and he heard it from the bank manager so you see that the money which the landlady and her son saw sir simon handling and which filled the blue pocket book amounted to that sum now if we can trace the notes we'll lay hands on the criminal have any of the notes been presented not yet however the manager has the numbers trent makes this statement at the hearing to day before the magistrate i must get off there and you i'm coming with my father in half an hour you'll come back with your husband to this place shortly said kind in an encouraging tone oh sweetlips do you really think so i am absolutely certain of it and he departed leaving mrs herries much up lifted by the good news she was certain that the cheap jack spoke the truth for there was that in his manner which inspired confidence elspeth dressed herself very simply to accompany her father to the hearing before the magistrate and indeed even had she been minded to dress more expensively she could not have done so her frock and hat her boots and gloves were all presents from rachel kind in return for the nursing and were of the plainest and cheapest description dr browne in his impulsive generosity had wished to give his friend's wife a dress but this elspeth refused as she preferred to be indebted to no one and browne honoured her for the refusal he was beginning to have a better opinion of women since he had known elspeth herries but if the daughter was plainly dressed the father was resplendent as the old scamp had no scruples in taking money from whomsoever was fool enough to give it to him he was arrayed in purple and fine linen and looked highly prosperous gowrie was aware that he was the most important figure at the trial after the prisoner and resolved to take every advantage of the publicity which was as he said himself thrust upon him for years as he also said he had been hiding his light under a bushel but now there was a chance of his shining brilliantly and he arranged to stick his candle in the most conspicuous position the shrewd old man saw every opportunity of making money and although he hoped that his son in law when freed and in possession of the property would remunerate him for his services still he did not neglect the chance of making a few shillings on his own account and finally gowrie dearly loved publicity and praise his progress along the streets with elspeth was like that of a king leading a princess to the altar his daughter wanted a cab but this gowrie refused haud up yer held ma bairn said he in his grand mellow voice an' dinna leuk sae white this is a gran' day in the annals o' ma hoose an' i gang forth like david tae succour the sick and tae here mr gowrie who had been taking various drinks became somewhat incoherent and elspeth was glad when he held his tongue since everyone in the street knew who he was and who she was from the old man's loud talking he was really a dreadful person to have for a father all the same he held the fate of her husband in his hands there was a crowd outside the building in which the trial was to take place but a very few people were admitted into the court itself this was done by order of the presiding magistrate who knew that the sympathy of the public was with the prisoner and who did not wish for any manifestations during the proceedings trent had assured him that herries would undoubtedly be convicted on the evidence and the magistrate believing this guessed that when the young man was committed to take his trial at the next essex sessions there would be a tumult therefore when elspeth and her father entered the court they found that few were present but outside could be heard the murmur of the mob who were eagerly waiting to see what would happen the proceedings were very much the same as they had been at the marsh inn inquest trent made similar statements to those he had made before but supplemented them by adding that sir simon had in his possession on the night he was murdered the sum of two thousand pounds in gold and notes he stated that the numbers of the notes were in his possession but that as yet none of them had been presented he detailed all that had taken place at the inn on the night the crime had been committed the arrival of sir simon to meet his unknown visitor the subsequent arrival of herries who said and perhaps wrongly as trent suggested that he did not know that his uncle was in the house then came the relation of narby's discovery of the dead body and the evidence found in herries' room in fact inspector trent made out a very good case against the prisoner and it really looked as though nothing could prevent the accused man being committed for trial at the chelmsford sessions the same witnesses as had appeared at the inquest were called mrs narby her husband her son and elspeth no new facts were elicited and the witnesses with the exception of elspeth stated that they were certain the prisoner was guilty browne was examined and gave evidence as to his examination of the dead body and mentioned the probable hour of death it was all rather dull as everything had appeared before in the papers herries seated in the dock gazed straight before him with a calm face and every now and then stole a glance at elspeth to gain confidence she was seated with clasped hands in agony as the evidence was given in the face of it all how could she hope that her husband would escape trent recalled by the magistrate explained that he had not been able to find the man who had passed through the tap room arrayed in sir simon's fur coat but mentioned that the coat itself had been discovered the magistrate who seemed to be an open minded man thought that this was a favourable sign for the prisoner as the missing man might possible be and very probably was the assassin but the lawyer who appeared for the prosecution pointed out that the razor and the empty pocket book had been found in herries' room he dared the defence to explain how these came to be in the room of the prisoner it was at this point that michael gowrie was called and then all present listened attentively as this was the most important witness of the lot and assuredly according to common report would be able to save the prisoner the young lawyer who was acting for herries asked gowrie a few questions relative to his position and the reason he had been at the marsh inn on the night in question then he asked him to tell his story this gowrie did in his best english and very earnestly he knew that too much was at stake to commit himself to the scotch dialect which would not be half understood by those present gowrie's statement made with considerable impudence was to the effect that herries on retiring to bed was so excited by his misfortunes that it was probable he would not sleep sorry for the young man gowrie bethought himself of a small bottle of laudanum which he possessed he considered it his duty to give herries a dose so that he might sleep that was a dangerous thing to do said the magistrate rebukingly it was sir it was replied the witness but herries might have gone off his head had he not obtained the needful rest i deemed it my duty as his old tutor and sincere well wisher to drop a small quantity of the soothing drug into the whisky which i took up to him therefore sir i would point out that as the prisoner was under the influence of the drug he certainly could not have risen in the night to kill the deceased is there any evidence other than yours to show that this drug was given asked the magistrate looking grave gowrie mentioned pope narby the son of the landlady and the woman herself both of these witnesses were recalled and pope stated that he certainly saw gowrie drop the laudanum into the whisky to make the prisoner sleep as he had stated mrs narby gave evidence as to the administration of the drugged liquor and how readily the prisoner had fallen into a deep slumber browne was recalled and stated that while under the influence of such a dose of laudanum the prisoner certainly could not have committed the crime and then gowrie reiterated his statement with added proofs that the drug was so administered elspeth listened with joy believing every word of her father's story herries believed it also but knew perfectly well that the drug had been administered by gowrie not to make him sleep since he was already weary but to enable the old scamp to rob him he was on the point of stating this but thought that if he did so gowrie would probably deny the charge and such an accusation would complicate matters he therefore held his peace and waited to see what would come of this important piece of evidence the magistrate consulted with another official and trent was recalled the counsel for the prosecution questioned him and gowrie and the narbys minutely but after all in the end there was no doubt in the minds of anyone that the laudanum had been so administered and that herries under the soporific influence could not have left his bed to commit the crime after some delay the magistrate therefore did what he was forced to do he acquitted herries who left the court a free man much to the joy of elspeth when the late prisoner appeared outside the court the news of his acquittal and the reason of it had already preceded him and he was welcomed by the large crowd with great joy with his wife herries hurried to a cab intending to drive to browne's house and many a hand was stretched out to greet him undoubtedly everyone was pleased that the young man had been proved guiltless and elspeth with the tears streaming down her face could do nothing but gaze into the eyes of her husband who was thus at large again followed by shouting crowds the cab drove to dr browne's abode but gowrie remained behind as the hero of the hour and submitted not unwillingly to the questioning of many reporters who were anxious to hear more he related what he had said in the court and protested again and again that his only reason for giving the laudanum was to make his son in law sleep as there was no reason on the face of it why he should not be believed everyone thought that the old man spoke the truth and for once gowrie enjoyed the sensation of being the lion of the hour but herries much as he was indebted to his father in law was not quite satisfied when gowrie returned to browne's house the young man drew him aside and questioned him closely you robbed me of money said herries abruptly only a few shullings laddie chuckled gowrie ye wudna hae me tak awa ma ain character and you gave me the drug so that you might rob me in safety aye gowrie rubbed his hands joost sae an' a lucky nicht it wis for ye that i did pit the drug intae yon gless you are a scoundrel gowrie eh this tae yer paw in law an' tae the mon wha saved yer life you wouldn't have saved my life if i had not married elspeth was herries' dry retort weel maybe i wudnae hae pit maesel tae sic trouble hoots mon a few shullin' against yer ain neck it's gey cheap the old fellow was so shameless that herries could say nothing he stopped rebuking a man who could not feel the force of a rebuke and went on another tack when you came up to rob me did you see or hear anything aye but i winna tell ye what i saw you want to make more money out of it i expect well if you don't tell me i'll inform the police and you nae nae laddie dinna dae that i'll tell ye i saw a wumon in the paussage aye i dinna ken wha she wis but i saw a petticoat you saw her dinna pin me tae a word my manny it wis dark ye ken when i wis paying ye a veesit an' about what time was this after twelve or before it it wis nearer one o'clock in the morn said gowrie after some hesitation i wanted tae gie the drug time tae dae its marciful work i wis sleepin' in the tap room ye ken aye and a weary bed i hed laddie when the clock deil tak it for keeping me awake struck the haulf hour i joost slipped off mae shoon and crept up tae see ye sleepin' like a bairn had you a light nae nae i wis nane sae dafty a' the hoose es i thocht wis in slumber and i didnae care tae wauken the puir weary folk i kenned the lie o' the hoose weel enow and joost crept up the stairs tae yer room the door wisnae closed i saw tae that when i ganged up wi' yon limmer the narby wumon i came in lamb like nae wishful to disturb ye and then i struck a match ye were sleeping like a bairn added gowrie pathetically an' i thanked my gude thocht for makin' ye sleep aye i wis a faither tae ye on that nicht laddie well well questioned herries impatiently weel weel reiterated gowrie testily i turned oot the pockets of yer troosers and fund less nor i expected but i wis thankful for sma' marcies and departed wi' the few shullin's the which protested mr gowrie was scarce the price o' the beneficent drug i gie ye tae mak ye sleep to enable you to rob me you mean well you saw naethin' but i heard the swish o' a wumon's dress departing doon the stairs there i'll tell ye nae mair i dinna ken wha the female was maybe the landlady or seora guzman replied herries much perplexed chapter xix mrs mountford's accusation that same evening after dinner angus and elspeth sat side by side in the severe looking drawing room their host had been called out unexpectedly after the usual custom of patients who appear to fall ill at the most awkward moments but in this instance the young couple were rather glad that browne had departed as they wished to have a quiet and confidential talk about their position and their future hitherto owing to the attentions of various friends this had been impossible herries looked extremely well in spite of his late exciting experiences a very different man to the haggard tramp who had arrived at the marsh inn or hotel as many of the papers called it mrs kind had fed him well during his sojourn in the caravan and while detained in the tarhaven prison he had been treated kindly but he still wore the threadbare blue serge suit although browne had supplied him with clean linen a luxury which herries much appreciated elspeth was different also in every way she was improved as her face had filled out and her figure looked less fragile and her eyes were less like those of a hunted deer good food and a happy love for happy it was in spite of untoward circumstances had done much to improve the miserable little drudge of the inn hand in hand the lovers sat for they were more lovers than ever and the marriage bond was yet new to them there was only one electric lamp alight and that was at the end of the rather large room therefore mr and mrs herries sat in comparative twilight after all the storm and stress of the last few weeks they felt extremely happy and like weary sailors who had reached a safe port elspeth made some such remark but angus laughed as he kissed her you dear silly darling said the young man slipping his arm round her waist we are not in port yet there is a long voyage before us and a stormy one before we are safely berthed what do you mean dear you are safe my life is and my liberty but you forget elspeth that i am as poor and friendless as ever not friendless since you have me he pressed her to his breast i count you as more than a friend as my wife well then there is dr browne he's a trump and sweetlips kind the best fellow in the world save browne and my father here herries' eulogies came to a stand still he screwed up his face and shook his head i am not so sure that we can call your father a friend elspeth oh angus when he saved your life my dear i am well aware of that but his reason was simply a pecuniary one he told me plainly that he would not have put himself out had i not married you ah said elspeth somewhat bitterly he is only too glad to get rid of me i have always been an encumbrance to him well at least you are now with someone who appreciates you said angus kissing her do you really mean that angus do you really love me darling is there any need to tell you every need she said vehemently and with a suspicion of tears in her voice i have been so lonely all my life no one has ever loved me i have been kicked about from pillar to post neglected starved beaten scorned oh dearest heart she looked up passionately into his face can you wonder that i want you to tell me again and again how much you love me i love you i love you i love you there will that do again again she hid her face in his breast and he bent over her till his lips touched her soft hair i love you with all my heart and soul you are the one woman in the wide world to me and i am the only woman not maud maud he snapped his fingers pouf ah said elspeth jealously but you loved her you would have married her i loved her in the usual way a shallow young man loves she was pretty and coquettish when i was with her in edinburgh and her exterior drew me i loved her merely for her beauty never for her heart and beautiful nature as i love you dearest it required months of misery to deepen my nature and make me appreciate a true woman such as you are ours is one of those rare marriages that is made in heaven never be jealous of maud tedder my own love you alone possess my heart i know it i feel it all the same she paused all the same i want you to tell me again that you love me i love you little donkey elspeth threw her arms round his neck and brought his lips down to her own i am a donkey all the same i am a woman who wants to be loved i am loved this triumphantly but oh how delicious it is to love and to be loved angus elspeth they clasped hands and looked deep into one another's eyes then the reaction came and both burst out laughing we are like a couple of children said herries smiling merry children why not we have been sad for so long and foolish children ah my own we have been too wise in the misery of the world look at your years of sorrow look at my years of trouble we have both been unlucky mr and mrs jonah said angus with a shrug well darling i think two bad lucks make one good one since we have been married the luck has changed in what way i am free from a terrible charge and you are my wife henceforth i truly believe that we will be the happiest and most fortunate couple in the wide world two negatives make an affirmative so why shouldn't your bad luck and mine when joined as they now are make one superlatively good one what do you think i think the same as you everything will go well now hurrah angus shook her hands vigorously let us build castles in the air and perhaps they will turn into bricks and mortar elspeth caught his spirit and laughed also well then we will learn who killed your uncle and then you will get fifty thousand a year upon which she gave him a comical look we can manage to exist with due economy said herries gravely but we must not forget my dearest that should this great fortune come to us we will have to hold it in trust for less fortunate people there are many male and female jonahs about who will have to be helped i quite agree with you but we must get the money first now that you are free angus you can search for yourself i intend to but in what direction can i search elspeth thought for a few moments i fancy it would be best for you to return to the 'marsh inn' and question mrs narby do you think that she knows the truth i can't be sure but she is an observant woman and if you promise her a reward she would tell you of anything suspicious she might have seen that's true then angus burst into laughter i wonder if she'll be civil of course she must have seen in the papers that you have inherited this money and if you make it worth her while but i can't until i find out who killed my uncle only when the true assassin is discovered will i be able to inherit make it worth mrs narby's while and she will assist you insisted elspeth i am quite sure that the secret of the crime is to be discovered at the 'marsh inn' perhaps mrs narby herself killed my uncle why do you think that asked mrs herries quite startled your father acknowledged that when he went up the stairs after midnight to empty my pockets while i was lying in that drugged sleep he heard the swish of a woman's gown in the darkness going down the stairs that looks as though mrs narby no exclaimed elspeth vehemently and rising to gesticulate i really don't think that mrs narby bad as she is would commit such a crime she might have done so to get that two thousand pounds and then have placed the pocket book in my room to no no she would rob and scold and do many things but at heart she is a coward and would never risk her neck well then perhaps the woman who went down the stairs was seora guzman i don't see how she could have got into the inn neither do i said herries scratching his head in perplexity and i don't see either why she should have killed my uncle say that she wanted this two thousand in order to fit out an expedition to hunt for this peruvian treasure my uncle was ready to give it to her provided she removed kyles from maud's path yet maud accuses her said elspeth equally perplexed angus shrugged his shoulders of course maud is a jealous rival and would hang seora guzman at once if she could manage to do it it was strange that seora guzman was not at the trial to day why should she have come well you see she told kind that the crime was as she verily believed a political one and so she might have been present in order to save me seeing that she must know that i am innocent and did not know what your father was about to say the best thing will be to see her i intend to i'll go along to pierside to morrow and board that yacht and added herries emphatically i don't leave it until i learn all she knows do you think captain kyles no mrs mountford said that he was with maud at the 'moated hall' on the night of the murder i believe said herries walking up and down the room that your father knows more than he will admit he was sleeping in the tap room and anyone who went up the stairs would have to pass through it oh no angus well i don't exactly mean that but your father who admits to having been kept awake by the clock would have heard anyone who went up the stairs also he might have heard anything that went on outside the house what went on there armour was kidnapped and the man whom sir simon was to see climbed in at the window where stood the candle with the red handkerchief before it as a signal depend upon it your father knows where is he now asked elspeth we might ask him pooh he'll say only so much as suits his book he went an hour ago to see maud and claim his reward what reward you know the five hundred pounds that she offered for my apprehension he caught me so he can claim it the payment will make a large hole in maud's reduced income of one thousand a year i promised if she saved you angus that she should have half the fortune of her father i know but you are released from that promise maud did not save me your father did that unless i see some very strong reason i won't give maud a penny we must forgive our enemies rebuked elspeth quite so but maud sought my life to further her love chase i daresay in the end i'll help her but she must suffer a trifle for her wickedness hullo who is this browne come back as herries spoke the door opened and a bulky gentleman entered with a bulky lady behind him then a voice spoke which was easily recognised and a hand turned on the full glare of the electrics settin' in the twilight like turtle dooves said mr gowrie blind tae th' warld as ye micht say aye young luve young luve while the old tutor ran on in this jocular manner the bulky lady advanced she was clothed in black and wore a large picture hat trimmed with large ostrich feathers her advance was like that of a tragedy queen and she waved gowrie aside when he attempted to speak man she said grandly let me introduce myself mrs herries she bowed mr herries she repeated the performance i am mrs mountford the companion of miss maud tedder yes said angus rather coldly and may i ask why you have come here mrs mountford to appeal to you on behalf of your cousin she has been wrongfully dispossessed by her father and pardon me mrs mountford but i am unable to enter into this question at present until i discover who killed my uncle i am not in possession of the property and what if i can help you to discover the assassin what you know i know nothing but i have grave suspicions of whom mrs mountford did not reply immediately she sank into a chair and arranged herself like a queen gowrie stood beside her with folded hands and looked at her majestic form satirically elspeth sat beside angus and waited to hear what this formidable looking dame had to say i came here with mr gowrie said the ex governess as he has had some difficulty with miss tedder deeficulty do ye ca' it wumon cried gowrie who could keep silence no longer she's nae mair nor a jeezebel a scarlet wumon o' babylon takin' ma hardly earned siller frae me deeficulty says she aye and rank cheatin' swindling embeezling thieving hush mrs mountford waved her hand as though rebuking a rebellious subject be silent mr herries this man gentlemon ye bauld limmer aye an a meenister foreby he came to see miss tedder to claim his reward for having betrayed your hiding place he has certainly earned it said herries coolly miss tedder refuses to encourage this judas like conduct since she did not wish to pay the reward unless you were convicted and hanged ended angus laughing why don't you finish the sentence mrs mountford i am quite aware that my cousin was only too anxious to have my neck stretched provided she got the money elspeth would have burst into indignant speech but herries laid a reproving hand on her arm gowrie grumbled judas ye ca' me ye jade o' nineveh yon great city and a' for askin' for ma ain you betrayed your son in law said mrs mountford aye kenning weel i cud save the laddie's neck so miss tedder guessed and so she will not pay the reward i'll county court the hizzy aye she'll pay doon the siller or jailed she shall be for a bleezin' slut o' tophet mr herries the lady in black appealed to angus i must really ask you to stop this man talking well mrs mountford you can hardly expect me to do that when you come here calmly to regret that i was not hanged send her away said elspeth angrily peace said mrs mountford with severity then addressed herself to herries believe me i regret that maud should have conducted herself in such a way but love is a short madness as the latin grammar says and miss tedder is in love with captain kyles he i truly believe loves her for the money she once had and will not return to her side unless she recovers her fortune i see said angus coolly and you come here to ask me to give up the fortune so that she may marry kyles i must say that is an impertinent request hear me out mr herries i love maud she has her faults and she has i admit behaved badly all the same she has her good points and you must remember that she was so to speak under the thumb of this adventurer kyles maud only wished you hanged to save him but kyles wanted to save me said herries puzzled at least dr browne told me ah that was acting on captain kyles' part said mrs mountford contemptuously he wanted to see you hanged so that the question of the assassination should be settled maud was quite willing that this should be so provided she married him ah mr herries you must forgive maud she loves so much even to hanging me a nice foundation for a marriage i must say it is infamous talking in this way cried elspeth who was white with indignation what can ye expect frae a wumon wha wull nae dischairge her lawful indebtedness the fair sex they ca' ye the unfair limmers ye are the hail clamjamfarry adaam wis respectable beside eve the cutty wi' her stolen fruit and nae clothing herries began to laugh the extreme humour of mrs mountford although quite unconscious appealed to him and the indignation of gowrie was not less amusing everyone had his or her own axe to grind as the saying goes and each was ready to sacrifice everyone and anyone to get what he or she wanted it was a gilbert and sullivan opera without music come mrs mountford said angus suddenly becoming serious tell me what you want i want you to have captain kyles arrested why because i am quite sure that he murdered sir simon impossible i understood that you declared he was with maud at the hall on the night of the murder i said that at maud's request confessed mrs mountford with a blush indeed i have given in too much to her and for doing so i ask your pardon mr herries you would have let him be hanged cried elspeth indignantly no indeed no mrs herries had maud persisted in her mad intention of incriminating your husband i should have come forward at the trial to denounce the real murderer captain kyles can you prove that he is guilty asked angus quickly i can prove nothing but i know that sir simon wrote a letter to captain kyles at mr ritson's office asking for a meeting at the 'marsh inn' and telling him that he had disinherited maud because she insisted upon marrying him but maud herself said that the letter was written to seora guzman put in elspeth alas that is merely jealousy maud knows that captain kyles will marry seora guzman failing herself and so wishes to remove a rival from her path all love mrs herries all love humph said angus i must say that maud has a very pretty way of getting rid of people she was willing to hang me she is willing to hang seora guzman and all to marry the man who killed her father a nice person upon my word a cutty a slut a jade said gowrie wrathfully maud doesn't know that captain kyles killed her father said mrs mountford but she knew as i do that he was at the inn on the night of the crime he was the gentleman expected by sir simon on the authority of the letter which captain kyles showed to maud and about which maud spoke to me yes then my cousin must have a shrewd idea that kyles is guilty said herries however we can talk of the ethics of maud later where is captain kyles now at the hall no he is at the 'marsh inn' stopping there in fact he wrote to maud saying that he was putting up there for a week did he explain his reason no he simply said that he was there and would see her before he returned to the 'tarabacca' which is still at pierside with seora guzman on board i suppose so but i want you mr herries to have captain kyles arrested and his guilt proved then you can give maud a sum of money and i'll take her to the colonies there to begin a new life i shall certainly see kyles and have him arrested if possible said herries but i am not quite certain about giving maud money in the first place i am penniless myself you will be rich when captain kyles is condemned not sufficiently so to pay maud an income for behaving in so wicked a way i wonder you have the face to ask me mrs mountford i love her in spite of her faults pleaded the ex governess and then her dignity broke down and she began to cry i know she is wicked and has been led astray by captain kyles but i brought her up from the cradle and am attached to an' muckle creedit does the lassie dae ye cried gowrie angrily mr herries said mrs mountford wiping her eyes and taking no notice of the tutor what will you do nothing at present i am sorry mrs mountford for i recognise your good heart but maud is too bad later we can speak of this you can go mrs mountford the ex governess with all her stiffness taken out of her rose and walked limply to the door without a word she vanished and the three left alone stared at one another gowrie opened his mouth elspeth would have spoken but herries master of the situation held up his hand not a word from either of you he said gowrie you must take up your quarters at the 'marsh inn' and let me know what kyles is up to why not yersel' laddie he would suspect me he won't suspect you you can go to morrow and what will you do angus asked elspeth i'll go to pierside and interview seora guzman do you believe that captain kyles is guilty angus no your father heard a woman moving about in the darkness i would not be surprised to learn that the woman was mrs mountford herself i can account in no other way for her preposterous behaviour chapter xx at the marsh inn the rev michael gowrie was not averse to visiting the marsh inn again as he was well known there and posed as a fireside king certainly mrs narby had refused to receive him again after the desertion of elspeth but now that she knew gowrie was the father in law of a wealthy man she would probably change her tune moreover the old tutor saw that it was necessary to discover the assassin of sir simon if the money was to be fingered by himself for if herries did not fulfil the conditions of the will and bring the murderer to justice he could not inherit the fortune in which case mr gowrie would not reap the reward he hoped to gain for letting elspeth marry the man the golden apple which gowrie longed to pluck was yet beyond his reach therefore he returned to the marsh inn the next day and was sourly welcomed by the landlady indeed she still showed a disposition to keep him out of doors but gowrie having five pounds in his purse he had procured the same from browne for business purposes flashed his gold in her eyes and spoke largely ye can gie me the best bedroom an' the parlour said he with the air of a millionaire and see that the cooking be gude and the drink plentiful the lean days are gane and noo come in the fat years o' merry making an aboot time i'm theenking mrs narby was still sore that elspeth should have defied her and departed also she was not pleased that her former drudge should have married a man worth fifty thousand a year ritson while informing the press that herries had got the money had for obvious reasons suppressed the fact that he had a duty to perform before getting the cash therefore mrs narby was extremely jealous of elspeth and nothing would have given her greater pleasure than to have scratched her face and pulled her hair but mrs herries was beyond the reach of her malice and the father of mrs herries had money galore it was worth while to transfer that money from his pocket into hers she therefore smoothed her sour face and softened her raucous voice which was as hoarse as the note of a starling in her desire to propitiate gowrie she even curtseyed i am very glad t' see you sir croaked mrs narby with a greedy eye on the gold which gowrie held in his hand jes like ole times ain't it you an' me an' ow's yer daughter me dear friend revellin' in silks an' satins an jewels of price replied gowrie carelessly there's naethin' ower gude for the lassie ho yelped mrs narby almost suffocated with rage it is a chainge mr gowrie ain't it i thought she'd be a gallows widder ye're nae paid tae theenk retorted gowrie with his grand air gae spin ye jade and bring me th' flowin' bowl th' which tommy moore sang aboot y' must pay me a'ead an' hoo muckle for the bedroom an' the' parlour there ain't no parlour capting kyles 'as thet and th' bedroom es the old gent wos a murdered in but y' kin 'ave the room es yer son in law slep' in boar' an' lodgin' added mrs narby glibly two quid a week in advance hoots ye're demented woman twa pun' says she the deil tak her for a greedy glede nae nae ye'll nae pairt a scotchmon frae his siller sae easily i'll gie ye haulf a croon a nicht for ma room and pay ma victuals as i gang capting kyles guy me three quid said mrs narby sullenly the mair fule he weel tak it or e'en leave it i'm nae verra carein' tae stap in a butt an' a ben o' this sort i joost cam' here tae show ye i wisnae prood or puffed up by mae prosperity for th' sake o' auld lang syne as ye micht pit it and nae lee you can stop at that price by the daiy said mrs narby after some reflection but there's a lot of fellers come 'ere to stop 'cos of thet there murder if i gets a better lodger out y' goes this just suited gowrie as he knew that mrs narby was bluffing no one would stop at the marsh inn while the season was so wet notwithstanding the attraction of the murder what captain kyles was doing in such a damp locality he could not think unless indeed the captain was trying to hide his tracks in the affair of the murder always supposing that he was guilty gowrie was not sure of this in spite of mrs mountford's accusation nor did he believe the rash statement of herries that mrs mountford herself had committed the crime but if she was innocent and kyles was not guilty who had killed the old man this was what gowrie wished to learn and he soon saw that he had set himself a very difficult task weel said he when mrs narby gave her decision we'll close on those terrums i'll tack ma room by the nicht an ma board by the day there's haulf a croon in advaunce an' dinna waste it where's yon gowk o' a pope my son's in londing and i'll thenk y' not t' call 'im names said mrs narby hotly he's a genius and 'ave gone to git 'is poetry inter print so there an' wha's gain' tae publish his doggrel 'imself snapped the landlady sulkily an' where's the siller comin' frae mrs narby put her arms akimbo in her favourite attitude and stormed in her old style i guve it 'im d'y' see she cried furiously y' think i carn't do wot i likes with m' own me an' narby 'ave come in for a legacy and we're a goin' t' giv h'up th' inn an' go t' th' staits where narby wos reared pope's comin' too arter he 'as 'is verse brought h'out so there an' i don' want any of yer sauce though yer are the father in lawr of thet cove es murdered sir simon es i believe he did wumon don't call me naimes or i'll scretch th' h'eyes h'out o' yer 'ead an' there's allus callin' in the kitching and mrs narby hurried away leaving gowrie full of thought he obtained a glass of whisky from alice the miserable maid of all work who had stepped into elspeth's place and sat down on the tap room settle to smoke and think outside the rain was falling heavily and there was the usual grey mist over the marshes but the room was warm and the fire burned brightly mr gowrie approved of the whisky and the pipe soothed his nerves which had been rather upset by mrs narby's sudden wrath with his glass in his gouty old hand and his pipe in his mouth he sat staring at the driftwood fire thinking a lot after the fashion of the celebrated parrot two things struck him as strange first that mrs narby should have so suddenly lost her temper with a man whom she apparently desired to propitiate and second that she or narby should have so unexpectedly inherited a legacy if she really had money it was quite natural that she should have let pope go to london to publish his poetry for the virago adored her son even though she did not understand his writing but where had mrs narby got that money gowrie in his frequent visits had learned a lot about narby's past life in the states but he had never heard that the anglo american expected a legacy indeed mrs narby on one occasion had said that neither herself nor her husband were bothered with relatives it was queer that the money should come to them so suddenly and from an unknown source equally queer that the pair should decide to seek america and give up the inn certainly the inn had been doing better business than ever since the murder owing to the morbid curiosity of visitors so it was odd to say the least of it that at such a moment a money making concern should be given up aye meditated gowrie sipping his drink i mind now th' auld mon hed siller wi' him es yon lawyer body tauld kind twa thoosand aye a couple o' hundreds in gold an' one thoosand eight hundred in notes bank o' england nae doot hoots they wudnae gang wi' only twa hundred in gold an' they darenae cash the notes aye the ways o' transgressors are haird these thoughts revealed plainly that mr gowrie suspected mrs narby of having killed sir simon either with or without the connivance of her husband in order to get the money the gold she had used to send pope to london and doubtless had supplied him with a sum to publish his verse but the notes owing to the warning of the numbers being kept having been given in the newspapers had not been presented the desire to go at once to the states was thus explained mrs narby and possibly her husband were flying from justice gowrie was certain that she had killed the old man as he remembered the swish of a woman's dress which he had heard in the darkness there was a sound about that which a keen eared man like himself could not mistake and then she knew that herries was drugged thought gowrie and so implicated him in the crime by placing the razor on his quilt and smearing his sleeve with blood then she found the pocket book under the bed where no doubt she placed it those who hide find i see now that she is guilty the money carried by sir simon was too tempting for her she must have hidden the notes somewhere if i could only find them i would soon have her in charge this being gowrie's belief he made up his mind to stop at the inn until he could unearth the notes and meanwhile he kept a jealous watch on mrs narby's every action she became aware of his scrutiny and strange to say in so masculine a woman became panic struck it was with the greatest difficulty that she preserved her composure towards him during the afternoon and when it was growing dark she broke down entirely why do you 'ave yer h'eye on me she inquired angrily i ain't got 'orns a growin' h'out of me 'ead 'ave i nae nae but ye mind me of a sister o' mine lang syne deid she wos a sweet lassie rats retorted mrs narby going about her duties as usual but she bridled all the same being open to a compliment in spite of her resemblance to the witches in macbeth but after she had shown that she knew his eye was on her gowrie became much more circumspect and several times later when mrs narby looked she found that he was not staring in her direction consequently she recovered her spirits and nerve but gowrie was on her trail as she had to his mind given herself entirely away gowrie sat genial and warm in the tap room talking to anyone who came in and enjoying himself thoroughly alice the maid served the yokels with beer and mrs narby tore in and out of the room to keep an eye on what was doing but for the most part she remained in the back parts of the house and gowrie noticed that her dress was wet and her boots muddy as though she had been out in the rain more he noted that the mud she left on the tap room floor was red and remembered that there was earth of this peculiar hue down by the creek which ran past the bottom of the back garden attached to the marsh inn wondering what could take her down there and suspecting from her uneasy glances that she had something to conceal gowrie resolved to take the first opportunity to spy on her footsteps but she gave him no chance for quite a long time and then when the opportunity did occur he was momentarily withdrawn from his purpose by the entrance of captain bruce kyles who strode bluffly into the tap room looking more like a buccaneer than ever aye captain said gowrie genially it's you is it kyles stared at the fiery faced old man with narrowing eyes i don't think i've met you before he remarked maybe but there's mair knows tom fool nor tom fool knows ye ken kyles shrugged his shoulders and was passing on to the parlour when the next remark of gowrie arrested his steps aye ye'll be a freend o' miss tedder maud they ca' her like the bonny wench in tennyson's poem th' which canna compare wi' robbie burns the captain wheeled round sharply and brought his heels together with a click plainly he was startled by this speech and not pleased as was evident from the flaming glance he sent in gowrie's direction i have seen you before he said abruptly aye said gowrie placidly but making a shot in the dark at mirk midnicht when the fiends o' gory bluid were abroad in this very inn nae sae lang ago what the devil do you mean i never stopped at this inn before then where did ye see me sir in the court during the trial of young herries eh then ye were there i was though i don't see what it is to you weel weel i wis leukin' for ye but didnae see ye what did you want with me asked kyles fiercely joost tae hae a crack what about hoots it's a lang story and i'm gey dry this was an intimation that the captain should replenish mr gowrie's empty glass but kyles did not take the hint instead of answering he stared gloomily at the old man and seemed to be thinking deeply presently his face cleared and he stopped pulling his long black moustache later on you can come to my parlour and have a talk he said brightly just now i have to see to something before i sit down to my dinner aye murmured the old scamp to himself when kyles vanished once more into the night it's a guilty conscience i'm theenking i wunner noo if the mon wis in the inn as mistress mountford says she's got a liar's eye has yon limmer and yet yon hint o' a meetin' at midnicht seemed tae startle the black avised laddie will ye walk intae mae parlour says he maybe i will but ye'll nae devour me ye spider dods but there's mair in this nor talk i'm of opeenion hech but i'll pit mae best fut foremaist and get on the windy side o' the man he's nae gangin' tae get the upper hand o' michael gowrie maister o' arts i'll joost bide ma time this he did and while waiting for the return of the buccaneer he partook largely of whisky so that in an hour he was in a gloriously talkative mood kyles did not return and gowrie fancied that the buccaneer conscience stricken had levanted this being his belief he waited for another hour and then when it was close upon seven o'clock he rose and stretched himself i'll joost tak a dander roond he informed the casual guests who had dropped in to drink and talk aye there's nae mair fervid admirer o' the warks of nature nor me but i doot if ye puir tillers o' the soil wud unnerstan' the grand thochts which come tae me when gazing at the glorious firmament there's a wully shakespeare spoiled in me i doot aye the drink the drink auld nick's broth tae catch unwary mortals with this final speech which was greek to the staring countrymen he strolled forth by the front door into the street to look at the glorious firmament of which he had spoken but the same was veiled by mists and the night was extremely dark no one was about the wet roads not even armour the policeman so gowrie had every opportunity of doing that which he intended to do which was to stroll down to the red creek and see if possible what mrs narby had been doing there it may seem strange that gowrie should have been so suspicious of the landlady for she had given him little reason to doubt her but after his chat with herries and her mention of the legacy and her panic in dodging his eye he really thought that she had something to conceal then again the red mud on her boots perplexed him and aroused his curiosity how he proposed to see anything in the dark it was hard to say as he certainly could not trace the footsteps of the landlady when the night was so gloomy however he climbed over the low fence which parted the garden into which herries had dropped from the road and walked round to the back of the house the luck held good for the first thing he saw was a lantern dancing like a will o' the wisp at the lower ends of the grounds and just where the creek was as he knew very well it's the wumon hersel' murmured the spy feeling his wicked old heart beating loudly and what's she digging like a ghoul for he saw that she was digging for on creeping nearer the feeble light of the lantern showed mrs narby delving with a spade on the near shore of the creek so absorbed was she in her work that she did not hear the ponderous footsteps of gowrie he dropped to the earth near the hedge and watched while the rain fell upon him and made him shiver despite the whisky he had been drinking here he heard the lapping of the water and also strange to say a muffled beating some distance away in the fog which sounded like a giant heart throbbing mrs narby appeared to hear a noise also for suddenly it would seem she was stricken again with a panic fear and flinging down her spade she hurried back to the inn leaving the lantern on the ground but at the back door she hesitated then returned hastily and removed the light blowing it out as she went towards the house gowrie wondered at these strange and guilty proceedings aye she's the guilty limmer wha did the deed o' darkness said he heaving up his huge body from the mud noo i wonner what's she's hiding in the bosom of the univarsal mother it surely canna be her ain son that she's murdered he shivered at the thought then dismissed it nae nae it's her ill gotten gains the notes i'm of opeenion we'll hae a leuk the throbbing had stopped the door of the inn was closed and there was no sign of anyone lurking in the darkness gowrie stole forward trying to find the place where mrs narby had been digging suddenly he stumbled over a pile of fresh turned earth and came down on his hands if the notes were hereabouts they would certainly be in a box and with this idea in his head he groped with his hands in the hole for some time he was unsuccessful and his hands became caked with mud again and again he raked the earth but could feel nothing but the red moist clay the rain still continued to fall and he was soaked to the skin all the same he continued searching breathing heavily and occasionally muttering to himself in words which certainly did not invoke blessings on mrs narby's head unexpectedly a thin beam of electric light shot over his head and as he started in terror it was lowered until he knelt in a stream of radiance it came as he could dimly see from a boat on the low waters of the creek which was moving inshore from the deck he certainly could be seen easily and as he was about to rise and fly he heard an exclamation of surprise and a fierce oath all at once a man followed by two others sprang from the boat and made for the shore unnerved with whisky and by this strange experience gowrie rose to make for the inn but stumbled and fell again the next moment he was in the grasp of strong rough hands and in his terror natural enough under the circumstances he fainted chapter xxi on board the yacht being old and enfeebled by incessant doses of whisky gowrie remained unconscious for a long time how many hours had passed since he had been seized in the back garden of the marsh inn he did not know but when he opened his eyes and came to himself he found that he was in a luxuriously furnished room later when his brain became clearer and he was better able to take in his surroundings he perceived by the decorations of the place and from a certain heaving sensation that he was in the state room of a vessel from the ornate decorations and costly furniture it looked more like a boudoir than a cabin then he remembered what kind had reported concerning the splendours of the tarabacca and realised with some dismay that he was on board that very boat this belief was confirmed when he beheld seated before him captain bruce kyles in a gold laced uniform as gowrie struggled into a sitting position he had been dropped unconscious on the divan running round the cabin kyles whose brilliant black eyes were fixed mockingly on him laughed in a provoking manner he pointed to a bottle of whisky and a glass which stood on the table take a drink mr gowrie said the captain encouragingly and don't look so terrified i mean to do you no harm nae harrum quavered the old man trying to steady his shaken nerves are ye nae ashamed tae treat me sae what the deil dae ye mean many things mr gowrie and i would point out to you that blustering will not improve the situation you are in my power aye but this is a law abiding country and oh captain kyles shrugged his shoulders the law has no power on board this craft i am the law ye're a scotchmon and thereby a subject o' his mawjesty edward first o' scotland for never wull i ca' him seeventh o' yon kingdom and as a subject o' edward o' scotland aforesaid i command ye tae pit me ashore and pay me siller for moral damages like old kruger eh said kyles pleasantly you're an old rip mr gowrie and i'm going to bring you to book in the name of your king i haven't got one i'm scotch by birth and name cosmopolitan by choice i was the admiral of the indiana navy but since the revolution i am a wanderer on the face of the earth aye gowrie unconsciously stretched for the drink and filled himself a full glass we're beginning tae unnerstan the seetuation my mon yer a gipsy o' sorts a gipsy of the sea an' a black hearted villain at that you'll find me so if you don't keep a civil tongue in your head mr gowrie permit me to remind you that you are drinking my whisky and therefore cannot afford to vilify your host i'm here against ma wull yes and here you will stop until you give me certain information regarding the murder of sir simon tedder i ken naethin' said the old man sullenly aye but ye ken muckle mocked kyles i can talk the scottice tongue as well as you sir you said at the 'marsh inn' that you wanted to have a crack so i brought you here to have it then ye kidnapped me wi' intention captain kyles nodded carelessly produced a cigarette and swung back in his chair as he lighted it from what you hinted at the inn i saw that you were poking your nose into matters which do not concern you aye but ma son in law quite so mr gowrie you are playing his hand and i am swinging on my own hook when i left the tap room on business promising to return i intended to bring the motor launch up the creek and collar you she was lying in the river on the other side of the station having brought me from this ship and am i at pierside near the wharf asked gowrie thinking he could escape if he was in touch with mother earth no you are on board my yacht and she is swinging at anchor off tarhaven if you go on deck you'll be able to see the lights of the town a quarter of a mile away i'll gie the alarrum and gowrie rose unsteadily kyles made a long arm and pushed him back on to the divan sit tight said kyles and drink your whisky you'll need it before i've done with you ye mean tae do an auld mon harrum not unless the old man is obstinate see here kyles flung away the cigarette and placing his arms on the table talked coldly and slowly after the hint you gave me at the inn i intended to kidnap you failing anything else i would have rushed the inn but you saved me the trouble by coming to dig in the garden now then mr gowrie from what i have gathered at the inquest and the trial and from sources which you need not be told about i always thought you were a proper old scoundrel when we spoke in the inn i knew you at once although it suited my book to pretend ignorance i have long wanted to get a hold of you to hear exactly what you saw and heard in the tap room on the night of sir simon's murder but added the captain with emphasis i did not think to find in you the assassin of that old man gowrie's remaining gray hairs rose straight on end and he gasped me mel is it o' me ye talk of you of your very own self as the children say retorted kyles coolly look over there gowrie quite bewildered with the accusation brought against him glanced towards the end of the cabin which was in semi darkness kyles leaning back switched on an electric and then the prisoner as he truly was saw a black tin box of no great size covered with moist red earth you were digging that up said the captain after your crime you buried it on the shore of the red creek and returned to the inn when you thought that all was safe so as to get the notes notes screeched gowrie rising in great excitement as if you didn't know replied the captain contemptuously yes the notes to the value of one thousand eight hundred pounds which you thieved from the pocket book of sir simon after you had cut his throat that's a lee a lee i'll hae ye in court for libel nae less pooh if you didn't hide the notes how came you to be digging them up after you fainted i had you bundled on board the launch and then searched for myself i found that box very speedily and on opening it on the way back here i discovered the notes but the gold is gone the gold two hundred pounds worth what have you done with it naething i hadnae one shullin' o' they sovereigns kyles rose and stood over the shrinking old man menacing and dark and with a fierce expression on his swart face mr gowrie he said very distinctly no one knows that you have been kidnapped as no one saw the launch come up the creek and i dare swear that you didn't tell anyone when you came to look up your cache you are here in my power and there's nothing whatever to prevent me from dropping you overboard with a shot at your heels gowrie now truly frightened grovelled with a cry of alarm nae nae dinna dae that i ken naethin' aboot the siller i never saw yon box until the noo and i have nae set eyes on they notes you liar it's the truth ye ca' me a murderer what then dae ye ca' mistress narby wha acted the pairt o' jael mrs narby ejaculated kyles with a start and a frown aye mumbled gowrie she brocht forth butter in a lordly dish an gie him milk tae drink foreby it wis a chop an' beer then the limmer for want o' a hammer an' a nail cut the auld mon's windpipe is this true kyles seized gowrie by the throat fiercely augh augh choked the tutor grasping at the hands which clutched him ask her yersel captain kyles loosened his grip and walked up and down the long cabin while gowrie drank more liquor to restore his courage and truly he needed all the courage he possessed for the position he was in terrified him not a little kyles was evidently a lawless man and as no one knew that he gowrie had been kidnapped he could be put away in the manner described by the captain very easily fondling the glass and looking as dismal as a sick monkey gowrie shivered and quailed at every glance of the captain's fierce eyes finally after a short silence kyles returned to the side of the table opposite to gowrie see here said he striking the table with his closed fist these notes and that gold belong to me aye i ken you wis expected by sir simon on that nicht how do you know that the lawyer body told sweetlips kind how sir simon had written a letter to you on the 'tarabacca' the which is this boat but how did ritson know that the letter was addressed to me it's a lang story then you tell it or by heaven over the side you go i have too much at stake to waste time on your babbling mr gowrie i am aware that herries is free as he deserved to be for he is innocent but he and that cheap jack and the lawyer and the doctor all think that i am guilty and should they discover certain things i may be arrested then ye are guilty asked gowrie shrinking no would i have accused you were i guilty would the notes have been buried in that back garden were i guilty use a little common sense man and tell me what herries and co are doing i'm not going to be laid by the heels if i can help it and i want that money he pointed to the box ye have it ye have it and much good it will do me if it was in gold i would put you in a boat and steam away south at once but those are notes mr gowrie and the number of every note is in the possession of the police did i present those notes i would be but ye can defend yourself i'm not so sure of that there are certain circumstances then ye were in the inn on that night are you here to question me said kyles fiercely just you tell me what is doing in this case so that i know where i stand or prepare to be thrown overboard if i tell ye all will ye let me go i might or i might not but if you speak the truth your life is safe until i leave these dangerous coasts i may have to keep you prisoner but you will be well treated come now kyles rapped on the table tell me all thus compelled gowrie shivering with dread related all that he knew concerning the case from the time of herries' arrest down to his digging in the garden in search of what mrs narby had hidden the captain kept his sinister eyes on the wrinkled old face before him and made sure that the tutor was speaking the truth gowrie never considered that he might be betraying herries to the enemy all he wanted was to save his life and escape from the gaze of those eyes which probed into his guilty old soul when he ended the captain flung himself back in the chair and laughed you old villain said he sneeringly no wonder i intend to keep you a prisoner what cried gowrie in dismay for the time being you have been so ready to betray your son in law that you would have no hesitation in betraying me you will stop here for how long captain kyles until the murderer of sir simon is arrested mistress narby perhaps it looks as though the woman was guilty and yet his brows wrinkled themselves perplexedly and he shook his head i do not quite see how to here he fell into a brown study see to do what ventured gowrie kyles turned and smiled that is my business do you think mr herries would come and see me on board this boat if i asked him i'll tack the message ma ain sel said gowrie eagerly i dare say you would replied the captain dryly but it doesn't suit my book to let you go on shore you might make capital out of this kidnapping i swear i wouldn't were i you it will do no good answer me a few questions mr gowrie where is mrs narby at the inn and her husband her son pope's in london getting his poetry published but i don't know where the husband is humph i notice mr gowrie that you waver between scotch and english according to the state of your feelings i assure you that now i know what i know you are quite safe take another drink kyles pushed the bottle in the old man's direction and what's more if i get this money he glanced towards the box i'll pay you well for the fright that you have had but hoo can ye get the siller asked gowrie reassured and again filling his glass herries will give me the equivalent of those notes he canna captain what with fifty thousand a year he does nae come in for the siller until he finds the murderer o' his uncle well said kyles coolly i may be able to help him there eh mon dive ye ken wha killed the auld mon i do said kyles nodding decisively and who gowrie was devoured by curiosity no no mr gowrie it is not yet the time to play my hand you are of opinion that mrs narby is guilty perhaps i struck the blow you gowrie almost shrieked and ye own it i would if i wanted to rejoined kyles calmly only let me get the two thousand which sir simon was about to pay me and which by an accursed accident slipped through my fingers and i don't mind confessing anything but the police they can't arrest me on board this boat and when once steam is up the 'tarabacca' will show a clean pair of heels until she drops anchor in south american waters but there may be an extradition treaty between indiana republic and great britain there is but i'm not going back to indiana the president seor guzman who was my friend has been kicked out and his enemy is in power of all his wealth and mine this yacht only remains i came to england to get money and nae tae purchase war ships pooh that was a blind however to make a long story short seor guzman is waiting for me and his daughter in a certain spot in south america which does not concern you from that place we start out to find the treasure of manco capac but to do so i wanted money and two thousand is the least i can do with indeed said kyles biting his fingers i fancy i'll ask herries to double the sum he can easily spare it out of fifty thousand a year when he gets the siller he'll get it right enough after an interview with me said kyles carelessly and now we'll retire mr gowrie and i'll inform you of my plans to bring herries on board to morrow but i thocht he wis on board said gowrie perplexed when he sent me tae spy oot the land at the 'marsh inn' he wis ganging tae pierside to see seora guzman miss tedder accuses her o' the crime the devil she does then i can tell you it's a lie cried kyles his dark face flushing seora guzman has nothing to do with these things as to herries i daresay he went to pierside but this boat left there early this morning however that makes things easier seora guzman will invite him on board and explain that she is entirely innocent and will you confess your guilt captain i never said that i was guilty retorted kyles dryly don't jump to conclusions gowrie miss tedder accuses seora guzman aye and mistress mountford accuses you indeed and you accuse mrs narby there's a devilish lot of females in this case well mr gowrie and which person do you think guilty mrs narby then you exonerate me weel said gowrie perplexedly ye speak sae queerly quite so said kyles cutting him short you evidently know nothing mr gowrie i tauld ye sae said the sage triumphantly did you see anything when you slept in the tap room naething said gowrie in a brazen manner and when you went upstairs as you confessed at the trial i didnae confess that i said that i drugged herries' drink tae give him a sleep humph i should scarcely think that you were so philanthropic but you were up the stairs hoo d'y' ken asked gowrie swiftly ah that's my secret i know more about your movements on that night than you think then you were at the inn ye climbed in at the window perhaps kyles thought for a moment and then laughed did you hear anything weel i heard the swish o' a wumon's dress in the darkness o' the stairs it sounded as going doon ah so you were up the stairs and in herries' room robbing him of his few shillings hoo d'y' ken asked gowrie once more i believe that you are the guilty person don't put all your money on that mr gowrie you might lose however you'll know all in good time say when i get that four thousand pounds by exchanging those notes with herries there's no two thoosand yonder no i intend to have double as i said come now you write a note to herries asking him to come to morrow evening to the 'marsh inn' i'll meet him there and arrange matters but he'll nae come he will if you write the letter to trap him come now and mr michael gowrie had to do what he was told but ye'll gang tae the pit of tophet for this said mr gowrie viciously chapter xxii another mystery as guessed by captain kyles herries' visit to pierside had been unproductive of result on arriving there he found that the yacht had left for an unknown destination and returned to tarhaven quite certain that seora guzman and the buccaneer had left england for good this was a great disappointment to the young man as he did not see how the mystery of sir simon's death was to be explained without getting the evidence of the mexican lady he came back to tell browne and to consult with sweetlips kind the doctor recommended patience and a visit to the marsh inn so as to see what gowrie was doing browne quite believed that the pair connected with the tarabacca knew much but he felt certain that gowrie knew more than he chose to tell herries and browne argued over the matter until a late hour and resumed their talk when they met at breakfast then browne departed to see his patients and herries went to look for kind but the cheap jack was not at the humble little place where he and his wife had put up during the trial since they had left the caravan at anderfield in buckinghamshire and herries thought that they also had gone leaving him to his own devices perhaps they thought that they had done enough in return for his saving of mrs kind's life and he could not blame them for looking after their own affairs for some time herries contemplated walking to the moated hall and see what maud had to say but on reflection he decided to wait for the return of gowrie from the inn it might be that something important was transpiring there elspeth met him at the door of the doctor's house when he came back to luncheon having practically wasted a morning angus she said eagerly here are two letters one is in papa's writing and the other has been written by sweetlips herries went into the drawing room and opened the letters the one from kind was merely a short intimation that he had met captain kyles early that very morning and from certain facts which he had learned from him he had gone to london on business i'll be back in a couple of days ended the note and then will call and tell you all about it good said herries throwing this aside then kyles is still in england and in tarhaven said elspeth who had been reading over his shoulder i should not be at all surprised angus if he had anchored the 'tarabacca' in this port nor should i however we can easily ascertain that fact meanwhile let us see what your father has been doing and he opened the second letter while he read it his wife glanced at the envelope i see that your father asks me to come to the 'marsh inn' this afternoon said the young man rapidly reading the few lines he has so he says discovered something important strange murmured elspeth to herself and taking no notice what is strange this envelope has not the desleigh post mark on it herries examined the envelope in his turn it must have been posted in tarhaven it has that post mark on it at all events i expect your father sent it here by hand to be posted no there is a stamp on the envelope if papa intended to send it to you by hand he would not have wasted a stamp they both thought this strange and tried to puzzle out the reason but could arrive at no conclusion i'll ask your father what it means when i see him said herries placing both letters in his pocket what train can i catch elspeth an examination of the time table showed that he could not get a train to desleigh for an hour so meanwhile angus ate some luncheon and possessed his soul in patience i don't like your going to the 'marsh inn' after what has occurred angus said elspeth uneasily mrs narby will make herself disagreeable herries laughed scornfully what does that matter i am not afraid of mrs narby or of a dozen like her besides i have an idea of how to tame that virago in what way i'll tell her that i intend to bring an action against her for telling lies about me but can you perhaps i cannot but the threat will serve to keep mrs narby's tongue quiet by the way elspeth i must look up armour while i am at desleigh and ask if he has moved in the matter of his kidnapping by the tarabacca sailors oh said elspeth suddenly i knew that i had something to tell you angus dr browne's housekeeper has lived in tarhaven for the last twenty years and knows everyone really dear the young man laughed that information doesn't give me any pleasure no but listen she was a servant at your uncle's place for some time and says that mrs armour was a servant there also herries shrugged his shoulders that is quite possible all the same i don't think that it matters much what do you mean well said mrs herries thoughtfully mrs armour knows maud very well she was her nurse for some time i believe i wonder if armour was kidnapped because his wife had been maud's nurse my dear herries took her in his arms you see a bird in every bush as this case has got on your nerves i don't see the least connection between armour's kidnapping and mrs armour's early employment i agree with seora guzman and believe that the kidnapping was a political affair in what way well you see seora guzman is the daughter of the ex president of indiana and with kyles as the commander of their tin pot navy she came home to get war ships so as to regain possession of the republic if possible naturally the new president not wanting a civil war must have sent emissaries to thwart this scheme sir simon was mixed up in it and possibly these emissaries would keep an eye on him one might have followed him to the 'marsh inn' and kyles who was no doubt going to meet sir simon there on political business must have told his sailors to get rid of any suspicious looking person from indiana consequently armour by taking up his position near the inn laid himself open to suspicion and was promptly removed it might be so but then you know the meeting was to bribe captain kyles to leave maud kyles would not give his sailors the true reason replied herries leaving the table good bye elspeth i'm off do take care of yourself darling she pleaded of course he kissed her but you need have no fear the luck has changed since our marriage elspeth felt that this was so as she stood watching him from the window assuredly her heart was light enough and she had no premonition of evil perhaps after all their separate bad lucks had combined to form one good one as herries fancifully imagined yet she dreaded to think that anything should happen to destroy the new and wonderful life which was now hers and went to her room to pray earnestly that angus might be successful in his mission but what was his mission angus did not know very well himself as the train steamed towards desleigh it seemed to him that he could do very little towards elucidating the mystery of his uncle's death he was ignorant of all things since he had been asleep during the commission of the crime but gowrie might have learned something and herries privately suspected that gowrie had been wide awake all that eventful night also since he had been wandering over the house he might have chanced on some suspicious circumstances at all events the old man had evidently found out something when he sent so peremptory a note it was therefore with great surprise that herries on arriving at the inn was met with the news that gowrie was not within where is he he asked the new maid alice who gave him this information in the well known tap room i can't tell you sir she replied timidly he went out last night just before dinner and never came back strange herries recalled the omitted desleigh post mark and felt uneasy can i see mrs narby missus have gone to london to see her son and the landlord he's in london too seeing about selling the inn said alice glibly selling the inn yes sir master and missus are going to america the deuce they are murmured herries rather perplexed now what does that mean i wish i could find gowrie i wonder if he has been kidnapped also he added smiling and little knew how near he was to the truth well i'd better utilize the time at my disposal and call on armour and he turned away the next words of alice arrested him please sir won't you see the lady sir she's in the parlour waiting for you a lady who is she oh the most beautiful lady you ever set eyes on she came here an hour ago and said that she wanted to see you sir mr herries yes sir and i know you're mr herries 'cos i saw you when you was arrested for there there interrupted the young man wincing for he did not like to be reminded of that ugly episode take me to the lady i expect it's seora guzman or maud the stuffy parlour looked a duller apartment than ever as herries opened the door and stepped in he half expected to see maud but instead faced a tall lady with the look of a queen who rose and smiled as he entered from the description given by kind angus had no doubt but what this was the daughter of the indiana ex president how do you do mr herries she said in excellent english you are surprised to meet me here instead of your father in law what you know i know that mr gowrie wrote you a letter asking you to come to this place said seora guzman composedly then you know where he is i do can you tell me not at present she interrupted but later you shall know everything mr herries about the murder he asked looking at her in a penetrating manner and trying to read her thoughts certainly the time is coming when all that is mysterious will be made plain to you but added donna maria with emphasis you will have to pay for your knowledge ah herries was quite cool i thought the element of money would come into the matter and how much say four thousand pounds herries laughed my dear lady i don't possess as many pence not at present but you will when certain information is given to you i have read the papers mr herries and i know that you inherit fifty thousand a year on certain conditions ah but those conditions were not mentioned in the newspapers quite so rejoined seora guzman resuming her seat but we learned the conditions from another person we myself and captain kyles i have no wish said herries slowly to ask impertinent questions madame but i should like to know if you and captain kyles are in partnership seora guzman laughed in her turn you might put it that way she said resting her elbow on the shaky round table and her chin on the back of her locked fingers captain kyles and myself intend to make our fortunes and then marry but maud maud she interrupted fiercely don't talk to me of that wicked girl or i shall lose my temper i only hope i won't tell her some painful truths when i see her are you going to see her to day and here seora guzman glanced at a bracelet watch in a quarter of an hour i wrote and asked her to come here why here because i want to see her in your presence but you don't mean to say that maud knows anything of on the contrary she knows a very great deal and has acted towards you mr herries in a most cruel manner oh i know that myself certainly there are some excuses seeing that she has lost a fortune it was in her power to retain it replied the mexican lady coolly but she would hover round a flame is the flame captain kyles why should you think so because maud was engaged to him and donna maria seemed determined to give herries no chance of finishing a single sentence she was engaged for certain reasons but captain kyles will marry no one but me then don't you think that he has acted very badly towards maud what do you think yourself she asked irrelevantly herries thought for a few moments i know that my cousin has not acted well he said hesitatingly all the same this unfortunate engagement with captain kyles and one which you admit seora he never intended to fulfil may have driven her into courses which in more unemotional moments she would not have entered into i must say mr herries that for a wronged man you are generous i have had much trouble in my life said angus simply and it has taught me to judge no one i think you are a good man said seora guzman looking at him in a softened manner all the better captain kyles and myself will have all the more pleasure in placing you in possession of your property then you know who killed my uncle i do not nor indeed does captain kyles still we can place certain evidence at your disposal which will go far towards solving the riddle but the price i am willing to pay the price four thousand pounds five if you wish it said herries frankly it is a small sum out of fifty thousand a year donna maria looked at him in silence for a moment then her proud lip quivered and she burst into tears herries was quite distressed when she laid her head down on her arms and wept as though her heart would break my dear lady i feel so ashamed she sobbed making it a condition that you should pay for what ought to be done without money you must think that i am an adventuress and a bad woman i think nothing said herries rather coldly for he did not know what this scene might mean because i know nothing mr herries she said raising her head and wiping her eyes with a dainty lace handkerchief you must not judge me too hardly i am the daughter of a man who held great power in indiana although i am a mexican by birth i was brought up to riches and honour and for years had everything i could wish for but an enemy of my father's intrigued against him and in a night he was driven from the presidential palace my mother was shot during the revolution and my father and myself escaped only with our lives thanks to the bravery of captain kyles we lived in exile for some time and fortunately escaped in the yacht which had belonged to the government the 'tarabacca' yes it is a splendid yacht it is all that remains of my father's wealth for the new government confiscated everything but my father learned from an indian of the whereabouts of a certain treasure in peru which had been hidden according to tradition by manco capac who first civilised the peruvian indians to get that treasure entails a long and toilsome journey and much money leaving my father concealed at lima captain kyles and myself came to this country to try and raise some money on indiana bonds we wanted the sum of two thousand or four thousand pounds so as to fit out an expedition and get this money this treasure unfortunately the new indiana government had been beforehand and we found that the bonds were useless then an accident introduced us to sir simon tedder and there was a chance that he might assist us but i understood that you came to buy war ships that was the excuse we gave out and for that reason we have been haunted by indiana emissaries who would take our lives if it was needful but we promised sir simon a share of the scarcely had she got this far when they heard the shrill scream of a woman in the tap room herries sprang from his chair and opened the door hurriedly when he and seora guzman walked hastily into the tap room they found maud tedder in the grasp of armour the policeman who was in plain clothes herries flung himself forward and threw the bulky man to one side how dare you touch a lady he said indignantly a lady said armour who had evidently been drinking if she's a lady let her pay me for having lost my position in the force through her visit don't listen to him don't listen to him whispered maud pale and trembling and clinging to herries i've been dismissed the force complained armour in a maundering tone and all on account of that there blamed murder and she he pointed a stumpy finger at miss tedder she knows summat about it she does it's a lie gasped maud shaking from head to foot while the eyes of seora guzman lighted up and she took an eager step forward oh raved the ex policeman while alice lost her head and flew out of doors shouting for help is it a lie that she he pointed again towards maud that she came to my house when i was on my rounds and made my wife betray me on the very night of the murder she was at my house and i came to see my old nurse gasped maud then what were you doing wandering about desleigh at midnight i got it out of my missus i did and you put them sailors on to me no no you did and i believe cried armour that you murdered your father your very own self chapter xxiii an explanation maud uttered a squeak like that of a trapped rabbit and clung to her cousin in a half fainting condition the startling accusation of the ex policeman came upon herries with the force of a bludgeon and his flesh crept as he felt maud's terrified grasp what if she were guilty after all what if she had but the thought was too horrible bad as the girl was in many ways vain frivolous cruel selfish she would never have killed the father who had loved her so greatly as it was she vehemently denied the accusation it's a he a lie she murmured trying to keep from fainting oh how dare you how here nature would have her way and maud sank unconscious on the ground armour continued his vociferations so herries gave the insensible girl to seora guzman who received her with reluctance and caught armour by the collar do you know what you are saying he demanded shaking the man in a fierce way how dare you accuse this young lady of well if she didn't do it who killed him asked the man in a sullen tone and beginning to see that he had gone too far it wasn't that herries chap i am herries you armour shook off the grasp and recoiled against the wall yes and you have no right to accuse my cousin she came as her companion mrs mountford knew this was a lie but herries wanted to save the miserable girl to see her old nurse and went out late at night my wife confessed it it was at this moment that alice returned followed by mrs armour after her first cry for help the servant had thought it best to go for the wife fortunately there were few people about and her feeble cry had gone unheeded also the tap room was empty a rare occurrence for the time being so when alice brought back mrs armour that woman ran into the room with a white face dreading lest her husband's tongue loosened by liquor should have wagged too freely you drunken beast she said advancing with brandished arms how dare you insult my young lady she killed her father grumbled armour but under his breath as the stern looks of herries and the presence of his wife cowed him not a little mrs armour uttered an indignant exclamation and placing her hand on his coat collar dragged him to the door it is quite false you fool he says that you told him said herries to the wife mrs armour pushed her husband outside and faced round i told him nothing of the sort he found out i don't know how that my young lady was at my house on the night of the murder and taxed me with it i confessed like a fool that she had been there and then he got it into his head that she set those sailors after him to get him kidnapped he thinks that he lost his position in the force through her which is quite wrong why didn't you come to the inquest and say that miss tedder was with you on the night asked herries sternly because she asked me not to i wouldn't have said a word even to armour but that he found out who are you sir i am miss tedder's cousin who was accused of the murder screeched mrs armour in surprise yes and if my cousin was here on that night she is innocent innocent i swear interrupted the woman in great agitation she only came to the inn oh she was here was she in the house no yes that is i tell you sir she is innocent cried mrs armour at her wits' end she only came to see me i'm her old nurse sir don't you believe what armour says he's drunk he doesn't know what mischief he is making miss tedder was in this house on the night of the murder about midnight she wanted to see her father and ask him not to take her lover from her sobbed mrs armour putting her apron to her eyes indeed she's as innocent as the sun sir but i'm ready to confess confess nothing interrupted the young man if my cousin has been indiscreet we'll put it that way i'll see that nothing comes of the matter but i'll come round and see you later to hear what you have to say meanwhile i'll question miss tedder where is she my lamb in the parlour with a lady she has fainted oh mrs armour was about to start towards the parlour when herries stopped her no go back to your husband take him home and get him sober if he dares to say another word about miss tedder i shall have him arrested yes yes i'll go i'll stop him speaking but oh sir mrs armour wheeled at the door with clasped hands believe me my young lady is innocent yes i believe that but i must hear what she has to say before exonerating her now go mrs armour fled like a hare and clutching her husband dragged him home scolding him all the way in a low vehement tone you fool you fool she muttered you'll ruin me you'll ruin yourself i didn't mean mumbled armour now growing sober and terrified for he really had scanty reason to say what he had said you didn't mean you born fool if this ends in a police court it will be the worse for us both my young lady is innocent but you have placed her in a most dangerous position you beast you ass you wretch but i'll trounce you i'll take it out of you and half dragged half driven armour was brought back to his home in the meanwhile herries gave alice a shilling to hold her tongue promising her more if she did not speak and especially not to mrs narby said herries impressively i'm fly said the small servant biting the shilling to see that it was a good one i don't tell her anything if i can help she hammers me too hard sir you poor little devil said herries pityingly when these things are settled we must see if we can get you a good home and so saying he patted the miserable alice on her head of tangled hair and walked into the parlour maud had revived as seora guzman had dashed water on her face with no gentle hand and was now standing at the end of the room looking at her with extreme aversion maud herself with all the spirit knocked out of her was seated at the table with her face hidden in her hands weeping silently badly as the girl had behaved her cousin could not help feeling sorry for her especially when she raised her small pathetic childish face he closed the door and came forward gravely well maud and what have you to say to this accusation nothing i'm sure i was very fond of poor pa she sobbed looking a woeful spectacle with her damp dress and tearful face no one was more sorry than i was when he was killed you were not sorry for me herries could not help remarking i thought you had killed pa what when you accused seora guzman of the crime to my wife the mexican lady started and her fine eyes flashed you accused me she said drawing herself up yes and i believe you did it said maud raising her head and darting a malignant look at her rival for the moment it looked as though donna maria would fling herself on her enemy but controlling her temper with a violent effort she laughed coldly of course such an accusation does not deserve any defence you were in the neighbourhood you set those men on armour cried maud viciously and rearranging her disordered dress oh i don't mind acknowledging that retorted seora guzman with a curling lip i have nothing to conceal i accompanied captain kyles from pierside in the launch and remained on board while he went up to see sir simon at this inn captain kyles told me that he suspected some emissary from the republic would spy on his movements and as he did not come back i sent up the sailors and told them to carry away anyone who happened to be lurking about the inn at so late an hour they saw armour the policeman sitting under the window of sir simon's room and thinking that he was waiting for captain kyles to descend in order to kill him for they took the policeman for an indiana spy they muffled his head in my shawl and carried him away to leave him in a ditch then they returned to the launch which was on the river on the other side of the railway line herries nodded this was exactly the explanation which he had given elspeth and he was delighted to see how accurate his forecast had been but there was another point which he wished to be cleared up at what time did captain kyles return to the launch she shrugged her fine shoulders i must leave captain kyles to tell you his own story mr herries all i wish to do at present is to show miss tedder that i am not afraid to confess my movements on that night it is lucky for her if she can do the same i was with mrs armour said maud quickly yet with a passing gleam of terror you were in this very house said herries sternly mrs armour told me so then she was with me she would not allow me to go alone i'll ask her about that myself said herries sitting down in the meanwhile you must confess everything you did on that night i shan't said maud setting her baby face in an obstinate frown then i shall tell the police she quivered at this and choked you would tell on me a woman your own cousin you never hesitated to tell about me said herries grimly that's different you are a man you can defend yourself not like poor little me i have enemies and she scowled at the mexican lady in a most venomous manner i am not afraid said seora guzman sitting down near the door you would like to kill me with a look and marry bruce but you will not oh no he will be my husband he'll be hanged aha you will accuse him miss tedder i make you my compliments on your delicate way of making love he loves me he doesn't love you oh but he does mademoiselle you mistake bruce is not fond of english babies this with a disdainful look at maud's childish face twisted with rage and grief ah you cat wait till i see him face to face he can't resist me he never loved you never never never seora guzman laughed again in the most irritating manner you will never see him face to face we go away he and i from this land of yours to south america there we shall be happy maud started to her feet he shan't go he won't go i'll tell the police i'll have him hanged i'll oh oh oh she appeared to be on the verge of a fit of hysterics when herries thinking this scene between the two women had gone far enough caught her by the arms and hurt her a trifle the pain made her cry out but it strung her up to overcoming the hysteria you brute said maud with a sob to strike a woman i did not strike you said herries very patiently and if i have hurt you i beg your pardon but you had better sit down quietly and tell me all you know i shan't then i can't protect you from the police you will tell no on second thoughts i shall not tell but armour will and if he does what is to become of you maud she saw her danger and made for the door as though to fly but herries brought her back sit down sit down he said soothingly believe me maud that badly as you have treated me i am still your friend your only friend and you need a friend observed seora guzman surveying the girl with coldly critical eyes you cat cried maud turning on her viciously then dropped into a chair with a sob oh heavens was there ever so unfortunate a creature as i am i've lost my money and my father and and your lover pray be silent seora said herries rather disgusted i will not she retorted fiercely why should i be silent when she tried to take my lover from me she knew that he was engaged to me she knew i didn't sobbed maud interrupting swiftly you did sir simon asked me to his house when we came to see him on business we bruce and myself i told you that i was engaged to be married and you you tried to get him away and i succeeded said maud with dismal triumph he made love to me he kissed me i know that he told me everything what he told you yes snapped the seora we wanted money heaps of money sir simon knew that we didn't want war ships but only money for this treasure expedition at first he would lend then he would not then since you were so shameless seora seora pleaded herries quite helpless between these two fierce creatures quarrelling over a man i must speak she cried loudly and striking the table with her gloved hand she must be told the truth for once in her silly vapid life she dares to pit herself against me the daughter of a house which has been famous for centuries she dares to compare her feeble washed out beauty with mine with mine ah she raised her arms with a proud gesture look at me look at you i tell you bruce would lay down his life for me he shall on the gallows panted maud viciously pah you little fool sneered the mexican woman with scorn you have been a catspaw to get the money i told bruce to make love to you to lead you on to twist you round his little finger and all to get the money was i wrong seeing how shamelessly you tried to steal my lover no she answered herself i was right bruce told sir simon that he would take you away sir simon forbade you to think of bruce you persisted and then he said he would cut you out of his will he wrote a letter to brace telling him that he had done so and asked him to meet him at this inn offering to bribe him to give you up you said seora guzman with an insulting laugh you for whom bruce cared nothing bruce said that he would take two thousand pounds more or less he hinted as much to sir simon and he came here with that amount of money then sir simon was murdered by captain kyles cried maud it is a lie said the woman striking the table again had he killed him he would have had the money and have sailed away but he did not kill him and so lost the money but i saw captain kyles at this inn said maud he was here i told you so but how came you to see him i was taking a walk before going to bed mrs armour was with me i saw captain kyles under the window where the red light shone the red light said herries involuntarily yes i there was a red light in the front room the window was open and captain kyles was looking up i understand said herries gravely sir simon hung a red handkerchief in front of a candle to serve as a signal well then i wanted to go up and see my father bruce had told me that papa wanted to bribe him to give me up and that he was going to meet him at the inn that was why i came i came by a late train and went to mrs armour who is my old nurse i implored her to help me since she knew mrs narby i wanted to get into the house and throw myself at my father's feet and implore him not to send bruce away mrs armour came and when we saw captain kyles under the window we stole round in the fog to the back door mrs armour knocked at mrs narby's bedroom window at the back in a peculiar way and mrs narby came to the back door she would not let me in at first but i offered her twenty pounds which i had brought with me then i went into the house and up the stairs in the darkness i saw a gleam of light under the door of the furthest room and then i heard deep breathing i grew afraid and ran down the stairs again i believe there was a man in the nearer room which was in darkness that was gowrie said herries he heard the swish of a woman's dress so it was you and you saw nothing nothing i ran out and asked mrs armour to take me back and hold her tongue i slept that night at her house as her husband was away and then went home by an early train mrs mountford let me into my home and no one knew that i had been away and when you heard that your father had been murdered i thought captain kyles had lost his temper and had killed him oh then you did not believe that it was me after all no i never knew that you were in the house but when i heard that you had been arrested i thought in any case that you would be hanged and so joined in the cry against you i wanted to save bruce wailed maud i see said herries horrified at this callous girl so you were willing to hang an innocent man and marry one whom you thought had murdered your father bruce did not murder sir simon put in seora guzman vehemently it is not true i came here mr herries to explain all i could and to ask you to come on board the yacht which is at tarhaven will i see captain kyles yes he wishes to see you about the money why should i pay the money you said you would said seora guzman vehemently and you will have to do so if you wish to get the fortune an evil light suddenly shone in maud's eyes as though the devil had whispered some delicious thought let me come also she said eagerly to seora guzman no we do not want you then i shall go straight back to tarhaven and tell the police all about myself and captain kyles you are afraid i am not but maud looked cunning and snarled i am desperate you shan't come she shall said herries in a peremptory manner i want everyone to be present at the clearing up of this affair not a word seora miss tedder comes with me or i don't set foot on the yacht seora guzman shrugged her shoulders very good she said insolently bring her if you like but i have said all so i will go when shall i come to the yacht captain kyles will let you know and she vanished chapter xxiv startling news herries brought maud back to the moated hall and delivered her into the hands of mrs mountford the girl recovered herself wonderfully on the journey but said very little all the time in the train she sat huddled in her corner of the compartment and eyed angus in a most spiteful manner her cousin saw the look and wondered what was in her mind had he known he might not have pitied her as he did as it was he felt truly sorry for the miserable girl by her own foolishness she had forfeited a fortune she had been deserted by the man whom she had striven to take from another woman and had lost her father by a violent death had not maud troubled her head over the buccaneer's good looks her father would never have made a second will he would never have gone to the marsh inn to meet his death for all the terrible things that had happened maud had only herself to blame yet she talked of fate and bemoaned herself as the most unfortunate creature in the world many people cheat themselves in the same way however mrs mountford saw that she was really getting ill and that her nerves were in a terribly excited state she therefore sent her at once to bed when herries brought her back and remained alone in the drawing room with the young man i know that maud went to the 'marsh inn' in response to an invitation from seora guzman she said gravely but i did not expect that you would bring her back mr herries i was there also he replied quietly i went to meet mr gowrie and found seora guzman instead maud got into trouble with that woman with armour the policeman who said that maud had been at desleigh on the night her father was murdered mrs mountford turned pale surely you do not believe that wild statement mr herries i have such good authority mrs mountford that i must whose authority that of maud herself unhappy girl what has she said i think you know what she said mrs mountford since you also knew that maud stopped with mrs armour on that night mrs armour is maud's old nurse said the ex governess with emotion and maud went to visit her without my permission maud said that you helped her no that is not true i would not have let maud out of my sight to pay such a visit and at so late an hour she certainly told me that sir simon was to meet captain kyles at the 'marsh inn' and then bribe him to give her up she wanted to go to desleigh and implore her father not to act in this way i said that she was not to go but she slipped out of the house and went i could do nothing save watch for her return and admit her secretly lest the servants should come to know of her mad visit what did she tell you when she returned asked herries curiously that she had stopped all night with mrs armour she did not inform you that she had been inside the 'marsh inn' no mrs mountford closed her eyes in horror impossible it is true maud went there to see her father mr herries mrs mountford rose and grasped the young man's arm i cannot believe that maud has anything to do with this crime why should you believe it said herries astonished at the emotion displayed in her usually solemn face tell me what you know and i'll explain herries hesitated but reflecting that mrs mountford could do no harm and that it was better to have her for a friend than an enemy at this juncture he told all that had taken place at the inn as he had heard it from maud herself at the conclusion mrs mountford drew a long breath of relief it is better than i expected she said nodding i must tell you mr herries to explain for the way in which maud has acted that she is not quite right in the head mad was the young man's startled exclamation not exactly mad she has no moral principles and if she does not get her own way will not hesitate even at a crime to get it her mother a frivolous foolish woman who came of a decayed family was the same maud at times is not responsible for her actions sir simon was devoted to her and therefore after maud's education was finished he kept me here to look after her i noticed that you had great power over maud the power of a strong mind over a weak one said mrs mountford in her deep voice yet at times maud is too difficult and cunning even for me to manage you know how she escaped and went to desleigh i dreaded lest she should meet her father for then mrs mountford hesitated would she have murdered him not deliberately but she would have fallen into a frenzy of rage and the first weapon to hand would have been used by her in these rages she goes what the norsemen called baresark and stops at nothing to gain her ends she loves this captain kyles so much that she would do anything to become his wife you know that she was quite ready to sacrifice you mr herries and seora guzman also said the young man rather startled at what he had heard since she accuses her wrongfully mrs mountford looked gravely at him i believe that captain kyles killed sir simon she said decisively and seora guzman may not be so innocent as you imagine the captain was certainly at the 'marsh inn' on that night since you say maud saw him looking up at the window wherein sir simon had placed his signal also seora guzman was in the neighbourhood and had that policeman kidnapped all these things look suspicious assented herries yet since kyles was willing to give up maud for whom he had no affection and since sir simon was willing to pay the price i do not see the motive for the commission of the crime it is strange what does captain kyles say himself i have not seen him yet to morrow however i am going on board the 'tarabacca' which lies off tarhaven quay out stream i believe then kyles will explain and maud is to come with me mrs mountford started to her feet impossible if she meets captain kyles face to face i don't know what would happen i'll look after her said herries who was determined that maud should be brought face to face with her lover so that everything should be cleared up in a proper manner i must know the truth as i want to enter into possession of my property kyles evidently can tell me who killed my uncle and i am going to see ritson as to getting four thousand pounds to bribe him into speaking the truth he deserves no money after the way in which he has treated maud i quite agree with you responded herries dryly but beggars cannot be choosers apparently kyles is the only man who can solve the mystery so he must be paid he will have to acknowledge himself guilty then said mrs mountford obstinately in which case he should be arrested certainly and i may tell you that i intend to give information to inspector trent as to my engagement to see kyles on board the yacht he will come later in the evening for i believe that the explanation will be given to morrow night if kyles is guilty he will be arrested but he won't confess unless he gets the money so i must enlist the services of ritson to procure it and take it on board i can get it back if your surmise is correct well said mrs mountford coldly i presume that will be the best way to settle the matter and mr herries she added giving him her hand i may tell you that i am glad you have got the money were maud in possession i would lose my influence over her and then god knows what would happen to so feather headed a creature she would be surrounded by flatterers and sycophants and would waste the money in excesses ending probably in an insane asylum but she is not mad i tell you she is at times said mrs mountford impatiently the germs of insanity are in her and it only needs great emotions to develop them into rank lunacy see what she was prepared to do in order to get captain kyles for a husband she is not safe she never will be safe and sir simon did not want her to marry no mr herries you get this money and make good use of it maud and myself will go abroad and live on her thousand a year you must let me add to that said herries shaking her hand in a hearty manner i believe that you are a good woman i have had great troubles said mrs mountford and troubles make us think of others when you are in possession of that large income mr herries don't forget the poor and needy let your troubles aid you to remember the troubles of others you can depend upon that said herries and took his leave feeling a profound respect for mrs mountford he was not so surprised as he might have been on hearing of maud's weakness several times when he was courting her in edinburgh he had noticed how strange her manner was and how careless she seemed to be of other people's feelings but then he was blinded with what he took for love and had not seen clearly now he could judge dispassionately and felt certain apart from any personal benefit that the best thing that could have happened to maud was the loss of the money to weight so frail and fickle a creature with gold would have been to sink her in the ocean of life he determined to allow mrs mountford another thousand a year for looking after her and then the ex governess could take the poor girl away to some lonely place where she could quietly live out the rest of her life in his own mind herries with a sudden memory of a striking book compared her to lady audley and recalled how that celebrated heroine had been placed in seclusion as dangerous maud was just such another childish pretty cunning dangerous woman as that conceived by miss braddon having made up his mind how to act towards his unfortunate cousin herries returned home and told browne and elspeth all that had occurred both of them were much astonished and were divided as to who was guilty of the crime elspeth fancied that seora guzman was guilty browne held that kyles was the criminal herries shook his head there's been so many mistakes over this case he said that i am afraid to give an opinion it might have been mrs narby for all we know mrs narby ejaculated elspeth with a gasp mrs narby echoed the doctor his face growing redder than ever herries shrugged his shoulders she looks the kind of woman who would kill anyone especially for money my father knows mrs narby better than anyone else said elspeth i should think you knew her well enough my dear the worst side of her perhaps has she any better side if so i should be glad to know it but i wish i knew where your father is at present seora guzman is aware of his hiding place but she won't tell why is he hiding asked browne very directly really i don't know he can't be in any trouble or he would have said so in his letter the letter that was posted at tarhaven said elspeth who had risen from the table and was thinking deeply angus i should not be surprised to learn that my father was on board the yacht by jove it's very probable elspeth kyles was ashore this morning according to sweetlips so gowrie probably gave him the letter to post that was why it did not bear the desleigh post mark but why should he have boarded the yacht no one could answer this very pertinent question but browne ventured an explanation i believe that all this is a conspiracy to get that four thousand pounds i wouldn't pay kyles a cent herries then how am i to clear up the mystery of the murder and get the money browne i must make some move as i can't live here on you all the days of my life four thousand pounds is worth paying if by kyles' information i can get fifty thousand a year quite so but if kyles is guilty he won't accuse himself why not he won't see me ashore but on the yacht he can say what he likes and then steam away with the money and you will let him said elspeth indignantly no said her husband putting on his hat i'll see trent to morrow and inform him of the proposed meeting after i get the truth whatever it may be out of kyles trent can come on board and arrest the guilty person seora guzman said elspeth captain kyles ventured browne but not very eagerly it may be one or the other or neither retorted herries meanwhile i'm off to see inspector trent said elspeth accompanying him to the door no i won't see him until i have a note saying what time i am to go on board the yacht i must interview ritson about the money this herries did after he had thought well over the position of affairs which was decidedly perplexing ritson gasped when he heard all that herries knew and appeared to take the same view as browne had done i believe that kyles is guilty he said in a profoundly certain tone and that being the case why pay him four thousand pounds he won't confess anything until he gets the money insisted the client and if he is guilty trent can arrest him then we can get the money back but will you advance me the cash ritson yes said the lawyer without the slightest hesitation you have a good enough security be careful ritson warned herries gravely i am not yet in possession of the fifty thousand a year and unless i learn the absolute truth i never may be you'll learn the truth sooner or later at all events to get to the bottom of the thing i'm willing to risk four thousand on the matter it's a sprat to catch a mackerel but you must make it worth my while risking this much herries naturally said the other i never expected you to oblige me without asking a percentage what do you want i must think it over said ritson rubbing his hands but you won't find me too expensive i wish to keep you as a client that you certainly will said herries as you have been most kind during all these troubles good bye i'll see you to morrow make your arrangements and have the money in gold of course humph rather a large sum in gold better take a cheque my dear man i don't take the money kyles won't be satisfied with a cheque which may be stopped bank notes then same objection applies kyles is a wary man and will accept nothing but gold well sighed ritson we must see what we can do by the way are you certain that kyles is guilty i am not but you are i'm changing my mind since you tell me that your father in law is on board the yacht i only think that he is on board then if he is perhaps he has fled fled herries somewhat startled returned from the door to escape justice i shouldn't wonder added ritson playing with a pen to learn that gowrie was the guilty person herries turned red and hot at the thought of the disgrace to his wife all the more reason that we should see kyles on the yacht and pay him the four thousand he can take gowrie to south america this puts a different complexion on the matter ritson i shan't tell trent to come on board now herries having thus made up his mind went away but ritson determined when he learned the hour of the meeting with kyles to tell the inspector the lawyer knew that if gowrie was guilty the truth would have to be made public in order that herries should get the fortune and as he intended to make a good bargain for the loan of the four thousand he did not intend to let any sentimental business spoil his chance of getting back the money and interest if gowrie was guilty he would be arrested by trent and taken ashore mr and mrs herries would just have to put up with the disgrace fifty thousand a year is worth a trifle of mud thought ritson meanwhile herries quite unaware of ritson's proposed treachery passed a very bad night from the flight as he thought it was of gowrie he really began to believe that the old scamp was the guilty person after all since he had condescended to robbery for a few shillings he probably would not mind throat cutting for so large a sum as two thousand pounds angus did not tell elspeth his idea of the old man's guilt and although she saw that he had something on his mind she could not learn what it was that her father might have done the horrible deed never entered her mind all the next day herries waited to hear from kyles he soon found out that the tarabacca was anchored some distance away from the shore about a quarter of a mile in fact and went down to the end of the pier to look at her through a glass she seemed a very pretty little craft of the piratical order herries was half minded to take a boat and board her but on second thoughts he determined not to be so rash while he was watching he saw a launch put off and saw also that there was a lady in it thinking that this was seora guzman he waited and waved his hand as the boat drew near the pier she recognised him and made the sailors row longside herries went down the steps and she gave him a letter i can't stop to talk mr herries she said quickly fearing apparently to be asked unnecessary questions read the letter while the launch steamed back to the yacht herries read the note and found that he was expected on board that night at eight o'clock at once he returned to the town and seeing ritson arranged about the money which the lawyer was expecting from town by the five o'clock train then herries gave the time and place for the meeting and went home again to await the hour ritson put on his hat and repaired to the station there he remained until the money came to hand in charge of a bank of england messenger and he saw that it was taken to his office after that the lawyer went to see trent at the police station and arrange about the arrest of michael gowrie he found trent in a great state of agitation with a long telegram in his hand he fairly rushed at the lawyer i am glad to see you said he you were sir simon's solicitor so you have the right to know first know what that a man presented one of the missing notes before he could be arrested he slipped away and the police are hunting for him he was he was said the inspector solemnly pope narby chapter xxv the captain's story at half past seven o'clock that same evening herries was on the fisherman's jetty situated in the lower parts of tarhaven and with him was his cousin both were well wrapped up as the night was bitterly cold however the atmosphere was clear and there shone a wintry looking moon the light of which was occasionally obscured by drifting clouds maud looked over the grey choppy sea to an emerald star which indicated the position of the tarabacca and shuddered at the idea of venturing out on such an evening timid as a rule only her love for kyles made her resolve to board the ship also she had another idea in her head and as she thought of it again she stole a glance at her cousin which was forebodingly forbidding but herries was looking up towards the town and wondering why ritson did not come the lawyer had insisted upon sharing the adventure and on taking charge of the gold but the watched pot boiled on this occasion and very soon a cab drove down to the top of the jetty and ritson came along well muffled up in a fur coat followed by two men carrying a wooden box which they placed in the waiting boat by his directions then herries got in after handing maud to a seat and the oarsmen there were two dipped their oars into the gleaming water got it there asked angus nodding towards the wooden box as they swept clear of the jetty the lead yes said ritson with a frown you mean the leaden seals don't you certainly replied herries seeing that ritson did not wish either the boatmen or maud to learn the real contents of the wooden box they are very heavy those seals continued ritson with emphasis what seals asked miss tedder glancing at the box official seals connected with the indiana republic answered the solicitor promptly captain kyles is taking them out but i thought that he was not allowed to enter the republican territory again oh he's made all that square he and seora guzman are steaming back to indiana to morrow replied ritson lying frankly i'll go too muttered maud that is if she huddled her wraps about her and stole a vicious glance at herries which passed unnoticed in the darkness there was not much conversation herries was anxiously wondering if gowrie would be accused of committing the crime and was congratulating himself that he had not informed inspector trent about the meeting on the yacht he would scarcely have been so easy in his mind had he known that ritson had arranged with trent that the police should board the tarabacca between nine and ten o'clock when the truth had been told as it was probable it would be by that time ritson on his side was debating if he would inform herries that pope narby had tried to pass one of the notes for which sir simon had been murdered the lawyer had no doubt in his own mind but that pope was the culprit and privately considered himself a fool for taking four thousand pounds in gold on board the yacht to pay kyles for information already received in fact he had intended to stop away but trent had advised him to go and to hear what kyles would say then even if the money were paid it could be recovered again by the police when they paid the proposed visit kyles did not expect that the law would board his nefarious craft on that night and within a couple of hours as for maud she kept glancing every now and then at her cousin and hugging her secret to her breast she had conceived an idea by which she hoped to get back her fortune and thus secure kyles if i could only get him away from that woman thought maud i would be quite happy and when i have the money she glanced again at herries and laughed softly what is amusing you maud he asked rather uneasy at mirth so obviously out of place only my own thoughts she muttered shall we soon be there herries nodded the yacht was only a stone throw away as he looked the long black form of the launch shot out from behind the ship and steamed at full speed up the thames in the direction as it seemed to herries of the waterway which led to the marsh inn that boat can go he said wondering what was up ah sir she just can said one of the boatmen as the launch sped along scattering the white foam from her sides to glisten in the pale moonlight she's been dodging about these waters for the last month or so racing between tarhaven and pierside she can show a clean pair of heels like the yacht herself is she quick the boatman chuckled i should just think so a mate of mine met one of the engineers a scotch chap and he said that she could steam hell for leather begging the lady's pardon herries winced kyles was extremely unscrupulous and in a boat of great speed might not hesitate to keep him a prisoner until much more than four thousand was paid over he had only to get up steam and slip away in the darkness for south america and it would be difficult to catch him however the adventure was begun and had to be finished and herries believing that his luck had changed with marriage hoped for the best shortly the boat was longside the yacht swinging up and down on the tide kyles was expecting them and a rope ladder was lowered up this swarmed herries who was well used to the sea ritson came next but was in a state of terror the whole time owing to the swaying of the rope ladder lastly the boatmen assisted maud up the steep black side of the yacht kyles who had made no observation when the two men ascended uttered an exclamation when he saw a woman appear have you brought your wife herries he asked much vexed it's my cousin your cousin said kyles in tones of dismay by this time maud had scrambled on deck and was holding out her hand good evening captain kyles she said ceremoniously you have been quite a stranger of late why why do you come come here stammered the captain who was considerably taken aback maud laughed in an amused manner to say good bye said she carelessly humph i believe that he retorted and she could hear him grit his teeth at her unwelcome presence at that ominous sound the girl who unfortunately for herself really did love him turned pale and laid her hand on her heart as though she there felt a cruel pain as no doubt she did kyles stared at her frowning and then turned away with a grunt of satisfaction as a wooden box was hoisted on board by the two boatmen and a couple of his own sailors you've got it he said in a thankful tone herries nodded and this is my solicitor mr ritson who advanced the cash and has come to see it paid over on conditions added the young man significantly oh i'll keep my word said kyles looking over the side you two men below can remain where you are then he turned to three truculent looking sailors don't let them come on board you know what to do when the launch returns after giving his orders he asked the company to come below and two sailors carried the box between them down the brass bound steps which led to the state room herries was surprised at the splendour of the cabin but still more surprised when he saw seated at the head of the long table a well known figure sipping whisky and smoking vigorously aye said the voice of the missing sage it's me ma ain sel angus taken awa frae a useful existence tae herd wi' tarry men the which ca' themsels sailors but who are nae mair nor the scum o' the arth but i'll hae an action for false detention if there's law to be had and i chairge you laddie tae pay ma fees how the deuce did you come here asked herries recovering from his astonishment i kidnapped him said kyles casting down his gold laced cap and throwing off his oilskin sit down miss tedder miss tedder echoed maud in tones of reproach kyles flushed all over his bronzed face and gave her an angry look striving meanwhile to remain calm we can speak after we have transacted this business he said call me maud then maud said the captain in ironical tones and what is maud doing here asked another voice a woman's cold and cutting as an east wind maud recognised her rival with a snarl like that of an angry cat and looked defiantly at her seora guzman in a richly trimmed dinner dress which well became her beauty was standing at the door of her berth and her face grew pale with wrath as she gazed at the insolent baby face of miss tedder you have no right here said the mexican lady this is my ship captain kyles' ship taunted maud he is the skipper and my servant how dare you thrust yourself here uninvited i brought her seora said herries firmly and it will be as well to postpone any conversation you may wish to have until we have despatched the business we have come about the two women glared at one another and all the men even the philosophic gowrie felt uneasy at their attitude dods he growled an' they ca' yon the weaker sex it's weel that the late mistress gowrie is unnergrund for never again wull i trust my ain precious sel' tae sic jades as they after the business is ended we can speak said seora guzman and sat down disdainfully i'll be only too glad snapped maud likewise sinking down you're not going to have it all your own way madam and after a mutual scowl both fixed their jealous eyes on kyles who for a brave man looked decidedly nervous he was about to relieve the situation by addressing himself to the business in hand when the silence was broken by an exclamation from herries the young man had mechanically picked up a telegram which was lying on the table and without thinking had read the same its contents astonished him not a little i beg your pardon kyles he stammered still holding the telegram with an expression of amazement on his face i read this inadvertently it is from kind to you quite so answered the captain smoothly and you will see that pope narby presented one of the notes stolen from sir simon at a shop and was given in charge also that he escaped and that kind believed he fled at once with his mother to the 'marsh inn' it takes a lengthy wire to explain all that herries but i told kind not to spare expense was this why kind went up to town yes he met me yesterday ashore and i gave him my instructions oh cried the young man wonderfully surprised and do you mean to say that kind obeyed them kyles pointed to the telegram that proves it ritson picked up the wire and looked at the time you got this before the news came to trent he said sharply oh remarked the captain smiling so the police have been informed already i told kind to let them know in london guessing that the news would be at once forwarded to tarhaven my only regret is that pope narby should have escaped but we can't foresee everything aye remarked gowrie waving his pipe what says glorious robbie 'the best laid plans o' mice an' men gang then wrang' i'm nae varra sure o' the context but there's the sense for ye herries passed a bewildered hand across his brow i don't quite understand he observed is pope narby the guilty person oh i don't say that replied the captain agreeably it's his limmer o' a mither cried gowrie what cried ritson jumping up with an activity surprising in so elderly a lawyer did she here interrupted kyles impatiently we'll never get on at this rate mr gowrie you had better tell what happened at the 'marsh inn' and i'll take up the story when your knowledge fails gowrie smiled graciously asking nothing better than to be the central figure in the conversation the three men listened attentively but the two women still glaring at one another gave but a careless ear to the tale told in the old tutor's best style and in his best english for the beenefit o' the lawyer body explained gowrie nodding towards ritson him being unacquaint wi' the tongue o' auld reekie but baith ye laddies he indicated herries and kyles respectively ken well the vernacular ye sooked in wi' yer mither's milk as it micht be get on get on cried kyles looking at his watch we have not much time i have steam up and we lift anchor before midnight ritson smiled to himself thinking that before midnight captain kyles would probably find himself in tarhaven prison however as gowrie was speaking he gave his attention to the story and it astonished him not a little the sage related all that had taken place at the inn since his arrival there and described with indignation how he had been kidnapped while searching for the box buried by mrs narby in the midst of his diatribes the captain cut him short i learned from seora guzman that mrs narby had gone to see her son in london he explained rapidly and got the address from the maid servant of the inn mrs narby had given her the address and had told her to send on any letters on receiving this information i went ashore with one of the notes which i took from the box i intended to come and see you herries and make an arrangement but i met kind by chance on the jetty and made the arrangement with him he agreed to take the note to town and give it to pope narby also to try and induce him to pass it and then give information to the police so that pope might be arrested and thus the note would be brought under the notice of the scotland yard authorities but pope would never have tried to pass a note of that sort when he knew that the authorities had the numbers he did not know that this was one of the stolen notes mrs narby i presume went to london to tell him that the box had been found which it was by me and is now on board but he would never connect kind and the stolen notes kind presented the note to pope who is a fool as a present from seora guzman who admired his poetry it was for fifty pounds and pope swallowed the bait he went out to cash the note as he was short of money kind according to my instructions entered the shop with him and declared that it was one of the notes that had to do with the tedder murder and gave pope in charge but since kind gave him the note oh kind could explain that in due time all he wanted and i wanted was to have that narby animal arrested however pope lost his head and before the policeman could seize him he escaped i think that was how the affair happened and you see from that telegram that kind believes pope and his mother have made for the 'marsh inn' i expect that they will hastily pack a few things and escape then pope narby killed sir simon said herries again i can't be certain of that until i see him said kyles then you don't get the four thousand pounds retorted ritson i'll have it before midnight said kyles glancing again at his watch for then i sail for let us say indiana i have so wish that you mr ritson should put the police on my track mr herries i can trust but you a lawyer aye aye commented mr gowrie they lawyer bodies are the bairns o' auld nicky ben the faither o' lies the accuser o' the brethren perverse an' damnable don't miscall your best friend mr gowrie snapped ritson but we are no nearer the end than we were perhaps captain kyles you will now make your long deferred explanation have you the four thousand pounds asked kyles sharply there's the box but you don't get it until open the box and let me see the money said kyles how do i know but what you will diddle me you said that you would trust me put in herries yes i also said that i mistrusted your lawyer i'll get a screw driver and a hammer the box must be opened and kyles left the cabin in a hurry i believe he is guilty himself exclaimed ritson striking the table you are wrong remarked seora guzman quietly captain kyles is innocent he isn't cried maud viciously i can prove you can prove nothing i can you can't and what is more you shan't the two women panting and savage faced one another defiantly however the scene was ended for the time being by the return of kyles and the box was opened by ritson who declined to let the captain tamper with the precious metal when the lid was thrown back and the glitter of sovereigns was displayed kyles raised another objection you have some money there he admitted but how do i know that the sum amounts to four thousand pounds count it said ritson curtly that would take too long mr herries will you give me your word of honour that the sum of four thousand pounds is in that box yes so ritson assures me ah kyles was suspicious at once then you can't say yourself if the whole hark he stopped abruptly and held up his finger there was a long shrill whistle evidently from some steamer near at hand kyles rushed out of the cabin and ritson hastily replaced the lid on the box wondering if the police had arrived thus inopportunely and before the revelation had been made but in any case the gold was safe and he chuckled at the thought of having kyles arrested and forced to speak the truth in order to save his own neck the buccaneer would not gain possession of the gold after all for which ritson was profoundly thankful but his glee was of short duration in five minutes during which everyone sat pale and expectant kyles returned but not alone with him was pope narby white and sick with fear he shambled in at the heels of the captain and dropped into a chair here said kyles waving his hand allow me to present to you mr pope narby he and his mother did return to the 'marsh inn' to prepare for flight i sent up the launch and they have sought safety on board this boat i'll take them to south america meanwhile i can now say herries that this he laid his hand on pope's arm this is the murderer of your uncle no no howled a high shrill voice i killed 'im and mrs narby looking like a grey old rat at bay in a trap rushed into the cabin chapter xxvi the beginning of the end ritson and herries appeared to be the only members of the company who were surprised by mrs narby's announcement gowrie in a state of high glee leaned forward his elbows on the table and his pipe in his mouth aye mistress said he portentously ye're fighting for yer young like the milky mither o' the herd wha horns the rash intruder wha wud convart her caulf into veal the muckle great deil tak ye for a leear gowrie cried herries who was on his feet you knew all along nae nae ye'll nae mack me compromise maesel in yon way i hed ma suspeecions though no o' her say plainly herries rapped the table is mrs narby guilty or i'm nae varra sure captain kyles he appealed to the skipper who stood by mrs narby with folded arms and a grim smile i accuse the son it's a bloomin' lie panted the landlady who looked a gruesome object with her grey hair disarranged and her bonnet askew it wos me who cut th' ole man's 'orrid throat pope wouldn't 'urt a fly i did h'it fur the tin so es t' 'elp pope t' be a great man you don't seem to be surprised seora guzman said herries looking at the composed face of the mexican lady captain kyles told me long ago that pope narby was guilty me me me declared mrs narby with vehemence and wreathed her old arms round the shaking drooping figure of her miserable son aye aye commented the sage pointing with the stem of his pipe mark hoo th' mither luve rins thro' a' th' wand yon's alfred tennyson i'm theenkin' herries who was the person principally interested seeing that on the truth of this statement depended the possession of fifty thousand a year turned to the mother and son which one of you did it he demanded i must know for certain pope made no reply for his tongue clove to the roof of his palate and mrs narby wiping his damp brow with her handkerchief replied for him i tell you i killed yer bloomin' uncle and i say that pope narby did declared the skipper decisively and i cried maud rising suddenly and stretching out her arm in a threatening manner i say that bruce kyles is the assassin seora guzman leaned across the table and pushed maud back on to the divan if you dare to say that i'll have you thrown overboard bruce she addressed the captain imperiously tell them what happened on that night mr herries knows that we came to england to get money for the expedition he knows that you made love to maud by my order so that sir simon should help us and he has been told that sir simon wrote a letter saying that this woman she pointed to the indignant maud was disinherited and that he would meet you at the inn to pay you to give her up give her up laughed the lady insultingly a woman for whom he did not care two straws while i lived to be his wife it's a lie a lie bruce bruce you love me me only and maud looked at her quondam lover with agonised appeal i don't love you at all mumbled the skipper in the most brazen manner and cutting anything but an heroic figure you knew that i was engaged to seora guzman and yet you wanted me to throw her over and be your husband i never had any intention of marrying you all i wanted was to get money out of your father and oh cut it short you hound interrupted herries fiercely kyles turned livid you are on my boat in my power he said in a slow and deadly manner what do i care for that retorted the young man facing the buccaneer with determination you have acted like a cur towards my cousin no no moaned maud who persisted in believing that kyles was acting a part because seora guzman was present if i had the money he would marry me very good said herries captain kyles i offer you half the money left by my uncle that is twenty five thousand a year if you will marry maud tedder bruce bruce cried maud stretching out her arms you consent bruce cried donna maria in her turn with flashing eyes you promised me to kyles interrupted both with an imperious gesture i stick to my one and only love and that is maria guzman he said sharply but his face was pale i have four thousand pounds with that i'll find the treasure and have five millions then we'll but that's neither here nor there herries he wheeled round to face that most indignant gentleman you may think what you like it is not to my interest to kill you or to keep you prisoner you shall hear all i know and then go free for your opinion of me i don't care that and he snapped his fingers contemptuously herries eyed him with scorn fewer words would have done kyles i wait to hear what you have to say aye said the sage gravely we're wasting valuable meenutes an' it's dry wark a' this talk wi'oot the cheerin' cup kyles flushed and winced at the tone of herries and cast a glance at mrs narby who was still fondling her miserable tongue tied son then he straightened himself and his face brightened when his eyes rested on the wooden box which contained the money he had risked so much to get he spoke quietly and to the point sir simon said captain kyles objected to my marrying his daughter and wanted me to give her up to gain my own ends i refused then he offered to bribe me with one thousand pounds i declined and said that i would take two thousand herries shrugged his shoulders but did not look up kyles reddened at this sign of contempt and continued more rapidly as though eager to get the shameful tale ended the rest of the company even the lively gowrie held their peace sir simon then made his plans he signed a will disinheriting maud save for a year and giving the money to you herries provided you found out who killed him and why did he do that because he was to have an interview with me at a lonely inn and fancied that in a fit of anger i might kill him or else might get rid of him and marry maud with her money that was the reason he disinherited the girl and why he put in the proviso about the discovery of the murderer who would in sir simon's opinion be me i see said herries quietly sir simon wanted to make sure if you did kill him that you would not get the benefit of your crime by marrying maud and her money that's it assented the captain but i need hardly say that i had no idea of killing the old man when i got his letter i arranged to go to the inn and receive the two thousand then i would have gone away as i was not certain of what time i would be at the inn sir simon said that he would put a red light in his bedroom window and that i could climb up or that he would admit me by the door when everyone was in bed i don't see the reason for all these precautions said herries in an impatient manner ah now you trench on politics i was being watched by emissaries from our indiana republic and ran a chance of being stabbed or shot i had reason to believe that they got wind of my engagement at the 'marsh inn' and would be on the watch that was why i would not fix the exact time for calling on sir simon he expected me earlier but i said that i might be late so he invented the red handkerchief signal well to make a long story short i went to the 'marsh inn' with seora guzman that is he went in the launch she interrupted quickly i remained on board the launch and yes yes herries interrupted in his turn i know how you sent the sailors to see if any indiana person was about and how they kidnapped armour by mistake well captain you got to the inn at what time may i ask shortly after midnight i walked through the rain and the fog with my revolver in my hand i knew where the inn was as i had been there before i noted the red light in the window i saw you i saw you cried maud looking at him eagerly i am aware of that seeing what took place afterwards it was for your sake she gasped with a side glance at herries what is that maud asked the young man quietly you'll hear in due time if you will allow me to go on with my story said kyles testily it's getting late and i wish to get away as soon as possible go on then said ritson who was deeply interested i scrambled up to the window which was open it had been left ajar on purpose by sir simon i am not heavy the captain cast a complacent look at his slim figure so i easily clambered up the trellis work you broke it you beast said mrs narby savagely pooh rejoined kyles good humouredly i did very little harm i easily slipped into the room wondering why sir simon was not on the look out i spoke his name softly there was no reply so i came gently from behind the dressing table which had been moved to one side and went to the bed was there a light in the room asked ritson eagerly oh yes a candle which was placed behind a red handkerchief so as to signal the special room i was to climb into i took the candle and then to my horror saw that sir simon was lying dead with his throat cut you did it cried maud with a sob i did not cried kyles savagely the man was dead when i entered the room his pocket book lay on the table along with a razor and a few papers i could not find the money else i should have gone away in silence then i heard a footstep and concealed myself behind the curtains of the bed the door opened gently and this creature he pointed to pope who shuddered crept in softly he had a bloody towel in his hands with which he wiped them and then began to examine the pocket book i crept out and caught him by the throat he nearly fainted you hurt me moaned pope at this moment and his mother fondled him i would have choked you had i had the two thousand pounds safe at that time said kyles savagely to go and murder an old man in his sleep i did it i did it cried mrs narby like a parrot and trembling violently with mixed emotions of rage and terror that's rubbish as i can prove i made pope confess he said that he had been tempted by the gold and notes which he had seen in the parlour he crept up the stairs shortly before midnight and cut sir simon's throat then he emptied the pocket book and took the money to his own room downstairs at the back of the house he had come back when i caught him to see if he had taken everything he also told me that you herries the nephew of the old man were in the next room asleep how did he know that i was sir simon's nephew he heard your name and your talk with gowrie i didn't mention to gowrie that i was sir simon's nephew aye i can stake my life on that laddie i'll explain i'll explain said kyles impatiently however to continue i promised to say nothing if pope went down and brought up the money on that condition i let him go he went and never returned i waited and waited in that dismal room with the one candle and the corpse on the bed then i thought that the red light might attract the attention of any indiana spy who was about so i put out the light and sat in the dark pope never came why not asked herries surprised pope opened his mouth to speak but his watchful mother put her hand over his mouth you never did it lovey you know nothink she said significantly but i can prove that he did said kyles pope did not return he went on quickly because he knew that i could not give the alarm without incriminating myself and he intended if i did to accuse me of killing the old man i guessed that and afterwards i made him confess that he intended to act in that way so there i sat in the darkness then i remembered the papers on the table and examined them to see if sir simon had made any mention of the appointment i found my own letter and confiscated that how did you see in the dark asked ritson suspiciously i lighted matches as i was afraid to relight the candle well then i also found a small pocket diary written up to the time sir simon went to bed it mentioned that angus herries was in the house and sleeping there how did my uncle know that asked herries much amazed he overheard your voice raised when talking to gowrie and peered out of the parlour to see who it was he recognised you nae nae said gowrie waving the smoke away from his eyes he cudnae hae recognised the laddie sae changed wi' weary travels but angus here talked tae me his auld tutor and i spoke his name at times aye and i mind me noo the door of the parlour opened and shut while we hed oor crack i don't remember that said angus thoughtfully aye but i do ma laddie ye were sae taken up wi' yer tale of woe and verra sad it wis that ye didna hear nor see but i keeked oot o' the tail o' ma ee and saw though tae be sure i didna weel ken at the time it wis yer lawfu' uncle hed i kenned i micht hae touched him for a shullin' or two you evidently robbed herries instead said kyles contemptuously eh but that's actionable i'll hale ye afore the magistrate for yon speech hoo d'y' ken i wis in herries' room i heard you muttering to yourself your accent betrayed you well and wherefore no i joost looked in tae see that my puir laddie wis asleep and you took his money pope narby found that out gowrie turned wrathfully on the culprit d'y' ken yon's a base lee here interrupted herries growing weary of all this talk get on with what you have to say captain kyles we can settle these minor details later what did you do when narby did not return i waited until the morning then assumed sir simon's coat and boldly walked out of the inn why did you wait until the morning for two reasons first i wanted to get the money which pope had taken away and thought up to the last moment that he would return and second when i did have a half idea of escaping by the window armour came and sat down beneath it and there was a third reason added kyles with his eyes on maud tedder one moment before you proceed further said ritson quickly how can we believe all this about pope narby there's his confession said kyles taking a packet from his breast pocket and throwing it across the table i saw him later he refused to give up the money but i made him sign that confession by threatening to arrest him and pope yelled mrs narby oh you fool did you sign i had to mother moaned her son and captain kyles said he would save me by taking me away to america and i'll do that said kyles nodding herries ritson you have now the truth that confession repeats all that i have told you and has been signed by pope narby who killed sir simon you can now leave the four thousand pounds with me and go ashore i am off in another hour from these waters but one thing i'll say before i go he declared you herries have defended your cousin and have blamed me for treating her as i did but you have very little reason to decry me and defend her for it was your cousin who placed the razor and the pocket book in your room and who smeared your shirt with her father's blood maud cried herries horrified and started to his feet yes i did she said with pinched lips and a bloodless face i got into the inn as i told you but i did not run away when i heard mr gowrie coming out of the bedroom i hid while he went down the stairs then i ran along to the room where i saw a gleam of light it came from under the door explained kyles as i had lighted the candle on hearing gowrie muttering i saw it was bruce and he told me all and also mentioned that angus was sleeping in the next room to save bruce and to get my own money i determined to get angus hanged for the crime so i did what bruce said papa had left the money to angus as he told bruce and bruce told me so i thought that if angus was hanged the money would come back to me and if you were to die now added maud tigerishly i should have my fortune again and then my own bruce would marry me before herries could exclaim on the iniquity of his cousin's conduct there was a sudden shouting overhead kyles started and listened down the stairs rushed an excited man he was one of the engineers who cried out that the police were on board the police cried herries astonished the police echoed kyles wrathfully did you betray me herries no i swear that i i told trent to come cried ritson much excited as i want the murderer arrested and before he could say anything further mrs narby was at his throat you 'ang my son she shrieked i'll choke y' furst guy up thet confession pope come an' elp me but pope terrified out of his life at his danger ran up the cabin stairs in the vain endeavour to escape and so fell into the arms of trent himself ritson shaking off the old woman ran up also and shouted out to trent to hold the murderer kyles followed and there was a general rush the night was clear with moonlight and the deck was filled with the sailors of the yacht trent with a couple of policemen was on board and in the boats longside were many others who were being kept from getting on deck by some of the crew i arrest everyone on board this ship cried trent loudly in the name of the king i don't care for king or kaiser shouted kyles in his turn you get away and leave that man no no cried the lawyer hold him tightly trent he killed sir simon i have the confession in my pocket and the captain here is an accessory after the fact arrest him said trent pointing to kyles a policeman advanced and was knocked down this was the signal for a general fight trent held on to pope narby like grim death and the miserable creature was whimpering like a soul in pain the other policemen in the boat managed to get on deck and one who remained behind sent off a green rocket as a sign that assistance was required apparently trent expecting some fighting had laid his plans excellently on the moonlit deck a mass of men struggled and strained with much noise and clamour mrs narby fought tooth and nail for her son but he was down under the feet of the inspector who stood over him with a levelled revolver kyles blew his bo'sn's whistle and more and more sailors came tumbling up from below dark fierce looking fellows they were who cared for nothing the police were overpowered gradually but already more boats were putting off from the shore and there was every chance that kyles would have to yield he shouted down to the engine room and gave the signal to stand by trent dragged his prisoner to the side and dropped him into the boat while mrs narby clung to him biting and scratching indeed but for the assistance of ritson she would have succeeded in getting her son free what with the yelling and swearing and struggling the deck was like a pandemonium having secured at least one prisoner and seeing that there was danger of bloodshed trent cried to his men to regain the boat at the same time the yacht began to move and kyles on the bridge was pulling at the whistle which shrieked shrilly herries not wishing to be carried away for the policemen were tumbling into their boat rushed to the side where his own boatmen were he saw the boat and shouted just as he did so and was leaning over at a dangerous angle he was pushed violently from behind and had just a glimpse of maud's malignant face as she thrust him to his death the money's mine mine she cried clapping her hands and bruce is mine said seora guzman in her ear and sent maud tedder overboard after her victim chapter xxvii the end some months later in the spring time mr and mrs herries were seated under their own fig tree in other words they were occupying the moated hall angus had entered into full possession of his property and was now a country gentleman popular and wealthy his wife also was much admired and her story being known everyone was delighted to make her acquaintance it had been impossible to keep the mysterious tale of the marsh inn murder out of the newspapers and quite a legend had grown up in connection with it pope narby was tried for the murder of sir simon and although he would fain have denied his guilt and although his mother would fain have taken it on her own shoulders he was condemned and sentenced to be hanged it was this news which elspeth and her husband were discussing after dinner in the garden the night was beautiful and spring like there was a glorious moon gleaming in a cloudless sky and everywhere the earth was breaking into blossom with the coming of spring browne had been dining with the young couple but had been hastily called away to see a patient angus and his wife were alone and sat side by side hand in hand on the terrace of the old hall elspeth looked more delicate and ethereal than ever in her evening dress and herries immaculately groomed and arrayed in purple and fine linen appeared a very different creature to the worn out tramp who had sought the shelter of the marsh inn he was just talking of this experience i thought that it was the unluckiest thing that ever happened to me he said looking fondly at his pretty wife but now i know that but for my visit there i would never have been where i am you would not have been my wife elspeth nor would i now be drawing fifty thousand a year yet we have seen much misery coming out of the whole business sighed the girl wife is it a good thing angus to build up happiness on the sorrows of other people my darling we did all we could to help others their sorrows were caused simply by their own wickedness from which both of us suffered no elspeth i don't think we can blame ourselves in any way let us recall for the last time all that has happened and then agree to forget the sorrowful past well then angus let us begin with pope narby i rather think we end with him said herries seeing that the poor wretch will be hanged in a few days the appeal his mother made to the home secretary has been rejected and the law will take its course but he certainly deserves his doom when i was in the court at the time he was sentenced elspeth he talked about eugene aram and compared himself to that person saying he had killed sir simon to get money to become famous did mrs narby know that he was guilty not at the time but she noticed that he was always down at the red creek i noticed that also from the mud on his boots well then one day she followed him there and found that he had buried the notes and gold in a box she made him confess all which he did only he never told her that captain kyles had made him sign a confession i wonder that pope was so foolish as to do that he would not have done that had not kyles promised to save him by taking him to south america then he thought that he was safe and kyles certainly would have kept his word had not trent and his policemen arrived i was angry with ritson for having warned trent but as events proved it was just as well i thought you intended yourself to warn trent said elspeth so i did dear but then from certain information i learned i fancied that your father might be guilty what papa oh no he would do many wrong things i know but not well said herries dryly i don't think he'd even stop short of murder to get money but there is no danger of his doing anything of that sort now as he has his five hundred a year he is coming to see us to night elspeth and then intends to go to morrow to the north there to live always i am glad of that said the daughter heartily papa is not a good man angus and the further away from us he is the better but do you know she added smiling i really thought that papa would have married mrs mountford there was not the least chance of that dear although he certainly admired her poor mrs mountford i am glad i allowed her an annuity as she certainly has had a very bad time she felt the loss of maud very much why was not maud saved asked elspeth in all the confusion it was impossible said herries earnestly for i would have saved her myself in spite of her wickedness had i got my wits about me but i struck my head against the side of the yacht when she pushed me over and the boatmen dragged me quite stunned into their boat maud was pushed over immediately afterwards by seora guzman and who can swear to that ritson he saw her do it and saw maud push me over you see my dear maud knew that if i died that the money would come to her and that was why she wanted to come with me on the yacht i saw that she had something on her mind but she would not tell me what it was and no wonder seeing that it was her design to push me overboard and get the cash then she thought that bruce kyles would marry her had she been successful would he have done that no he loved seora guzman i think that kyles behaved very badly however he has vanished out of our lives with the four thousand ah said elspeth smiling mr ritson has never ceased to mourn for the loss of that i think kyles deserved the money said herries and ritson made a good thing out of it when the property came into my possession without that confession extorted by kyles from pope narby we would never have got the fortune but it proved beyond all doubt that pope was guilty so everything has turned out for the best i do not grudge kyles the money he's in south america by now i expect hunting for that treasure along with seora guzman and her father what will they do when they find it marry and then with heaps of money at their back i believe the treasure amounts to five millions sterling they will try and get back authority in indiana what about mrs narby i intend to give her some money and send her to the states to rejoin her husband pope must be hanged there's no help for it while they thus talked and enjoyed the beauty of the night they heard a grand mellow voice chanting one of the psalms shortly the musical person came in sight and then they beheld the rev michael gowrie in strict clerical dress looking fat and gay and more bibulous than ever on seeing his son in law and daughter he advanced with a majestic gait reciting solemnly soon as the evening shades prevail the moon takes up the glorious tale that's addison ye ken my bairns a fine poet though not tae be named i' the same breeth wi' robbie burns so you are off to morrow said herries taking no notice of this poetical outburst i'm gangin' tae morrow tae the norrth aye my fut wull be on ma native heath soon five hunner a year and a stainless name leuk laddie what honesty o' purpose does for the wise oh father said elspeth disgusted you know you i know that i walked in miry ways said the sage quickly groped in darkness and employed in the muckrake to find ma gold but i wis but a good honest mon struggling wi' advarsity aye lassie dinna forget that i saved your husband fra the gallows you've made five hundred a year out of that said herries contemptuously and gey cheap at the price my manny my ain conscience o' having dune good is ma reward aye i can lay ma venerable locks on my pillow and say i've thocht o' the gude o' ithers afore ma

herries stared at mr gowrie thus praising himself then taking elspeth's arm within his own calmly walked away dear he said when they entered the house when your father goes we'll forget all the past i never wish to see him again shuddered the girl and oh angus to think i should have such a father she let fall a tear herries kissed it away there there we won't think any more of him or of our troubles all's well that end's well you and i are no longer mr and mrs jonah what are we then asked elspeth smiling through her tears dand joan and then they sat down happy at last and the sage the wise man who had steered them in his own opinion through all their troubles sat on the terrace lamenting the ingratitude of his children aye aye said gowrie i'm a lear wha hes cherished a serpent to sting me but for the gude siller aye he chuckled and rubbed his hands i hae the siller and can gang my ways content until yon day when i occupy the hoose built wi'oot hands a provideence hes watched
