cupid in leading strings it's an infernal shame i call it common sense call it what you please malet i deny your right to keep back my money right your father's will gives me every right if i approve of your marriage the money will be paid down on your wedding day but you don't approve confound you certainly not brenda scarse is not the wife for you harold that's my business mine also under the will come come now don't lose your temper the elder speaker smiled as he proffered this advice knowing well that he was provoking his cousin beyond all bounds harold burton was young fiery tempered and in love to be thwarted in his love was something more than exasperating to this impetuous lover the irritating request that he should keep his temper caused him to lose it promptly and for the next five minutes mr gilbert malet was witness of a fine exhibition of unrestrained rage he trembled for the furniture almost for his own personal safety though he managed to preserve a duly dignified outward calm while harold stamped about the room his burly cousin posed before a fireless grate and trimmed his nails and waited until the young man should have exhausted this wholly unnecessary display of violence they were in the library of holt manor it was a sombre monkish room almost ascetic in its severity bookcases and furniture were of black oak carpet and curtains of a deep red color and windows of stained glass subdued the light suitably for study and meditation but on this occasion the windows were open to the brilliant daylight of an august afternoon and shafts of golden sunshine poured into the room from the terrace stretching before the house vast woods sloped toward chippingholt village where red roofed houses clustered round a brawling stream and rose again on the further side to sweep to the distant hills in unbroken masses of green manor and village took their teutonic names from these forests and buried in greenery might have passed as the domain of the sleeping beauty her palace was undoubtedly girdled by just such a wood but this sylvan beauty did not appeal to the pair in the library the stout domineering owner of the manor who trimmed his nails and smiled blandly had the stronger position of the two and he knew it well so well that he could afford to ignore the virile wrath of his ward strictly speaking captain burton was not a ward if that word implies minority he was thirty years of age in a lancer regiment and possessed of an income sufficient to emancipate him from the control of his cousin gilbert still though possible for one his income was certainly not possible for two and if gilbert chose he could increase his capital by twenty thousand pounds but the stumbling block was the condition attached to the disposal of the money only if malet approved of the prospective bride was he to part with the legacy as such he did not approve of brenda scarse so matters were at a standstill nor could harold well see how he was to move them finding all his rage of no avail he gradually subsided and had recourse to methods more pacific let me understand this matter clearly he said taking a seat with a resolute air independent of my three hundred a year you hold twenty thousand pounds of my money to be correct replied malet in a genial tone i hold forty thousand pounds to be equally shared between you and your brother wilfred when you marry the three hundred a year which you each possess i have nothing to do with well i want to marry and you do against my wishes if i do not approve of your choice i need not pay you this money i can hold it until i die and then asked harold sharply gilbert shrugged his burly shoulders then it goes to you and wilfred direct there is no provision made for my handing it over to another trustee you are bound to get your share in the long run but i am not thinking of dying just yet my dear harold i can't imagine what possessed my father ever to make so foolish a will your father was guided by experience my boy he made a miserable marriage himself and did not want you or wilfred to go and do likewise he had evidently confidence in my judgment and knew that i would stand between you and folly confound your impudence shouted harold his dark face crimson with anger you're only fifteen years older than i am at the age of thirty i am surely capable of selecting my own wife i hardly think so when you select miss scarse what the deuce have you against her nothing personally she is a nice girl a very nice girl but poor a man of your extravagant tastes should marry money brenda is well enough for herself continued malet with odious familiarity for which harold could have struck him but her father stuart scarse is a little englander captain burton was taken aback at the irrelevancy of this remark what the devil has that to do with her or me he demanded bluntly everything if you love your country you belong to a conservative family you are a soldier and the time is coming when we must all rally round the flag and preserve the empire scarse is a member of that pernicious band which desires the dismemberment of our glorious oh i'm sick of this harold jumped up and crammed on his cap your political ideas have nothing to do with my marriage you have no reason to object to miss scarse once for all will you pay me this money no i will not i shall not agree to your marrying the daughter of a little englander then i shall throw the estate into chancery malet looked uneasy but sneered by all means if you want the whole forty thousand to go to fee the lawyers but before you risk losing your money let me advise you to make sure of miss brenda scarse what do you mean ask mr van zwieten who is staying with her father oh said harold contemptuously brenda has told me all about him her father wants her to marry him and it is true he is in love with her but brenda loves me and will never consent to become the wife of that boer van zwieten is no boer he is a dutchman born in amsterdam and a friend of yours sneered captain burton he is no friend of mine shouted malet somewhat ruffled i detest the man as much as i do scarse if look here gilbert i don't want any more of this i trust brenda and i intend to marry her very good then you'll have to starve on your three hundred a year you refuse to give me the money absolutely then i'm glad i don't live under your roof and can tell you what i think of you you are a mean hound malet keep back or i'll knock you down yes a mean hound this is not your real reason for refusing to pay me this money i'll go up to town to day and have your trusteeship inquired into gilbert changed color and looked dangerous you can act as you please harold but recollect that my powers are very clearly defined under the will i am not accountable to you or to wilfred or to any one else for the money i have no need to defend my honor that we shall see harold opened the door and looked back this is the last time i shall enter your house you meddle with my private affairs you keep back money rightfully belonging to me on the most frivolous pretext and in fact make yourself objectionable in every way but i warn you the law will force you to alter your behavior the law cannot touch me cried gilbert furiously i can account for the money and pay it when it should be paid out of my house i am going and see here gilbert malet if the law affords me no redress i shall take it into my own hands yes you may well turn pale i'll make it hot for you you swindler and captain burton banging the door marched out of the house furious at his helpless position left alone malet wiped his bald forehead and sank into a chair pooh he muttered striving to reassure himself he can do nothing i am his cousin my honor is his honor i'm in pretty deep water but i'll get ashore yet there's only one way only one then mr malet proceeded to cogitate upon that one and only way and the obstacles which prevented his taking it his thoughts for the next half hour did not make for peace of mind altogether meanwhile captain burton fuming with rage strode on through the green woods to the lady of his love they had arranged to meet and discuss the result of this interview as mr scarse did not approve of his attentions toward his daughter the cottage where she dwelt was forbidden ground to harold he was compelled therefore to meet her by stealth in the woods but the glorious summer day made that no hardship he knew the precise spot where brenda would be waiting for him under an ancient oak which had seen many generations of lovers and he increased his pace that he might the sooner unburden to her his mind as he left the park and made his way through the orchards which surrounded chippingholt he saw mr scarse no great distance away that's a queer get up the old man's got on muttered harold perplexed at the wholly unusual combination of a snuff colored greatcoat and a huge black scarf never saw him in that rig before i wonder what it means as he came up within a dozen paces of the thin white haired figure he was more than ever puzzled for he noticed that the black scarf was of crape there must have been several yards of it wound round the old man's neck it was undoubtedly mr scarse there was no mistaking that clean shaven parchment like visage burton took off his cap in greeting but did not speak he knew the old man was not well disposed toward him mr scarse looked blankly at him and pressed on without sign of recognition and even though he had half expected it captain burton felt mortified at this cut direct brenda and i will have to marry without his consent he thought never mind but he did mind to marry a girl in the face of parental opposition was all against his inclinations the future looked dismal enough to him at the moment and his spirits were only further depressed as the sky began to blacken over with portentous clouds impressionable as he was this endorsement of nature was full of meaning for him in his then pessimistic frame of mind the sunshine faded to a cold grey the leaves overhead shivered and seemed to wither at the breath of the chill wind and when he caught sight of brenda's white dress under the oak her figure looked lonely and forlorn the darkling sky the bitter wind the stealthy meeting the solitary figure all these things struck at his heart and it was a pale and silent lover who kissed his sweetheart under the ancient tree his melancholy communicated itself to brenda bad news dear you have bad news she murmured looking into his downcast face i can see it in your eyes they sat silent on the rustic seat the birds had ceased to sing the sun to shine and the summer breeze was cold cold as their hearts and hands in that moment of sadness they were a handsome couple the man tall thin flanked and soldiery of bearing dark eyes dark hair dark moustache and a clean cut bronzed face alert vivacious and full of intelligence brenda was a stately blonde golden haired blue eyed and passionate as one of those stormy queens of the nibelungen lied to whom love insistent and impassioned was as the breath of life both were filled with the exuberant vitality of youth fit to overcome all obstacles greatly daring and resolutely courageous yet seated there hand in hand they were full of despondency even to cowardice brenda felt that was so and made an effort to rouse herself and him come dear she said kissing her lover the sun will shine again things can't be so bad as to be past mending he has refused absolutely he won't give me the money on the ground that he does not approve of me harold nodded he tried to make out that you were in love with van zwieten oh he is so ready to stoop to any meanness said brenda scornfully i always disliked mr malet perhaps my dislike is hereditary for my father detests him on political grounds of course but those are strongest of all grounds for hatred religion and politics have caused more trouble and more wars than she broke off suddenly of course you don't believe this about mr van zwieten need you ask said burton tenderly the fellow is staying with you still yes he has been here for the last two days talking politics with father and worrying me thank goodness he goes to morrow glad of it growled burton he is the beast mentioned in revelation by the way brenda who is van zwieten miss scarse looked puzzled a friend of my father's yes but what is his position where does he come from how does he make his income there is something mysterious about the fellow he comes from holland he is a friend of dr leyds and he is shortly going out to fill some post under the transvaal government that's all i know about him he seems to have plenty of money yes he spends a good deal to judge from what i saw of him in town last season then he is a popular cricketer you know i know but the idea of a foreigner playing cricket well mr van zwieten does and very well too you must have seen about his play in the papers he is a great man at lord's all the same he is a mystery and he is too much mixed up with the boers to please me if there is a war i hope he'll be with them that i may have a shy at him brenda laughed and pressed her lover's arm you silly boy you are jealous i am i am who wouldn't be jealous of you but this is not war brenda dear let us talk about ourselves i can't get this twenty thousand pounds until malet dies i see nothing for it but to marry on my three hundred a year i dare say we'll scrape along somehow i have two hundred a year of my own cried brenda vivaciously that makes ten pounds a week we can easily manage on that dear but your father oh he wants me to marry mr van zwieten of course said she with great scorn so i must just do without his consent that's all it sounds wrong harold doesn't it but my father has never done his duty by me like most men who serve the public he has sacrificed his all to that i was left to bring myself up as best i could and so i think i have the right to dispose of myself my father is nothing to me you are everything dearest he kissed her then let us marry but no he broke off abruptly if war should break out in south africa i would have to leave you but i wouldn't be left said brenda merrily i would go out with you yes to the front i'm afraid you couldn't do that i could and i would i would go officially as a nurse but harold why don't you see your lawyer about this money he may find means to force mr malet to pay it to you i intend to see him to morrow dearest i am going up to town by the six train this evening though i confess i don't like leaving you with this van zwieten i think i can undertake to keep mr van zwieten at his distance said brenda quietly even though my father encourages him i believe your father hates me said harold gloomily he cut me just now cut you dear what do you mean just what i say brenda i met you father and he cut me dead she stared at her lover in amazement you can't possibly have seen my father she said decisively he is ill with influenza and hasn't left his room for two days chapter ii a shot in the darkness after many and fervent farewells the lovers embraced and went home it was understood that harold should go to london that evening by the five o'clock local from chippingholt which connected with the express at langton junction some twenty miles away after seeing his lawyer he was to write her a full account of the interview and arrange definitely the details for their marriage meanwhile to set his mind at rest brenda promised to see as little of van zwieten as possible as her father was ill she was compelled to play the part of hostess an ungrateful one enough toward a guest she so disliked but as the dutchman had arranged to leave next morning she hoped for so short a time to obey the laws of hospitality and at the same time keep him at his distance but even so the situation was a trying one and brenda relished it little the cottage was an unpretentious little place on the borders of chippingholt where the orchards began to stretch toward the woods scarse was not well off and had been fortunate enough to obtain it at quite a nominal rental he kept a cook and one housemaid both of whom brenda looked after and despite his slender means his style of living was in every way refined the largest room in the house had been turned into a study and here brenda now found her father buried in blue books pamphlets and newspapers scarse was a lean tall anmic looking creature his hair was quite white his pallid and wrinkled face clean shaven and his whole aspect was one of peevishness and querulousness in spite of the warmth he had ordered a fire to be lighted and wrapped in a llama wool dressing gown he crouched over it with the daily mail spread out upon his knees he looked ill and cross and seemed terribly feeble brenda was more than ever certain now that she saw him that harold had been mistaken in thinking it was he whom he had met he looked she thought more fit for bed than for walking come in come in he said in his thin cantankerous voice shut the door brenda there is quite a draught are you no better father she asked coming toward him and taking his hand scarse snatched it away not a bit my dear this thing has a hold of me i am aching all over of course it comes just to prevent my speaking at the trafalgar square meeting next week you can send an excuse i can't and i won't snapped her father this paper shows me how necessary it is for all men to protest against this unjust war which has been forced upon the boers i must speak in favor of that honest god fearing band of farmers who are in danger of being crushed by a capitalist war i want to see van zwieten about this article it is perfectly scandalous where is he i don't know i've not seen him all the afternoon is that the way you attend to your guests he is no guest of mine cried brenda indignantly i can't bear the man his mere presence is most objectionable to me you are a foolish strong headed girl brenda van zwieten wants to marry you as i have told you and he is i won't marry him i detest the man and you fancy you are in love with that scamp of a burton said scarse frowning harold is not a scamp father he is noble and honest and everything that is good i will marry no one but him i shall never give my consent never then i must do without it replied brenda determinedly i do not want to behave otherwise than as a daughter should father but i love harold and i hate van zwieten don't be silly said the mp querulously van zwieten is well off he is a good match for you he can give you a good position in the transvaal i suppose scoffed brenda yes and where could you live better than in a new land where the vices of civilization have not penetrated i don't speak of johannesburg that sink of iniquity but of pretoria and of those towns where the boer element exists pure and simple with your husband in the government you can help him to build up an ideal state i don't want to build up anything harold and i can be happy by ourselves you shall never marry the scamp i tell you cried scarse angrily let alone his character which is bad he is the cousin of that scoundrel malet who is a bigoted imperialist one who is doing his best to ruin this country by advocating annexation of all and everything he is one of those who are urging on this war i hate the man only because you differ from him in politics no on other grounds which do not concern you i know malet none better and i would gladly see him dead father brenda was amazed at the savage energy of the old man what has mr malet done to you that you should hate him so never mind i hate him and i hate that young burton well father said brenda quietly you need not have shown it quite so plainly to day harold said you met him this afternoon and cut him this was a tentative remark as brenda was certain her father could not have been out met burton said he raising himself angrily what do you mean child were you not out to day no i have not left this room but harold said he saw you with a snuff colored coat and a crape scarf round your throat father brenda shrieked what is it she might well ask scarse was always pale but now he was deathly white he reared himself out of his chair with a look of terror in his eyes it was in broken sentences he spoke did harold burton see me with a crape scarf to day yes yes but was it you father why did you wear hush say no more brenda go away a faint color was coming back to his face and he began to look more like himself less like a corpse brenda was about to demur at leaving him but he stopped her with a peremptory gesture go away brenda i say but won't you explain there is nothing to explain go away she was obliged to obey and reluctantly she left the room she could not understand her father's emotion nor could she understand the presence in chippingholt of this man with the crape scarf who so nearly resembled him as to be mistaken for him by harold so far as she knew her father had no relatives but he had always been very reticent about his family affairs she knew nothing of his connections or his past life her mother she could scarce remember she had died when brenda was a tiny child and ever since that time she had been brought up by strangers far away from home up to the age of twenty she had been at a boarding school and there she had seen next to nothing of her father a casual visit on his part and a few casual questions as to her welfare her mental welfare chiefly that represented brenda's experience of the domestic affections and a father's love when she had come of age scarse had sent for her and had established her in the cottage at chippingholt giving her occasionally a week in london during the season he retained his bachelor chambers in start street piccadilly but never took her there and ever kept her at arm's length when she hungered for sympathy and love no wonder then that in the all important matter of her marriage she felt no inclination to obey the man who had been to her but a father in name and no wonder she had fallen in love with harold burton and was bent now on linking her life with his he was the one human being who had held out to her affection and sympathy and from him she determined no earthly power should part her her father treated her as a pawn on the chessboard of life to be moved about as best suited his own purpose she regarded herself as a human being with the right to consider her own happiness and to work out her own destiny never will i marry van zwieten she reiterated to herself as she dressed for dinner the man is a tyrant and a brute father has done nothing for me that i should sacrifice myself so for him together harold and i will shape a new life for ourselves if father's neglect has done nothing else for me it has at least made me self reliant as she expected her father did not appear at dinner alleging his megrims as the reason for his non appearance but brenda had a very shrewd idea that the appearance of this unknown man who so resembled him had more to do with it she felt sure there was some sort of mystery her father's life was altogether so secretive but she did not let it disturb her and dismissed it from her mind until a chance remark from van zwieten again roused her curiosity the dutchman was tall of stature well over six feet and stout in proportion a well set up figure assuredly and what would be termed a fine animal his hair and beard were of an ochre color and his sleepy blue eyes although seeming to observe nothing on the contrary took in everything his complexion was delicate as a woman's and he was slow and soft of speech and movement a casual observer might have set him down as lethargic and small brained but brenda knew that he possessed a fund of energy and cunning and dogged determination which could be exerted to the detriment of those whom his sleepy looks deceived those blue eyes could sparkle with fire that soft low voice could ring out like a trumpet and that huge frame could be active and supple as any serpent waldo van zwieten he was called and he had lived in london now for the past five years he spoke three or four languages especially english with wonderful purity and fluency he appeared to have plenty of money and for the most part devoted himself to cricket as an exhilarating pastime for an idle man in the capacity of a crack batsman he was highly popular no one deemed him anything but a lazy foreigner good natured and loving england and the english sufficiently well to become an english subject in all but an official sense but he had never taken out letters of naturalization he was correctly attired now in evening dress and took his seat at the table in his usual sleepy fashion his blue eyes rested with a look of admiration on brenda whose blonde beauty was more dazzling than ever in her dinner dress of black gauze and silk she apologized for her father's absence and winced at van zwieten's compliments you leave me nothing to desire miss scarse said he i could wish for no more delightful position than this please don't replied brenda annoyed i'm sure you would rather talk politics to my father than nonsense to me i never talk nonsense to any one miss scarse least of all to you thank you i will take claret by the way it was rather unwise of mr scarse to go out to day with this cold upon him he was not out to day indeed i think so i saw him and spoke to him you spoke to him had he a snuff colored coat and a crape scarf on no he was dressed as usual in his tweed suit brenda looked at him sceptically her father had denied being out yet this man said he had actually spoken with him but according to him he was not dressed like the man harold had described could two men be so much alike and why had her father been so moved when she had related harold's experience are you sure it was my father you spoke to she asked after a pause van zwieten flashed a keen glance at her puzzled face and was evidently as puzzled himself i am certain it was mr scarse he said quietly i had no reason to think otherwise why do you doubt my word my father denies having been out in that case i should have said nothing mr scarse evidently has some reason for his denial but cannot we select a more pleasant subject of conversation such as what demanded brenda wondering at this sudden change yourself or captain burton i saw him to day that is very likely she replied quietly divining van zwieten's intention captain burton is staying at the 'chequers inn' at least he was staying there but he left for london at five oh indeed he must have changed his mind then for it was after six when i saw him i suppose he is privileged to change his mind said brenda all the same she was puzzled to account for harold's remaining at chippingholt thwarted in this direction van zwieten tried another he was bent on making brenda confess an interest in burton so as to lead up to an explanation of his own feelings it is strange said he slowly that captain burton does not stay at the manor why do you think it strange mr van zwieten ach is it not strange his brother wilfred stays there he is there now mr malet is captain burton's cousin and he is hospitable not to me added he with a sleepy smile mr malet does not like me brenda ignored this last remark if you ask captain burton for his reasons i have no doubt he will gratify your curiosity she said coldly oh i do not care it is nothing to me van zwieten paused then resumed very deliberately i do not like captain burton really the loss is his i do not like captain burton repeated van zwieten because he likes you what has that to do with me asked brenda injudiciously everything i love you i want to marry you you told me all about that mr van zwieten and i told you i was unable to marry you it was agreed that we should drop the subject captain burton loves you and wants to marry you pursued the big man doggedly and so i do not like captain burton the situation was becoming embarrassing but the man was evidently acting and speaking with a set purpose please say no more mr van zwieten said brenda trying to control her temper still he went on resolutely when we are married we will see nothing of captain burton that will never be i shall never marry you oh yes your father is willing but i am not brenda rose with a glance of anger how dare you take advantage of my father's absence to insult me i do not insult you went on the dutchman with a quiet smile one does not insult one's future wife i would rather die than marry you she walked to the door you have no right to speak to me like this i refuse to see you again and i shall tell my father of your behavior she swept out of the room in a fury feeling herself helpless in the face of the man's persistency her departure however did not ruffle him in the least he went on eating and smiling as though the interview had ended entirely to his satisfaction after a good meal he lighted a cigar and went along to mr scarse's study the door was locked he knocked but there was no answer van zwieten was puzzled there were matters connected with mr scarse which he did not understand and which he wished very much to understand after pondering for a few moments he put on a greatcoat in spite of the warmth of the night a smasher hat of the boer style and stepped out by the front door thence he passed round to the french windows which lighted the study the blinds were down and the yellow lamplight shone through them from within van zwieten tried the catch of one window it yielded and he slipped into the room the lamp fully turned up was on the table some papers were spread out on the blotting pad on the desk but there was no one in the room he glanced at the papers but could gather nothing from them to account for the absence of scarse he reflected and recollected what brenda had said a snuff colored coat a crape scarf he mused so then he left the room closed the window after him and vanished stealthily as a cat into the blackness of the night meanwhile brenda had gone to her room furious with van zwieten and her father with the former because he would persist in his attentions with the latter because he exposed her to their annoyance not knowing that the dutchman had gone out she decided to remain upstairs so as to avoid meeting him in the drawing room but her bedroom was so small the night so hot and she felt so restless that eventually she decided to go up to holt manor and see lady jenny gilbert's wife was a pretty frivolous woman with a good heart a long tongue and an infinite capacity for wasting money malet was devoted to her and it was common talk that she could twist him round her finger if she interested herself in the matter there might be a chance still of harold's getting the money lady jenny always declared in her exaggerated way that brenda was the sweetest girl in the world so putting on her hat and cloak brenda determined to learn whether lady jenny really was her friend or merely a society acquaintance the night was moonless hot and almost without air what the scotch call uncanny all day clouds had been rolling up from the south and now the sky was an immense mass of bluish black vapor hanging low over the dry and gasping earth no breath of wind no sound of life human or animal the earth lay dumb under that tent of gloom brenda felt stifled as she took the short way through the orchards knowing every inch of the ground she made no mistake and was occasionally aided by a vivid flash of lightning which ran in sheets of sudden flame from east to west with her nimble feet and her knowledge of all the short cuts it took her only twenty minutes to arrive at the manor she noted the time nine o'clock for the village chimes rang out as she halted at the porch of the great house here she was doomed to disappointment for lady jenny as the servant informed her had gone to the rectory with mr wilfred burton mr malet went out for a stroll too miss said the butler who knew her very well but any message oh no message roberts said brenda hurriedly that is i will call on lady jenny to morrow good night won't you have an umbrella miss it looks stormy no thank you i shall no doubt reach home before the storm breaks good night but she was wrong in thinking so hardly had she left the park gates when the storm came a blue zig zag flared across the dark sky there was a crash of thunder and on the wings of a bitterly cold wind came the rain the storm was tropical in its suddenness and fury the wind struck brenda like a solid mass and she had to grasp the trunk of an apple tree near by to keep her feet with a hiss and a shriek the rain shot down one deluge of water as though the windows of heaven were opened as in the days of noah's flood a furious wind tore at the tree tops rending boughs clashing the branches together and sending a myriad leaves flying abroad like swarms of bees the drenching rain spattered and drummed on the woods and in the open was driven in slanting masses of water by the force of the blast anxious to get under shelter and terrified by the fierce lightning brenda kilted up her skirts and ran blindly through the trees at the risk of breaking her head her feet squelched in the soaking grass and she was shaken and driven like a leaf by the furious gusts still on she stumbled in a dazed condition it was a witch storm and the powers of hell rode on the flying clouds suddenly her foot tripped and she fell full length on the grass which was more like a morass as she struggled to her knees the heavens overhead broke out in one dazzling sheet of flame which for the moment threw a noonday light on the scene there under a tree but a short distance away brenda saw a tall dark bulky figure standing hardly had the darkness shut down again when she heard a startled cry then a shot rang out with terrible distinctness and then again the roaring of the tempest hardly knowing what she was doing brenda got on her feet shaking and terrified she ran forward a second flare of lightning lighted the orchards with hell fire livid and blue almost at her feet she saw the body of a man there came another deafening crash of thunder and she staggered a moment later and she lay senseless across the body of the unknown man shot in the darkness by an unknown hand chapter iii the name of the victim the cook at mr scarse's cottage was in a great state of alarm she did not mind an ordinary tempest of respectable english character coming at its due and proper season but this gale at the close of a quiet summer day arriving with so little warning and raging with such fury had frightened her beyond measure as a precautionary measure against the frequent lightning she concealed the knives covered up all the mirrors and reflective surfaces generally and threw the fire irons into the garden having thus safeguarded the cottage against the bolts of heaven mrs daw so she was called insisted that the housemaid a whimpering orphan of meagre intelligence should go round the house with her to see if any one or anything had been struck they found dining room drawing room and bedrooms deserted and the door of their master's study locked lor' said mrs daw her fat face ashen pale an' 'e may be lyin' a corp in there poor dear oh no he ain't responded the shaking housemaid i 'ear voices jus' put your eye to the key hole cook but the cook's valor did not extend thus far she also heard the murmur of voices and thinking her master and his friend the dutchman were within knocked at the door to bring them out for company we may as well go to 'eaven in a 'eap said mrs daw knocking steadily like a woodpecker the door opened so suddenly that the two women recoiled with shrieks against the wall of the passage scarse looking pale and upset stepped out and closed the door after him judging him by themselves they attributed his scared appearance to fright at the storm and were ready to receive any amount of sympathy but it soon appeared that their master had none to give them what's all this why are you here he demanded angry and suspicious it's the storm sir whimpered mrs daw holding on to the housemaid i'm that feared as never was miss brenda's hout sir and mr van zwieten's with you and me an' tilda's a shakin' like jelly miss brenda out repeated scarse starting oh yes i recollect she said something about going to the rectory this was untrue but he seemed to think it necessary to make some excuse even to the servants i dare say miss brenda has been storm bound there and as you say mr van zwieten is with me there is nothing to be afraid of go back to the kitchen the 'ouse may be struck sir the house won't be struck said scarse impatiently don't be a fool it is almost ten o'clock go to bed and stepping back into the study he closed and locked the door cook and housemaid tottered back to the kitchen i'll give notice to morrer wailed the former it ain't right for two lone women to be without a manly arm if 'e only kep' a footman or a coachman it 'ud be a 'elp 'and me the church service tilda an' we'll pray as we may not be took ow ain't it orful yelped tilda as a fiercer blast than usual shook the cottage turn up the berryial service cook this request the cook hurriedly obeyed and the two were soon cheerfully employed in drawing what comfort they could from this somewhat depressing selection the clock struck ten and so unstrung were their nerves that they simultaneously jumped and shrieked tilda declared that the candle burned blue that a coal in the form of a coffin had jumped out of the kitchen range and meanwhile the storm raved and howled without shaking the house tearing at doors and windows as though twenty thousand demons were trying to force an entrance in their terrified frame of mind mrs daw and her factotum actually believed that such might be the case but they soon had further cause for alarm the kitchen door was tried but mrs daw had locked it immediately there came a furious knocking insistent and incessant tilda shrieked and scrambled under the table mrs daw dropped the church service and grasped the poker with a trembling hand there was a crash of thunder which went grinding over the roof then the battering at the door again quick quick let me in wailed a voice thin high pitched and terrified don't don't shrieked tilda grovelling under the table oh lor' wot a bad girl i 'ave been but mrs daw somewhat recovered from her terror thought she recognized the voice in spite of its accent of pain yer's a fool tilda it's miss brenda and she unlocked the door still grasping the poker in case she should be mistaken as the door flew open a wild blast tore into the kitchen and tilda shrieked again mrs daw too uttered an exclamation for brenda fell forward flung into her arms the girl was soaking wet wild eyed and white faced with terror she could hardly speak and clung choking and shaking to the terrified cook the door banged to with a crash murder help gasped brenda hoarsely oh my god he is dead dead murder shrieked mrs daw dropping the poker and tilda wailed in sympathetic chorus lor' miss who's 'e i don't know he is dead shot in the orchards said brenda and fell down in a dead faint for the second time that night usually she was not given to such feminine weakness but the terrors of the night had proved altogether too much for her having something human to deal with mrs daw recovered her presence of mind and unloosened brenda's cloak poor dear she's frightened out of her wits an' no wonder tilda tell 'er pa there's murders and faintings look sharp tilda crawled from under the table and across the floor she raised herself with a sudden effort of will and was soon hammering at the study door master sir 'elp murder perlice oh sir as scarse came out hurriedly miss brenda's in the kitchen an' there's murder he seized her wrists with an ejaculation of alarm who is murdered speak girl i don't know miss brenda sez as there's murder oh lor' what will become of us scarse shook her so that her teeth chattered go back to the kitchen he said sternly i'll follow directly and tilda found herself hurled against the wall with the study door closed and locked her surprise at such treatment overcame even her terror well 'e is a father she gasped and her wits being somewhat more agile now that she was less afraid she flew to the dining room and snatched the spirit stand from the sideboard with this she arrived in the kitchen and found brenda regaining her senses ain't 'e comin' asked mrs daw slapping brenda's hands violently as a restorative measure in a minute 'ere give 'er some brandy where's a glarss oh a cup'll do oh ain't it all dreadful just 'ear the wind hold your tongue and lock the door said mrs daw snatching the cup from tilda come miss try and drink this she forced the strong spirit down brenda's throat the girl gasped and coughed then the color slowly mounted to her cheeks and she raised her head feebly what is it she asked faintly then she shuddered and covered her face ah the murder shot shot oh god how terrible don't you be afraid miss the doors are all locked an' nothin' or no one can git in then a shriek from mrs daw followed a sudden clanging of the bell whatever's that front door replied tilda casting a glance at the row of bells i'll answer give 'er more brandy cook as the housemaid left brenda moaned and struggled to her feet oh the terrible darkness the body his body in the wet grass father where is my father 'e's a comin' dearie said mrs daw giving her more brandy take another sup dearie who is it as is murdered miss she asked in a scared whisper i don't know i could not see the darkness i fell over the body i saw nothing oh she started up with a shriek oh if it really should be harold then she was overcome with anguish and tilda darted back to the kitchen would you believe cried she to mrs daw it's the furriner an' master said as 'e was in 'is study talkin' to 'im lor' so 'e did said mrs daw awestruck at having detected her master in a lie and 'e was out all the time what does mr van zwieten say tilda van zwieten shrieked brenda who was clinging to the table has he been out ah he hated harold the dead man oh her voice leaped an octave he has killed my harold what shrieked the other woman in turn and mrs daw throwing her apron over her head began to scream with the full force of her lungs tilda joined in losing all remnant of control and brenda sank in a chair white faced and silent the conviction that harold had been murdered stunned her at this moment there was heard the sound of foot steps coming rapidly nearer scarse with an angry and terrified expression appeared on the scene close behind him came van zwieten who seemed as ever quite undisturbed and master of himself brenda caught sight of him and darting forward seized the man by the lapels of his coat harold she cried you have killed my harold harold burton replied scarse aghast is he dead dead murdered oh i am certain of it and you killed him you you van zwieten said not a word but remained perfectly calm he saw that the girl was beside herself with terror and grief that she knew not what she was saying or doing without a word he picked her up in his strong arms and carried her moaning and weeping into the drawing room scarse rated mrs daw and tilda sharply for so losing their heads and followed the dutchman but before leaving the kitchen he was careful to take with him the key of the back door no one leaves this house to night he said sharply i must inquire into this give me that spirit stand now go to bed you fools bed wailed mrs daw as her master left the room lor' i'll never sleep again not for weeks any'ow i daren't lie alone oh what an 'orful night i'll give notice to morrow that for sure so'll i squeaked tilda with this the two went shivering to a common couch full of prayers and terror and prepared to die if die they must in company in the drawing room brenda was huddled up in a chair terrified out of her wits van zwieten calm and masterful stood before the fireplace with his big hands clasped loosely before him his trousers were turned up his boots were soaking and there were raindrops in his curly hair for the rest he was dry and the storm had not made the slightest impress on his strong nerves when scarse entered he threw a steely and inquisitive glance at the old man who winced and shrank back with an expression of fear on his face van zwieten ever on the alert for the signs of a guilty conscience noted this with secret satisfaction now then brenda said her father recovering at last some of his presence of mind what is all this about you say that burton is dead that mr van zwieten killed him ah interposed the dutchman stroking his beard i should like to know how i managed that you hated him cried brenda sitting up straight with a sudden access of vigor you told me so to night at dinner pardon me i said i did not like captain burton but as to hating him van zwieten shrugged his shoulders that is an extreme word to use but even if i did hate him you can hardly deduce from that that i should kill him he was shot shot in the orchards not far from the manor gates you were out that is scant evidence to justify a charge of murder interposed scarce angrily you are unstrung and hysterical brenda how did you come to be out yourself in such a storm i went to see lady jenny at the manor about about harold's money she was not in so i came back by the short cut through the orchards a flash of lightning showed him to me there standing under a tree then there was a shot and a cry and i ran forward and fell over his body whose body i don't know at least i think it was harold's body mr van zwieten hated him it may not be harold at all said her father impatiently you are jumping to conclusions the wildest conclusions brenda did you see his face no how could i it was dark then how on earth do you know it was captain burton i am not sure of course but i think so oh father do you think oh perhaps after all it may not have been harold scarse shook off her clinging hands i think you're a fool he said sharply and this wild talk of burton's being dead is pure imagination on your part i hope so oh how i hope so and brenda shivered van zwieten who had been listening with a cynical smile on his face burst into a laugh at which brenda looked angrily at him excuse me miss scarse he said politely but it is my opinion no one is dead at all the shot and cry were no doubt the outcome of a thundercrash you were upset by the storm and it seemed to you like what you say but a man is dead protested brenda rising in my anxiety for harold i may have been mistaken in thinking it was he still some one was shot i fell over the body and fainted the man may have fainted also suggested her father if i may make a suggestion said van zwieten with strong common sense we are all talking without any reasonable sort of basis before we assume that a crime has been committed i would suggest that we go to the orchards and see if we can find the body no no cried scarse shrinking back impossible at this hour and on such a night the storm is dying away said the dutchman derisively however if you don't care to come i can go myself i will go with you cried brenda springing to her feet for you miss scarse i think it is hardly wise you are very much upset had you not better go to bed i couldn't sleep with this on my mind i must know if it is harold or not if it is i am certain you shot him and until i know the truth i don't let you out of my sight very good van zwieten bowed and smiled come then and guide me brenda you can't go out now i forbid you it is not fit or proper what do i care for propriety in such a case as this cried brenda in a passion come with me then father no i can't i am too ill van zwieten cast an amused look at scarse and the old man winced again he turned away and poured himself out a glass of brandy without taking any further notice of him brenda put on her wet cloak and left the room followed almost immediately by the dutchman van zwieten had many questions to ask his host for he knew a good deal and guessed more but this was not the time for cross examination it was imperative that the identity of the deceased should be ascertained and van zwieten wished to be on the spot when the discovery was made as he left the room he heard the glass in scarse's trembling hand clink against the decanter and the sound made him smile he guessed the cause of such perturbation the rain had ceased for the moment but the wind was still high and dense black clouds hurtled across the sky a pale moon showed herself every now and then from behind the flying wrack and fitfully lighted the midnight darkness as she was with van zwieten brenda took a wide circle through the village street there were many people about in spite of the bad weather some with lanterns but brenda could not gather from the scraps of conversation she heard whether the report of the dead man lying in the orchards had got abroad in silence van zwieten strode along beside her apparently indifferent to anything his attitude irritated the girl and when the wind lulled for a moment she demanded sharply where he had been on that night you will be surprised to hear miss scarse that i went to see captain burton and why asked brenda taken aback by this answer the last she had expected to hear to warn him replied van zwieten coolly warn him about what against whom about my engagement to you against myself i am not engaged to you but to him said brenda almost with a cry of despair it seemed impossible to make this man understand how she hated him i think you are engaged to me said the dutchman deliberately you say no but that is girl's talk i am not to be beaten by a girl i always get what i want and i want you the wind rose again and further conversation was impossible brenda walked on praying for strength to escape this terrible man she could not rid herself of the idea that the dead man was her own true lover van zwieten might have seen him as he said might have quarreled with him and shot him the fear chilled her heart and when next the wind fell she again taxed van zwieten you killed him she cried you will insist on that but you are wrong i never saw captain burton he was not at the inn when i called he had gone to town said brenda breathless with joy no he had gone to the rectory brenda stopped short lady jenny had gone to the rectory also perhaps harold had seen her and had asked for her aid while she was wondering if this might be so there was a great shouting and in the distance she saw the blaze of torches borne by many people the wind made them flare furiously ach said van zwieten under his breath they know now in the high wind brenda did not hear him guessing that the concourse meant the discovery of the body she flew along the road like a lapwing the procession was coming toward the manor gates from the direction of the orchards some men were shouting some women screaming but the solid group surrounded by the red smoking lights remained silent van zwieten followed noiselessly and reached the group almost as soon as brenda you see he breathed in the girl's ear he is alive brenda gave a cry of joy and flung herself into the arms of the foremost man harold harold thank god you are safe brenda what are you doing here go back go back no no tell me who who is dead who has been murdered seeing she knew so much harold signed to the men carrying the body to stop they set down the gate on which it rested malet cried brenda as she recognized the features of the corpse it is mr malet chapter iv a strange piece of evidence next morning there was great excitement in chippingholt that a murder should have taken place in that peaceful hamlet was bad enough but that the victim should be the lord of the manor himself was terrible beyond words the body was carried up to the house and the rural constable not feeling himself competent to deal with so unusual an incident sent for instructions to the police station at langton toward midday an inspector and constables came over to investigate the inspector proceeded at once to the manor and interviewed lady jenny her coolness and powers of endurance in such trying circumstances amazed even this stolid official she was a small slightly built woman with a sylph like figure dark blue eyes and dark hair her rose leaf skin was wonderfully delicate of tint and texture and she looked fragile enough to be blown away by a breath of wind she was said to be both frivolous and emotional a shallow creature fond of nothing but pleasure and spending money in this emergency every one expected her to relapse into hysteria and to be quite incapable of any control over her feelings but to their surprise she was all the opposite of this and shed hardly a tear she received the news of the death almost apathetically directed the body to be laid out in the bed which her husband had occupied when alive and herself calmed the emotions of the household indeed wilfred burton was far more upset about the murder than was lady jenny he expressed his amazement at her wonderful self control he was lying on the sofa in her morning room when he spoke to her on the subject some one must manage things said the brave little woman and i know well enough you're incapable poor dear harold could be of use i know but i don't want him just now when i do i'll send for him he was here this morning jenny i know he was i saw him before you were up he told me about the finding of poor gilbert's body who found it branksom the lodgekeeper he was coming home from the village about ten last night and took the short path through the orchards he stumbled over a body in the dark and lit a match to see who it was thinking it was some drunken man the match blew out but he recognized gilbert and saw the blood on his face so he ran back to give the alarm harold who was at the 'chequers' heard of the murder and came with a man to remove the body in fact he was the first to arrive and he examined the corpse before the rest came up wilfred a pale faced delicate looking young man with large dark eyes and a hectic flush on his face shuddered at the calmness with which lady jenny went into these details i don't know how you can do it he gasped putting his hand to his throat like a hysterical woman it is terrible and i thought you were so fond of gilbert yes i was fond of him said lady jenny with emphasis but i learned something about him lately which rather checked my fondness what something that concerned our two selves only wilfred poor gilbert he is dead so i suppose i must forgive him i wonder who killed him said wilfred i wonder of course gilbert made many enemies political enemies yes and private ones also my dear wilfred said lady jenny laying her hand on the young man's arm i wish to speak well of the dead especially as the dead was my husband but gilbert was not a good man wilfred looked at her doubtfully you speak as though you knew something so i do but that something has nothing to do with the murder i have no more idea who killed him than you have this conversation was interrupted by a message from inspector woke asking to see lady jenny so she left the room at once mr inspector a fat stolid little man much flurried by the unusual responsibility resting on his shoulders had already seen the doctor and those who had found the body he set about opening up the matter in his own way i have seen the doctor my lady he said wiping his face and breathing hard he tells me the deceased must have been murdered at about half past nine last night the wound is on the right temple and as the skin and hair are burned and blackened with gunpowder the shot must have been fired at close quarters death must have come very speedily my lady we can find no bullet as it passed right through the deceased's head and no weapon although we have searched the orchards all the evidence my lady must be circumstantial we must find out who had a grudge against the deceased or who had an interest in his death lady jenny arranged the ruffles of crape round her neck she was in mourning for her father and had been for some weeks and laughed coldly she thought very little of this elaborate explanation and less of the man who made it the inspector she took to be a man of the smallest intelligence and one wedded to the red tapeism and stereotyped routine of criminal procedure as conducted by the police generally mr malet had many enemies she said quietly he was a politician and at one time not so long ago was connected with the war office can you tell me the names of any who had a grudge against him my lady no he told me he had enemies but gave no explanation nor did i seek any but this is a circumscribed neighborhood mr woke and not over populated if a stranger came down to murder my husband we should have no difficulty in getting a description of him woke pricked up his ears does your ladyship then suspect some stranger it is only an idea of mine replied lady jenny coldly i have no reasonable grounds for making a definite assertion still my husband was popular to a certain extent in chippingholt and i know no one i can think of no person likely to desire his death it might have been a stranger mused woke rural murders do not use revolvers as a rule and if they did it would hardly be at such close quarters as this can you inform me of the movements of this household last night my lady certainly we dined at seven as usual the night was hot and airless before the storm so my husband said he would go out for a walk he put a light coat over his evening dress and strolled through the park it was after eight when he went out he did not say where he was going no merely remarked that he would like a breath of fresh air that was the last i saw of him after eight i received a message from captain burton asking if i could call and see him at the rectory why did he not wait on your ladyship here lady jenny changed color and her hands became restless he was not on good terms with my husband they quarrelled over some family matter and captain burton refused to enter this house again oh said woke significantly and where was captain burton last night he stayed at the 'chequers' but as of course i could not meet him at a public house he asked me to go to the rectory the rector is a mutual friend did you go i left shortly before nine o'clock with mr wilfred burton who is he my lady my husband's cousin captain burton's brother he is staying at the manor and has been here for the last month oh grunted woke again it seemed to be his method of expressing satisfaction then mr wilfred burton was not on bad terms with the deceased no they were excellent friends mr burton is rather nervous and delicate and my husband was careful of his health i asked mr burton to go with me to the rectory and he agreed we left this house shortly before nine o'clock on the way mr burton stumbled and twisted his ankle so he returned to the house and i went on alone before i got to the rectory the storm burst and it was so violent that i grew afraid i was taking a path through the woods and got under a tree for shelter as i was nearer the manor than the rectory i determined to return and explain to captain burton in the morning it was ten o'clock when i got back soaking and tired out i was waiting a long time under the trees for the rain to go off and so it was late when i returned then i went to bed but was awakened about midnight by the news of my husband's murder and mr burton he did not get back until ten either in fact we arrived almost at the same time for his foot became so painful that he could walk only with great difficulty he also was caught in the storm oh said the inspector again i should like to see mr burton certainly lady jenny rose is there anything else you would like to ask me not at present my lady i will examine your household first as wilfred's foot was sprained the inspector was shown into the morning room it was a case of the mountain coming to mahomet mr woke being a veritable mountain of official dignity he looked curiously at the pale young man lying on the sofa and seeing he was in pain examined him as gingerly as possible wilfred was quite ready to give an account of his movements although he expressed some surprise that such information should be required surely you don't suspect me of complicity in this dastardly crime mr inspector dear me no certainly not replied the jovial woke rubbing his hands but i am examining the whole household it is wonderful what evidence may be gathered by such means indeed i have got some evidence already it may bear on the case or it may not what is it asked wilfred listlessly and winced as his foot gave a twinge i'll tell you later sir first relate your movements please last night young burton gave an account coinciding with that of lady jenny my foot must have got twisted he said for it grew very painful and the ankle is a good deal swollen otherwise i should not have let lady jenny go on alone but she was anxious to see my brother and insisted on going it was a few minutes past nine when she left me i tried to walk but could not then the rain came on and i dragged myself under a tree i got soaked through and thinking i should probably catch a severe chill i am not strong mr woke i set my teeth to it and hobbled home i found a stake which i used as a crutch but the pain was so great that i could only walk very slowly no one was about who could help me it was so late i got home after ten and the butler helped me in then i went to bed and put cold water bandages on my foot it is easier now you should get the doctor to see it mr burton the doctor has been too busy examining poor malet's body said wilfred i shall see him soon have you any idea who murdered mr malet sir great heavens no the whole case is a mystery to me mr malet had many enemies i believe he said he had but i think he spoke generally rather than of any particular person or persons so far as i know he had no enemy who specially desired his death the inspector looked grave and a trifle ill at ease mr burton he said at length are you aware that your brother was on bad terms with mr malet they were not friendly admitted wilfred looking anxious there was a disagreement about my brother's marriage but come now my brother hasn't anything to do with the affair well said woke pinching his chubby chin it's just this way sir i have been making inquiries and i find that your brother and the deceased had a violent quarrel yesterday afternoon in this house i know that but a quarrel does not mean murder confound it sir i won't listen to your insinuations mr woke went on coolly and deliberately i questioned roberts the butler he said and the man admitted that captain burton had used threatening language how did roberts know he overheard captain burton at the open door of the library he spoke loud enough for the whole house to hear so roberts says but there happened to be nobody else about go on cried wilfred flushed and impatient let me hear what my brother said he called mr malet a swindler and said he would make it hot for him wilfred smiled derisively really and on such words used in a moment of anger you would accuse my brother of a brutal crime i don't accuse him sir retorted woke hotly but i should like an explanation of his words i dare say he will furnish you with one wilfred forgot his sprained ankle now and sat up filled with indignation and let me tell you mr woke he went on the explanation will be such as to clear my brother wholly from all suspicion he is the best fellow in the world and i would as soon believe myself guilty of this thing as him suspect whom you please but not my brother but the phlegmatic officer was quite unmoved by this outburst natural enough he said oh i don't blame you for standing up for the captain sir and i dare say for that matter he may be able to furnish an alibi as he was at the rectory waiting for her ladyship all the same i am bound to inquire further into this quarrel i don't accuse him mind mr woke shook his forefinger but i can't help having my suspicions he paused and asked suddenly who is miss scarse sir the daughter of mr scarse mp and the lady to whom my brother is engaged to be married mr malet disapproved of the marriage that was the reason he and captain burton quarrelled scarse scarse repeated the inspector rising i've heard of him he's the gentleman that's always writing and talking tall about the boers isn't he i believe he is what is called a little englander an unpopular part at present mr burton i am an imperialist myself h'm so miss scarse is engaged to captain burton is she she called here at nine last night and asked for lady jenny roberts tells me perhaps you'll accuse her of the murder next said wilfred contemptuously i accuse no one as yet sir but i must have my facts quite clear and i go to get them good day sir and mr woke departed to call in at the chequers with captain burton still the central figure in his mind but harold was not at the inn late in the morning he had called at the cottage to see brenda and discuss with her the very stirring events of the previous might she received him in the drawing room and thankful to find that he was alive and well embraced him more than ever affectionately the poor girl looked ill and pale for all this trouble had shaken her nerves more than she cared to confess and in truth harold himself did not feel much better although he showed it less markedly mr scarse being shut up as usual in his study they had the room to themselves van zwieten had gone out i had no chance dear of speaking to you last night said harold tell me how you came to hear about this murder harold dear i saw it committed the man turned pale you saw it committed he repeated why brenda who did it i don't know i had gone to the manor to see lady jenny i thought she might be able to help you about this money and on my way home i was caught in the storm in a vivid flash of lightning i saw mr malet sheltering under a tree i did not know then that it was mr malet after that i heard a cry and then a shot i ran forward and stumbled over the body then i fainted i think but as soon as i was able i made my way home it was only when i met you that i knew that mr malet was the victim oh harold dearest i thought all the time it was you what on earth put such an idea as that into your head he asked in amazement i don't know van zwieten had told me he hated you and i am afraid of van zwieten he told me he went to see you at the inn and i thought you might have quarrelled and she threw out her hands oh dearest it is only because you are so much to me i suppose that i thought it must be you oh harold the thought nearly drove me mad but why did van zwieten want to see me to insist that you should give me up give you up confound his dutch impertinence said harold angrily dearest i am afraid of that man said brenda clinging to him yes terribly afraid he will not leave me alone he speaks as though he were perfectly certain i should have to marry him in that case the most effectual method of putting an end to his presumption will be for you to marry me dear and that at once remember the twenty thousand pounds comes to me now harold the money is yours but how malet's control of the fund died with him now that he is dead nothing can prevent my getting it we can be married straight away dear we should have done that in any case harold but now oh do let us go to london at once for until we are really married i shall not be able to shake off my fear of this man i know i sha'n't nonsense brenda he can be nothing to you why you told me you detested the man so i do i loathe him but he is so determined and wicked and so unscrupulous that somehow i fear him i is he here now yes but i believe he goes this afternoon he may meet us in london harold and give us trouble there believe me he is dangerous give me the legal right to protect you brenda said harold and you need not fear van zwieten he is a brute i don't know how your father can tolerate him simply because mr van zwieten is going out to the transvaal government and father has taken up the boer cause if kruger goes on as he is doing there won't be any transvaal government at all in a few months don't you bother about van zwieten dear as soon as poor malet is buried i shall go up to london and see about the money there will be an inquest i suppose of course the police are at the manor now i went over to offer my services to jenny but she did not want me and sent out to say so poor little woman i don't see how she's going to manage matters i hope she'll have enough to live on why i thought mr malet was rich he was but he spent money freely and gambled a good deal harold looked uneasy i tell you what brenda i sha'n't be easy in my mind until i know that my money and wilfred's is safe malet had supreme control over it and for all i know he may have made ducks and drakes with it well if he has we'll have to do without it that's all replied the girl by the way dear why didn't you go to town last night as we arranged i changed my mind it struck me that jenny might manage to succeed with malet where i had failed i didn't go up to the house because i didn't want to meet him so i sent her a note asking her to come to the rectory you know mr slocum is one of my oldest friends how strange said brenda wonderingly i had exactly the same idea that was why i went to the manor last night when i got there they told me lady jenny had gone to the rectory i didn't see her said harold grimly i waited till nine and as she hadn't turned up then i went back to the inn there later on i heard of the murder and went to look at the body although we had quarrelled i felt sorry for the poor devil when i heard of his violent death poor mr malet sighed brenda i wonder who killed him and why well i can't say why dear but i have an idea who it was that shot him who who that man i mistook for your father brenda turned pale remembering her father's agitation impossible why do you think so i examined the body first before the others came up i found the right hand was clenched and by the light of the lantern i opened it it was grasping a scrap of crape a scrap of crape but what has brenda's voice died in her throat don't you remember my description that old man wore a crape scarf chapter v van zwieten shows his teeth this unexpected piece of evidence caused brenda no little uneasiness she reflected that the man with the crape scarf had so closely resembled her father as to be mistaken for him and then she remembered how her father had refused to give any information concerning this double of his there was also the fact of his avowed hatred of malet do what she would she could not rid herself of the idea that through this third person so like himself her father was in some way connected with the murder and little as she loved him the thought of it shocked and terrified her she told harold what had passed between them in the study and unbosomed herself of her suspicions to him in reply he asked her a few straightforward questions did your father refuse to speak of this man brenda absolutely he sent me out of the room he was uneasy more than uneasy said the girl with emphasis he was terrified there is great mystery in all this harold in some way my father is connected with this man for all i know he may be a relative i am very ignorant of my family history h'm have you seen your father this morning no he did not come to breakfast and i did not go to his study knowing that he dislikes to be disturbed well we must go to his study now said harold rising for i am sure that the man with the crape scarf killed malet and your father may be able to throw some light on the subject harold you don't think my father who can tell brenda we must face the facts and see him in any case i am the only person who knows about this scrap of crape and i shall keep the information to myself now come along dear and let's hunt him up when they reached the study they found it empty on the table lay a note for brenda in her father's handwriting it informed her very curtly that he had gone up to london for the day and would return that same evening harold looked grave and brenda was perplexed it was so unexpected mr scarse seemed to be doing all he could to heap suspicion on his own head does he usually go off in this sudden fashion asked captain burton yes and no sometimes he tells me sometimes he leaves a note after all harold we may be altogether mistaken perhaps father knows nothing at all about it i hope so brenda but from what you say he certainly knows this man and it is strange there should be such a striking resemblance between them the scrap of crape might easily have been torn off the scarf in the struggle but there was no struggle said brenda eagerly i saw mr malet for one moment when the lightning flashed the next i heard a cry and it was followed at once by a shot there was no time for a struggle you heard the cry first and then the shot yes the shot must have killed the poor man at once he did not cry again harold reflected i saw dr lincoln this morning at the manor he said slowly he deduces from the blackened skin and singed hair that the shot must have been fired at close quarters now if the murderer saw malet by that lightning flash and was close at hand he no doubt sprang forward and clutched the poor devil's arm while he placed the muzzle of the weapon at his temple in that case malet would utter a cry and the next moment drop dead in his agony he might have gripped at the crape scarf and have torn off the piece i found clenched in his hand that is all purely hypothetical said brenda fighting against her doubts i know it is but it seems to me the only way to account for your hearing the cry first and for this piece of crape being in the hand of the corpse depend upon it brenda your father can throw some light on the subject well as he's gone to town there's nothing for it but to wait till he comes back meanwhile i won't say anything about the piece of crape to any one and what are you going to do now she asked as he moved toward the study door return to the inn i should like to know if any one else saw this stranger and if they mistook him as i did for your father harold harold do be careful implored brenda we may be misjudging father altogether dear don't i beg of you get him into any trouble on the contrary dear my object is to get him out of trouble if i don't succeed in arriving at some explanation of this queer confusion of identities the police may take it up then it would be dangerous good bye dear i shall be back shortly brenda waved her hand as he left her and returned to the study she was filled with ominous foreboding and trembled at the thought of possible complicity on the part of her father his pronounced hatred of malet his agitation at the mention of the stranger the odd idea of the crape scarf worn by the supposed criminal and the morsel of it in the dead man's hand these things collectively formed a mystery which brenda could not fathom she looked again at the note which intimated that her father had gone to town and from the straggling scratching character of the handwriting she gathered that he must have been greatly agitated when he wrote it afterward she went to the kitchen and skillfully questioned mrs daw and tilda about their master's departure both declared that he had said nothing to them about it it seemed likely then that he had made up his mind on a sudden impulse and gone off in a hurry brenda wondered vainly what it could all mean and then rebuked herself severely for her suspicions after all her father would no doubt be able to give good reason for his hurried departure when he returned the surrounding circumstances strange as they were might prove to be all that was natural and obvious in the light of what he would have to say the dawn had brought wisdom to mrs daw and the housemaid too for they no longer spoke of giving notice they were chattering like parrots about the murder many exaggerated and wholly imaginary details of which had been supplied by butcher baker and milkman but brenda learned that as yet no one was definitely suspected of the crime and that the villagers were hopelessly bewildered at its committal about the stranger no word was said and somewhat relieved in her mind brenda gave her orders for the day and returned to the study she sat down before the fire which was lighted as usual in spite of the summer warmth and gave herself up to thoughts of harold these were pleasant enough but occasionally there would come the recollection of van zwieten and his calm insistence that she should be his wife then she shuddered for the man fascinated her as a serpent fascinates a bird there were moments when it came upon her that he might get his way in spite of her repulsion idly looking into the fire she noticed a fine white ash under the grate disposed in a regular line at first she took no heed of it but presently she became aware that this was no coal dbris and her eye travelled along the line until she found an unburnt piece of the material the remainder of which was ash growing pale she bent down and picked up a tiny piece of crape undoubtedly it was crape there was enough saved from the burning to swear by brenda turned faint from the long narrow outline of the white ash from the scrap of material she held in her hand it was certain that her father had flung a crape scarf under the grate and had set fire to it and she guessed that the scarf was the one worn by the stranger the scarf from which the morsel in harold's possession had been torn motionless and terrified she pondered over the meaning of this destruction before she could come to any conclusion there was a shadow thrown across the floor and brenda her nerves shaken jumped up with a slight scream to see van zwieten step into the room through the french window he looked unusually well pleased with himself and smiled blandly when he saw her in fact she detected an exulting expression in his blue eyes which vaguely terrified her with the instinct to conceal the discovery of the burnt scarf she thrust the scrap into her pocket and turned to welcome van zwieten with a smile he looked at the fire at her action and seemed to connect the two but he said nothing no doubt he thought she had been about to burn something and that he had interrupted her aha miss scarse he said politely i have been walking in the orchards to have a look at the spot where i murdered that man brenda was annoyed at his satire and rather foolishly showed her annoyance you should make allowance for my state of mind last night she said irritably i spoke without thinking besides i accused you of killing harold not poor mr malet quite so but you might as well say i killed the one as the other pardon me i will say no more i have been to the place where the poor man was murdered and i have made discoveries ah you english you have no eyes dozens of people have been round this morning but they have seen nothing i have seen much what have you seen what have you discovered asked brenda anxiously van zwieten clicked his heels together in foreign fashion and bowed miss scarse i am a wise man he said smiling wise men never talk but if you will be wise also and give me the right to tell you what i know why then how can i give you the right by accepting me as your future husband no a thousand times no i am engaged to captain burton ah captain burton i quite forgot that young gentleman i have something to say to him he is no doubt still at his hotel i will call if your object is to make him give me up you may save yourself the trouble of calling said brenda quietly we are engaged and nothing you can say or do can break our engagement ah i think otherwise mr van zwieten will you understand once and for all that i refuse to have anything to do with you i refuse to marry you van zwieten shook his head i cannot accept your refusal i have made up my mind that you shall marry me and marry me you must i have a strong will miss scarse i also and so has captain burton you can't bully me into being your slave pardon me i should be the slave said the dutchman blandly as for captain burton poof i will sweep him from my path when he is in south africa i shall be there also he is not going to south africa oh yes i think so he is a soldier and your soldiers will have much to do in south africa shortly mr van zwieten i believe you are a boer spy indeed why do you believe so you seem to be so certain of the war you are going out to the transvaal i am you too miss scarse as my wife ah do not look angry you must accept the inevitable with a good grace as to my being a spy there is no need for me to act so low a part as that i think there will be war because i read the sign of the times europe is with us did your friend dr leyds tell you so she asked scornfully perhaps but this is idle talk i am not what you think me when the time comes you will know what i intend you to know so sure am i that you will be my wife that i am content to return to london this day and leave you with captain burton the sooner you go the better pleased i shall be ach what english hospitality how charmingly said brenda turned on him with tears of rage in her eyes you force me to be rude she said almost breaking down in the face of this persistence i have never been spoken to as you speak to me an english gentleman can take 'no' for an answer but i love you too much to accept such an answer if you loved me you would not worry me so please go mr van zwieten oh i wish my father were here to protect me cried poor brenda keeping back her tears with difficulty call him miss scarse he has not gone out to day has he he has gone to london clever and self possessed as van zwieten was this intelligence disconcerted him he started and frowned to london he repeated he was here a couple of hours ago brenda handed him the note left by her father and turned away you can see for yourself i suppose you will go after luncheon van zwieten read the note and frowned again yes i will go after luncheon he said in the meantime i will see captain burton i think oh yes i think i shall come to terms with that young gentleman till luncheon miss scarse and bowing with a mocking smile he stepped out of the window leaving brenda puzzled and uneasy meanwhile harold was talking with inspector woke at the inn he had found that official waiting for him on his return from the cottage and had at once consented to his request for a private conversation he had no idea that woke suspected him in any way and answered his questions with the utmost frankness i went to the rectory last night to see mr slocum who is an old friend of mine he said and left here about eight o'clock it was shortly after nine when i returned at what time did you arrive here asked woke watching his companion's face about ten o'clock oh and you left the rectory at nine did it take you an hour to walk a quarter of a mile captain burton stared and his dark face flushed i don't know why you wish me to answer you so precisely he said haughtily but it so happened that i was caught in the storm and stood under a tree for some time the storm again murmured woke rubbing his chin lady jenny malet and your brother were both caught in the storm i know that retorted burton impatiently lady jenny was coming to the rectory to see me on business this morning i learned that she was caught in the storm and turned back my brother sprained his foot i know all this well mr malet was murdered at half past nine so the doctor told me well harold was so unsuspicious that the inspector felt uncomfortable and did not know very well how to put his doubts into words did you see mr malet last night he asked no i did not oh if you had would you have spoken to him what the devil do you mean asked captain burton sharply only this that i have been informed at the manor by roberts the butler if you want to know that you and mr malet had a quarrel yesterday we had over family business that has nothing to do with you i'm not so sure about that said woke drily you used threats you said you would make it hot for him captain burton jumped up with clenched fists are you trying to make out that i murdered malet he asked savagely if so put your meaning more clearly and i shall know how to defend myself i don't say you murdered him protested woke soothingly but you quarrelled with him you threatened him and you were out of doors between nine and ten during which time he was killed the position is suspicious don't be angry captain burton i am only doing my duty of course you can prove an alibi i can give you my word that i did not see malet last night i saw his body after i had been informed of his murder as to an alibi no one saw me after i left the rectory so far as i know i stood under a tree for a time then i walked round by mr scarse's cottage had you any particular reason to do so captain burton flushed and bit his lip i could refuse to answer that question he said at length but as you suspect me i will be as candid as possible i am engaged to miss scarse and i went round with the intention of seeing her on the same matter about which i went to the rectory however i concluded it was too late so i returned here you answer frankly captain burton said woke rather disconsolately and i say again i don't accuse you of the crime harold bowed ironically have you any idea who committed it no replied burton keeping his own counsel i have not woke rose to go then he looked at harold and hesitated finally he spoke in a confidential tone do you know if mr scarse is mad was his strange question burton suppressed a smile not that i know of he replied wonderingly why because he was seen in the village yesterday afternoon with a yard or two of crape around his neck crape captain burton a strange material for a scarf very strange replied burton keeping strict guard on his tongue he saw that other people besides himself had mistaken the stranger for scarse but he did not correct the inspector lest he might say too much for brenda's sake it would not do for that subject to be gone into too minutely you had better see mr scarse yourself about the matter said he at length he has gone up to town but may return this evening woke nodded and withdrew he had not gained much by his conversation harold was evidently guiltless or at all events there seemed to be no evidence to connect him with the crime the poor inspector accustomed to open murders of the poker or hatchet order was wholly at a loss how to deal with the intricate criminal problem presented to him he could not find the weapon with which the crime had been committed he could gain no tangible intelligence likely to fasten the crime on to any one person at last utterly perplexed he took himself off harold watched him go with some sense of relief he saw that the case handled by a man of such inexperience and meagre intelligence would come to nothing and for brenda's sake he was glad he could not help thinking that scarse was in some way connected with the matter much would depend upon the explanation he had to give regarding his double until that mystery was solved nothing could be done he was still pondering over the pros and cons of it all when he was interrupted by the waiter with the intelligence that mr van zwieten wished to see him wondering what his rival could have to say to him he directed that he should be shown in when van zwieten appeared harold received him coldly he did not offer to shake hands you wish to see me was all he said ach yes replied van zwieten with a beaming smile you will let me sit down he threw himself lightly on the sofa thank you yes captain burton i have come to see you about a lady i know whom you mean said harold his voice tremulous with rage and i must ask you to leave that lady's name unspoken i refuse to discuss the matter you have come about it will be better for you to agree said van zwieten with a steely gleam of his blue eyes i come to see you about more than miss scarse harold sat down suddenly it flashed across him that the dutchman knew something connected with the crime so significantly did he speak resolved to know the worst he decided to let him have his say although he winced at the idea of brenda's name on the lips of the man however there was no help for it the position was dangerous and this was not the time for squeamishness say what you have to say and go then he said holding himself in hand i can say that in a few words said van zwieten you are engaged to be married to miss scarse yes assented burton breathing quickly know then that i love her captain burton and i wish to marry her miss scarse has consented to marry me you have oh damn you get out or i'll kick you how dare you talk about miss scarse about my private affairs the young man was on his feet furious with rage it wanted little to make him hurl himself on van zwieten but the dutchman never flinched never ceased to smile you must give up miss scarse to me i'll see you at the devil first was the fierce reply in that case i must talk of your private affairs you have done so you are doing so not yet but now captain burton i hold you in the hollow of my hand what do you mean asked the startled harold van zwieten bent forward and spoke low for a few moments when he had finished captain burton's face was grey and drawn and terror stricken the dutchman continued to smile chapter vi what mr scarse admitted for the next week brenda lived in a state of bewilderment everything seemed to go wrong her father did not return but wrote that his things were to be sent on to london and that brenda herself was to leave the cottage in charge of mrs daw and come up in a fortnight's time van zwieten bowed himself out of chippingholt without having told her of his interview with harold with his usual cunning he had left harold himself to do that but harold leaving a message for brenda that he was suddenly recalled to his regimental duties had himself left by a later train without either explanation or word of farewell brenda was hopelessly at a loss to understand her lover's action and in her despair sought lady jenny it was a week after the inquest and the two women were seated in lady jenny's boudoir a pleasant rose hued room which looked out on to a dutch garden the usual verdict of willful murder against some person or persons unknown had been brought in by the usual opaque country jury directed by a not over intelligent coroner gilbert malet's body had been laid away in the family vault and lady jenny was utilizing for her husband the mourning she had worn for her father brenda was paying her now a visit of condolence but lady jenny showed clearly by her manner and curt speech that she stood in no need of sympathy it was amazing to see the change that had taken place in her since her husband's death formerly she had been a gay frivolous little woman with ever a smile on her face now brenda found her a small image of stone as hard and every whit as cold she could scarcely believe it was the same woman finding that her sympathetic references to the dead man were received with coldness brenda tactfully changed the conversation she mentioned her own anxiety about harold's abrupt departure and found lady jenny quite ready to talk on that subject she loved brenda and admired harold and wished to see them married consequently she was only too glad to smooth down brenda's feathers which were a good deal ruffled by her lover's strange behavior my dear you know a soldier's time is not his own she said i expect harold got a telegram and had just time to pack and catch the first train he should have sent for me said brenda i should have seen him off at the station well i've no doubt he will explain his reasons when you meet in town you go there next week and harold is only at aldershot he has written to you several times and always fondly but he has never explained his leaving without seeing me it's no good lady jenny i confess i am angry yet he may have avoided seeing me on account of the murder lady jenny looked up sharply why should he brenda hesitated she was thinking of harold's suspicions regarding her father and did not want to tell them to the dead man's widow for the moment she had forgotten to whom she was speaking but having committed herself so far she was obliged to get out of the difficulty as best she could you know inspector woke suspected harold she said nervously avoiding lady jenny's sharp black eyes he said i know i know woke told me of his suspicions he's a fool to suspect harold of killing gilbert just because they had a few words is ridiculous and i told him so nobody will ever know who killed gilbert you speak very confidently said brenda amazed at her hard tone because i feel confident retorted the other there is not a scrap of evidence against any one all that could be said was said at the inquest woke and his police have been doing their best to get at the truth and have failed the revolver was not found no one knew why gilbert went out walking on that night or whom he met and oh the whole thing is over and done with it is only one more of the many undiscovered crimes do you suspect any one not a soul why should i gilbert had many enemies so he said but i don't know any of them and i don't suppose any one of them would have gone the length of murder the police here are such sillies put in brenda why don't you get a clever detective down from london because i think the case is hopeless my dear said the widow gloomily and because it would cost a great deal too much money i have not yet gone into the affairs of the estate but i am afraid i shall not be over well off gilbert would play and i suppose i was extravagant we lived far beyond our means this place is mortgaged heavily what the manor asked brenda startled yes all our property is mortgaged i expect i shall be left with nothing but the ten thousand pounds for which gilbert's life was insured fortunately it was settled on me at the time of our marriage so his creditors can't touch it i hate being poor cried lady jenny viciously and so far as i can see i shall be very poor i had no idea things were so bad nor had i until six months ago when gilbert told me we have lived from hand to mouth since then all gilbert's efforts have been directed to staving off ruin brenda's heart sank within her what about harold's money oh harold and wilfred are all right said lady jenny hastily at least i suppose so gilbert always said that he took good care of their money and i think he did he was not the man to place himself within reach of the law by appropriating trust monies at least i can't believe he would do such a thing but next week the whole matter will be gone into then i suppose you and harold will get married of course in any case money or no money we shall be married oh i don't know it's absurd marrying on nothing gilbert was well off when i became his wife or i shouldn't have married him had i known he was a gambler i should have refused him he made a nice mess of his life i thought you loved him i did a deal better than he deserved said lady jenny bitterly but but oh what is the use of talking he was a bad man another woman his fault and i my dear don't you trust harold all men are bad i always understood mr malet was devoted to you so did i until i found him out it came about in the strangest way the discovery i mean lady jenny paused as though considering whether to speak out or not finally she decided to hold her tongue but then these things concern only myself said she abruptly he deceived me i was jealous that is all you need know but i cannot say that i sorrow for him now that he is dead oh how can you speak so because i am a woman and jealous when harold deceives you brenda you will feel as i do feel that you could kill him with your own hand lady jenny looked suddenly at the girl's blonde beauty but no you are a cold saxon girl with little such spirit in you i my father was irish my mother italian and i have in me all the fire of celt and latin it was well for gilbert that he died when he did she said between her teeth i don't know what i should have done the bitterness and passion with which she spoke were both new to brenda who had never suspected her of such depth of feeling being in the dark more or less concerning its cause she hardly knew what to say so she held her peace she felt that nothing she could say would alter her friend's feelings and might possibly even aggravate them after a turn up and down the room the widow resumed her seat and seemed to become calmer where are you going to stay in town brenda with my aunt mrs st leger in kensington my father always lives in his own rooms you know he doesn't want to be troubled with a grown up daughter he won't be troubled long if harold is to be believed you mean our marriage no but you know my father doesn't approve of it he wants me to marry mr van zwieten that dutchman horrid creature i never could bear him gilbert liked him though indeed said brenda rather surprised mr van zwieten told me he and mr malet were not friendly lady jenny laughed in a way not good to hear very likely van zwieten is cunning slim as his countrymen call it i know more about him though than he thinks do you know who he is yes i know who he is and how he makes his money and why he is in england how did you find out asked brenda breathlessly oh that i mustn't tell you suppose you were to tell van zwieten tell him repeated miss scarse her face crimson her eyes bright why i hate him more than any man i ever knew he wants to marry me and won't take a refusal my father supports him and for harold's sake i have to fight them both and you are not afraid of so formidable a foe said the widow seeing her eyes droop not of my father but i am afraid of mr van zwieten he is a terrible man and has so powerful a will that he can almost impose it on mine there is something hypnotic about him and i feel scarcely mistress of myself when he is near me nonsense you are fanciful child indeed indeed i am not protested the girl eagerly but you don't know how strong and obstinate he is he never loses his temper he just looks and looks with those terrible eyes of his and repeats his desire his will his intentions over and over again i feel like a rabbit in the presence of a snake and that's why i want harold and me to be married soon because i feel if we are not mr van zwieten will compel me in spite of myself lady jenny bent forward and caught brenda's wrists my dear if van zwieten tries these pranks on you send for me if any one can save you from him i can but how that is my affair van zwieten may be all you say but i can make him afraid of me now you must go my dear i have a lot of letters to write brenda went off much puzzled over lady jenny's attitude toward van zwieten evidently she knew something to the man's disadvantage but brenda was doubtful whether her friend could use her knowledge sufficiently cleverly to crush the dutchman his resource was extraordinary and he was clever and unscrupulous enough to be able to defend himself in an emergency however she felt it was no use trying to forecast the future she resolved to keep out of van zwieten's way and get harold to marry her as soon as possible once she was mrs burton the dutchman would be obliged to cease persecuting her for the next few days brenda was fully occupied with her packing as harold was in london or rather so near london that he could come up there quickly she was glad to be going she felt she must see him and have from him an explanation and an understanding as to when their marriage could take place at her aunt's she would be safe from van zwieten since mr st leger did not like him but brenda knew well that for his own ends whatever these might be her father would as ever insist on her favoring van zwieten the only way to put an end to the intolerable situation was to marry harold with that her father would no doubt wash his hands of her but at least she would be relieved from the persecutions of the dutchman and would have some one to love and protect her so it was with thankfulness that brenda left the cottage in the train she found a travelling companion whom she did not expect none other than harold's brother wilfred's foot was now quite well and he looked better in health than when brenda had last seen him he joined her at langton junction and they travelled up in the same carriage which they were fortunate enough to have to themselves she was pleased that it was so for she wanted to talk confidentially with wilfred they were the best of good friends i am so glad your foot is all right again wilfred she said cheerfully it is such a painful thing a sprain yet for all that i am not sorry i sprained it said wilfred turning his thin white face toward the girl not sorry what do you mean oh it's an ill wind you know yes i suppose it is but it's difficult to see what sort of 'good' one can look for from a sprained ankle well in this instance i fancy it did me a good turn you see it rendered me physically helpless for the time being my dear wilfred i confess you puzzle me do i well i'll tell you what i mean the night almost the hour i sprained my ankle poor malet was shot so no one can possibly accuse me of having shot him but who would dare to accuse you of such a thing oh i don't know that fool of an inspector was quite prepared to fix his beastly suspicions on harold told me as much i know but then you see harold and mr malet quarrelled that was the reason mr woke was suspicious but of course harold laughed at the idea i should think so i confess the whole thing licks me i can't imagine who can have done it no one knows lady jenny says no one ever will know i suppose not it seems to be relegated to the list of undiscovered crimes do you know brenda i have had my suspicions a cold hand clutched the girl's heart she immediately thought of her father have you she faltered of whom well i wouldn't tell every one as i have really no sort of basis for them they are the purest suspicions but i suspect that big dutchman who was staying at your place van zwieten brenda's mind ran over the events of that terrible night the dutchman had been out he had come in after her but again her father had told the servants that van zwieten was in the study with him a distinct falsehood whichever way she looked at it her father seemed to be mixed up in the matter yet what possible motive could van zwieten have had to impel him to such a crime she asked wilfred it might be a political crime said the young man his face lighting up as it invariably did when he talked politics gilbert was an imperialist always preaching and writing against the boers van zwieten is dutch and is going out to an appointment at pretoria also he is an intimate friend of dr leyds he might have wished to get gilbert out of the way because he was dangerous to his schemes surely he wouldn't have gone the length of murder for such a reason oh i don't know if he could without being found out i am certain he would i don't say van zwieten fired the shot himself but he might have hired some one to do it what makes you think that wilfred well i was talking to the station master at chippingholt he said that a man in a dark overcoat with a soft hat pulled over his eyes went to langton junction by the train the last train on that night van zwieten saw him off at the station he was seen to follow the man to the compartment and put his head through the window there was evidently an understanding between them now you know brenda few strangers come to chippingholt for there is nothing to see there it was odd to say the least of it that van zwieten should have seen this fellow off moreover he just left after the murder was committed i don't see though how you are justified from this in thinking that either van zwieten or the other man is implicated in the murder said brenda after a pause they might simply have met on business what sort of business i can't say i am not in mr van zwieten's confidence wilfred's eyes flashed i wish i was he said emphatically i believe the fellow is a boer spy i thought so too and i told him so what did he say he denied it wilfred did any one see the face of this stranger no he kept his coat collar turned up and his hat well over his eyes why nothing i was only wondering brenda dreaded lest she should hear that the stranger was he who so closely resembled her father she wondered too whether it was possible her father could have assisted this man to escape after he had shot mr malet for that the crime had been committed by the same man who wore the black crape scarf seemed conclusively proved by the presence of that piece of it in the victim's hand i intend to keep a pretty close watch on mr van zwieten went on wilfred in fact that is why i have come up to town if as i suspect he is a spy the authorities must know of it in the event of hostilities breaking out between this country and the transvaal he would of course be arrested at once but you cannot prove his complicity in this matter wilfred i intend to have a shot at it any way replied the young man grimly but come brenda here we are at victoria let me put you in a hansom do come and see me wilfred i'm at mrs st leger's thanks i will i may ask you to help me too in my pursuit of this dutchman how you seem to hate mr van zwieten wilfred she exclaimed have you any especial reason to dislike him i hate him because he is the enemy of my country as the cab drove away brenda mused on the fervent patriotism of the man frail neurotic frequently ailing a prey to chronic melancholia yet he was of the stuff of which such men as hampden pym and cromwell are made he believed in the greatness of england as he did in the existence of god her every triumph sent a thrill through him her lightest disaster cut him to the quick it was as if he were ever under the influence of a fixed idea but if he were the idea was at least a noble and an elevating one his spirit was strong as his body was weak and through his body he paid dearly for his patriotic emotions it had been brenda's intention to drive at once to kensington but when she recalled all that wilfred had said she felt she must see her father if only to clear her mind of suspicion had he assisted as seemed probable in the escape of the unknown man he must have known that the creature was a murderer since there could be no other reason for such a hurried and secretive flight she felt she could not rest until she had the truth from his own lips hence she told the man to drive to his chambers in star street fortunately the old man was in he looked leaner and whiter she thought than ever he was buried in the evening papers from which he was cutting out slips which he proceeded to paste into a large book it was from these clippings of editorial opinion and collected data that he constructed his speeches throwing in as flavoring a dash of his own dogmatic optimism and some free expression reflecting the true humanity of other nations as compared with that of his own brutal country of which in truth he had little to say that was not abusive as usual he received brenda coldly and wondered why she had not driven at once to her aunt's she soon explained to him her reasons father i am worrying myself to death about that man with the crape scarf scarse colored and averted his eyes why pray he asked because i can't get over his resemblance to you is he a relative no scarse cleared his throat and spoke the fact is brenda i wore that crape scarf and snuff colored coat myself i am the man harold saw chapter vii aunt judy for a while brenda did not grasp the full significance of her father's admission she stared at him blankly then the recollection of that morsel of crape in the dead man's hand and all that it meant came upon her with overwhelming force she could not cry but a choking sensation came at her throat her father was the man who had worn the crape scarf then her father was the man who had murdered gilbert malet what is it brenda why do you look at me like that he asked nervously he stood beyond the circle of light cast by the lamp on the table and she could not see his face but by the tremor of his voice she guessed that he was badly frightened she pulled herself together what the effort cost her no one but herself knew and came at once to the gist of the thing father did you shoot mr malet i no are you mad girl to say such a thing how dare you to me your father indignation apparently choked further speech on the part of mr scarse god help me yes you are my father wailed brenda she threw herself face downwards on the sofa and sobbed bitterly there was that in her father's nervous denial which impelled her to believe that her suspicions were correct if he had not himself killed malet at least he knew who had but at the present moment brenda firmly believed that his own hand had fired the fatal shot brenda listen to me you speak foolishly we must understand one another what grounds have you for making such a terrible accusation against me the old man's voice was now steady and he spoke harshly he poked the fire and expanded his thin dry hands to the blaze it was a haggard face which the spurting flames illumined but the mouth was firmly set and there was a hard dogged expression in the eyes as brenda made no reply and still continued to sob he cast an impatient glance at her prostrate figure and went over to the sideboard thence he returned with a glass of wine drink this brenda and don't be a fool i did not murder the man the girl sat up and slowly drank the wine her father crossed over to the door and locked it upon which the girl laughed contemptuously do you think i have the police in waiting she said that is not the way to speak to your father snarled he sitting down but the wine had put new life into brenda and she was regaining courage with her returning color not by this man the father who had been no father to her was she to be daunted with a quick movement she removed the lampshade and the sudden spread of the light showed her mr scarse biting his nails with anything but a reassuring expression on his face at that moment brenda felt she hated the author of her being you are my father in name nothing more she said coldly in no way have you ever attempted to gain my affection you kept me at school as long as you could and only when it was forced upon you did you take charge of my life i have no love for you nor have you for me but i always respected you until now scarse winced and his parchment like skin grew pink and why don't you respect me now because i am certain that even if you did not kill him you had something to do with the death of mr malet that is untrue replied he composedly brenda looked at him keenly the murderer wore a crape scarf of that i have direct evidence i also know that you burnt that scarf how do you know that he snapped i found the ashes under the grate and i picked up a scrap of the crape nevertheless in spite of your admission i am not certain now in my own mind that it was you who wore it father you were not the man whom harold met i am i was insisted scarse doggedly i put on that old coat because i couldn't find the one i usually wear as to the scarf i wore it in token of my sorrow for the way in which this country is being ruined by its statesmen but brenda declined to accept this explanation you are not mad father she said quietly and only a madman would wear yards of crape round his neck in mourning for the delinquencies of his country's leaders and only a madman would have killed mr malet she paused and as he made no reply continued the man harold mistook for you was seen by other people who also made the same mistake what he came to chippingholt for i know as well as you do he came with the full intention of killing mr malet go on go on jeered her father you are making out a fine case against me not against you but against this relative of yours ah you wince i am right he is a relative no person who wasn't could bear so strong a resemblance to another he is some relation of whom you are ashamed a twin brother for all i know he was in your study that day when you said it was van zwieten who was with you he was not retorted scarse angrily how dare you make me out a liar van zwieten was with me i locked the door of the study because we had quarrelled he insisted on leaving the room and as i refused to open the door he stepped out of the window and went round and rang the front door bell for admittance that is an ingenious but a far fetched explanation father it is the true one you can take or leave it i leave it then said brenda calmly you had the stranger in your study and you afterwards sent him off by the train he was seen at the station scarse started by whom he asked hurriedly by van zwieten and the station master van zwieten repeated scarse irritably he saw who told you all this rubbish wilfred the station master told him besides it is not rubbish oh father why won't you be frank with me we have not much feeling for one another but still i am your daughter and i want to help you so does harold what has he to do with it asked scarse sharply it was harold who searched the corpse before it was taken to the manor replied brenda speaking slowly in the clenched right hand a morsel of black crape was found father it was torn off that scarf you cannot be certain of that how otherwise could so strange a material as crape come to be in the dead man's hand he cried out before he was shot i heard him he must have clutched at his assailant and torn a piece from his scarf did you see me shoot mr malet i saw no one shoot him but i am certain it was that man scarse rose and paced up and down the room i was the man i tell you who wore the scarf he said for the third time and i never even saw malet on that night i have no brother no relatives of any kind save your aunt mrs st leger you won't trust me said brenda sadly there is nothing more to say replied her father his features set hard as a flint it is useless my giving you the facts if you won't believe them i have no idea who the man was who was seen at the station van zwieten said nothing to me about it i am the man harold took for a stranger and i cut captain burton because i dislike him very much i did not see mr malet certainly i did not kill him and and i have no more to say how do you account for that piece of crape in the hand of brenda interrupted he turning on her i could give you an explanation of that which would amaze you but i will rest content with saying that the scrap you refer to was not torn off the scarf i wore i burnt the scarf after i had had it on once because i thought well because i thought it was foolish of me father i am certain you are not speaking openly no i am not if i did you would at once see that you were wrong in suspecting me of this crime i am not guilty of it no i don't think you are said brenda but you are shielding some one perhaps i am replied he smiling sourly but not the stranger you have invented he does not exist he paused and then asked abruptly has burton mentioned this matter to any one only to me for your sake he keeps silent oh scarse smiled sourly again i suppose he thinks he'll force me into consenting to your engagement that way but he won't you shall marry van zwieten brenda rose and drew her cloak around her i have told you i will marry no one but harold she said coldly there is no need to discuss the matter further my cab is waiting so i'll drive on to aunt judy's with your mind somewhat more at rest i trust said he as she unfastened the door yes so far as you personally are concerned but you know who murdered that man and you are shielding him i deny that then as she went out of the door he ran after her and said in a loud whisper think if there is no one else who wears crape at chippingholt before she could make reply to this he closed the door she did not pay much attention to it because she had made up her mind about the stranger whom she felt convinced her father was shielding she went down the stairs and got into her cab in a few moments she was again in piccadilly on her way west there at aunt judy's she felt sure at least of a warm welcome a stout good natured woman was mrs st leger she conceived it to be her one duty in life to keep her husband in a good temper and experience had proved to her that the only means of performing this was by a strict attention to his diet no easy task seeing that he was a peppery old indian colonel with a liver and a temper he had long since retired from the army after a career of frontier skirmishing in northern india and now passed his time between his home in kensington and his military club in both places he was greatly feared for his hectoring manner and flow of language which was well nigh irresistible mrs st leger was always thankful when the meals passed off without direct conflict and she spent most of her day reading cookery books for the unearthing of delicacies and having unearthed them in consulting the cook how to prepare them for the fastidious palate of her lord and master the old couple were fond of brenda aunt judy because the girl was a comfort to her in some vague sort of way which she could not define and uncle bill because brenda was not in the least in awe of his temper and gave him every bit as good as she received to each other colonel and mrs st leger were always julia and william but brenda from her earliest childhood had known them as aunt judy and uncle bill and to those fond appellations she still clung had any one else dared to address the colonel so he would assuredly have taken an apoplectic fit on the spot being so predisposed and of full habit but brenda he graciously permitted to be thus familiar to sum up the worthy colonel's character it may be stated that he hated mr scarse as bitterly as he hated cold meat and to any one who knew him the comparison would have been all sufficient dear dear child cooed mrs st leger as brenda sipped her cup of tea in the drawing room how good it is to see you again william very glad very glad rasped the colonel who was glowering on the hearthrug i want to hear all about this iniquitous murder poor malet clever chap but always contradicting good fellow all the same wrote and talked well against these damned little englanders gad i'd forgive judas iscariot if he did that have they caught the murderer dear asked aunt judy with a beaming smile on her fat face no replied brenda nor do i believe they ever will catch him him roared uncle bill chuckling egad and how d'you know it's a 'him' might be a 'her' eh what i suppose in these days a woman can fire a revolver as well as a man eh a woman why a woman eh why i don't know why should the poor devil have been killed at all yes why should he have been killed at all that's what william and i want to know bleated aunt judy how does lady jenny take it brenda dear oh very quietly she is much less grieved than i had expected her to be h'm rasped the colonel in a parade voice i dare say she is pleased for that matter most of 'em are when they bury their husbands i can fancy julia smiling when i toddle oh william how can you by the way has lady jenny been left well off brenda no i am afraid not she says mr malet was terribly extravagant he was a gambler shouted the colonel well known round the clubs when he wasn't dropping it at monte carlo he was running amuck on 'change always had bad luck that chap added he rubbing his nose lost thousands the wonder is he didn't go under long ago shouldn't be surprised to hear lady jenny had been left without a sixpence oh no uncle she has ten thousand pounds at least her husband's life was insured for that and she says his creditors can't touch that perhaps not but hers can i knew old lord scilly no end of a spendthrift and his daughter's like him or i'm mistaken women are all spendthrifts well i'm sure william oh you're all right julia there are worse than you nice little woman lady jenny though all the same good sporting sort shoots jolly straight and all that a thing i highly disapprove of said mrs st leger shaking her head mildly i'm glad dear child turning to brenda that you don't do that sort of thing it is so unladylike i think perhaps it's a pity i don't aunt if i go to the front with harold i might be all the better for knowing how to pull the trigger of a gun or a revolver harold what young burton growled the colonel are you going to marry him is it settled it is well he's not a bad young fellow but as a soldier pooh there are no soldiers nowadays the army's going to the dogs but brenda dear child what would you be doing at the front asked the old lady there is no war not yet but every one says there is going to be war in south africa of course there will be snapped the colonel do you think we're goin' to be defied by a couple of punny little republics damnable insolence i call it they ought to be whipped and they will be your father supports the beggars brenda and he's a william her father my brother beg pardon julia but he is and you know he is going against his own country ha here are the evening papers we'll see what further rubbish these pro boer idiots have been talking julia please see that dinner is punctual and brenda don't you be late i hate waiting for my meals thus saying the colonel plunged out of the room and mrs st leger took brenda upstairs the old lady was delighted at the news of her engagement to harold and congratulated and embraced the girl with much effusion and insisted upon her asking captain burton to dine all of which brenda received with the best of good grace notwithstanding that she was in no mood for conversation and longed to be alone at last mrs st leger left her then she fell to thinking of the subject which was all the time uppermost in her mind that last remark of her father's forced itself upon her who else was there in chippingholt who wore crape then suddenly it flashed across her mind that lady jenny did of course she was in mourning for her father then came the colonel's words she was a good shot trembling all over she sat down and wrestled with these two facts they were all significant could it could it really be lady jenny she asked herself but to that question she could find no answer chapter viii bad news so brenda was in london again and found the great city in an uproar over the possibility of a war in south africa negotiations were constantly passing between england and the transvaal concerning the franchise for the uitlanders history was being manufactured at the rate of a sensation a week leyds was weaving his plots and spreading his nets in europe while at pretoria paul kruger numbered his burghers dispensed arms and intrigued with the president of the free state few believed that a war was inevitable that a small state of farmers would defy a mighty empire but there were others who knew from rumors and hints that real strength lay behind the apparent weakness of those two diminutive republics meanwhile zealots like scarse preached ever the fable of the wolf and the lamb chamberlain was the wolf and good oom paul the lamb somewhat overgrown perhaps but still a lamb a pro boer meeting was announced to be held in trafalgar square and scarse was to speak in favor of the honest god fearing agriculturists who his imagination led him to believe inhabited pretoria he and his following were dead against the war and asserted that so many were the people of their opinion that only the big square could hold them so they rejoiced at the prospect of their convention which was going to force england into repeating the cowardly policy of the liberals after majuba a policy miscalled magnanimous and out of which all these present troubles had arisen in amsterdam astute dr leyds rejoiced also on the assumption that a house divided against itself could not stand his president had provided him with that text and the mere fact of this mass meeting seemed to prove the force of it meanwhile he scattered money broadcast uitlander money that the honorable continental press might yelp and clamor like jackals at the heels of the lion their respective countries dare not attack it is only just to say that none of leyds' guineas found their way into scarse's pocket if misguided he was at least honest but brenda took little notice of the question of the day burning as it was she concerned herself only with harold and had the fate of the empire been at stake as it seemed likely to be she would still have thought of him instructed by aunt judy she duly invited him to dinner he refused on the plea of regimental duty he would be in town he said toward the end of the week brenda imagined she could read a nervous fear in every line of his letter but having no one to consult she was obliged to wait his coming he alone could explain much that was mysterious to her meanwhile she resolved to see her father and ask upon what grounds he suspected lady jenny his hint about the crape referred unmistakably to that lady and it was true lady jenny had stated very plainly that she did not love her husband and that because of his connection with some other woman but she had said nothing on which brenda could fasten now even in the light of suspicion certainly she was in mourning for her father and wore crape usually and it was probable that she wore it on the night of the murder she had been out too about the hour when it took place then there was the fact that she was an accomplished shot but all this evidence was purely circumstantial and could in no way bring home the guilt to her yet she might have a motive and scarse might know that motive so brenda sought out her father two or three days after their last interview come what would she intended to force him to speak plainly that harold's name might be cleared from the suspicions cast upon it by inspector woke it was necessary that the guilt should be brought home to the right person now brenda wished to be at rest about her father's connection with the strange man whose existence he denied but on the occasion of this second visit to star street she was unfortunate mr scarse was not at home and the porter of the mansions did not know when he would be in brenda went upstairs to wait and was admitted into the chambers by her father's old servant a staid ex butler who had been with him for years this man brought her some tea gave her an evening paper and left her alone in the study it was between four and five so that the chances were that mr scarse would soon return one of his virtues was punctuality leaning back in the deep armchair by her father's everlasting fire quite superfluous on this warm evening brenda sipped her tea and fell to thinking of harold she was physically tired having been shopping all the morning with her aunt the warmth of fire and atmosphere soothed her nerves and made her feel drowsy in a very few minutes she was fast asleep and dreaming of her lover at least so concluded her father's butler when he peeped in to see if she required anything from her slumber brenda was awakened by the touch of a hand on her shoulder then as she languidly opened her eyes a man bent over her and kissed her harold she murmured drowsily my darling i win the gloves miss scarse said a quiet calm voice the man stepped back as she sprang to her feet mr van zwieten she cried with a sense of suffocation you i answered van zwieten removing the lampshade that he might see her more clearly then she realized that she must have been sleeping a long time for the lamp had not been lit when she sat down you coward she panted with flashing eyes you contemptible coward cool as he was van zwieten winced at the hatred in her voice but the more she loathed him the more determined he was to make her his wife he recovered his calmness with a laugh and stood by the table masterful and handsome in his smart town dress no dandy could have been better turned out than the big dutchman ach i have touched the proud lips of little red schefen said he quoting from heine come miss scarse when am i to have my gloves if i were a man i would kill you in that case in any case i am glad you are a woman why are you angry i am only anticipating my right oh cried brenda clenching her hands will no one deliver me from this man no one said van zwieten slowly and determinedly you are mine you always were that kiss makes you doubly so brenda seeing it was useless to speak cast on him one look of scorn and stepped toward the door before she reached it he spoke again what he said made her pause wait and listen to me miss scarse for your father's sake ah you are wise come here is a chair sit down we have much to talk about i prefer to stand tell me what do you mean she burst out what i say listen to me for your father's sake or if you care so little for him that you can get him into trouble without seeking to avert it why the door is open in answer to this speech brenda sat down and looked steadily at the man he met her gaze frankly and throughout conducted the interview with his usual politeness i know you do not love me said he in his deep voice but i love you and i am content to win your affection after marriage i will never marry you take that answer once and for all in that case you leave me free to deal with your father i don't understand you then i explain not everything for i never trust women not even you but i know the truth about this murder so does your father brenda preserved her coolness do you accuse him of the crime perhaps replied van zwieten with a singular smile should you not agree to give up captain burton and marry me i know who killed malet so do i said brenda quietly it was the man you saw at the station on the night of the murder van zwieten smothered an ejaculation of surprise what do you know of him i know that he killed mr malet that my father shielded him and sent him away you dare not accuse my father of the murder you are willing to risk that by refusing to marry me yes you can do your worst the dutchman seemed rather disconcerted he had not expected to be defied like this i don't want to proceed to extremities miss scarse he said doubtfully but i know much that may damage your father should it become public and if you do not care for him there is burton to be considered i can get him also into trouble on what grounds i won't tell you ask him yourself ask him why he left chippingholt so suddenly brenda started for the remark confirmed her suspicions that harold was troubled in some way about this crime i shall ask him have you anything more to say no that will do for the present only said van zwieten menacingly i give you one last warning if you marry captain burton he is lost your father is lost and you will be a wretched woman all the rest of your days up to the present brenda had controlled her feelings very well now the feminine desire to speak her mind got the upper hand and she rose to defy the dutchman you speak very boldly and confidently she said but you do not speak plainly you hint at my father's guilt at some link connecting captain burton with this crime i don't believe you have the knowledge you say you possess i am not to be terrified by vain threats mr van zwieten you are not dealing with a child when the time comes i shall speak out replied the man sullenly speak out now if you can if you dare no i will do nothing in a hurry but ask your father ask captain burton what they did on the night of the murder you villain i believe you killed the man yourself oh certainly mocked van zwieten if it pleases you to think so he took a turn up and down the room then approached her with a grave smile miss scarse said he entreatingly this is not the wooing i care for i love you and i will have you to be my wife but it is not my desire to gain you by force why cannot you accept me i am a richer man than captain burton and i will make you a better husband come with me to the transvaal and you know not what height i may raise you to there will be war i am certain there will be war afterward the transvaal will cease to exist mr van zwieten by heaven not so swore the dutchman growing red ah you do not know how we are tricking these english fools i am dutch born in holland but i have thrown in my lot with the boers i and leyds and kruger and steyn are set upon building up a new nation in south africa as the english a century ago were driven out of america so will they be driven from the cape they will go to war thinking it will be an easy task they do not know they do not guess we have more burghers more arms more friends than they think they are less well prepared for war than we are wait wait all the world will be astonished before the year is out brenda i could say much but i dare not trust me love me marry me and you will be great even as i shall be great come with me and assist me to build up this new nation at the expense of my own country cried the girl i would rather die you are a boer spy a boer liar but all your intrigues all your lies will come to nothing if there is a war your republic will be crushed and your rebellion punished is it to me a loyal englishwoman that you speak marry you betray my country i defy your threat i treat with contempt your boasts of conquest let me pass mr van zwieten never dare to speak to me again with a vigorous movement she thrust him back and swept out of the door before he could recover his presence of mind it was just as well she had gone for van zwieten baffled and scorned gave way fully to his rage he did not dare to follow and make a scandal lest it should lead to inquiry about him and his doings but he strode up and down the room swearing volubly in dutch and english furious with brenda furious with himself he could not contain his anger he had played his last card and had lost no matter he said with a mighty oath i'll make her heart ache yet though how he intended to do this was not clear even to himself van zwieten was involved in a maze of intrigue but he was doubtful how to use it to his own advantage he had ample material to manufacture trouble in connection with this crime but for want of certain missing links in the chain he was puzzled how to act to brenda he had spoken with less than his usual caution he had been carried away by his feelings he was madly in love with her and the more she scorned him the more he worshipped her if he could not win her by fair means he would do so by foul without waiting for the return of mr scarse he left the chambers to think out some plan whereby he might net brenda in his toils as yet he could not see clearly ahead but in time he might hope to accomplish much that now appeared to be impossible brenda returned to kensington with a feeling of dread it was apparent that van zwieten knew something detrimental to her father but she had grave doubts whether he could use his knowledge he would have used it before she thought had it been a weapon of any strength as to harold she could not conjecture what van zwieten's threat implied he certainly had not killed malet nor on the face of it did he know anything about the matter she looked forward anxiously to his arrival with the intention of warning him against his enemy only if there was perfect confidence between him and herself could they hope to baffle the wicked schemes of the dutchman but harold seemed to avoid her and as he had apparently something to conceal she could not assure herself that he would confide everything to her in that case van zwieten might succeed in implicating him for she deemed him no match for the dutchman single handed the days passed and she counted every hour anxious for that one which would bring her lover to her arms at length he came one afternoon she found him looking pale and haggard as with mental torture she uttered no word of reproach but threw herself into his arms he strained her almost fiercely to his breast and covered her face with kisses they were alone in the drawing room as mrs st leger was out shopping and the colonel was holding forth at his club for some minutes neither of them spoke it was brenda who first broke the silence my darling how glad i am to see you again she said looking tenderly into his dark face oh why did you leave me so cruelly so suddenly at chippingholt i thought you'd ask that replied he with an effort to appear gay well dear it was for two reasons in the first place i was recalled suddenly by my colonel and besides that i had bad news and did not dare to tell you oh harold as though i could not bear anything for your sake from whom did you have bad news fran van zwieten strange to say she withdrew herself suddenly from her lover's arms and a feeling of terror came over her van zwieten again the man seemed to be her evil genius what is the bad news she asked faintly malet gambled away my twenty thousand pounds i have nothing but my small income chapter ix mrs st leger is discreet is that all asked brenda drawing a breath of relief oh you stupid boy did you run away because you were afraid to tell me that captain burton stared and drew a breath also one of amazement well it's hard to understand a woman he said half smiling half annoyed i made sure you'd cry your eyes out when you heard don't you understand brenda what it means if we are to marry at all it must be on our five hundred a year and why not was her answer i am ready if you are harold how could you give me all this anxiety for such a trifle i want you my dear not the money but i thought you must have had some other reason for going away what other reason could i have had asked burton quickly and waiting apprehensively for her reply never mind i'll tell you later only the twenty thousand pounds well after all i'm not surprised to hear of the loss i was very much astonished and very wretched when i heard it i can't take the loss of all that money as quietly as you seem to do brenda and not only mine has gone but wilfred's too forty thousand pounds and all his own fortune great scot the man must have played day and night to get rid of it what folly for my father to leave it so completely in his power if there had only been another trustee to pull him up i don't want to speak evil of the dead cried harold wrathfully but i could find it in my heart to curse malet no don't harold his terrible death was punishment enough how was it that mr van zwieten came to know of this i can't say he refused to tell me but he did know and he tried to make me give you up on that account of course i told him well never mind what i said it was strong and to the point brenda we have a dangerous enemy in van zwieten i always knew we had and now that this crime has been committed he is more dangerous than ever how do you know that harold looked anxiously at her he threatened me the other day threatened you the hound what did he say he told me if i did not give you up and marry him he would get my father into trouble over mr malet's murder does he suspect your father yes and no he insists that father was cognizant of the murder but i think he puts the actual deed down to the man with the crape scarf that may be true remember what i found i remember i also made a discovery and brenda told him how she had found the crape scarf burning in the grate of her father's study at chippingholt how her father had asserted that he was the man seen by harold and many other things indeed she told him all she knew including her conversations with lady jenny with wilfred with van zwieten and with her father chin in hand harold listened attentively putting in a word now and then when she had finished he looked utterly perplexed it's all such a muddle i can't get at the rights of it he said no one will speak out straight and every one seems to have something to hide bad as van zwieten is i don't believe he killed malet i don't see what motive he could have had unless as wilfred says it were for political reasons oh wilfred's crazy about politics replied harold testily he thinks of nothing else it is a perfect mania with him but van zwieten would not be such a fool as to risk his neck because malet took up the cudgels against the boers no van zwieten is innocent enough what about lady jenny captain burton changed color and commenced to pace up and down the room she wouldn't have done it she is half an italian i know and fearfully passionate but i think she'd stop short of that besides although she is a jolly good shot i doubt very much if she could hit a man in the dark like that so square as to kill him outright but remember harold the shot was fired at close quarters i don't believe she'd have had the nerve for that of course it's quite possible she may be guilty but there's not a scrap of evidence against her as far as i can see what about the crape lady jenny wore crape that doesn't prove that this scrap was torn from her dress the crape trimmings on that would lie close to the dress it wouldn't be so easy for a man to make a clutch at them and tear a piece off as at a scarf with the ends floating freely my belief is that the morsel of crape was torn from the scarf well it was not worn by my father in spite of what he says no i dare say that man who left chippingholt by the late train is the man who fired the shot but your father knows all about it brenda otherwise he would not insist that he had worn the scarf nor would he have burnt it as he did i think with you that this unknown man is a relative of your father's and that your father is shielding him to avoid the disgrace of having a criminal in the family aunt judy would know him if he is a relative that is very probable you had better ask her harold do you think van zwieten knows the truth captain burton hesitated it would seem so said he but i don't think he is very sure of the truth or else he would speak out he threatens you dear i know he does he threatened me at chippingholt brenda i don't deny that the man is dangerous and that he knows more than i like him to know it is in his power to harm me and if i marry you he will do his best against me but that sha'n't stop us brenda we'll get married and defy him miss scarse signified her full approval of this course of action but she saw that her lover was keeping something back harold what else did van zwieten say to you at chippingholt oh nothing of any consequence replied her lover uneasily my dear brenda slipped her arm round his neck and drew him down on the sofa beside her if you love me you must trust me if you think me a sensible woman you must be honest with me i know you had some other reason for leaving chippingholt so suddenly it was not altogether because you were afraid of telling me about the loss of your money van zwieten told me he could get you into trouble and now you say the same thing tell me what hold he has over you he has no hold over me whispered harold but she saw that his forehead was beaded with perspiration tell me tell me she repeated brenda i cannot i dare not then there is something captain burton cast a glance round the room and nodded i am not a coward he groaned i hope i am not a coward but there are some things which make the bravest man afraid van zwieten is a devil does he accuse you of the murder no he doesn't go so far as that and yet brenda he cried taking her hand and holding it so tightly that she could have screamed don't ask me any more it is not my own secret has it anything to do with my father partly but you need not be anxious about that he is in no danger leave me to fight it out with van zwieten i shall get the better of him yet no no brenda don't ask me any more questions you cannot help me i must go through with this matter alone trust me if you love me i ask you to do that with me said brenda sadly and you refuse i don't refuse i cannot tell you now i will tell you when you are my wife listen we must get married quietly why quietly because i am afraid of van zwieten yes you may well look astonished i who have never known fear before fear him he knows too much and if he plots against me i cannot counterplot him at all events for the present we must marry when and where you please darling you trust me yes on the understanding that when i am your wife you tell me everything everything burton nodded again i will tell you before if i can brenda it is good of you and like your dear self to trust me we can be married at st chad's at brighton i'll get a special license down there we shall be free from interference by van zwieten he would not dare oh yes he would if he knew he would take some means of preventing our marriage and you would let him do that i i might and i might not captain burton sighed wearily if it were only myself i would not mind but but there are others whom i must consider harold you are shielding some one yes no brenda dearest for heaven's sake don't question me she was perplexed by his indecision annoyed by his reticence but she had given her promise and she would abide by it you will not let me help you she said plaintively you cannot help me dear i must go through with this matter alone unaided but i can help you she insisted van zwieten is our enemy well then lady jenny can help me to crush him he started nervously what are you saying lady jenny can do nothing indeed she can harold she told me that if van zwieten ever proved troublesome i was to see her and that she would thwart him harold made no reply but looked more than ever puzzled and perplexed then a light broke in upon brenda harold it is lady jenny herself you are shielding i won't i cannot tell you he replied desperately brenda i'll see lady jenny myself at once if she knows anything about van zwieten i may be able to make use of her knowledge come say good bye when shall i see you again in three or four days promise me brenda you won't see jenny until i do i promise but if you fail with her then i must see her yes if i fail but i won't fail you have put a weapon into my hand after i have seen her i will tell you the whole miserable business we will get the better of van zwieten yet my darling captain burton was picking up his spirits he went away in a more cheerful frame of mind brenda felt certain that his refusal to speak was in the interest of lady jenny could she have fired the shot but that seemed impossible if she herself were guilty how could she silence and thwart van zwieten who appeared to know so much about the crime what with her father's denials harold's silence and van zwieten's threats brenda was quite bewildered what would be the outcome of it all she wondered having promised harold not to see lady jenny miss scarse cast about in her mind as to who else could assist her in thwarting van zwieten from her father no help could be obtained he was wholly on the dutchman's side and it would appear under his thumb then she thought of wilfred and his openly expressed hatred of van zwieten could she not make use of that in the present state of popular feeling a boer spy would have a bad time if found in london if wilfred could discover that van zwieten really was on the secret service staff of the transvaal he could force the dutchman to leave england under threat of denouncing him to the authorities no sooner had she come to this conclusion than she acted upon it and wrote a note to wilfred's london address asking him to call having posted it she returned to the drawing room to make tea for aunt judy who had just got back from her shopping the colonel was still absent so the two ladies settled themselves down to the discussion of chiffons if there was one thing mrs st leger was fond of it was dress as for brenda her mind was too much preoccupied with her own troubles to care much for fashions or bargains but strive as she might to hide her indifference it did not take her aunt long to see that her interest was assumed but that she put down to her lover's visit why didn't he stay to tea she asked putting away her purchases because he had to get back to aldershot replied brenda pouring out the tea they are very busy down there oh brenda do you think there will be war how glad i am that william has retired that is not the speech of a true soldier's wife aunt judy my dear it's all very well talking replied mrs st leger testily but you don't know what war is i don't mean these little frontier skirmishes but a real war that is truly terrible i remember the crimea i don't think this will be so bad auntie the transvaal is not russia all the same i fancy they are better prepared than we think william says so he has heard all kinds of rumors at the club well if it's got to be it's got to be you will have to lose your harold for a time dear in a good hour be it spoken cried brenda hastily to avert the omen don't say i'll lose him aunt of course he will go to the front but don't speak of losing him well you never know my dear oh brenda i do wish your father were not going to speak at this mass meeting there is sure to be trouble i don't think he'll mind that said the girl my father and those who think with him are doing all they can to bring about the war by confirming kruger in his obstinacy stuart always was wrong headed and obstinate sighed mrs st leger i'm sure i tremble when he comes here william and he do nothing but wrangle aunt judy said brenda thinking the present a good opportunity do you know i am deplorably ignorant about my family ignorant my dear how do you mean your mother i know was a sweet woman and died all too young if she had only lived stuart might have been very different i was thinking more of my father aunt is he your only brother mrs st leger almost dropped her cup she looked scared and her face blanched why do you ask me that brenda she asked in a faltering voice because i have seen a man so like my father as to make me think he must be some relative possibly a brother where did you see him at chippingholt aunt judy tell me who is he mrs st leger recovered herself my dear brenda how should i know who the man is you have been misled probably by a chance resemblance the resemblance was too strongly marked to be mere chance and my father brenda checked herself auntie surely you can answer a simple question what is it you want to know asked the old lady nervously have you two brothers no your father is my only brother said mrs st leger but by the way in which she said it brenda knew that she spoke falsely chapter x the mass meeting the better day the better deed acting on the advice of this proverb those responsible for the pro boer meeting convened it on a sunday that all those engaged on other days in earning their bread might attend and so far as numbers went the crowded state of trafalgar square seemed to justify this course nelson's column soared from a dense mass of people which even overflowed into the streets approaching the great open space on all sides the windows were filled with curious spectators who apprehensive all the while of trouble gazed forth expectantly over the sea of heads below but they need have had no fear the mob was on its best behavior good natured and roughly jocular as an english crowd ever is amenable to law and order and ever ready to be controlled by the police platforms for the convenience of the orators had been erected round the grand column the symbol of an empire which these well meaning busybodies were so anxious to dismember and destroy below crowded laborers artisans shopkeepers traders of all kinds and on the fringe of the mob hard by the national gallery were lines of hansom cabs surmounted by clubmen from pall mall and st james' street who had come to see the fun there were plenty of women bringing with them their children when they could not leave them at home and a sprinkling of redcoats and bluejackets these as the visible symbol of england's fighting power were idolized by the mob for alas for mr scarse and his supporters the voice of the people was dead against their philanthropic efforts instead of the boer national anthem god save the queen and rule britannia were being sung the little englanders were doing their best to laud kruger and damn their own government but the temper of the mob was all the other way in a word the imperialists were in the majority on the parapet near the national gallery brenda very plainly dressed was holding on to wilfred's arm he had been lunching at mrs st leger's and afterward brenda had persuaded him to escort her to the meeting she feared for the safety of her father and dreaded lest his speech should draw on him the anger of the mob the colonel had declined to come swearing in true military style that he would attend no meeting meant to belittle england is mr van zwieten here asked brenda looking over the sea of heads i don't think so replied wilfred whose pale face was flushed with excitement he is too clever to sympathize openly with the cause he advocates no his task is to condemn the boers in public and to support them in private have you found out anything about him wilfred yes he lives ostensibly in duke street st james but he has other rooms in westminster where he passes under another name there he receives all kinds of queer people especially at night spies asked brenda so low as not to be heard by those near her i believe so he calls himself jones and a good many spies go up to see mr jones the scoundrel to plot treason almost in the shadow of the clock tower but i do not blame him so much as those who are betraying their country after all van zwieten is a foreigner and naturally hates us but there are englishmen brenda englishmen born and bred who are selling secrets for transvaal gold i'd hang the lot if i could hush wilfred don't speak so loud can you prove that van zwieten is a spy not yet but i have a plan in my head to trap him he will not be easily trapped no he is a cunning beast but i'll get the better of him yet when i tear his mask off he'll be forced to leave london hullo there's your father brenda turned pale as that familiar lean figure appeared on the platform he was saluted with a groan several union jacks were waved defiantly in his face and a few bars of god save the queen were sung with lusty strength a small knot of people stood round him taking off his hat he advanced to the edge of the platform a few expressions such as god fearing farmers greedy capitalists the jingoism of chamberlain the treachery of rhodes caught brenda's ear and then her father's voice was drowned in a roar of cheering and singing in vain did mr scarse hold up his hand for silence in reply he was assailed with insults and a lifeguardsman was shouldered and passed along the heads of the crowd a red spot of color amid the neutral tints union jacks were waved rule britannia was sung many a groan was there for kruger many a cheer for joe and the close locked crowd maddened by the sound of its own voice rolled and swung like a stormy sea pore thing pore thing said an old woman near brenda i 'ope they won't chuck him into the fountings oh wilfred gasped the girl terrified for her father's safety but the suggestion met with the approval of the crowd and passed from mouth to mouth until it reached those immediately under the fountain a roar went up to the sky and several enthusiasts endeavored to clamber up the platform the police beat them back and order was restored for the moment then as an appeal to the chivalry of the mob a grim looking female with a black bag came forward to speak she commenced a highly abusive harangue but it was drowned in laughter and a recommendation in terms purely colloquial that she should go home and tend any young offspring she might chance to have the pro boers began to look disconsolate each effort they made to speak was abortive a sailor jumped on the parapet opposite morley's hotel and waved a union jack the mob saw and cheered and roared out the national anthem some threw apples and oranges at the orators on the platform who promptly dodged behind the column and endeavored to obtain a hearing on the other side but with even less success on losing sight of her father brenda wanted to try and follow him and wilfred the patriot although he hated scarse and would gladly have seen him ducked could not but sympathize with the girl's anxiety so extricating themselves from the crowd they struggled downward toward the lower part of the square there a knot of talkers attracted their attention wot i say is why does rhodes want to fight a lot of 'ard working coves like them boers said one begrimed ruffian they're the same as us ain't they no they ain't grunted his neighbor they won't give englishmen votes an' we made their bloomin' country we did i 'old by gladstone i tell you garn you and your gladstone he'd ha' given away windsor castle if he cud ho wot price majuba ah we must wipe out that disgrace said a clearer and apparently more highly educated speaker then the fun began some abused gladstone as the cause of all the trouble others made extensive demands upon their vocabulary for a due definition of mr chamberlain it speedily became apparent that none of them knew what they were talking about wilfred laughed and the begrimed one straightway resented his laughter we don't want no tall 'ats 'ere he yelped no you want sense retorted burton but unwilling to involve brenda in a row he pushed on as they passed away they heard a scuffle and looked back to see that the dirty man had at last his heart's desire so far as to have found an antagonist but even thus early in the game he was getting the worst of it at length having apparently had enough he gave forth a lusty yell for police and was duly rescued in a battered condition and still arguing brenda felt anxious the mob all round was showing signs of restiveness in another part of the square some pro boer orators spoke with more chance of a hearing they drew the usual picture of a small toiling community of unscrupulous capitalists the worship of gold the rights of the boers to arrange affairs in their own house and the iniquity of a mighty empire crushing a diminutive state wholly unable to defend itself furious at the falsehoods which he heard all around him wilfred lost his head altogether and despite all brenda's entreaty got up on the parapet and raised his voice lies lies all lies i say all that we demand are equal rights for the white man and kindly treatment of the black the boer is a brutal bully he beats the black man and treats him like a dog kruger and his gang have accumulated millions through the industry of those to whom they refuse the franchise it is they who want war not england and if we refuse their challenge then will they try to drive us out of africa it is not the transvaal republic which is in danger but the empire continental powers who hate us are urging these misguided people to do what they dare not do themselves hoping to profit took place at length the police as in the former by their folly and attack us when we are hampered in south africa don't believe these liars men they betray their own country and a good half of them are paid with transvaal gold for doing so spies traitors all of them duck them here in the fountains then having thus relieved his feelings wilfred took the girl's hand and pushed on hurriedly and soon they were lost to view in the crowd but the effect of his words was immediate the pro boer champions trying to make good their cause were not allowed speech as quickly as they opened their mouths the mob shouted them down some ugly rushes were made in their direction and they were hustled roughly a couple of men and women beginning to see they were in danger of being chucked shouted for the police of the very government they had been abusing a body of constables forced itself through the crowd and formed a cordon round these political martyrs they were escorted to the fringe of the mob looking pale and nervous anything in fact but heroic and the language with which they were saluted was not such as need be set down here meanwhile their friends at the column were faring badly enough the police began to see that the temper of the mob was rising and insisted that the speaking or rather the attempts to speak should stop the orators refused and stuck to their platform they were driven off from one side and they climbed up the other missiles began to fly the crowd to growl and some rough and tumble fights took place at length the police as in the former case marched them away down northumberland avenue the crowd which followed was so excited that the martyrs afraid of the storm which by their own folly they had raised tried to enter one of the hotels but the porters here were prepared and drove them back and the wretched creatures scarse amongst them were beaten to and fro like tennis balls finally they managed to gain the shelter of a clubhouse where they held an indignation meeting on their own account but nothing on earth and above it would have convinced them that they had got just what they deserved brenda was in a great state of alarm for her father but wilfred consoled her as well as he could he will be all right he said cheerfully the police will look after him he may be hurt he should have thought of that before he played the fool but he will not be hurt those sort of people never are i beg your pardon brenda after all he is your father he honestly believes in the boers wilfred i know he does he'd find out his mistake if he went to live amongst them i wish i could have had half an hour at them brenda he said with sparkling eyes i would have done but for you you said quite enough wilfred i was afraid the police would arrest you arrest me come that's good seeing i spoke for the government what about your father and his wretched friends who are abusing their own country there are two sides to every question not to this one replied wilfred who was easily excited on the subject brenda decided that it was best not to contradict him he was so highly strung that in moments of this kind he was not altogether accountable either for his speech or actions he would flash into a rage on the slightest provocation and contradict every one around him like some hysterical woman no doctor could call him insane since he knew well how to conduct himself and was not the prey of any hallucination but his brain was delicately balanced and worry or persistent irritation brought him very near the borders of insanity for this reason he led a quiet life and saw but few people the magnitude and whirl of london always overwrought him and brenda regretted now that she had argued with him at all have it your own way wilfred she said taking his arm but i hope my father is safe i have seen enough so you might take me home all right don't be angry with me brenda but the silly views your father takes annoy me i am not angry with you wilfred come along let's get back now about time too said he the whole thing's a farce ah i agree with you there mr burton said a voice and brenda turned with a start to find van zwieten at her elbow how are you miss scarse he asked quietly as though nothing unusual had passed between them at their last meeting and what do you think of this silly business i think it just what you call it silly replied brenda coldly but i did not expect to hear you say so you ought to be pleased that your friends are fighting your battles said wilfred van zwieten flicked a grain of dust from off his frock coat and raised his eyebrows my friends he repeated oh none of those who spoke are my friends unless you refer to mr scarse but of course i don't agree with his views i am an imperialist he said smoothly remembering the disclosures he had made to her brenda was astounded at the effrontery of the man but wilfred understood of course you are an imperialist he said it pays better quite so assented van zwieten it pays better much better but you talk in riddles do i i think you can guess them then retorted wilfred and i don't think you will find oom paul will benefit by this meeting it will show him how very much of one mind the english people are and how they are determined to teach him a lesson oh a lesson eh van zwieten laughed it is to be hoped oom paul will prove an apt pupil but i fear he is too old to learn and leyds is he too old he pulls the strings what strings asked the dutchman blankly the strings to make you dance in spite of van zwieten's command of his temper wilfred was making him angry this of itself brenda did not mind in the least but she did mind a quarrel and toward that she could see these two were fast drifting moreover owing to the raised tones of wilfred's voice a crowd was collecting mr van zwieten did not look altogether comfortable he despised wilfred as a mere boy but even so boy or not this young fellow with his fearless nature and frantic patriotism might put highly undesirable notions into the heads of those around and most of them were more or less inflammable just then the fountains too were close at hand come along wilfred said brenda do let us get home but before he could reply a hubbub arose amid the crowd not far distant and they turned in that direction from out the jeers and laughter an angry voice could be heard holding forth in abuse of the government and in praise of the boers then the crowd parted surged along and brenda saw advancing a tall thin man he wore a snuff colored coat and a yard or so of crape wrapped round his throat like a scarf and his face how like it was to that of her father oh she cried grasping wilfred's arm that is the man who hush van zwieten whispered fiercely don't accuse him in public chapter xi a startling discovery in her anxiety to solve the mystery which surrounded this man so like her father brenda would but for the publicity of the position have rushed forward and questioned him moreover he began at once to speak loudly in abuse of the government and in defence of the boer republic it is the capitalists who want this war he cried excitedly rhodes and beit and all that gang of scoundrels chamberlain is merely playing into their hands their villainous scheme is to take the gold mines from these unoffending people and they are prepared to massacre them in their greed for gold kruger is shut your mouth shouted a big scowling man thrusting himself forward we'll make you if you don't i'm not afraid i'm ready to stand by the truth screeched the man with the crape scarf i mourn for england the victim of a corrupt set of time serving scoundrels i wear black for her woe to her i say and her greed for gold woe to her vile government with a fierce growl the mob flung forward brenda cried out it was as though her father himself were being attacked with a bound she placed herself before the old man leave him don't touch him she cried he's mad i'm not mad cried the man i protest against tyranny and the cursed greed that would destroy a nation you crouch at the feet of those who will drain your blood cowardly hounds all of you 'ere let me get at 'im stand away laidy no no he is old and weak oh mr van zwieten save him seeing an opportunity of posing as a hero at a small cost the dutchman placed the old man behind him and stood between him and the mob which was closing in leave him to me i'll see to him he's a furriner yelped a small man hit his head i'm a naturalized englishman shouted van zwieten but i won't let you touch this man woe woe to the wicked government who are about to dye their garments in the blood of a just people shrieked the old man waving his arms wildly then wilfred took hold of him and hurried him away hold your tongue he said roughly you'll get into trouble i will seal my protest with my blood stand back shouted van zwieten opposing those who would have followed hi constable why it's van the cricketer cried the big man joyfully he's all right boys seen 'im carry 'is bat out many a time i 'ave hooray for van roared the fickle crowd and as half a dozen policemen were pushing their way toward the centre of disturbance it veered round to cheering van zwieten spy spy he's a spy shouted a voice that sounded to brenda uncommonly like wilfred's the crowd growled again and darted forward but the police were now pushing right and left van zwieten who had changed color at the cry stepped back and was swallowed up by the concourse of people wilfred had let the old man go and the zealot was again raging waving his crape scarf like a banner brenda terrified at finding herself alone in the midst of the mob kept close to the big dutchman suddenly wilfred appearing as it were from nowhere caught her arm come away come away there may be trouble he cried drawing her aside on to the steps by st martin's church afar off she could see van zwieten leading the old man down a side street and the little band of constables fighting with the mob who were now inclined to resent any interference brenda was in despair i want to ask that old man who he is she cried but wilfred held her back in spite of her efforts to follow the dutchman brenda don't be foolish it's dangerous the people are getting their blood up but that old man killed mr malet i will know who he is van zwieten will find out i dare say said brenda tartly but he won't tell you or me it's too late now to think of that come up here and let us get a hansom if you got into trouble brenda harold would never forgive me and brenda knew that this was so and she guessed too that wilfred was chafing under his responsibility for her safety she therefore stepped into a hansom with him when they were rattling along piccadilly she asked him if it was he who had called out that van zwieten was a spy yes it was i admitted wilfred in a fiery tone and i should have liked to see the crowd go for the big brute i don't like van zwieten myself as you know brenda said all the same wilfred it is only fair to say he behaved very well over that old man he knew there was no danger that the police were about he wanted to show up as a hero in your eyes brenda for my part i wish he had been lynched for a spy i hate the man people don't lynch now in england wilfred they would have done it to day on small encouragement it was lucky for van zwieten that he is a popular cricketer and that they recognized him as such otherwise he would not have got off so easily but i'll catch him yet how you do hate him wilfred hate him of course i do here he is accepting the hospitality of england and spying out all our weak points to use them against us should there be a war i suspected him long ago from some words he let fall and i have kept a watch on him ever since he has haunted woolwich portsmouth and erith and has made friends with privates and officers alike and he has half a hundred creatures at his beck and call who are poking and prying about i dare say out at pretoria they know more about england and her resources than those here whose duty and business it is they will await the right moment then they'll strike and unless i'm much mistaken they'll strike pretty hard but we are not unprepared wilfred the young man shook his head gloomily i myself have talked with many of our officers he said and we are not so well armed as we should be since the crimea we have had no big war and the number of easy victories we have had have made us over confident of the valor of englishmen i have no fear they can fight as their fathers fought with true bulldog courage but nowadays science as well as grit is needed for victory and our war office is so sleepy and tied up with red tape that it doesn't keep our armaments up to the mark as it should do the boers are armed with the mauser rifle our troops but there is no need to talk technically to you brenda i can only say that if we have a war it won't be the military promenade to pretoria that many people expect it to be but the transvaal is quite a small state wilfred i know still it is more than probable that the orange free state will join them also all over cape colony and natal there are hordes of disloyal dutch ready to rise at the first chance besides leyds is stirring up the continent against us and here van zwieten is gathering information and sending it in cypher to pretoria oh there's trouble ahead brenda the uitlander business is only a pretext for war if we don't proclaim war kruger and steyn will let them we will crush them and punish them i should think so cried wilfred his dark eyes blazing with fervor i have never any fear for england though the world were against her she would conquer all the world was against her at the end of the last century but we shall have our waterloo over again god bless england if there were war wilfred would you go out as a newspaper correspondent he replied i have made all my arrangements with the morning planet oh yes i'll go to the front and if i die it will be for our country harold of course will go i am proud that he should yes even though he should never return and he is all in all to me he could have no nobler death said wilfred coldly oh but it would be terrible wilfred terrible remember i am only a woman and it takes a great deal of courage you are an englishwoman and englishwomen are always bravest when there is danger at hand don't cry brenda i should not talk like this my feelings carry me away let me be quiet for a time or mrs st leger will be alarmed if i arrive in such a state of excitement not another word would he speak on the way to kensington but he curled himself up in the corner of the cab his eyes feverishly bright and his face pale with emotion the patriotic fire which consumed him was wearing out his frail body brenda could not understand this man with one idea her love for her country was great but it was not to her the one devouring passion to wilfred england was as a well beloved woman a creature of flesh and blood every blow levelled at her made him quiver and turn pale for her sake he would willingly have died he hated the continental nations but most of all he hated van zwieten who was working darkly for her ill if war were proclaimed wilfred promised himself that he would be in the fighting van zwieten who was no coward would be there also and if perchance they met why england would be revenged if he had to shed his life blood to avenge her he changed his mind about calling on mrs st leger and kept the cab waiting while he said good bye to brenda at the door if you find out anything about van zwieten you'll let me know she entreated as they shook hands yes but i may be a week or two preparing my plans he is so infernally clever that it will take a lot to trap him but why are you so anxious to know about him brenda he means harm to harold nonsense this isn't the dark age he is powerless to hurt harold i'm afraid he can wilfred on the night of mr malet's murder harold was out of doors mr van zwieten has more than hinted to me that he can and will accuse him of it an angry fire glittered in wilfred's eye i'll soon put a stop to that he said between his teeth if i can prove van zwieten is a spy he will have enough to do to look after himself without troubling about other people i'm sure of that and wilfred see if you can find my father and tell him to come and see me i am so anxious about him oh he's all right wilfred really could not bring himself to be sorry for mr scarse tainted as he was with the heresy of little england i'll call at his rooms brenda and leave a message if you like but i can't see him i might be tempted to tell him my mind good bye he jumped into the cab so as to give brenda no opportunity for further argument it was natural that she should be anxious about her father but for her indeed he would have rejoiced had the mob succeeded in ducking mr scarse bad as was van zwieten mr scarse was to his thinking worse for he was betraying his own country with his rotten politics it was strange and inconceivable to wilfred that a man born an englishman should bring himself to abuse and condemn the very land he should have been proud of strangely enough he met the object of his thoughts as his cab turned into star street the old man looking ill and unhappy was stealing homeward his eyes fixed on the ground before him wilfred was pleased to see that the failure of the meeting had gone home to him he only hoped he would keep the memory of it by him for future guidance the cab pulled up with a jerk and he leaned out mr scarse can i speak with you scarse looked up irritably and recognizing wilfred came to the edge of the pavement he knew the young man's passion for politics and looked but sourly upon him what is it brenda thinks you might have got into trouble and is anxious to hear that you are safe please send her word thank you said mr scarse loftily there is no cause for alarm i will attend to the matter were you at the meeting to day i was retorted wilfred shortly and i was glad to see it was a failure drive on cabby and before the older man had recovered from his anger the hansom was swinging round the corner rude young man muttered mr scarse wearily mounting the steps to his chambers never shall i consent to brenda marrying his brother in his study he poured himself out a glass of brandy the events of the afternoon had tried him severely and he looked older and more frail than ever he was deeply mortified by the discovery that the popular feeling was all against the boers and he recognized that war was certain still he hoped that if england were the one to proclaim it europe might intervene and for his own part resolved to throw all possible obstacles in the way scarse was a true patriot he could not have loved england more had he been born a german or a frenchman he lay down for an hour the sleep refreshed him and he awoke with a clearer brain on returning to his study he set about writing a letter to the press alleging that the failure of the meeting was due to a jingoistic conspiracy while engaged on this precious epistle van zwieten was announced and mr scarse came forward with outstretched hands ah my dear fellow i am so glad to see you what a terrible afternoon it has been a conspiracy van zwieten a conspiracy the voice of the people has been stifled my dear friend it didn't sound like it this afternoon said the dutchman drily they all called for war well if they want it they shall have it and won't they be sorry when they get it no war no war i shall protest oh your protests won't do any good said the other rudely the tide runs too strong for you to drive it back with a mop but i didn't come here to talk politics mr scarse in that case i must ask you to go mr scarse was offended i have much to do you will have to lay it by then for the time being i called to tell you that i met a friend of yours to day yes at the meeting who that is what i want to hear from your lips i know who he is from his own he wears a yellow coat and a crape scarf mr scarse's face became grey and he fell against the wall with staring eyes and extended hands i don't know him i assure you i don't he said hoarsely i think you do he is the man who was in your study at chippingholt on the night of the murder the man whom you sent away by train in a word mr scarse he is your brother your twin brother chapter xii a story of the past the old man sprang up with the light of fury in his pale eyes and flung himself on van zwieten for an instant he was more than a match for the big dutchman how dare you i have no brother he gasped then as suddenly this strength born of anger went out of him and he became weak as a child van zwieten picked him up like a baby and flung him roughly into a chair sit there he said sternly i mean to know the whole of this story and he busied himself lighting the lamp there is no no story there is and what's more you will tell it to me i won't cried mr scarse shivering and forgetting his previous denial you can't force me to speak i can i will said the dutchman grimly then the lamp being lighted he sat down in an armchair on the other side of the fireplace opposite to his host and produced a cigar begin please scarse staggered to his feet he was shaken by his own nerves and van zwieten's rough treatment and moved slowly toward the door the dutchman rose and ran past him with a lightness and speed surprising in so heavy a man he reached the door before mr scarse did the next moment it was locked and the key in van zwieten's pocket go back to your seat please said van zwieten politely i won't i am master here cried the old man his voice shrill with anger what do you mean by treating me like this i'll call the police the dutchman pulled out the key and held it toward scarse as you please he said with a sneer call the police and i'll give you in charge give me in charge you villain for what for murdering gilbert malet aha my dear friend you did not count on my knowing that did you you are quite unaware that i followed you from your cottage into the orchards where you i did not i did not wailed scarse shrinking back no you did not retorted van zwieten but you were near the spot where malet was killed and near it about the time he was shot you will find it difficult to refute my evidence if i am compelled to give it on the whole mr stuart scarse i think you had better sit down and talk sensibly scarse glared like an angry cat but physically and morally the dutchman was too much for him with an attempt at dignity he returned to his seat i am at a loss to understand this extraordinary behavior mr van zwieten he said in his most stately manner and i deny the shameful accusation you have made perhaps you will be kind enough to apologize and leave my rooms my dear friend i shall do neither van zwieten carefully lighted his cigar i am waiting to hear the story what story asked the other willfully misunderstanding the story about your brother and his visit to chippingholt to murder our dear friend i know some of it from your brother but i have no brother i tell you oh yes i think so a twin brother named robert robert scarse he is dead to me ah that is quite another thing he has come to life for the purpose of throwing some light on this mystery indeed i think you had better tell me why he murdered gilbert malet he did not murder him oh yes he did and i should like to have details please his motive and all that i refuse to give them to you van zwieten rose and buttoned his coat very good said he then i shall see a magistrate and tell him all i know what do you know sufficient to have robert arrested for the murder and you as his accomplice mr scarse shivered again and bit his lip then he seemed to make up his mind sit down don't be in a hurry i will tell you all i can of course you will keep secret what i tell you of course i never talk without good reason so you have a twin brother yes robert he is he he is not in his right mind so i should think from his talk and his extraordinary apparel a black crape scarf is quite original by the way your daughter saw him to day brenda cried scarse horrified then she knows nothing except that robert is wonderfully like you i got him away before she could speak to him this i did for your sake and my own you wish to make quite sure of getting brenda to force me not exactly that smiled van zwieten since i know that you are already quite willing she should marry me but i wish to use the knowledge to force her into giving up burton and becoming my wife you would tell her of robert's existence not if i could help myself said the dutchman politely believe me my dear friend i am very discreet you can safely confide in me it seems i am forced to grumbled mr scarse ungraciously what is it you particularly wish to know the whole story about your brother and why you deny him i am sure it will be most interesting go on please i am waiting mr scarse looked at his tyrant savagely he would dearly have liked to refuse but he realized that he was on perilous ground van zwieten knew just enough to be dangerous he must not be allowed to make use of his knowledge even if he had to be told more besides mr scarse was satisfied that for brenda's sake he would keep quiet therefore he made a virtue of necessity and launched at once into a family history of which in no other circumstances would he have spoken to any living soul it was the very fact of the dutchman's having it in his power to force his confidence that angered him no man likes to be coerced i don't think the story will interest you much he said sulkily but such as it is i will relate it robert scarse is my twin brother and is as like me as it is possible for one man to be like another his appearance deceived young burton and the chippingholt folk i know they took him for you and on account of that scarf they paid you the compliment of thinking you were out of your mind mr scarse shrugged his shoulders as if i cared he said contemptuously my speeches in the house prove that i am sane enough well robert is my brother and i was i am very fond of him my sister julia mrs st leger you know never liked him and when we cast him off she made up her mind to regard him as dead she never even admits that she has a brother i am her only relative at least the only one she acknowledges and why pray was robert cast off thus and by his affectionate twin don't be sarcastic van zwieten it does not suit you snapped scarse my brother was a bad lot at school and college he led the authorities a devil of a dance until he was expelled when he came to london he took to gambling and drinking i was never like that my one desire was to get into parliament where my father had been before me and serve my country my sister married st leger he was a subaltern then and went out to india my mother died and there was no one to check robert's pranks my father paid his debts so often that we became quite impoverished that is why i am so poor are you poor asked van zwieten thinking regretfully that brenda sweet as she was would have no dowry as poor as a church mouse i married a woman with six hundred a year and out of that brenda has two hundred a year i can't touch it what with the other four hundred and my own money i have but a thousand a year all told little enough for a man of my position of course when i die my thousand a year will go to brenda ah said van zwieten with much satisfaction he was sufficiently dutch to be very fond of money you needn't look so pleased van zwieten even if you do marry brenda which i doubt since she hates you so you won't get my money i'll live a long time yet and in any case i'll settle it on her so that her husband whoever he may be can't touch it quite right mr scarse but about robert please go on well robert crowned his pranks by committing forgery and my father had to pay i don't know how many thousands to hush the matter up you can make no use of this admission mr van zwieten since the man whose name was forged died long ago and the papers are all destroyed robert went abroad after that and my father cut him off with a shilling he forbade his name to be mentioned and declared he was no son of his mrs st leger acted in the same way and i followed suit i could do nothing else if i had my father would have disinherited me most affectionate twin don't talk like that cried mr scarse angrily who are you to judge me i still love my brother after all he is my own flesh and blood and nearer and dearer to me than it is possible for you to imagine but he is supposed to be dead these thirty and more years and why should i bring him forth into the world only to be disgraced i allow him a small income and under another name he is as happy as ever he will be by the way he broke off suddenly how did you find out his real name oh i saw the resemblance and made use of my knowledge of his being in chippingholt to force him into confessing the truth i will tell you about that later on go on with your story which is truly remarkable truly criminal i think mr scarse said gloomily a nice family history for a sedate english gentleman to have i wonder what my constituents would say if they heard it ah there is a skeleton in every house in a way it is a relief to me to talk of it even to you van zwieten mrs st leger will never mention or listen to the subject well well my friend van zwieten was becoming impatient of this digression what did your brother do when he was cut off from his family you'll never believe it when i tell you strange to say he mended his ways on the continent in switzerland i fancy he came into contact with some socialists and imbibed their ideas he put away all his fine clothes and extravagant tastes and became quite humble and simple because he had no money to do otherwise there is something in that well he lived among these socialists for many a long year he went to russia and saw tolstoi knew karl marx and threw himself headlong into schemes whereby the human race was to be saved by all manner of devices having as their basis the equitable division of property then he married a young girl a swiss the daughter of one of his socialistic friends and returned to england he was poor so i helped him out of your poverty how noble sneered van zwieten lighting a fresh cigar oh i was richer then i was married and my wife had money then she died a few years after brenda was born and i put the child to school as soon as she was of an age she was brought up away from me he went on sadly that is why i have such small influence over her you will have influence enough to make her marry me my friend i doubt it i doubt it well my brother lived in a poor way having but little money besides which his ideas were all against luxury his wife was beautiful and frivolous and had no love for him she coveted money and position neither of which he could give her and would not if he could that was ten years ago ah and what happened then my brother's wife met malet he was handsome rich and a scoundrel and he ran away with her van zwieten appeared astonished he wasn't then married to lady jenny no he married lady jenny later but he ran off with my brother's wife to italy and the shock of his wife's treachery gave poor robert brain fever he loved her then he worshipped her she was his life he lived only to make her happy well he had his recompense she deceived him deserted him without a word she eloped with that scoundrel robert lost his reason and i had to put him in an asylum there he was for two years when he came out he went in search of his wife for he still loved her malet by that time had come back alone and shortly afterward he married lady jenny the reptile do you wonder that i hated him for robert's sake i saw him and forced him to tell the truth i threatened to inform his wife of his past if he did not but all that was before the marriage no woman would care if lady jenny would she is half italian and of an extremely jealous disposition she loved malet god only knows why and had she found out the truth then she would have left him but malet told me where to find my brother's wife and i held my tongue did lady jenny ever learn this story you shall hear robert found his wife and took her back she was a complete wreck and terribly unhappy they lived at poplar under another name on the small income i could allow them for years i saw very little of robert then he took it into his head to pose as a prophet of evil predicting woe to england he assumed that snuff colored coat and wore the crape scarf as a symbol of his mourning he was frequently in trouble with the police and several times i helped him out of his scrapes why don't you shut him up again ah my friend how could i take the poor fellow from his dying wife all those years she was bedridden and dying slowly i could not part them latterly he used to come now and again to see me at chippingholt usually at night and in ordinary dress on one occasion he arrived in the daytime and met lady jenny he knew her by sight and he told her the truth about his wife and her husband that was a year ago lady jenny was furious and i believe she quarrelled with her husband after that they were never the same to one another she loved him once but after that she must have hated him robert was foolish to have told her it could do no good well what then he went away and for months i saw nothing of him the next i heard was when brenda told me harold burton had met a man like me with a crape scarf round his neck from the description i recognized robert and knew that his mind must be more than ever unhinged for him to have come down in what he called his prophetic robes i knew he would not come to see me till dusk and i waited anxiously but he did not appear so i went out to look for him it struck me that he might be lurking round the manor gates to see gilbert malet and perhaps to do him an injury i searched for a long time and was caught in the storm then i found robert in the orchards and led him home he told me his news what was his news his wife was dead and he had come to tell malet chapter xiii the end of the story his wife was dead repeated van zwieten without showing much sympathy and he came down to tell you no he came to tell malet and kill him scarse shook his head i am telling you the truth he said if robert were guilty i should admit it the poor fellow is crazy as you know and at the worst can only be put away in an asylum again i am not afraid for him but i fear a public scandal which might shake my position and force me to resign my seat no robert did not kill the man but he met him and told him the truth about what hour was that shortly after nine o'clock i met robert wandering in the orchards at a quarter past and i took him home with me malet according to the doctor's evidence was shot about half past nine at that time robert was conversing with me in my study but he met malet insisted van zwieten rather disappointed at this statement which he had every reason to believe was true yes he met malet and told him that his victim was dead malet grossly insulted robert and there was a quarrel unable to restrain his anger robert threw himself on malet but being an old man and feeble he was easily overpowered and thrown to the ground robert told me this and i believe it is the truth because i found his crape scarf was torn no doubt in the struggle malet left him lying on the wet grass and went off he must have been shot almost immediately afterward by whom asked van zwieten keenly ah that is the question i have my suspicions but i may be wrong but when brenda came home with the news of a murder i guessed that the victim was malet the servants came to my study door and found it locked robert was with me then and i had locked the door because i did not want him to be seen they thought it was you i was talking to and i said it was you when afterward you came in by the front door they knew of course that i had lied brenda asked me about that and i still declared that you had been with me but that you had gone out of the study window to the front door i told her also that i was the man seen by harold burton why did you do that can't you guess to save robert he had a grievance against malet he had been struggling with him and there was every chance that he might be accused of the murder there was only my evidence to prove his alibi and as i was his brother i dreaded lest my word should be insufficient while the servants were with brenda in the kitchen i went back to my study put a coat of my own on robert and gave him a soft hat to pull down over his eyes then i gave him money and told him to catch the ten thirty train from chippingholt to langton junction which he did said van zwieten i was watching all that business through your study window i followed robert wondering who he was and watched him go off by the train then i came home to the house and was admitted as you know why did you not speak to me it was not the proper moment to speak i did not know who robert was and until i entered the house i knew nothing about the murder i also guessed the victim was malet and i thought you must have hired this man to kill him and having finished with him had got him safely out of the way ah you were anxious to trap me cried mr scarse angrily well you know the truth now and you can do nothing i burned the crape scarf and i told brenda i was the man harold had seen if you choose to make a scandal i shall tell my story exactly as i have told it to you and prove robert's innocence at the worst he can only be put under restraint again i don't wish to make any scandal said the dutchman mildly more especially seeing that your daughter is to be my wife you can rely on my silence if only on that account but i'm glad i have heard this story now i want to know who killed malet that i can't say said mr scarse gloomily but i suspect the wife lady jenny and why robert had a note written to her saying his wife was dead he brought it with him he sent it up to her by a boy that same evening of course the boy thought that robert was me i see cried van zwieten with a shout robert wanted to stir up lady jenny into killing her husband he is not so crazy to my thinking but i don't see how the intelligence of the wife's death would achieve it he added shaking his head gravely lady jenny knew all about the matter and hadn't harmed her husband there was no reason why she should do it on that particular night that is what puzzles me replied mr scarse lady jenny was out on that night she did not go to the rectory to see captain burton as she had intended for that she gave the very unsatisfactory reason that she was caught in the storm is it not probable that she met her husband and killed him no she would not carry a revolver if they had already met and quarrelled about this dead woman then it is possible she might in her jealous rage have made an attack upon her husband with anything to her hand but a revolver would argue deliberation and there was nothing sufficiently strong in the note your brother had prepared for her to urge her to deliberate murder burton found a piece of crape in the dead man's hand argued scarse and lady jenny was wearing crape for her father there might have been a struggle and the piece might have come off in his hand nonsense scarse ladies don't do that sort of thing besides your brother wore crape too and it is more likely that it was torn from his scarf malet might have kept it in his hand without being conscious of it probably when he went to his death then you think lady jenny is innocent it looks like it van zwieten said with a queer smile but i'll let you know my opinion later on and he rose to go you will keep my secret entreated scarse following his visitor to the door assuredly i can make no use of it i thought to find your brother guilty but it seems he is not the mystery deepens but lady jenny true lady jenny well we shall see and with this enigmatic speech the dutchman withdrew mr scarse went back to his chair and until midnight sat looking drearily into the fire but he was sufficiently thoughtful to send a letter to brenda telling her of his safety in spite of the trafalgar square mob for the next few days he went about like a man in a dream although he knew very well that van zwieten would hold his tongue for he had nothing to gain by wagging it he blamed himself for having been coerced into a confession to him the dutchman was almost a stranger he had been drawn to the man because he was going out to the transvaal as an official and mr scarse had always sympathized with the little state in its struggle for independence the dutchman had drawn so pathetic a picture of that struggle had spoken so feelingly of the boers as a patriarchal people who desired only to be left tending their flocks and herds that the english politician was touched he had sworn to do all in his power to defend this simple people had become extremely friendly with van zwieten and in proof of that friendship had asked him down to chippingholt there the dutchman by spying and questioning had learned so much of his family secrets as to have become his master as such he had forced him into a confession and mr scarse felt if a scandal was to be avoided that he was at the man's mercy of course brenda would be the price of his silence formerly scarse had been willing enough that his daughter should marry van zwieten it would be a noble work for her to aid him to build up a new state in south africa but now he saw that the dutchman was by no means the unselfish philanthropist he had supposed him to be he was tricky and shifty his was the iron hand in the velvet glove and if he became brenda's husband it was by no means improbable that he would ill treat her it did not seem right to force her into this marriage when she loved another man after all she was his daughter his only daughter and scarse's paternal instinct awoke even thus late in the day to prompt him to protect and cherish her if he felt for poor robert and his woes surely he could feel for the troubles of brenda musing thus it occurred to him that he might frustrate any probable schemes of van zwieten by telling the whole truth to brenda then let her marry harold and defy the man at all events he determined that brenda should be introduced to the family skeleton and accordingly one afternoon he drove to kensington mrs st leger was out so was the colonel and he found his daughter alone when he entered for all the world like an old grey wolf for his troubles had aged him brenda came forward with a look of astonishment in her eyes usually her father was not so attentive as to pay her a visit and she could not conjecture the meaning of the tender expression on his face as a matter of fact mr scarse was realizing for the first time that this tall beautiful girl was his daughter but she could not divine this and her welcome to him was as usual quite cold how are you father she said kissing him in a conventional way i am glad to see you but i expected harold and was quite astonished when you came in and disappointed too i suppose said scarse in a low voice something in his tone struck her sensitive ear as unusual no i am glad to see you she repeated but but but you know father there was never much love lost between us ah brenda i fear that too much love has been lost i wish to speak openly and seriously to you brenda he looked at her piteously but i don't know how to begin are you not well father yes yes i am quite well he replied leaning on her shoulder as she led him to the sofa but i'm worried dear worried sit down here worried what about she sat down but could not as yet grasp the situation it was so novel so unexpected about you about myself my dear i have not been a good father to you brenda stared were the heavens going to fall so astonished was she by this wholly unexpected show of tenderness that she could make no answer he looked at her anxiously and continued i fear i have been so engrossed by my duty to my country that i have forgotten my duty to you my child i should not have left you so long at school away from me no wonder you have so little affection for me i am not much more than a name to you but i see now how wrong i have been brenda dear and i want to do my best to make amends to you you will let me father she cried all her warm and generous heart going out to him in his penitence she threw her arms round his neck don't say any more dear i have to ask your forgiveness too for i have not been all a daughter should be to you ah brenda it is my fault i kept you from me but that shall not be now dear i have found my daughter and i will keep her kiss me brenda she kissed him and her eyes filled with tears in that moment of joy in finding her father she forgot even harold these words of tenderness were balm to her aching heart and too deeply moved to speak she wept on his shoulder henceforth she would be different everything would be different and the man himself was scarcely less moved how foolish i have been brenda i have lost the substance for the shadow no no father i love you i have always loved you but i thought you did not care for me i care for you now brenda hush hush do not cry child you won't ask me to marry mr van zwieten now father no replied he vigorously i intend to have nothing further to do with that man ah she exclaimed raising her head at last you have found him out no dear i have not exactly found him out but i have come to the conclusion that he is double dealing and dangerous you shall not marry him brenda you love harold and harold shall be your husband but i must not lose my daughter he added tenderly you shall not father you shall gain a son oh how happy i am and laying her head upon his shoulder she wept tears of pure joy for some moments he did not speak but held her to him closely he too was happy had not felt so happy for years how he regretted now having kept this warm pure affection at arm's length for so long but time was passing and mrs st leger and the colonel might be back at any moment and he had much to tell her listen to me brenda dear he said raising her head gently do you remember the man so like me whom harold saw the man with the crape scarf of course i remember him father she looked steadfastly at him expecting a revelation since he had so unexpectedly introduced the subject i saw him in trafalgar square on the day of the meeting and you knew that it was not me yes but he was so like you that had he not been on the platform i might easily have mistaken him for you like harold did had you spoken to him you would have found out your mistake sighed scarse i wanted to but mr van zwieten took him away i know i know brenda i deceived you about that man for your own sake and for mine i took his sins on my shoulders that he might not get into trouble what brenda's voice rose almost to a shriek did he kill mr malet no no replied her father eagerly i can prove to you that he did not but brenda do you not wonder why he is so like me and why i take so deep an interest in him i do wonder i thought he might be a relative but you denied it and aunt julia said she had no relative but you mr scarse drooped his head julia ah she is still bitter against poor robert robert who is he my twin brother brenda your uncle oh brenda threw up her hands in surprise and i never knew no one knows but your aunt and myself and she denies him and van zwieten knows oh father how can he know i told him replied mr scarse quietly i was forced to tell him lest he should imagine the truth to be worse than it is and he might have got me into trouble and not only me but poor mad robert mad is my uncle mad yes poor soul now i will tell you what made him mad the same story that i was forced to tell van zwieten brenda looked anxiously at her father and placed her hand in his grasping it hard he related the sad family history he had told the dutchman suppressing nothing extenuating nothing brenda listened in profound silence at times her eyes flashed at times she wept but never a word did she say when her father had finished her sorrow burst forth my dear father how good you are to think i have been such a bad daughter and you with all this worry on you oh forgive me forgive me and she threw herself sobbing into his arms my dear there is nothing to forgive i have told you why i bore this trouble in silence why i told van zwieten thank god you don't want me to marry him sobbed brenda harold and i are going to be married quietly at brighton better wait a while yet said scarse nervously it will drive van zwieten into a corner if you marry now and you don't know what he may do then he can't do anything father if he does attempt it i have only to tell lady jenny she can manage him harold has gone to see her about it somewhat astonished at this scarse was about to ask what way lady jenny could control van zwieten when the door opened and captain burton walked in looking considerably more cheerful than when brenda had seen him last he pulled up short at the amazing sight of the girl in her father's arms harold she exclaimed oh how glad i am you have come i have so much to tell you and father father father has just discovered that he has a dear daughter said scarse holding out his hand to the astounded young man yes harold and i consent to your marriage gladly but what about van zwieten gasped captain burton utterly at a loss to understand this sudden change of front he shall never marry brenda i'll tell you all about it wait one minute father cried the girl harold did you see lady jenny yes brenda i have seen her it is all right she can manage van zwieten no i won't tell you now she particularly wishes to do that herself chapter xiv what van zwieten knew the clever criminal who wishes to escape the law does not seek provincial neighborhoods or foreign climes he remains in london for him no place is so safe there a man can disappear from one district and reappear in another without danger of recognition by unwelcome friends of course the pertinacity of the police may do much to complicate matters but the history of crime goes to show very clearly that they are by no means infallible but about them van zwieten troubled himself very little certainly he changed his name to jones for his own in those anti dutch times smacked overmuch of holland but for the rest his disguise was slight from st james's he changed his address to a part of westminster where none of his west end friends were likely to come across him and as mr jones he carried on his plotting against the empire with every sense of security and in such security he saw only a strong proof of john bull's stupidity an englishman would have seen in it a glorious example of freedom in a side street van zwieten alias mr jones dwelt on the first floor of a quiet house let out in lodgings by the quietest of widows and mrs hicks had a good opinion of her lodger it is true he was somewhat erratic in his movements for days he would go away into the country he said and even when in town would be absent for many hours at a stretch but he paid well and regularly was not exacting about either his food or attendance and behaved altogether in the most becoming manner he certainly saw a great number of people and they called on him principally at night but mr jones had kindly informed her how he was writing a great book on london and how these people were gathering materials for him had mrs hicks known the kind of materials they were collecting she might or might not have been astonished certainly she would have been but little the wiser a decent if narrow minded little person mrs hicks knew little of politics and still less of spies these latter on those few occasions when they had presented themselves to her mind she pictured as foreign persons given to meeting by candlelight with mask and cloaks and daggers that the kind gentleman who was so polite to her and so kind to her fatherless children should be a spy assuredly never entered mrs hick's head van zwieten it is more convenient to call him so sat in his rooms one night in the second week in october his face wore a satisfied smile for a great event had taken place free state and transvaal under the sapient guidance of their presidents had thrown down the gage of defiance to england and the federal armies were overrunning natal scarse and his following were dreadfully shocked at this sample of simplicity on the part of their innocent lamb it was all out of keeping with mr kruger's pacific intentions as extolled by them indeed they found it necessitated a change of tactics on their part so they right about faced and deplored that war should thus have been forced on an honest god fearing man in all sincerity they tried to divide the country on the question of the war and in brussels leyds was doing his best to hound on the continental powers to attacking england altogether van zwieten was very well satisfied with the outlook what with the unprepared state of the british in natal leyds on the continent scarse and his friends in london it seemed as though the boers by treachery and cunning and the due display of armament as formidable as it was wholly unlooked for would come safely out of the desperate adventure to which they had committed themselves van zwieten's part was to send off certain final information to leyds for transmission to pretoria and then to leave england but van zwieten was not going out to fight for his adopted country oh dear no he had ostensibly thrown up his appointment in the transvaal which in truth he had never held in great indignation before the war began proclaiming himself as a neutral person anxious to reconcile the english and the boers he had solicited and obtained the post of war correspondent on a little england newspaper called the morning planet this paper whose columns were filled with the hysterical hooting of scarse and his friends was only too glad to employ a foreigner instead of an englishman and van zwieten received good pay and an order to go to the front at once now he was occupied in burning a mass of papers gathering up the loose ends of his innumerable conspiracies and looking forward to a speedy departure all his spies had been paid and dismissed he had one more letter to despatch to the patriotic leyds and then he was free to turn his attention to his private affairs these were concerned chiefly with an attempt to force brenda into giving up burton and accepting his hand by threatening to denounce her father and his brother he had never for a moment intended to keep the promise he had made to scarse he was too slim for that he possessed knowledge which would serve him to his own ends and he intended to use it for that purpose burton too was to leave with his regiment next day and was already at southampton and once he was parted from brenda there would be a better chance of bringing her to see reason van zwieten smiled sweetly as he thought on these things and gave himself up to the contemplation of that rosy future when the republics conquered england as they assuredly would he forgot that very significant saying that man proposes and god disposes but van zwieten was a heathen and had very little belief in an overruling providence he knew how to make himself snug did this dutchman his room was large and comfortably if not luxuriously furnished wall paper carpet and curtains were all of a dark green tone two windows led on to a light iron balcony but at present these were closed and the curtains were drawn the firelight he had lighted a fire because the evening was chilly shed its comfortable glow on the two easy chairs wherewith he had supplemented the furniture of mrs hicks to him belonged also a tall press with pigeon holes filled with papers and a knee hole desk with many drawers and brass knobs on this latter the lamp was placed and its crimson shade shut off the light beyond the immediate circle cast on the desk on the mantel glittered a gimcrack french clock and three extraordinary ornaments with brass pendants but altogether the room was decidedly comfortable and as mr van zwieten did not pay for it out of his own pocket maybe he enjoyed it all the more on that account at the present moment he was shifting papers from the pigeon holes into an iron box destroying some and burning others and executing the business with ease and despatch while he was thus employed a timid knock came at the door he knew the knock well and he knew that behind it was mrs hicks he did not desist from his occupation because he held her of but small account it would have been otherwise had the knock been sharp and peremptory well mrs hicks he said graciously as the pale widow glided in what is it if you please mr jones there is a man waiting to see you a man a gentleman a common person sir in a rough coat and a cap and big boots i don't think he's a gentleman as he speaks rough like and his black hair and beard look very untidy mr jones i was once a lady's maid sir so i ought to know a gentleman when i see him show him up said van zwieten curtly then as she left the room he made certain preparations he closed the press doors and the lid of his iron box seated himself at his desk and glanced into a drawer to be sure that his revolver was handy in van zwieten's walk of life it was necessary to be forearmed as well as forewarned the man who shortly afterward came tramping into the room fully bore out mrs hicks's description he was of medium height and rather stout and was roughly dressed in coarse blue serge and had a tangle of black curls and a heavy black beard he was not a prepossessing object in response to van zwieten's invitation he shuffled into an armchair by the desk and pushed it well back into the shadow the act though skillfully done roused the dutchman's suspicions but he was accustomed in his delicate profession to deal with curious customers and he showed no surprise he did not even shift the shade of the lamp but very much on the alert he waited for the stranger to state his business is your name jones asked the man in a gruff surly voice yes that is my name and yours dobbs augustus dobbs i should have brought a letter to you but i didn't it's better to do my own business off my own hook i reckon are you a yankee asked van zwieten noting the expression and a slight twang i guess so i come from n'york city i do and i fancy a run out to the transvaal to have a slap at the britishers indeed said the dutchman staring blankly at his visitor and what have i to do with your ambitions in that direction the man drew the back of his hand across his mouth and van zwieten noted that the hand was white and well cared for this in contrast to the rough dress and harsh voice made him more circumspect than ever he began to suspect a trap and wondered which of his enemies for he had many could have set it do you know a man named mazaroff asked mr dobbs after a pause no replied van zwieten lying cheerfully never heard of him he's a russian the name sounds like it dobbs looked disappointed and turned sullen he knows you mr jones indeed that is not improbable did he send you to me yes he did dobbs had dropped his american accent by this time and only used it again when he recollected himself mazaroff said you paid well for certain information what kind of information about the war he leaned forward and spoke in a gruff whisper what would you say to a plan of the whole campaign against the boers van zwieten smiled blandly of what possible interest can that be to me mazaroff said you would be prepared to pay well for such information he knows me then better than i do myself replied van zwieten better than i know him for indeed i have no knowledge of your russian friend but this plan of campaign mr dobbs how did it come into your possession dobbs looked round mysteriously and rising in his chair leaned toward van zwieten i stole it he said softly and i am willing to sell it at a price think of it mr jones a plan of campaign symons's plans the boers would be able to frustrate it easily van zwieten looked his man up and down with a smile his gaze alighted on those well kept hands which his visitor had placed on the desk to steady himself as he leaned forward on the third finger of the left hand was a ring and van zwieten recognized it it was a gold signet ring with a crest the moment he set eyes on it the spy jumped to a conclusion which happened to be the right one he knew now who his visitor was and he played him as a skillful angler plays a trout not a muscle of his face moved not a flush or a look betrayed his newly gained knowledge but he smiled behind his golden beard to think that he was master of the situation so mr mazaroff told you that i bought such things he said negligently yes and that you paid a large price for them ah and what would you call a fair price for these papers say a thousand pounds that is a very large price indeed too large i fear for me said van zwieten most amiably perhaps you can see your way to make it lower the visitor could not refrain from a movement of satisfaction which was duly noted by the astute dutchman well he said i will do what i can to meet you van zwieten smiled he saw that the man was growing excited and that in his excitement he would probably betray himself that is accommodating of you mr dobbs but how can i be certain this plan is genuine you can be perfectly certain for i stole it from the war office indeed that is certainly first hand but how did you an american get into the war office i have been a porter there for some time said dobbs glibly i am allowed access to all the rooms i saw those papers on a desk and i took them mazaroff told me you paid well so well i came to you come now you shall have them for five hundred pounds too much mr dobbs three hundred said the man trembling with eagerness ah that's more reasonable have you the papers with you no but if you will come to my lodgings i will give them to you but i must have the money first certainly will a check do oh yes a check will do right enough van zwieten produced a check book and bent over it to hide a smile he drew the check but before signing it looked up of course this rather inculpates you he said i suppose you know what it means if you were caught at this game i'm willing to take the risk said dobbs nervously quite so just see if i've got your name correctly burton isn't it what do you mean wilfred burton i i don't understand van zwieten deftly twitched the beard off the face of his visitor and snatched the shade off the lamp do you understand now he said laughing look in the glass sir and see if augustus dobbs is not wilfred burton wilfred was ghastly pale but more with rage at the failure of his scheme than with fear with a cry of anger he sprang up and whipped a revolver out of his pocket but van zwieten on the alert for some such contingency was quite as quick he also snatched a revolver from the drawer and with levelled weapons the two men faced one another van zwieten was as calm as the other was excited you are very clever mr burton he said mockingly but when you are in disguise you should not wear a signet ring i observed your crest on the letters written to miss scarse by your brother come how long are we to stand like this is it a duel if so i am ready wilfred uttered an oath and slipped his weapon into his pocket with a laugh van zwieten tossed his into the drawer again and sat down quite unruffled i think we understand one another now he said genially what induced you to play this trick on me because you are a spy replied wilfred fiercely and if i had my way i would put a bullet through you well and why don't you mocked an zwieten do you see that iron box it is full of papers which might be of the greatest interest to you shoot me and take possession of it your government would reward you or hang you they'll hang you if they learn the truth we are at war with the boers and you are a boer spy a word from me and you would be arrested i dare say there are enough documents in that box to hang me i dare say you bribed mazaroff and learned my business also my address here as mr jones but i am not afraid not that van zwieten snapped his fingers you can walk out and call up the police if you like and what is to prevent my doing so two things one is that i leave immediately for the transvaal oh yes my work here is done and well done i have found out how unprepared you english are for this war you talk big but there is nothing at the back of it confound you cried wilfred his white face flushing you'll find out what is at the back of it when we hoist the british flag at pretoria what is the second thing your brother you love your brother no doubt mr burton he sails to morrow with his regiment from southampton quite so well mr burton it is a good thing he is going it is better he should be shot than hanged hanged wilfred sprang from his seat with a bound the morning after the murder continued van zwieten without taking any notice i examined the place where malet was shot ah you blind english who see nothing even when it lies under your nose i am dutch i am sharp i looked and looked and i found this he slipped his hand into the open drawer of the desk and produced a heavy revolver of the army pattern this mr burton with which your brother shot mr malet you you can't prove it is harold's said he white but calm easily here is a silver plate on the butt with his name now what do you say that my brother is innocent the revolver is his but some one else fired the shot van zwieten shrugged his shoulders i am afraid you will find it difficult to get a jury to take that view mr burton your brother quarrelled with malet he was overheard to threaten him he was out in the storm and could not account for his time and here is his revolver with all that evidence i could hang him but you know well i'll be generous hold your tongue and i'll hold mine what do you say wilfred looked piercingly at van zwieten who had dropped his bantering tone and was in earnest harold is innocent said he but i'll hold my tongue chapter xv the girl he left behind him when wilfred had taken his departure van zwieten drew a breath of relief he had only escaped a great danger by virtue of his ready resource and the excitability and hot headed impulsiveness of his adversary without doubt wilfred's plan and a harum scarum plan it was had been to decoy him into an ambush of police on the pretence of selling him the so called state papers and when he had irretrievably betrayed himself to have had him arrested as a spy thanks only to his skill in penetrating the disguise of his visitor van zwieten had evaded this peril but he had been in greater danger than even wilfred knew the papers in the iron box were sufficient to prove him a spy ten times over had wilfred only been astute enough to have procured a search warrant on the evidence of mazaroff and with the assistance of the police to have raided the premises of the so called mr jones these papers would have been discovered and mr van zwieten's little games put an end to for the time being but wilfred had let the golden moment go by and the dutchman was safe from his worst enemy that is from the one who wished him most harm and who knew most to his disadvantage there was no doubt that wilfred was now powerless to move against him by skillfully suggesting that harold had committed the murder which was untrue and producing the revolver inscribed with harold's name which had been found near the scene of the murder which was true van zwieten had effectually stopped the mouth of mr wilfred burton if that young man now denounced him to the authorities he would do so at the risk of having his brother arrested and in the face of such evidence it might be that harold would be found guilty in any case he would be prevented from sailing for south africa but van zwieten while looking after himself had no wish that things should go thus far he was most anxious that captain burton should go to the front for if chance did not aid him he had quite determined to have him specially shot in action at present things were going as he wished wilfred was coerced into silence he himself was safe and harold was about to go to his death in natal there remained only brenda to deal with and with her mr van zwieten hoped to come to an understanding very shortly now the rest of the night he spent in burning such papers as he did not require and in packing the remainder in the iron box it was of no great size this box and one man could carry it away with ease van zwieten locked it and then stowed it away on the top of the tall press in a hollow formed by the ornamentation of the crest into this the precious box just fitted and thus carelessly deposited he took it to be far safer than any more elaborate attempt at concealment could make it a thief would assuredly make for the safe first and foremost so would the police while neither would think of looking on the top of the press not that van zwieten expected either thieves or police for that matter but it was his habit to place the box there and what had happened in no way caused him to depart from his usual custom having thus finished his work he went to bed and slept for a few hours and as he closed his eyes his thoughts were altogether pleasant i shall go down to southampton to morrow they ran and see burton off for the front i sha'n't exactly relish being witness of his very tender leave taking with brenda but it will be some satisfaction to know it's for the last time she won't see him again we'll be married at once and i'll follow close on his heels if he only knew if she only knew but that is what shall be i van zwieten have spoken then once in the british camp i can both serve these brave little republics and make sure that captain harold burton is made short work of that will be very easily done and then when all is over and these british hogs are driven into the sea i'll come and fetch my little wife and there amid the glorious expanse of the veldt we shall live together happily ever after a beautiful little castle of cards truly but one which had he only known was destined to be very much knocked about by fate over which not even he van zwieten had control next morning he was up betimes and handing the key of his rooms to mrs hicks with strict injunctions to admit no one he set off for waterloo station he knew that he could trust his little landlady and he judged it wiser to do so than to lock up and take the key in his pocket for of that even she might have been suspicious on his way to the terminus he again relapsed into a gentle and wholly self congratulatory reverie and with a religious zeal worthy of a follower of oom paul he fished from the deep recesses of his memory a text bearing on the destruction of the unrighteous to wit in this instance messieurs wilfred and harold burton the ancient town of southampton was gay with flags crowded with people and bubbling over with excitement and bustle through the streets marched the troops in khaki with resolute faces and swinging tread while those whose rights they were going to defend cheered them poured blessings on them and sought to enliven them with frequent snatches of patriotic song not since the days of the crimea a dim memory even to the older generation had there been such excitement and the great transport lay there a floating barracks ready and impatient to carry these brave fellows overseas to vindicate the name of britain as a civilizing and protective power oom paul had been given rope enough now he was going to hang himself or be hanged as he assuredly deserved to be maybe van zwieten thought otherwise he surveyed the excited throng with his usual bland smile and pushed his way through their midst down to the quay knowing as no one else did the true power of the republics he smiled grimly as he thought how soon all this joy would be turned into mourning but what mr van zwieten did not know what he could not realize was that the more terrible the danger threatening a britisher the more does he set his back to the wall and set his teeth to meet it and to conquer in the bright sunlight the troops embarked speeches were made healths were drunk and many a hand gripped hand on board the transport the officers were busy looking after their men and superintending the horses being taken on board brenda quietly dressed and doing her best to keep up her spirits was leaning on the arm of her father and longing for a few last words with harold but captain burton a fine soldierly figure in his khaki uniform was on duty and could not be spared for the moment much as mr scarse disliked the war and reprobated the causes which had led to it he had come down with brenda to see the last of harold but in the face of all this he could not but lament inwardly that the good offices of the peace party had not prevailed this stir and military activity was surely out of all proportion to the business in hand the subjugation of a mere handful of farmers but mr scarse forgot that wasps are not so easily crushed that the larger the fist that tries to crush them the greater the chance of its being stung while thus meditating on the iniquity of his country he felt his daughter start and when he looked at her he saw that she was white and trembling what is it brenda he asked nervously for he had not been the same man since his interview with the dutchman i have seen mr van zwieten she replied faintly he is yonder in the crowd he smiled in that horrible way of his when he caught my eye never mind brenda van zwieten can do no harm now and shortly we shall be rid of him altogether he is going out to the cape to pretoria you mean no i mean to the cape returned her father rather to my surprise i hear he has given up his appointment in the transvaal and has thrown in his lot with this misguided country he goes with lord methuen as the correspondent of the morning planet to report the massacre of his unfortunate countrymen i suppose i don't believe he is on our side brenda said vehemently at heart he is a traitor and has been living in london spying for the benefit of the boers so at least wilfred tells me wilfred is an excitable boy can he prove this wild charge not now but he intends to do so later he never will believe me i don't like van zwieten and i regret very much that i ever made a friend of him but i don't think he is a spy i'm sure he is how can you be sure because i hate him replied brenda with true feminine logic and if he is going to the front i'll tell harold to keep a sharp eye on him it might be quite as well dear replied her father forewarned is forearmed and when he learns the truth about you it is quite possible he might attempt some plot against harold i'm not afraid harold can protect himself even against such a scoundrel as van zwieten here is harold father how splendid he looks brenda might well be excused for her enthusiasm captain harold burton did make a most striking and soldierly figure in his close fitting khaki uniform he was trim and natty in his dress bright and ardent and full of enthusiasm for the work before him brenda would have had him a trifle more subdued since he was about to leave her but she had no cause to complain when he said good bye he felt their parting as much as she did even though as a man and a soldier he was more able to conceal his emotions come down to my cabin brenda he said taking her arm i have got ten minutes to spare we start in half an hour i won't come mr scarse said waving his hand take her down harold and get it over the two went below amongst the busy throng of stewards who were darting about getting the cabins in order into one on the starboard side captain burton led his wife he shared it with a brother officer who was at that moment on duty harold closed the door the girl was crying bitterly now he took her in his arms don't cry dear little wife he said tenderly please god i'll come back to you safe and sound oh harold you will i know you will she said earnestly nothing will happen to you i dreamed it did harold and dreams always go by contraries you know dearest if only i were coming with you i wouldn't mind dear brenda it is better as it is besides i should have had to leave you at cape town you could not have come to the front no dear you stay with your father and pray for a speedy end to the war remember you are my wife now brenda so i have no fear of any harm coming to you through that scoundrel van zwieten he is here harold i saw him among the crowd i have no fear for you dear there at the front but well i am afraid of van zwieten's treachery but he is in england dearest he can't hurt me out there he is leaving for the cape almost immediately father told me so well then laughed harold to comfort her if i see him in the ranks of the enemy i'll shoot him before he can take sight at me will that do harold he won't be in the ranks of the enemy why not the fellow is a boer or to all intents and purposes will be when he takes up his transvaal appointment that's just it he has given up the appointment and is going out as correspondent to the morning planet captain burton wrinkled his forehead i don't like this sudden conversion he said decisively wilfred believes the fellow is a spy and so do i dearest from the bottom of my heart well if he's going to hang about our camps for the spy business i'll make short work of him be careful harold oh be careful he is a dangerous man i shall know how to manage him out there wilfred is coming out you know in a week or so and i'll get him to tell me all he knows about van zwieten if he is a spy we'll watch him and have him slung up i'll keep my eyes open brenda and if he tries on any games before he leaves england just you see lady jenny what can she do a great deal she wouldn't tell me how she meant to manage him but she told me she would bring him to his knees that was why i determined to marry you before i left now that you are my wife lady jenny will look after you you must promise me dear that you'll go at once to her if he should cause you the least uneasiness i promise dearest for your sake oh harold how i wish i was going yes dear i know you do but you are a soldier's wife now and they do their work at home i have made my will leaving all i have to you brenda and if i don't come back his strong voice trembled you will have enough to live on at all events your father has the will harold harold she cried weeping on his breast for this parting was very bitter to her how can i bear it darling dearest be careful of your dear life for my sake for me your wife hush dear hush i am in the hands of god he pressed her closely to him and kissed her in silence then he looked upward and said a silent fervent prayer they clung to each other with aching hearts too deeply moved too sorrowful for words then the tramping of feet overhead the sound of cheers the shrill voice of the bo'sun's whistle made them start up brenda whispered harold pressing her again to his heart good bye my own dearest oh harold harold good bye darling god bless you and bring you back to me on deck he led her to her father who was standing by the gangway and placed her in his arms take care of her sir he said in a low voice then hurried away at the call of duty father and daughter descended the gangway to the wharf she stood as in a dream with streaming eyes among other women and looked at the great ship the shouts of the crowd the glitter of the sunshine the many colored bunting seemed like a cruel mockery to her aching heart her harold was gone from her and god knew when he would return and everywhere the women wept and strained and ached at parting with their dear ones the transport was like a hive at swarming time the soldiers were hanging over the bulwarks and clinging to the rigging hats and handkerchiefs waved women wept and men cheered then amidst all the noise and movement the blades of the screw began slowly to churn the water as the seething white foam swirled astern the band struck up auld lang syne and the great ship swung majestically into mid stream her engines throbbing and black smoke pouring through her funnels from the newly stoked furnaces below brenda for weeping could hardly see the grey monster gliding over the glittering waters nor strain as she would could she make out her harold's dear face amongst those hundreds of faces turned shoreward the band changed the tune i'm leaving thee in sorrow annie i'm leaving thee in tears my god exclaimed brenda almost hysterical now as she clutched her father's arm miss scarse said a voice at her elbow brenda looked up with a tear stained face and a look of horror came into her eyes as she saw van zwieten's hateful calm face you you ah harold go away sir go away said mr scarse curtly then he began to push through the crowd with brenda clinging to his arm i must speak to miss scarse insisted the dutchman following the old man turned on him like a wolf there is no miss scarse he said firmly my daughter is now mrs harold burton chapter xvi the unexpected happens as the full meaning of those words came upon him van zwieten paled his wicked eyes flashed fire and he uttered an oath which being in dutch was happily unintelligible to those around him for the moment he could neither move nor speak and seeing his momentary helplessness mr scarse with brenda on his arm hurried on through the crowd before the dutchman could recover his presence of mind there were already two or three lines of people between him and those whom he had fondly thought his victims they had tricked him in spite of all his caution even scarse whom he had been so sure of had turned against him but he would be revenged and that speedily conjecturing that they would probably go to the railway station van zwieten hurried thither if he did not find them in the london train then he would wait till he did in any case he swore to get at the truth about this marriage their punishment should follow on his part mr scarse seeing the devil which looked out of the dutchman's eyes knew that the man thus baffled was prepared to go to any lengths and that being so he was only too anxious to escape from so dangerous a neighborhood taken up with her own sorrow brenda had paid no attention to the presence or foreboding glance of van zwieten but submitted blindly to be guided through the crowd all she longed for was to get to some quiet place where she could give way unrestrained to this grief that shook her whole being and her father instinctively divined what she desired and said no word to comfort her but hurried her on to the station and by the judicious bestowal of half a sovereign secured a carriage to themselves the man touched his hat and after locking the door walked off to see if any other person's sorrow would take such tangible and wholly excellent form there in the corner of the carriage brenda lay back and wept for her lost husband whom it might be she would never see again but she had a great belief in dreams and in the contrariness of this particular dream and something told her he would come safe and sound out of the hurly burly of battle nevertheless life seemed very blank to her just then she wept on unrestrained her father paid no attention to her he was leaning out of the window watching for van zwieten his mind travelled quite as quickly as that of the dutchman and he guessed that he would come on to the station on the chance of finding himself and brenda in the london express the inspector came along unlocked the door and tried to hustle a couple of weeping women into the carriage but mr scarse gave his name and whispered that he had engaged the carriage whereupon the inspector promptly conducted the mourners to another compartment in his hurry he did not lock the door which as it turned out was unfortunate with great anxiety mr scarse watched the minute hand of the station clock crawl round to the hour at which the train was timed to start he turned hot and cold at the thought that van zwieten might come he had a very shrewd idea of the dutchman's present mood but there was no sign of him and the bell was ringing now for the departure of the express thank god cried mr scarse throwing himself back into his seat we have escaped that villain for the time being at any rate vain congratulation it was as if he had tempted the gods hardly had the train commenced to move when the door of the carriage was dashed open and van zwieten hurled himself into the compartment like a charging buffalo brenda uttered a cry of alarm her father swore a thing he very seldom permitted himself to do and the dutchman now quite master of his vile temper smiled blandly and subsided into a seat he cleared his throat to explain himself brenda cast on him one look of ineffable contempt although she was far from feeling contemptuous and did so merely out of bravado then she drew her veil down and glanced out of the window if she was forced to travel with him she was not forced to speak to him and besides she felt quite safe having her father to protect her and knowing how different now was his attitude toward the dutchman van zwieten smiled unpleasantly he knew well how to rouse her out of that indifference and he would do so when he judged the proper time had come meanwhile he explained himself to the enraged scarse whose blood was on fire at the creature's insolence notwithstanding the very elaborate pains at which you were to reserve this carriage scarse i trust you are sufficiently hospitable not to mind my joining you he said coolly i mind very much sir cried the other how dare you thrust your company where it is not wanted my daughter and i can dispense with your presence i dare say sneered the dutchman although he looked surprised at this unexpected resistance on the part of the hitherto meek mp but you see i have a great deal to say to you and miss scarse mrs burton if you please brenda said in a cutting tone van zwieten bowed his fair head in a cruelly ironical manner i beg your pardon i did not know i was a day after the fair but it seems to me most strange that you should be married when your father promised me that i should be your husband i did nothing of the sort said mr scarse bluntly i promised to consent to your marrying my daughter if she chose to have you but as she had a very distinct preference for captain burton i agreed to that and i'm glad of it he cried with energy at least she has married an honorable man i also am an honorable man i have kept your secret up to the present my secret cried the other contemptuously oh tell it to whom you please van zwieten bit his lip to prevent an exhibition of the surprise he felt at this unexpected defiance in that case i had better begin with miss sca i beg your pardon with mrs burton she would like to know she does know interrupted brenda in her clear voice there is nothing left for you to tell meinherr van zwieten ach you make me out to be dutch then you are wrong i am english quite so until it suits you to become a boer we shall see oh you will not have it all your own way in this war you english but enough of this he went on imperiously you know then that your father and his twin brother killed mr malet i know nothing of the sort retorted brenda with spirit you had better take the case into court and prove your assertion think of the scandal i can face all that cried mr scarse sharply if you think to blackmail me van zwieten you have come to the wrong person so far as what i told you is concerned you are harmless you can do nothing perhaps not i won't even try but the arrows are not all out of my quiver yet for you old man i care nothing you cross not my path so i can spare you but as for brenda the girl turned fearlessly upon him i will thank you sir to address me by my proper name which is mrs burton van zwieten winced he felt his position intensely though he put a brave face on it brenda saw this and realized the strain he was putting on himself to keep down his temper mrs burton well let it be so for the present until you change it for mrs van zwieten that will be never oh yes when you are a widow brenda shuddered and fell back on her cushions but her father leaned forward and shook his fist at the dutchman i am an old man he said hoarsely and you are young and strong but if you insult my daughter i will strike you in any case you will leave the carriage at the next station it is yet a quarter of an hour away sneered van zwieten looking at his watch so that will be time enough to say what i have to say i do not think you will ask me to go when you hear all i am not afraid said brenda coolly my father is here to protect me and we are in england meinherr van zwieten not in your barbarous country of the transvaal ah you english will find it sufficiently civilized in warfare said the man savagely but i will come to the point you are married to this captain burton is that true or is it not true of course it is true let me speak father put in brenda yes it is true we were married at st chad's church brighton four days ago just time for a honeymoon a very short honeymoon sneered van zwieten but the perspiration was on his face and the girl could see that he was suffering she was glad to see it and continued to speak knowing that every word she uttered caused the villain intense pain callous as van zwieten was in most things he was a true lover and suffered only as a strong man like himself could suffer if you like to go to the church you can see the register she went on carelessly my father was present so was lady jenny malet she looked him full in the face as she mentioned the name but he did not flinch whatever power lady jenny might have over him he was apparently ignorant of its existence it is a pity you did not ask me he said clenching his hands i should have completed the happy family party well burton has escaped now we shall see if he will be so fortunate in the future ah you would murder him i know it said brenda scornfully but he can take care of himself very likely mrs burton but can he protect himself from the law what do you mean that you are going to accuse my husband of mr malet's murder you are quite capable of it i am and i can prove that he is guilty mr scarse cast an angry glance at the man you are a liar van zwieten he said savagely i wonder how i ever came to believe in you you accuse first me of the crime then my brother now it is harold burton you would ruin we are all three innocent two of you we will say but the third is guilty van zwieten spoke slowly looking at brenda the while i found the pistol with which the murder was committed it has a name on the butt and the name is that of harold burton the girl grew deathly pale and clasped her hands i do not believe it she said bravely well drawled van zwieten throwing himself back i can prove it by showing you the pistol it is at my rooms in duke street if you choose to come there with your father of course you can see it yes you may look and look but your husband and no other killed malet it is false there was no reason why harold should kill mr malet oh pardon me i think he had a very good reason corrected van zwieten blandly at least captain burton thought it a sufficient reason when i told him what i knew at chippingholt ah flashed out mrs burton so this was what you told harold to make him leave without saying good bye to me it was i showed him the pistol and he admitted that it was his but not that he had used it you are very sharp mrs burton but that is just what he did confess i don't believe it cried the girl nor i joined in mr scarse you are speaking falsely van zwieten shrugged his mighty shoulders as you please said he if i show it to the lawyers you may find that what i say is true if it was not true how could i have made harold burton leave chippingholt why did he keep his marriage with you a secret because he feared what i had to say about him i had decided not to betray him if he left the lady to me as it is i shall speak as you choose said brenda you can prove no motive for such a crime harold left chippingholt because you told him that mr malet had gambled away his twenty thousand pounds and the poor dear did not want to tell me of his loss oh yes i told him that also i knew more of malet's private affairs than you think but burton did not know the money was lost at the time he murdered malet he murdered him to get it you speak very confidently returned brenda ironically you will now of course put the matter into the hands of the police well no i shall not do that just now however as i see you do not believe me i should like to give you an opportunity of changing your mind come with your father to my rooms in st james's to morrow and i will show you the revolver i dare say you have the weapon put in mr scarse but how do we know where you found it i can prove that come to morrow and convince yourselves then i will make my terms your terms yes my silence must be bought but not with money you mrs burton must give me your promise to marry me when you become a widow i am not a widow yet said brenda trying hard to keep up her courage and please god i shall never be amen sneered van zwieten as the train slowed down we shall see but i hold the winning card and i intend to play it for my own benefit here we are so i will leave you now to morrow at three i shall be at my rooms if you do not come i will see the police about the matter very good said brenda much to her father's surprise i will be there come now you are sensible sneered van zwieten i shall make something out of you yet mrs burton get out shouted mr scarse fiercely or i'll throw you out ah bad temper scarse keep that for those who are fighting our republics au revoir until to morrow and van zwieten jumping lightly out of the compartment made for a smoking carriage why did you agree to meet the blackguard fumed mr scarse when the train was moving off again you know he is lying no i don't think he is what do you believe your husband guilty i wouldn't believe it if an angel from heaven told me so flashed out mrs harold burton but van zwieten has this revolver with harold's name on it or he would not dare to speak so confidently i will find out where he got it he might have stolen it from harold or he might have had the name put on the silver plate harold is not here to contradict him to morrow we will take wilfred with us he will know if the revolver is harold's or not in the meantime i will see lady jenny harold told me to go to her if mr van zwieten made himself disagreeable the time seems to have come but what can she do i don't know but that is what i must find out we will baffle this man yet oh father and to think that you once wanted me to marry him i was wrong my dear very wrong mr scarse said penitently but at any rate you are married now to the man of your choice harold my darling brenda's tears burst out afresh god knows if i shall ever see him again she wept bitterly truly poor brenda was hard beset meantime van zwieten was swearing at his own stupidity in not having kept a sharper eye on harold but he had not expected the young man whom he had regarded as his victim to display such daring at chippingholt he had warned him that if he married brenda he would denounce him well he had married brenda and was now well beyond reach on his way to africa more than ever was van zwieten determined that he should pay for what he had done he had but exchanged the gallows in england for a boer bullet in south africa then when he was no more his widow should become mrs van zwieten that he swore should be he had failed once he would not fail again from waterloo he went to westminster to get the revolver and take it to his rooms that he might have it ready for production on the morrow on arrival there he was met by mrs hicks she was in the greatest distress oh sir she cried a policeman's been here and has taken a box from your room an iron box for the moment van zwieten stood stunned then he rushed upstairs and looked on the top of the press the box was gone chapter xvii checkmated strong man as he was van zwieten reeled half fainting against the wall it was true the box was gone in a flash he realized his peril for that box held little that was not of a highly compromising nature once its contents were seen by the authorities as it would seem they must be he would be arrested as a spy imprisoned perhaps hanged no ingenuity or lying on his part could explain away the damning evidence of the papers they spoke for themselves what a fool he had been not to have forwarded them to leyds in the morning as he had intended to do now it was too late and nothing remained but to fly to pretoria and to throw in his lot openly with his employers useless now to think of going out as correspondent to an english newspaper even were he able to manage his escape from london those in command at the front would surely be advised of his true character by the home authorities and not only that but he would be unmasked in a country under military law where a spy such as he would receive but short shrift fly he must and that at once he must get to the continent and take ship for delagoa bay the game was up in england there remained now only the transvaal after the first emotion of terror had passed van zwieten collected his wits and set to work to find some way out of the difficulty had he been in russia or france he would have given himself up to despair for there the authorities were lynx eyed and relentless but here in england he was amongst a people so firmly wedded to their old fashioned laws as to freedom and justice that they might fail to take the strong measures which the situation so far as they were concerned demanded he would baffle these pig headed islanders yet and with a courage born of despair he set himself to the accomplishment of this design mrs hicks pale and tearful had followed him into the room and had been witness of his despair the poor woman was too much agitated to speak this unexpected invasion of her quiet house by the police had been altogether too much for her van zwieten made her sit down and proceeded to question her with many tears and lamentations that she had no husband to protect her she gave him all the necessary details and he listened with feverish anxiety to every word it was about midday mr jones said mrs hicks yes i will not deceive you sir the clock was just on twelve when i heard a ring at the door i left mary anne in the kitchen and went to see who it was there was a hansom at the door sir and standing on the mat there was a policeman and a lady a lady put in van zwieten looking rather puzzled for he could not guess what woman could have interfered with his affairs he had always kept himself clear of the sex what lady i don't rightly know her name mr jones for to be plain with you she never gave it to me she was a short lady sir with black hair and eyes as black as your hat sir dressed in mourning asked the dutchman with a sudden flash of intuition as you say sir dressed in mourning and beautifully made it was too she asked if mr jones lived here and if he was at home i said you did lodge with me sir having no reason to hide it but that you were out the lady stepped into the passage then with the policeman what was the policeman like tall and handsome with big black eyes and a black beard he was something like the gentleman who came to see you last night i beg pardon did you speak sir but van zwieten had not spoken he had uttered a groan rather of relief than otherwise the thing was not so bad after all in the lady he recognized the wife of mr malet though why she should have come to raid his rooms was more than he could understand the policeman he had no difficulty in recognizing as wilfred burton in a new disguise without doubt it was he who had brought lady jenny malet to the westminster rooms and wilfred knew too of the existence of the box with its compromising contents of which van zwieten himself had been foolish enough to tell him on the previous night out of a sheer spirit of bravado bravado which he bitterly regretted when it was too late he swore now in his beard at his own folly and at wilfred's daring however now that he could feel tolerably sure that the authorities had nothing to do with the seizure of his papers he felt more at ease after all these private enemies might be baffled but of this he was not so sure as he had been the several checks which had recently happened to him had made him feel less sure of himself well mrs hicks he said rousing himself from his meditations and what did these people do mrs hicks threw her apron over her head and moaned oh sir she said in muffled tones which came from under her apron they told me that you were a dangerous man and that the government had sent the policeman to search your rooms the lady said she knew you well and did not want to make a public scandal so she had brought the policeman to do it quietly she asked me for the key and said if i did not give it up she would bring in a dozen more policemen and that would have ruined me sir and you believed her cried van zwieten cursing her for a fool mrs hicks whipped the apron off her head and looked at her lodger in wide eyed amazement of course i did she said i'm that afraid of the police as never was many a time have i feared when i saw poor hicks who is dead and gone in the hands of the constables for being drunk poor lamb i wouldn't resist the police would you sir never mind he said seeing it was useless to argue with her you let them into my rooms i suppose as you may guess sir me being a law abiding woman though the taxes are that heavy yes sir i took them up to your room and left them there ach what did you do that for i could not help myself sir the policeman ordered me to go away and it was not for me to disobey the law i left them there for twenty minutes and then i came up to see what they were doing the policeman had gone and so had the cab though i swear to you mr jones that i never heard it drive away the lady was sitting cool as you like at your desk there writing what was she writing that sir i don't rightly know as she put her letter into an envelope and here it is he snatched the letter mrs hicks produced from her pocket and said something not very complimentary to that good woman's brains she was indignant and would fain have argued with him but he silenced her with a gesture and hurriedly read the letter as he had already guessed the writer was lady jenny malet and she merely asked him to call at her house in curzon street for explanations so she put it somewhat ironically perhaps and van zwieten swore once again this time at the phrase he put the letter in his pocket determined to accept the invitation and to have it out with this all too clever lady meanwhile mrs hicks rose to make a speech i have to give you notice sir she said in her most stately tones as i have not been in the habit of letting my rooms to folk as is wanted by the police you will be pleased to leave this day week which i believe was the agreement i intend to leave this day retorted her lodger i told you i was going and i have not seen fit to alter my decision i will send for my furniture this afternoon and i will pay your account now thank you sir i shall be most obliged and i think you should pay me extra for the disgrace you have brought on my house oh wailed mrs hicks to think i should have lodged murderers and forgers van zwieten started at the word murderer but he recovered himself quickly he dismissed her with a shrug go down and make your account out he said you have done mischief enough already oh indeed cried the woman shrilly i do like you sir disgracing my honest house and then turning on me i have been deceived in you mr jones never again will i let my lodgings to mysterious gentlemen and when they put you in the dock sir i'll come and see you hanged and with this incoherent speech mrs hicks tottered out of the room left alone van zwieten lost no time in vain lamentation he had been beaten by his enemies for the present he could only wait to see if the tide of war would turn it would be necessary to make terms with lady jenny and wilfred for they now possessed the evidences of his employment in england but on his side he could use his knowledge of the murder and of harold's connection with it as witness the revolver to keep them quiet if they could bite so could he meanwhile he gathered together his personal belongings and packed them he left the drawers of his desk empty and he put the clothes of mr jones into a large trunk by the time mrs hicks arrived with her bill he was quite ready nor had he left any evidence which would identify mr jones of westminster with mr van zwieten of st james's beaten he might be but he would retreat in good order this is my bill sir said mrs hicks i have charged nothing for the disgrace to my house just as well retorted he you would gain nothing by that there is the money in cash i suppose you would prefer it to my check well sir said mrs hicks softened somewhat by the gold you have always paid up like a gentleman i will say and i hope they won't hang you thank you said van zwieten drily as he fastened his glove that is very kind of you i will see after my furniture this afternoon is there a cab at the door all right send the man up for my luggage and mrs hicks he turned on her as mrs hicks described it afterward like a tiger it will be as well for you to hold your tongue about this business by the way how did you know the policeman took away my box mary anne was watching on the stairs sir and she saw the policeman come down with it said the landlady with dignity oh i won't say anything sir you may be sure i only want to keep away from the law i hope you'll be as lucky and mrs hicks bowed her suspicious guest out of the house she was immensely relieved when she saw his cab drive round the corner in another ten minutes mr jones was transformed into mr van zwieten and was established in his rooms in duke street st james's but he had no intention of staying there long the place was evidently too hot to hold him or would be unless he could threaten and bully lady jenny and wilfred into surrender of that precious box in any event his great desire was to go south his work in england was done and well done even leyds acknowledged that but for van zwieten's report of the rusty condition of the british army the out of date ordnance the little way these islanders had of putting incompetent men in office to be rendered still more incompetent by an antiquated system of red tapeism and the inconceivable folly practiced of allowing the civil power to override the opinion of military experts but for all these things the republics well armed though they were would not have declared war the world was amazed at their daring but their two presidents knew what they were about and so did leyds his business it was to spread reports which would gain the sympathy of the continental powers that of the burghers to hurl themselves on the british all unprepared as they were through the folly of the peace party now that the glove had been thrown down van zwieten was all eagerness to get to the front how useful he could be to his adopted country at this juncture but were he in the british camp as war correspondent to an english newspaper his usefulness would be trebled and now it seemed as though his enemies were to upset all these plans by this one coup however there was nothing for it now but to face them bravely and learn the worst then he could take what steps were possible to frustrate them meanwhile brenda was pouring out her troubles to lady jenny malet and telling her all about van zwieten and his threats she had gone there full of anxiety to enlist the little widow's sympathies and of indignation at the charge made by the dutchman against harold having made herself as clear as she knew how and having related all the facts she waited with some impatience for lady jenny's opinion which was not immediately forthcoming indeed it was some time before she spoke the drawing room was both tastefully and extravagantly furnished lady jenny might be a spendthrift but she was also an artist and alas her period of splendor was drawing to a close already chippingholt manor had been sold to gratify the greedy creditors of its late owner the house in curzon street was her own property under her marriage settlement and this with ten thousand pounds from the insurance office was all she had in the world so by the advice of her lawyer she had invested the money and let the house furnished now she was going abroad to practice economy in some continental town all her plans were made and this was the last week of her prosperity she only lingered in england at the express request of wilfred who had made her promise to help him all she could to trap van zwieten brenda had come on the same errand and now lady jenny sat and pondered how much she could tell her about the man do speak to me said brenda i am so afraid for harold you need not be replied the widow and her visitor noticed how worried and haggard she looked he is perfectly safe i assure you van zwieten shall not harm him but he accuses him of committing the murder so you said but that doesn't matter whoever killed poor gilbert it was not harold burton tell me how harold's revolver came to be found on the spot i have an idea but i cannot tell you at all events not just yet wait till i have seen van zwieten are you going to see him i think so to night about nine o'clock at least i left a note at his rooms which i think will bring him i can only say that if he is a wise man he will come then i will settle him once and for all as far as harold is concerned lady jenny tell me who do you think killed your husband she looked at the girl sharply did your father ever tell you he had a brother she asked yes he told me all about it and how your wicked husband ran away with his wife i beg your pardon i should not speak so of mr malet you need not apologize the widow said bitterly gilbert deserves all the names you could have called him he was a bad man and even though he is dead and though he was punished by a violent death i have not forgiven him oh don't say that it is wrong i know it is but i can't help it i have southern blood in my veins and i never forgive i am glad your father told you the truth it saves me from having to repeat a very painful story that poor uncle of yours told me all about it and how gilbert had deceived and ill treated his wife i asked my husband and he denied the story but i saw the woman myself and made certain it was true then i hated gilbert not for that only there were other things before he married me and after he deceived me i could have taken his punishment into my own hands but i felt sure that heaven would check his wicked career but to go on with my story that night i got a note from your uncle telling me that his wife was dead i saw gilbert in the library and showed him the letter it was just before he went out i reminded him that the man and a madman at that was hanging about the place the boy who brought the letter had told me so and i warned him against going out he laughed at me and was most insulting then he went and i never saw him again until his body was brought in i knew then that the vengeance of heaven had fallen brenda looked at her with a white face what do you mean she asked in a whisper child can you not guess it was robert who had killed him impossible cried brenda my father found my uncle and took him home with him at the time of the murder uncle robert was in our cottage is this true said the widow and a bright color came into her face then who was the man talking to gilbert in the library there was some one with him just before nine o'clock i was going to the rectory to meet harold about your business and i went to the library to see if gilbert had come back i was afraid of robert scarse and of what he might do half crazed as he was by his wife's death little as i loved my husband i did not want that to happen the door of the room was locked but i heard voices i went out without thinking any more about it oh i swear to you brenda that i have always believed it was your uncle who killed him who was it then the revolver ah and van zwieten has it she jumped up and clasped her hands i see i know i know what asked the girl rising in alarm never mind never mind i will tell you soon go now brenda and leave me to see van zwieten oh i know how to manage him now is it him you mean he is worse than a murderer lady jenny cried he is a spy i was sure of it but how do you know i know and i can't tell you how as to the murder he has to do with that too i believe he did it himself but how do you know repeated brenda how do you know no matter i am sure he fired that shot and i can prove it prove it and hang him cried brenda and there was bitter hatred in her voice the little widow sat down again and the fire died out of her eyes no i cannot hang him even though he is guilty there are things oh i can't tell you the man must go unpunished for the sake of go away child and leave it all to me but i want to know the truth i must save harold i will save harold he is safe from van zwieten as to the truth you shall know it when once he is out of the country brenda had to be satisfied with this for her friend absolutely refused to tell her any more but she left feeling that her husband was safe from the intrigues of the dutchman and that was all she cared about left alone lady jenny clenched her hands if i could only hang him she muttered but that is impossible chapter xviii exit van zwieten as lady jenny had expected mr van zwieten proved himself to be a wise man by presenting himself in her drawing room at the appointed hour he was in evening dress calm and composed as usual and greeted her with a low bow she could not help admiring his self possession his reputation his liberty even was at stake and yet he never turned a hair and with these feelings uppermost she received him more kindly perhaps than she would otherwise have done the dutchman taking his cue from her that the conversation despite its probable sensational character was not to be conducted on melodramatic lines reciprocated her politeness any one seeing the pair might have imagined that they were discussing nothing of more importance than shakespeare and the musical glasses rather than a subject which to one of them at least meant life or death the hostess in a black silk dinner dress with a few well chosen jewels looked unusually pretty in the light of the lamps and van zwieten was an admirer of pretty women and knew well how to make himself agreeable to them had the subject matter of their conversation been only less serious he would have enjoyed himself as it was he did not find the hour he spent with her irksome for a few moments the two antagonists discussed general topics and then lady jenny came suddenly to the point the man watched her warily pretty she might be but that was no reason why he should allow her to get the better of him it was a duel of words and the combatants were well matched well mr van zwieten began the widow i suppose you were somewhat astonished at my invitation i cannot deny that i was my dear lady it is perhaps a trifle disconcerting to find one's rooms robbed and then to receive an invitation from the robber oh come that is rather harsh is it not it was what i should call simple justice indeed replied the other dryly it would interest me to learn how you make that out oh easily i can give you two reasons in the first place you threatened did you not to accuse a man of a crime which you knew he had not committed in the second you are a spy to put it plainly and both wilfred burton and i felt it was our duty to secure proofs of your guilt we are not all fools in this country that is a charge one would hardly bring against you returned van zwieten with emphasis nor against that young man had i suspected him of so much cleverness i should have taken more elaborate precautions ah you should never undervalue your enemies well i suppose you know that you are in my power and in wilfred burton's also no i can manage him he has left the decision of this matter in my hands i am sure you ought to be pleased at that i am because i see you mean to let me off that depends she said and shot a keen glance at him i asked you to come here because it was necessary that i should see you sir but i despise you none the less for that you are a spy the meanest of all created creatures van zwieten held up his hand he was quite unmoved my dear lady let us come to business believe me preaching of that kind has very little effect on me i might defend myself by saying that i have every right to use craft on behalf of the transvaal fox against the mighty english lion but i will content myself with holding my tongue i would remind you that i have very little time to spare i intend to leave this country to morrow morning how do you know that i shall allow you to go you would hardly have invited me to this interview else van zwieten said cunningly you have something you want from me well i will give it in exchange for my safety and that includes of course your silence it is clever of you to put it that way responded the widow coolly it so happens that you are right i intend to make a bargain with you always provided that i agree of course said she airily but in this case i really think you will agree i am not so sure of that van zwieten narrowed his eyes and blinked wickedly you forget that i also know something for that reason i asked you here let me advise you not to pit yourself against me my good man or you may get the worst of it a word from me and you would be kicking your heels in jail this very night probably van zwieten had too much to gain to notice her threat but you will never say that word you can't be quite sure of that yet well let us get to business i am not anxious to spend any more time in your company than is necessary i assure you the feeling is mutual may i ask how you found my rooms in westminster i think you know that very well after the visitor you received last night i was told about them and you by mr wilfred burton he knew long ago that you were a spy and he has been watching you for many months he is not so very clever then all these months and yet he has got no further than this how much further do you want him to go he has the box with all your papers your treasonable papers your orders from dr leyds really mr van zwieten you should have taken a little more care of that box the top of a press was hardly a safe place to hide it but perhaps you had been reading poe's story of the 'purloined letter' never mind what i read he said evidently annoyed at her flippancy let us confine ourselves to business the idea of the disguised policeman was yours i suppose yes sir it was i felt sure that the landlady would not let us enter your room to make the search unless she was thoroughly frightened so i suggested that he should get himself up as a member of the force our little stratagem succeeded to perfection mrs hicks that is her name i believe was terrified and let us in at once then we found your box and i sent wilfred away with it while i stayed and wrote my note to you oh what a time we had over your papers you really are very clever mr van zwieten what a lot the foreign secretary would give to see what we saw and as it happens he is a personal friend of mine i might sell it you know she went on coolly i am poor enough now and they would give me a good price not such a price as would recompense you for what i could say about your husband retorted the dutchman she laughed gaily oh that my good man i know all about that do you think i should have taken the trouble to talk to you if i had not known that my husband had been doing all your dirty work yes he did my work van zwieten said viciously he was my creature paid by me with transvaal gold you call me a spy lady jane malet your own husband was one and not only a spy but a traitor i know it she said and her face was very pale and for that reason i am glad he is dead terrible though his end was i dare say you helped him out of the world sneered van zwieten that is false and you know it i had no idea of what my husband was until i found his papers after his death had i known that when he was yet alive i might have killed him she clenched her hand yes i might have shot him the mean cowardly hound he spoke against the boers and yet he took their money oh you must not blame him for that that was my idea it is worthy of you oh she started up and paced the room in a fury to think that i should have been married to such a creature to think that i should have lived on gold paid for the betrayal of my country the cur the judas thank god he is dead and then turning abruptly on the dutchman how did you gain him over to your side she asked gilbert was a man once a man and a gentleman how did you contrive to make him a a thing easily enough he said placidly he could not understand why she made all this fuss two years ago i met him at monte carlo i watched him gamble and lose i heard he was in the war office or had some connection with it so i made his acquaintance and induced him to play still higher we became intimate enough to discuss money matters his of course and he told me that he was very hard up he blamed you i dare say returned lady jenny coldly go on well i put the matter to him delicately i asked him to find out certain details connected with your military organization and i told him he would be well paid for the information i am bound to say he kicked at first but i went on tempting him with bigger sums and he was so desperately hard up that he closed with me in the end he soon did all i wanted and once in my power i trained him to be most useful but i kept on paying him well oh yes i paid him very well he made this villainous confession in so cool a tone that lady jenny could have struck him it was horrible to think that she had been the wife of so degraded a creature as van zwieten now described her husband to have been and thank god he is dead she cried again it would have been worse for both of us if i had known it while he was alive it might have been i then who would have fired the shot but after all i suppose it was better that he should fall by your hand the dutchman started from his seat i am a spy lady jenny he cried but i am not a murderer i leave that sort of thing to you to me do you accuse me of the murder of my husband i do captain burton while staying at your house at chippingholt left his revolvers behind you found them you took one and stole out after your husband and shot him i found the weapon do you take me for a fool where were you when you pretended to go to the rectory out in the orchards tracking your husband you killed him because he was in love with mrs scarse deny it if you can i do deny it it was all over between him and mrs scarse before he married me he cared so little for the poor woman that he did not go to her when she was dying that madman her husband came down to tell gilbert of her death they met and had a struggle i thought it was he who had killed him and indeed if he had i should not have blamed him as it was you were the man you who wanted to get rid of your tool van zwieten threw himself back in his chair with a laugh you talk nonsense he said roughly why should i want to get rid of a man who was useful to me no one was more sorry than i when poor malet died not from any sentimental point of view oh dear no but because he had become quite a necessary person to me i found the revolver in the grass but it was not i who had used it if i had he added cynically i should have no hesitation in telling you you did murder him insisted lady jenny fiercely i know where you found the revolver not as you say on the grass no it was in the library on the night of the murder gilbert had been shooting at a mark in the afternoon and at night at nine o'clock i heard voices in the library it was you who were with him you who came to take away treasonable papers from my unhappy husband you got what you wanted and you got the weapon and he went back with you to mr scarse's cottage you wanted to get rid of him without danger to yourself you tried to lay the guilt on harold burton to rid yourself of a rival you shot gilbert in the orchards and you threw away the revolver to implicate harold and walked back to the cottage you you murderer you cain she stopped half choked by her emotions van zwieten seized the opportunity to deny once again the truth of her accusation i tell you i did not kill malet then who did i don't know i thought it was captain burton upon my soul i did have you a soul lady jenny asked with scorn i should doubt it however i stick to my opinion i believe that you killed my husband oh you need not look alarmed i am not going to give you up i have done all i wanted i have married harold to brenda by telling him i could keep you from accusing him of the murder and can you sneered van zwieten he was fighting every inch i am sure i can i have your box remember for my husband's sake i spare you now i don't want an honorable name to be smirched through him i don't want to be pointed at as the widow of a spy and a traitor otherwise i would denounce you as the spy and the murderer i truly believe you to be this is my bargain mr van zwieten you leave england at once cease to persecute captain burton and his wife and i will hold my tongue and if i refuse he asked sullenly if you refuse i will have you arrested as you leave this house you think i can't do that but i can i have made all my preparations i have left nothing to chance one does not leave things to chance in dealing with a man like you mr van zwieten she sneered wilfred burton is outside with a couple of policemen i have only to whistle and they will come up but van zwieten was not so easily bluffed on what grounds may i ask he said if you wanted to keep this matter quiet for the sake of your husband you would not have told the police i have told them nothing about your spying business she said calmly you will be arrested on a charge of being concerned in the murder of my husband and i can assure you that if you are so arrested i will press the charge on the other hand if you agree to my terms i will let you go free i can easily make things right with the police by telling them that i have been mistaken oh all this is not regular i know but i have some little political influence and i am using it for my own benefit and for yours if it comes to that he looked at her savagely had he obeyed his inclinations he would have wrung her neck it was gall and wormwood to him to be beaten so thoroughly by a woman but being in england and not in a country like the transvaal where such a trifling matter as murder would be winked at he had to suppress his homicidal desires quickly reviewing the situation he could see nothing for it but to yield to the superior power of the enemy twist and wriggle as he might there was no chance of escaping from the trap she had prepared for him the game was up and there remained only the transvaal well lady jenny asked imperiously what have you to say will you give me your promise to leave brenda and her husband unmolested and to leave england at once or will you allow yourself to be arrested and have all the world know what manner of life yours has been if you had me exposed you also would suffer my husband's name would be smirched i know that but i am prepared to run that risk if i had the misfortune to be the wife of a scoundrel that was not my fault but i am getting tired of all this i give you five minutes to make up your mind van zwieten assumed a cheerful demeanor he would take the sting of this defeat by accepting it with a good grace there is no need for me to consider the matter dear lady he said i am willing to accept your terms very good then you leave england to morrow morning and you will make no further accusations against captain burton no it would appear that he is innocent and you will not annoy his wife since she is his wife i will promise that also in that case i need detain you no longer mr van zwieten one moment my papers what about them am i not to have them the audacity of this demand took away the little woman's breath no certainly not she replied sharply i should lose my hold over you if i gave them up besides you have given quite enough information to your friend dr leyds you shall not give any more if i can help it then what security have i that you will let me go free you have my word and after all there are no guarantees on either side what security have i for your silence save the holding of these papers i know very well that as soon as you think you are safe you will do what injury you can to captain burton but i can thwart you there too mr van zwieten your wish is to go to the british camp as a war correspondent you would betray all our plans to the enemy well sir i forbid you to stay with my countrymen if i hear as i assuredly will hear that you are in our camp i will at once disclose the contents of the box and instructions shall be sent to the front for your arrest i can checkmate you on every point what about captain burton's life you can't protect that if you drive me to join the boers i can easily have him shot seeing there was no more to be said he rose to go at the door he paused you have forced me to consent to what you wished he said as i can do nothing against the power you have unlawfully gained over me by stealing my papers but i give you fair warning that i love brenda madly and that i intend to make her my wife in spite of captain burton once in the transvaal i shall join hands openly with my adopted country then let burton look to himself for i will do my best to make his wife a widow the future is in the hands of god lady jenny said solemnly you can go mr van zwieten he bowed ironically and went without another word he was glad to have escaped so easily for after all he could do as he liked when he was beyond the reach of pursuit once he was in the transvaal lady jenny might show the papers as much as she wished had she been wise he thought she would have kept him as a hostage but she had let her chance slip and he was free to plot and scheme needless to say he intended to keep none of the promises he had made then he went out into the night slipped past three men whom he recognized as wilfred and the constables and so took his departure like a whipped hound chapter xix a terrible letter then succeeded a period of waiting and heart breaking expectation which brenda in common with many of her fellow countrymen bore with quiet heroism glencoe elandslaagte rietfontein were fought and victory crowned the british arms but the triumphs were only achieved at a bitter cost the eyes of the world were eagerly fixed on this first example of modern warfare since the franco german campaign and the military experts of europe were anxious to learn how the use of scientific weapons of terrible destructive force would affect the warfare of the future it was soon seen that battles would resolve themselves into artillery duels since no human beings could stand up against the hail of shot and shell hurled incessantly from repeating machines such as the mauser nordenfelt and maxim that the british troops should brave the fury of this death storm proved to the onlooking world how brightly the valor for their sires burned in their hearts even the grudging critics of the continent could not withhold their tribute of admiration at this matchless daring mr scarse had taken a small house and brenda lived with him they had been very happy together since their reconciliation as happy at least as they could be while harold was at the front he was with buller who sheltered behind the tugela river had not yet commenced to move how eagerly brenda scanned the papers through those days of suspense wilfred had gone out as a war correspondent and when his brilliant letters appeared with what delight she read them over and over again mr scarse still denounced the war as an unjust one and unnecessary to boot and said so in public when he could seeing it was useless to attempt to alter her father's views brenda never mentioned the subject and so they got on very well together occasionally there came a letter from harold then brenda was happy for the day for he always wrote full of hope and courage lady jenny malet still lingered in england she had let her curzon street house and was staying at a quiet hotel knowing as she did that van zwieten was not wholly crushed she did not feel inclined to leave the country until she felt tolerably certain that harold was safe from him his box she kept in her own possession and showed to no one only in the event of van zwieten playing the traitor in natal would she produce them for no other reason would she smirch the memory of her husband she had arranged with wilfred that if the spy were found in the british camp information should be sent to her at once then she would see the authorities and he should be dealt with according to martial law she explained this to brenda wilfred is with harold she said and he will look after him van zwieten knows that on the first sign of his breaking his promise i shall not spare him but how will that affect him out there the girl asked dolefully it won't affect him if he is openly on the side of the enemy but if he is spying in the british camps he will be taken and shot i don't think he can be with general buller or wilfred would have denounced him he is probably at the modder but he may be with the enemy he may be i have heard nothing of him since he left london he went over to the continent so wilfred found out and sailed in a german liner for delagoa bay yes he might be with the boer forces but i doubt it why do you doubt it my dear van zwieten can do no harm to your husband except by treachery of course he might shoot him or have him shot in open battle but after all there would not be the same amount of certainty about that as there would be if he were to get rid of him by underhand means it is terrible cried brenda wringing her hands i don't mind harold fighting as a soldier should all the other men are doing the same but to have a private enemy like van zwieten is dreadful i don't think he will find it so easy to do harold any harm after all brenda your husband is no fool and he is on his guard i do wish i could go out to the front with what object you could do nothing to protect him and he would only worry about you better stay at home my dear and try to possess your soul in patience it is hard i know but remember you are not the only one brenda took the advice and strove to calm herself by constant occupation she made every sort of comfort she could think of for her husband and sent him everything that might by the remotest chance be useful to him this was her great solace and her father seeing how it cheered her gave her every encouragement but it was a terrible time every day brought some fresh sorrow the belmont and graspan victories cheered the nation somewhat but a period of gloom succeeded and news came of gatacre's reverse and the failure of buller to cross the tugela it was then that the suspense became almost too much for mrs burton for harold was in the thick of the fighting and on the very scene of the disasters but the long expected blow fell in due time and as usual when least anticipated one morning mr scarse came down first to breakfast and as usual eagerly scanned the papers when his daughter entered the room she saw at once that something dreadful had happened what is it father she asked and held out her hand for the daily mail nothing my dear nothing was his answer but he kept the paper in his hand only the usual disasters oh this unholy war harold oh father tell me the truth he is wounded dead oh harold harold no no cried her father with eagerness he is not wounded then he is killed shrieked brenda not at all if he were i should tell you she snatched the paper from his hand and spread it out but tears blinded her and she could not read a word for god's sake tell me the worst was her cry is my darling is harold he is missing mr scarse said roughly don't look like that brenda he may have been taken prisoner and then he would be all right missing echoed the poor young wife oh poor harold pray god he is not dead of course he's not his name would be amongst the killed if he were he is missing that is all he was taken prisoner no doubt at the passage of the tugela hope for the best brenda van zwieten she said faintly i hope this is none of his work not it if he had been in the neighborhood wilfred would have let us know this is only one of the ordinary chances of war you should be thankful my dear that he isn't on the list of killed or wounded the chances are that he is a prisoner and in safety i hope so i hope so but father let us go down to the war office the war office will know no more than is in this paper i want to make certain of that come father my dear child you have eaten nothing you must have some breakfast first i can't eat you must bear yourself as an englishwoman should brenda think how many women there are at this moment mourning over the death of their dearest you at least have hope it might have been far worse brenda agitated as she was could not but admit the truth of this and she forced herself to eat she would need all her strength to bear up against this cruel blow after all as her father had very rightly said things were far from being as bad as they might have been her husband's name might have been on the list of those killed or dangerously wounded as it was he was only missing news of him might come at any time she reproached herself with ingratitude toward a kind providence in a more cheerful frame of mind she finished her breakfast and got ready to go down to the war office with her father there she had an object lesson in seeing the endurance of women whose news was as bad as it could be if her own trouble was hard to bear how infinitely harder was the lot of those whose dead lay on the stricken field father father she whispered i should not repine i am so much better off than these poor things the news of the tugela disaster had brought a large crowd to the war office and a vast number of people had collected in the street men and women were scanning the fatal lists and many a heartrending sight did the girl see as she stood there waiting for her father who had gone into the office to see if he could gain any definite news about his son in law outside a proud old lady sat waiting in her carriage she bore herself with dignity but her face was ashen white and as brenda stood there she saw a girl come out and stagger into the carriage no word was spoken but in a storm of weeping she threw herself on the old lady's breast and the older woman neither wept nor cried out but drove silently away with the distracted girl beside her and she was a woman who had given her country of the best she had to offer the life of her son oh poor woman poor woman wept brenda there was a silence as of death in that crowded office save for now and again a low whisper or a stifled sob and still the people came and went and came again brenda waited with sinking heart when would her father come would he bring good news or bad she braced herself up to bear the worst it is all right brenda she heard him say at last he had come up behind her as she stood watching the crowd outside harold is safe oh thank god for that she gasped clinging to his arm he is not wounded is he no he is a prisoner he was out with a detachment of his men on patrol duty and the boers captured the whole lot i expect he will be sent to pretoria so you need not be anxious now my dear i don't i don't know she cried feverishly if van zwieten is there he won't escape so easily nonsense van zwieten is not omnipotent as you seem to think thank god that your husband is safe child and don't go out to meet your troubles i do i do i am grateful oh the poor women the poor fatherless children oh father what a terrible thing war is it is indeed sighed mr scarse i remember the crimea and all the misery it brought that is why i was so anxious to avert this war but we are in the midst of it now and we must go through with it at all events brenda your husband is safe there will be no more fighting for him i'm sorry for that she said much to his surprise harold will eat his heart out now i would rather he were fighting you are not easy to please my dear said her father drily so far as his safety is concerned he is in the best position you need not be afraid to look at the papers now i am foolish i know father but i wish he had not been taken i don't want him to be wrapped up in cotton wool while other men are fighting he would agree with you there however you must look upon it as the fortune of war he will have to stay where he is till peace is proclaimed and god knows when that will be in the present temper of this misguided nation come home now so home they went and did their best to take a cheerful view of things it was a sad christmas for brenda and for hundreds of other women who had suffered far more severely than she had done to hear of peace and goodwill was like mockery in her ears she knew that the war was a just one that it had been forced upon england by the ambition of an obstinate old man and that in going through with this terrible business the country was fulfilling as ever her appointed mission of civilization but even so it was terrible to open the papers and read sad tales of grief and disaster hundreds of young lives the flower of british manhood were being sacrificed to the horrible moloch of war and the end was not yet in sight toward the end of december the nation had been somewhat cheered by the news of general french's victory at colesberg but the year ended in gloom and sorrow and the wailing of rachel for her children and on the continent the enemies of freedom and honest government rejoiced at the blows an enlightened government was receiving truly in those dark hours britannia was the niobe of nations but she set her teeth and fought on no letter had come from wilfred about his brother's disappearance neither did he mention it in the columns of the paper of which he was correspondent the first news which mrs burton received other than from the war office was a letter which arrived one morning with the transvaal postmark in fear and trembling she opened it thinking it contained an announcement from some kind soul in pretoria that harold was dead to her astonishment and horror it proved to be from van zwieten and was addressed to her care of mrs st leger she opened it and was found later on by the parlor maid in a dead faint the first thing she did on regaining consciousness was to read it again as she got to the end she heard her father's step in a tremor of excitement she ran to him oh father look at this it is from van zwieten written from pretoria mr scarse was astonished the dutchman was the last person in the world from whom he expected to hear but the cool insolence of the man seemed to be beyond all bounds putting on his glasses he read the letter brenda sat beside him trying to control her excitement and this was what he read dear mrs burton your husband has been taken prisoner by our burghers and is now in pretoria and more or less in my charge i write to you to say that unless you come out to me here at once i will have your husband shot as a spy there is plenty of evidence to allow of this being done i hope therefore that you will save his life by obeying my orders if not you may expect to hear of his death you know i never speak vainly yours with all love waldo van zwieten father cried brenda when he had finished reading this cold blooded letter what is to be done my poor boy it is a trick to get you out there and into his power said mr scarse in a tone of decision i don't believe he can do it no not for one moment but i am quite sure he can you know how vindictive he is oh how can we save harold by seeing the authorities i will get a request sent out to kruger he is a god fearing man and would not permit this atrocity it will do no good the girl said shaking her head sadly no father i dare say if such a request were cabled to the president he would do his best but van zwieten would try and kill harold in the meantime and if he succeeded as he would succeed he would say it was an accident i believe he is capable of anything but what else is to be done you cannot obey this insolent demand i must to save harold go out to pretoria impossible i don't see that she said fervently i can go to delagoa bay by some german ship the german ships go there don't they and from there i can take the train to pretoria it is quite simple then i will see van zwieten and trick him into letting harold be under some one else's care for a time then i shall speak to the president and tell him all i am sure he will help me and i shall be able to take harold away then van zwieten won't have a chance of shooting him as he would have if a cable were sent leave the matter to me father i am a woman and van zwieten is in love with me i can blind him and trick him her father looked at her in astonishment she had evidently made up her mind to go out and get the better of the dutchman as she said it is a mad scheme brenda it is the only scheme i can think of by which i can save my husband but brenda listen to reason think what a scoundrel van zwieten is all the more reason that i should save harold from him he might insist as a condition of you husband's safety that you and he be divorced these things can be arranged you know and then he would marry you himself he is capable of making the most impossible demands i dare say i know he is capable of any villainy but you leave the matter to me father and i will think of some scheme by which i can get the better of him one thing is certain i must go at once to pretoria but brenda you cannot travel alone lady jenny will come with me if she will not then i shall go alone do you think i care for appearances when harold is in danger of his life i will plead with kruger with his wife i am sure they will help me h'm remember kruger is not omnipotent and van zwieten is powerful the president may not care to offend him besides you can see for yourself from this letter that the man is still in love with you once he got you into his power he would stick at nothing that would make you a free woman in that case i would die with harold but i don't believe the boers are so uncivilized kruger will help me i feel sure of it you say he is a good man he is mr scarse said he was one of the few people who had fallen into this error yes if anything can be done kruger is the man who will do it then dear father will you make inquiries for me about a german ship i want to go as soon as possible not alone brenda not alone said her father i will go with you yes child i will myself see the president he knows how i have advocated his views in this country and he will not refuse me this we will go together she threw her arms round his neck darling father she murmured how good you are yes we will go and save my darling from that wicked man lady jenny outwitted him so i will do the same oh how astonished harold will be to see me at pretoria chapter xx on the track brenda burton was a singularly obstinate young woman once she had decided upon a scheme she never rested until she had carried it through and being thus minded toward the affairs of everyday life how much more obstinate was she likely to be touching a matter concerning the safety of her husband leaving mr scarse to make his arrangements and he had much to do she herself ascertained full particulars as to the route and the cost of the journey we can make for the canary islands to morrow she told her father there is a castle liner leaving in the afternoon there we can pick up the german boat kaiser fritz which goes on to delagoa bay can't we go straight to the cape in an english boat and get a steamer there to the bay oh yes but the other way will be quicker i think the day after we arrive at the canaries we can pick up the german boat and we sha'n't have to transship at the cape i don't think we can do better well as you please said he i should like to go in the kaiser fritz myself it would afford me an excellent opportunity for learning the true opinions of the germans about this to my thinking most unjust war brenda shrugged her shoulders i dare say they will be disagreeable she said they are so jealous of us and if our country went to the wall which she never will do interpolated she patriotically germany would be in a very bad position she would not be the overwhelming power she hopes to be with france and russia at her heels but don't let us talk politics all i want is to make use of their boat to reach delagoa bay give me a check father and i will take the passages to morrow you must be ready to get as far as southampton so like the quick witted woman she was she attended to all the business and her father found to his astonishment that he had nothing to do but step on board the liner lady jenny malet came to see them off she could do nothing against van zwieten at present but there was no knowing what he might do at any moment and they must be prepared to checkmate him so she gave mrs burton a registered address in case she might have to communicate with her and did her best to cheer her i feel sure you will find him all right dear she said as she kissed the girl he is not the man to be shot by a scoundrel like van zwieten and you can coax kruger into doing what you want you are pretty enough to do what you like with him brenda smiled faintly the first smile for many day's i don't think that will have much influence with a man like kruger she said nonsense my dear he is a man and men are always susceptible i'm sure you have had enough experience of that sighed lady jenny all your troubles have arisen out of that horrid van zwieten being in love with you brenda was not much comforted by this view of the situation she hoped rather to move mr kruger by an appeal to his religious convictions though these were of the stern cast of the old testament however it was in a very hopeful frame of mind that she went on board the liner and she cabled to wilfred at spearman's camp telling him that she was coming out in the hope of making things as safe as possible for her husband she cabled also to van zwieten surely when he received that he would do nothing at all events until he had seen and come to terms with her what those terms would be she could not guess but she imagined they would include a suggestion that she should obtain a divorce from harold he was as she well knew quite as obstinate as his respected president and with none of his morality or his religion in fact brenda was going to pretoria without any sort of definite idea save one that somehow or other she would save her husband from this man that was her sole object and achieve it she would by hook or by crook and she had every confidence in her own capacity to outwit the dutchman wily as he was and the days of calm and peace on board the boat afforded her ample time for conjecture and reflection she had grown now to hate this man with a hatred that would only be appeased by his destruction they made a quick run to the islands and the sea air did her the world of good there were many passengers on board but to no one of them did she in any way confide sad at heart she kept very much to herself and either read or indulged in her own thoughts her father was socially speaking anything but popular among his fellow passengers air his little england opinions he would with the result that the majority of the passengers having relatives at the front gave him a wide berth he made not a single convert and all those whom he tried to argue round to his own way of thinking were glad enough when he got off at madeira the kaiser fritz came up to time and brenda soon found herself on the way south she did not much fancy the foreign boat officers crew and passengers being all pro boer to a man they were polite enough to the english lady but they took no trouble to disguise their real opinions the captain expressed some surprise that she should be going to delagoa bay and seemed inclined to suspect some political significance in her doing so though it was difficult to see what grounds he could have had for such an absurd idea and mrs burton did not enlighten him but left the matter to her father mr scarse intimated that his daughter was going to pretoria to nurse her wounded husband an explanation which seemed to appeal to the sentimental germans after that they were increasingly polite to her but she preferred her own cabin her father was more companionable but even he found but scant pleasure in their outspoken opinions on the subject of england and her inevitable downfall as they put it even he with his little england proclivities felt his patriotism awake in the most alarming manner at the way these foreigners jeered and scoffed smarting under the insults he developed quite a jingo feeling much to his daughter's amusement and he ended by withdrawing himself as much as possible from the society of all on board father and daughter were a good deal together and both looked forward eagerly to the end of a disagreeable voyage one night when they were south of the line they were on deck together the heavens were bright with stars and the great grey circle of the sea lay round them like a trackless desert most of those on board were down below and the two had the deck to themselves brenda was disinclined for conversation her mind was as usual full of thoughts of her husband and the only feeling she seemed cognizant of was one of joy in the thought that every day was bringing her nearer to him mr scarse broke the silence brenda he said did lady jenny say anything about that murder very little she said that van zwieten had accused her of the crime and that she was innocent of course i told her that i had never dreamed of such a thing and never would have credited it for one moment h'm at one time i thought myself that she might be guilty he said but i know now that i was wrong that piece of crape certainly was suspicious but poor scarse told me that in his struggle with malet the scarf had been torn i never noticed it myself when i burned it i suppose that malet kept it in his hand without being aware of it very likely at all events i am sure lady jenny is innocent as innocent as my uncle he is happy i hope in the asylum yes poor fellow he is as happy as he can be anywhere he has every comfort and kind treatment but i fear he will not live long van zwieten gave him a fright by threatening to denounce him for the murder unless he told his sad story some of it he did tell but not all i was foolish enough to relate the rest of it to van zwieten but i had no alternative at the time he was quite capable of making a scandal brenda who did kill malet every day the thing seems to become more obscure well father i can't help thinking it was van zwieten lady jenny thinks so too you don't say so but the revolver it was harold's harold left them that is he left a case of two revolvers behind him and both were in the library in mr malet's library on that night van zwieten came to see him and took one of them with him at least that is what lady jenny thinks brenda that sounds improbable why should he kill malet he hardly knew him child indeed you are wrong there father she said he knew him only too well listen and she related the story the widow had told her concerning her husband's treachery toward his own country mr scarse was deeply indignant and indulged in language unusually strong for him little englander though he was and misguided on many points though he might be he was an honest and an honorable man and he could not understand how a man in mr malet's position could have so deliberately played the part of traitor when he was in possession of all the facts he quite agreed with brenda that van zwieten was the culprit then we'll bring him to book he said angrily i will force him to confess that will do no good father the truth cannot come to light without the story of mr malet's treachery being known and lady jenny is more than anxious to avoid that no van zwieten must be left to the punishment of his own conscience i don't think that will trouble him much mr scarse said grimly how i have been deceived in that man i am sure when i tell kruger his true character he will have nothing to do with him brenda did not contradict this statement although she felt pretty certain that the foxy old president was very little better himself how her father could reconcile the opinion he held that kruger was an honest harmless old man with the fact that he had forced this terrible war upon england was more than she could understand she wondered if when her father got to pretoria his discovery of the true aims of the transvaal government would be at all modified but of this she had her doubts he was the most obstinate of men and an angel from heaven could not have altered his opinion once it had been formed knowing this she never argued with him it was absolutely futile and only caused trouble at the cape the vessel stopped for a time brenda did not go ashore she felt too sad and heavy at heart to take any interest in the sight of new scenes and new people she sat on the deck and looked at the smiling land at the glitter of the water as it danced in the hot tropical sun the azure of sky and sea the transports merchant ships and men of war the whiteness of the city set in groves of green the whole lying under the shadow of table mountain all went to form a picture unsurpassable in its peculiar beauty it was her first sight of africa but it might be harold's grave and she hated it for its very beauty she would have had all nature mourn for her dear one mr scarse went on shore and returned with the latest war news the tactics seemed to be mostly of a defensive order general french had driven back a boer force which had attacked colesberg and the gallant ladysmith garrison had repelled a terrible assault the cape town people were in high glee over this last success anticipating as they did that the boers would now be disheartened and no doubt it might have had this effect for a time but the teutonic race is not so easily beaten or discouraged mr scarse remarked on this when they left for delagoa bay the difficulty of this war he said is that for the first time teuton is fighting against teuton the very dogged courage which has enabled us to win so many battles against the latin nations is being used against us by the boers we do not know when we are beaten either but this will not be the easy task we thought and the struggle will go on till one or other of the combatants is utterly crushed oh england will win brenda said confidently i believe she will i can't imagine england being beaten but as i said before it will be no easy task by this time they have found that out my wonder is that they could not see that england had met a foe with courage and determination equal to her own if she conquers it will be one of her greatest achievements she will conquer his daughter repeated and she refused to discuss the subject further that britain could fail never entered her head the kaiser fritz did not stop at durban somewhat to the astonishment of mr scarse as he had understood that it was customary and on applying to the captain he received a gruff and discourteous reply the man seemed anxious and was always sweeping the sea with his glass there was one other englishman on board and mr scarse asked him if he could make out what all this anxiety and incivility meant perhaps she's got contraband goods on board ammunition and guns was the reply these boats usually call at durban my own opinion is that the captain does not want to have his ship searched but my dear sir germany is neutral i dare say the young fellow said with a grin germany is anything that suits her book if she can smuggle in ammunition to assist the boers you may be sure she will do it my good sir what with mercenaries in the boer army bread stuffs ammunition guns and rifles being imported we are fighting not only the transvaal but the entire continent of europe the powers would give their ears to see us smashed this was a somewhat new view to take of the matter and one which did not commend itself to mr scarse he had looked upon the boers as a handful of honest god fearing farmers his favorite expression when speaking of them struggling for their freedom against the overwhelming power of great britain that they had colossal armaments hundreds of mercenaries and clever agents scheming for them all over the world had never entered his head in further conversations with this young englishman he received considerable enlightenment and he began to modify his views somewhat as to the absolute guilessness of oom paul and his gang but he kept his opinions to himself the kaiser fritz did not slip past durban as her captain had expected when at dawn she was almost abreast of that port she was brought to by an english cruiser there was a polite signal to heave to and the german captain with much bad language felt himself forced to comply with the request the news travelled quickly through the ship and every one came on deck amongst the foreigners being brenda and her father and the young englishman the germans were savage and talked a great deal about the insult to the flag of the fatherland abuse of england was rife and as she listened brenda felt her blood boil under the saffron sky of the dawn lay the menacing form of the cruiser displaying the glorious flag of england across the deep blue of the sea came a large boat manned by the bluejackets and no sooner were they alongside than a smart officer jumped on deck with a request to see the papers of the kaiser fritz the captain blustered and swore in high and low dutch but the officer though scrupulously polite was quite firm at last the papers were produced and examined but no contraband goods appearing on the manifest the vessel was allowed to proceed on her way to the unbounded delight of the captain whilst the english officer swore under his breath the latter felt confident that there were guns and ammunition on board and that the manifest was false however he had to appear satisfied and prepared to return to his ship but before leaving he asked if mr scarse and mrs burton were on board i am mr scarse said that gentleman a good deal surprised to hear his name suddenly spoken by this stranger and this is mrs burton but how did you know we were here i will explain that when you are on board our boat sir but we are going on to delagoa bay said brenda in search of captain burton returned the lieutenant in that case there is no need for you to go further captain burton has escaped and is now at durban poor brenda nearly fainted at this joyful and unexpected news but the eyes of the ship envious foreign eyes were upon her and she struggled bravely to keep herself in hand the officer repeated his information and asked them to get their things together with all speed as the german was anxious to proceed hardly believing the joyful news that harold was out of the power of van zwieten father and daughter went below hastily got together their belongings and were soon on their way to the cruiser the germans gave vent to an ironical hoch brutes muttered the lieutenant give way men are you comfortable mrs burton quite thank you she said but how did you know i was on board that kaiser fritz how did captain burton escape how did you will get answers to all these questions on board the juno mrs burton but i may tell you that we expected to find you and mr scarse on board the kaiser fritz of course we came in search of contraband but we were able to kill two birds with one stone by picking you up as well i am very glad of it too and the young man who had the true sailor's eye for beauty looked as though he meant what he said the boat slipped under the grey bulk of the cruiser and they were assisted up the side a matter of some difficulty in mid ocean and were received by the captain then he anxiously asked for his officer's report concerning the suspected contraband it was evidently a disappointment to him and full steam ahead for durban was then ordered the boat was swung on the davits the screw revolved and in a few moments the juno was getting along at a great rate then the captain took brenda by the arm and led her down to a cabin you know that your husband has escaped mrs burton he asked smiling yes but how did he get away i feel so bewildered at all will you walk in there please was the reply some one is waiting to explain brenda began to tremble something told her what she might expect as she entered she saw a man in khaki tall and slim waiting for her with outstretched arms she uttered a cry of joy oh harold harold my darling boy at last at last and she fell into her husband's arms chapter xxi in south africa it was indeed harold thinner perhaps than when he had left england but bronzed and hardened and fit in every way for the arduous work of the campaign brenda clung to him as though she would never let him go she looked upon him as one who had been snatched from the jaws of death and assuredly he would have found a grave in pretoria had he been left to the tender mercies of van zwieten he on his side was delighted and moved beyond words at her tenderness and at her pluck in undertaking a toilsome and dangerous journey to be near him it was some time before husband and wife recovered themselves sufficiently to exchange confidences brenda cried in spite of her brave spirit for the joy of this unexpected meeting had shaken her nerves when she had regained her composure and was able to speak it was to congratulate her husband on his escape from pretoria and from the dangerous custody of van zwieten he laughed outright that is just where you make the mistake my love he said i never was in or near pretoria and i have seen nothing of van zwieten since i left england what on earth makes you think so she sat down and looked at him in astonishment i don't understand you she said you were reported missing i went to the war office myself and made certain that the report was correct that is true enough i was out on patrol duty with a small force while the general was trying to force the passage of the tugela a party of boers took us by surprise and captured us but after a week in their custody i was lucky enough to escape i'll tell you all about it later what i want to know now is how you come to be out in these parts don't you know van zwieten wrote to me saying that you were at pretoria and under his charge and that he would have you shot if i did not come out to see him father and i set off at once and we were on our way to pretoria to see the president and implore him to save you from that man brenda are you sure of what you are saying it is all new to me here is his letter i always carry it with me i was going to show it to kruger when i saw him harold took the letter which his wife produced from her pocketbook and read it with a frown well he is a scoundrel he remarked as he gave it back to her of course it is a trap and a very clever one i suppose he heard that i was missing through the boer spies and he turned the information to his own advantage don't you see brenda he wanted you to come out to the transvaal so that you might be in his power the beast cried she crimson at having been so tricked i assure you harold i believed the letter was written in all good faith the war office said you were missing and i thought you would be transferred with the other prisoners to pretoria that van zwieten should be there and that you should be in his power did not surprise me in the least i never dreamed for a moment that it was a trick oh how lucky it was that you were able to stop me how did you know i was on board the kaiser fritz easily enough you cabled to wilfred telling him so he was at spearman's camp at the time and so was i when he showed it to me i could not understand at first how it was that you were going to pretoria but it struck me that as i was reported missing you might think that i had been transferred to the transvaal capital i made up my mind that i would stop you at cape town my first idea was to wire to meet you there but the general wanted some one to send down to durban about some business and i contrived to have myself selected for the task there i heard that the kaiser fritz was suspected of having contraband on board and that she would be stopped by the juno i knew the captain and i told him all about you and your journey out here he was good enough to have me on board and so it all came about oh my dear wife he cried clasping her in his arms how thankful i am that you are safe if i had heard that you were at pretoria and in the power of that villain it would have driven me silly he is a bitter enemy she said i should have killed him if he had done you any harm i was never in any danger of my life dearest at least not from him no i see it now she paused and then went on after all i can find it in my heart to forgive him even for this trick since it has brought me to you i won't go home again until you do but my darling i must go to the front i leave durban to morrow you can't come with me yes i can and i will she insisted oh i know what you would say that it is not a woman's place but it is a woman's place and her duty to nurse the wounded and that is what i shall do i know a good deal about nursing and i'm sure the doctors will let me help they can't refuse but think of the terrible hardships it is far more hardship for me to have to sit at home when you are in danger at least i shall be near you and perhaps if van zwieten does any more of his plotting i may be able to frustrate him it is no use your looking at me like that harold i won't leave you again you are all i have in the world if you were to die i should die also there is your father yes father is very dear to me now that we understand one another but he is not you oh my love my love don't send me away again it will break my heart to leave you she paused then added defiantly i won't go there he laughed and he tried to persuade her to stay at durban or pietermaritzburg where she would be in comfort and safety but he might have saved his breath to the front she would go and nothing would move her in the end as might have been expected she got her own way and her husband promised that she should go with him up the tugela if he could procure passports for her and her father he admired her spirit more than a little and he was only too glad to have her with him but it was against his better judgment that he consented however there was this to be said she would be in no greater danger from the intrigues of van zwieten at the front than she would be at durban after all it might be as well with such an enemy that she should be beside her husband then that's all right she said taking this hardly earned consent quite as a matter of course and now tell me how you managed to escape from the boers well it came about in this way as you may guess when we found ourselves surrounded we made a hard fight for it we killed a few of the enemy a boy of seventeen rushed at me he fired but missed and i had him at my mercy i raised my revolver but i could not bring myself to shoot so young a lad when he was about to fire again for i was turning away i managed to knock him down then we were overpowered and had to lay down our arms the lad i had spared proved to be the son of the boer leader a fine old fellow called piet bok he was so pleased with me that he offered to let me go free but i could not leave my men then when we were about to be sent on to pretoria he renewed his offer i had by this time been separated from my men so i accepted he had kept me all the time under his own charge and had treated me very well so one night he led me out of their camp gave me a horse and gun and sent me on my way god bless him cried brenda fervently i was in the tugela district he continued somewhere in the neighborhood of a place called spion kop which has been very strongly fortified by the boers the country was swarming with the enemy and it was difficult enough to find my way back to camp then my map thanks to our intelligence department was all wrong by day i hid in gullies and behind kopjes and kept my eyes open i managed to fetch the river but i could not get over at first then one night i determined to make the best of a bad job so i made my horse swim for it the current was strong and it was pretty hard work to keep on at all but at last i was forced to let go and i was swept by the current on to the further side i kept myself hidden all through that day and got on when night came i reached our camp about dawn and was very nearly shot by a sentry however i made myself known and got in safely i was dead beat too my poor harold how you have suffered nonsense don't make a fuss over a little thing like that you must be a true soldier's wife and laugh at these things but now that i have told you everything and we have settled what is to be done i must see your father they found mr scarse on deck with the captain he received harold with unaffected pleasure i am thankful to see you alive he said the captain has been telling me all about your miraculous escape i am glad to be able to strike another blow for old england sir but i have to thank you for your kindness in coming out you were going into the very jaws of the lion to find me to pretoria yes he said simply but i am glad there is no need to do that and yet i should have enjoyed meeting kruger you shall see him when we take the capital harold said brenda has made up her mind to stay until the end of the war brenda what nonsense oh i must father if only to protect harold from van zwieten ah van zwieten what about that letter harold a trap mr scarse a trap to catch brenda why the man's a villain he is all that i hope to get a shot at him some day i have a long score to settle with the brute i agree with you i hope you will mr scarse said emphatically punish the scoundrel do you know that it was he who murdered malet no really i suspected as much but he accused me you know at chippingholt that was why i went away so suddenly i could not face brenda with that hanging over me you should have trusted me harold she said somewhat reproachfully i never would have believed you guilty i was wrong i know dear but for the moment i lost my head you see he had got my revolver and with that apparently the murder was committed it was and by van zwieten himself you left the revolver at the manor i did the last time i stayed there i left two in a case the case was in the library and he must have taken one of them out why in heaven's name ah that is a long and painful story mr scarse said significantly you tell it brenda and so brenda related the story of malet's treachery and the reasons which had led lady jenny to conceal the dead man's shame harold could hardly contain his indignation when he heard that an englishman had acted so base a part to be bought and sold by a scoundrelly dutchman to be the creature of a foreign power and all the while to be acting the rle of judas toward the land which had borne him these things were almost beyond the soldier's comprehension i'd have shot him with my own hand he cried striding to and fro the low blackguard the most honest action van zwieten ever did in his life was to kill the wretch don't talk so loud harold said his wife we must keep this to ourselves for lady jenny's sake yes you are right brenda and i will make quite sure of the silence of van zwieten by shooting him at sight i am certain to come across him and when i do i'll finish him not because he murdered malet but because he tempted him to be a traitor when at last his indignation had cooled down somewhat harold introduced his wife to the captain and the other officers without revealing too much he related how hearing he had been taken prisoner and that he was at pretoria she had started out in search of him when she had been intercepted by the juno and she received so many compliments on her pluck that she blushed as she had never before blushed in her life her beauty was greatly admired by the susceptible tars and harold was considered a lucky fellow to have so charming and clever and brave a wife mr scarse after all he had recently heard of the boers was not inclined to champion them quite so openly and therefore he got on well enough on the whole the short voyage was most enjoyable and recompensed brenda for all that she had suffered on board the kaiser fritz indeed it was with great regret that she left the juno at durban and she vowed ever after that sailors were the finest and most delightful of men harold reminded her laughingly that she belonged to the junior branch of the service when they were leaving the captain gave captain burton a parting word of warning see here he said with a broad smile don't you lose any more of our guns or i'm blest if we won't take up the war ourselves whereat harold laughed though in truth the shaft went home he parted excellent friends with his hosts and as for brenda the officers gave her three hearty cheers as she stepped off the juno at durban and the bluejackets grinned and thoroughly endorsed their officers' good taste they found out the best hotel in the place and took up their quarters there for the short time they had to spend in durban before leaving for the front harold went off to see if he could get a permit for his wife and her father to accompany him meanwhile they wandered about the town together this was brenda's first experience of africa and she enjoyed it it was as though she had dropped on to a new planet the wide streets with the verandas before the shops the troops the throng of kaffirs and the brilliant color of the whole scene amused and delighted her beyond words the air was full of rumors of what was doing at the front false reports and true came in frequently so there was no lack of excitement even mr scarse caught the fever and was not half so eager in his denunciation of the government as he had been moreover he was beginning to find out that the boers were not the simple harmless creatures dr leyds in europe was representing them to be in the smoking room of the hotel he heard stories about them which made what remaining hairs he had stand upright with horror on mature consideration it seemed to him that if the government handed back south africa to the boers as the little england party wished the clock of time would be put back a hundred years and the black races would be exterminated in his dismay at this idea mr scarse could not help revealing something of what he was feeling to his daughter she was delighted at his return to what she called a sane state of mind and she openly expressed her pleasure i wish you could bring out a dozen men or so father men of your party i mean it might teach them that england is not so invariably in the wrong as they seem to think my dear he confessed with some show of penitence i fear our race is too insular we have many things to learn we have not to learn how to colonize or how to fight father she said with true imperial spirit it is my belief that providence gave us those gifts that we might civilize the world if our empire were to dwindle to nought it would be a bad day for the world yes my dear it would after all we are the only nation that thinks twice before we do anything in short mr scarse was rapidly turning his back upon the old narrow views to which he had so long clung and with a broadening mind the true meaning of the imperialistic policy was becoming apparent discarding the parish politics of clapham he took to looking around him well and in doing so he found much to occupy his thoughts old and crusted ideas cannot easily be dislodged and to use oliver wendell holmes's image mr scarse had been polarized for years harold succeeded in getting the permit for his wife and father in law to go to the front and it was arranged that they should start the next day in the morning captain burton went about his military business for he had to carry a report concerning some stores back to his general and mr scarse being occupied in a political discussion with a south african whom he had met at the hotel brenda thought she would take a stroll she bought a few things she wanted explored the principal streets and as she had ample time turned her attention to the suburbs it was very hot and she walked slowly under the blaze of the african sun the red dust rose in clouds there was a drowsy hum of insects all around and patient oxen toiled along the dusty roads there were plenty of colonials about and a good deal of attention was attracted to mrs burton both on account of her great beauty and her dress now and again a body of soldiers in khaki would march through the streets followed by a crowd of people the kaffirs lined up under the verandas and grinned from ear to ear as the rooibaatjes went by although they missed the red coats which had procured them that name from the boers from what she could gather brenda learned that these kaffirs were all in favor of the english cause for they both hated and dreaded the boers and small wonder considering how they were terrorized by the inhuman sjambok at length getting tired of novelty brenda turned her steps back to the hotel it was drawing near midday and she wanted something to eat before they left as she took a turning up a side street which led into the principal thoroughfare she saw a man standing under a veranda a tall bulky man with golden hair and golden beard and he was coolly watching her a shiver passed through her as she caught sight of him for it was her enemy van zwieten chapter xxii at the front van zwieten's sins had evidently made no difference in his fortunes he appeared to be flourishing like the proverbial green bay tree he was dressed in a smart riding suit with long brown boots and a smasher hat of the approved boer type quite unabashed at sight of brenda he crossed the road with an impudent smile and held out his hand she shot one glance of indignation at him and drew aside as though to avoid contact with an unclean thing a proceeding which appeared to cause the man some shame although he tried to assume an air of unconcern and amusement you won't shake hands with me mrs burton he said quite jauntily how dare you speak to me she said drawing back i wonder you are not ashamed to look me in the face after that trick about the letter ah that was what the boers call 'slim' he said wincing nevertheless at her open contempt for him all's fair in love and war you know but your husband has been rather in advance of himself on this occasion and the plot has failed yes you see i admit that it is a plot and i admit that it has failed i have nothing to say to you said brenda coldly except to tell you that if you attempt to molest either my husband or myself further i shall have you arrested as a spy he looked uneasily down the road and at the stern set faces of the passing soldiers he knew that from such men as they he might expect precious little mercy once the word spy had gone out against him followed by damning evidence of his complicity boer treachery had to be avenged there had been plenty of it about and he did not fancy being a scapegoat for others my dear mrs burton he went on calmly i wonder you spare me at all why not have me arrested now and have done with it i am completely in your power am i not you have but to raise your voice and the thing would be done indeed i am not at all sure that i should reach the jail alive they hate spies here and it is true they have good reason to you may not have such a chance again so cry out upon me now and revenge yourself on me once and for all for my crime my crime of loving you no i will not replied brenda firmly but i give you fair warning mr van zwieten that if you do not leave this place immediately i shall at once inform the authorities about you in luring me to pretoria you made one mistake you thought i should come unprepared i did no such thing i have ample evidence with me to prove that in london your occupation was that of a spy lady jenny gave me the papers i'm very much obliged to lady jenny i'm sure he said with a bow at pretoria for oom paul you could hardly have brought credentials calculated to speak more highly in my favor he would be quick to appreciate my services why did you wish me to come to pretoria you know i am married yes i know you are married but marriage can be severed as all else is severed by death he said significantly if you had come to pretoria but there is no need to talk about that he broke off impatiently i was duly informed that your husband was missing but he escaped before i could reach the tugela and myself take him to pretoria where he would have been completely in my power i wrote the letter thinking you would really find him there but he escaped and got your telegram the one you sent to wilfred burton i followed him down here and learned how he intended to intercept the kaiser fritz you see i am well informed mrs burton brenda was astonished at the extent of the man's knowledge and the dogged fierceness with which he seemed to follow her and harold she wondered if it would not be wise to have so dangerous an enemy arrested at once but the thought of lady jenny and the shame which it would bring upon her through the deeds of her late husband which van zwieten would assuredly reveal in such a contingency prevented her from deciding upon so severe a course later on she had reason bitterly to regret that she had not acted upon her first impulse had she done so it would have saved both her husband and herself endless trouble van zwieten half guessed what was in her mind but he made no move and seemed quite content to abide by her decision there was even a smile on his face as he looked at her villain as he was his courage was undeniable the pity was that such a virtue should not have been linked to others but then that was the man all over he was a belated conrad the corsair a man of one virtue and ten thousand crimes yet another virtue might be added he loved brenda and he loved her honestly i see you know your business as a spy mr van zwieten she said coldly but all your work is thrown away if you succeeded in killing my husband as you seem anxious to do i should kill myself van zwieten turned a shade paler for once he was moved out of his attitude of sneering insolence no no he said hoarsely do not think of such a thing i won't harm your husband on my honor your honor the honor of a spy the honor of a man who loves you he said with some dignity she shrugged her shoulders she had not much belief in a love which was so selfish in its aims and so unscrupulous in the carrying out of them but she would not argue further with him she thought the conversation was taking a turn of a personal character highly repugnant to her and she moved away well mr van zwieten i have warned you if you don't leave british territory i shall inform the authorities of your london career good bye good bye he said he took off his hat with a grand bow as she left him nor did he make any attempt to stay her he knew already that she was going to the front with her husband and he had every intention of following that she would reveal his true character he did not for one moment believe there he had her in his power for he would at once make known gilbert malet's conduct and that would mean shame and trouble for lady jenny from which brenda was more than anxious to shield her as he well knew she had been a good friend to the girl and had indirectly done a great deal to bring about the marriage this dutchman had more knowledge of a woman's nature than most of his sex and he found it of no little service in the profession which he had taken up brenda found her husband impatiently awaiting her he had made all arrangements for the journey and after a hasty meal they went down to the station she was in high spirits with harold beside her and the prospect of a novel and busy life in her capacity of nurse she was perfectly happy and he still more of a lover than a husband thought he had never seen her look more beautiful concerning the journey there is very little to say there was considerable monotony about it some of the scenery was beautiful particularly when they got amongst the mountains but for the most part the plains extended on all sides grey and dreary the kopjes humping themselves everywhere amongst the karoo bushes the dust storms too were altogether disagreeable and in spite of her veil and cloak brenda arrived at the camp in a very gritty condition and thoroughly worn out her husband saw the doctor at once and told him of his wife's desire to nurse the wounded her offer was gratefully accepted for brenda had had a certain amount of professional experience which stood her in good stead now so next day she took up her quarters in the hospital and went to work in earnest mr scarse having been introduced to the authorities amused himself by wandering about the camp and enjoying the novelty of his surroundings to a home staying man such as he the round of daily life at the front proved most amusing indeed father and daughter were equally delighted with this new experience mrs burton proved herself a most capable nurse and paid every attention to those under her charge her husband chafed somewhat at first he did not like the idea of his wife doing such work but when he saw that she really enjoyed it and that she was anxious to be of use in her own way to those who were fighting for queen and country he made no further opposition moreover he had his own duties to attend to and upon the whole husband and wife saw very little of each other the few moments they did have were therefore all the sweeter and the knowledge that brenda was near him and safe from the machinations of van zwieten was a supreme satisfaction to harold he had yet to learn that the dutchman was as active as ever and bent upon getting her into his power since his failure to cross the tugela general buller had been reconstructing his plans and was taking ample time over the preparations as he himself said there should be no turning back this time the garrison at ladysmith was holding out bravely but the messages showed that they were anxiously expecting relief the soldiers held like hounds in a leash were longing to get at the foe and wipe out their first failure but the days passed and no move was made on this side of the tugela all was safe but on the other the boers swarmed although they kept at a safe distance from the british position to brenda the mere fact of living in a camp in time of war was sufficiently exciting shortly after their arrival captain burton was ordered on patrol duty to scour the neighboring country on this side of the tugela he said good bye to his wife and went off in high spirits but it was with a sinking heart that she watched him go off on this dangerous duty the arrival of wilfred however served to cheer her somewhat as has been stated young burton was acting as war correspondent for one of the london papers and had been gathering information about the country around he had been absent therefore when his brother's party arrived but when he came back the first thing he did was to look up brenda at the hospital she was struck at once by his healthy appearance he seemed less nervous and hysterical than he had been in london for the outdoor life and the vigorous exercise was telling upon him but his big black eyes flashed as feverishly as ever nor did they lose their restlessness when brenda told him of her meeting with mr van zwieten at durban to harold she had never mentioned it knowing too well his impulsive nature but with his brother she felt it was different he already knew so much about the man that a little information more or less did not matter but he was inclined to blame her for having shown the spy any mercy at all what could i do expostulated brenda in dismay you know that if i had had him arrested he would have revenged himself by telling all he knew of mr malet's life and then think how terrible it would have been for lady jenny she must take her chance he said gloomily she must be prepared to suffer all for her country van zwieten will pick up all sorts of knowledge at durban and he may be able then to hamper our plans i don't think he will stay there wilfred i told him that if he did not leave i would give information to the authorities he daren't face that and i don't think he will be very long in following us here she added with a flush of anger he will follow us everywhere i should not be surprised if he were across the river now in the hope of taking me prisoner when the camp is moved directly the advance begins brenda you must get back to durban it will never do for you to remain here there's going to be some pretty hard fighting yes but not here i shall be perfectly safe behind the british lines perhaps i hope so wilfred looked gloomy and bit his nails abstractedly a habit with him when he was annoyed i tell you what it is brenda he burst out i'm very doubtful about the wisdom of this advance buller's idea is i believe to cross the tugela and try and pierce the boer centre i'm afraid he won't succeed oh wilfred have you no more faith in the british soldiers than that i have every faith in the rank and file yes and in many of the junior officers but i confess candidly that i don't feel altogether the same amount of trust in our leaders the mere fact of this advance having been decided upon goes to prove to me that they don't know their business the country between this and ladysmith is precipitous i know nothing like it outside switzerland or the rockies and it seems to me to be a mad thing to lead an army over it with heavy transport and all that unless that army is in overwhelming superiority to the opposing force which we know it isn't the whole place is strongly fortified and the positions that will have to be stormed are almost impregnable these boers know only too well what they are about they have chosen their ground well mark my words there will be great loss of life if not a great disaster it is throwing away lives to attempt campaigning in this district but ladysmith must be relieved i know but it will never be relieved in this way even the valor of the british soldier is powerless against the hail of bullets which will rain down on him from these natural fortresses and ten to one he won't see a single boer to shoot at in return they are devilish clever at keeping out of sight of course i am only a civilian and don't intend to set my opinion against that of the professional soldier but there is such a thing as common sense and we have not had enough of it about in the conduct of this campaign brenda was impressed in spite of herself what do you think ought to be done wilfred fall back on durban and reconstruct the plan of campaign buller's original idea of invading the free state was by far the best if we took the capital we should cut the rabbits off from their burrows and ten to one the free staters would be disheartened then again in that country we should have had more open fighting and manoeuvring would have been child's play to what it is here it is sheer madness hurling line after line against these impregnable fortresses even if they are taken it can only be at terrible loss believe me buller's original plan was the best the only one but i hear he was overruled but you can take my word for it if buller makes this move there will be a terrible disaster brenda seemed disturbed at this view of things she could not believe that a soldier of general buller's experience could be capable of so grave an error of judgment and yet as wilfred put it this advance did seem to be of an unduly hazardous nature but there again wilfred was always so pessimistic he was not the man to look at anything hopefully when he could do the opposite the men themselves were all full of confidence she knew and were looking forward to relieving their gallant comrades in ladysmith within a very short time now wilfred must be wrong she argued it was more than likely that the general had some information up his sleeve that no one knew anything about at all events she was not going to look on the black side of things thus she comforted herself somewhat harold returned from his patrolling but only for a short while again and again he was sent out sometimes into the enemy's country and he was in the saddle from morning till night brenda saw but little of him and had to put up with his continued absence as best she could she had as it happened plenty of work to distract her she was an excellent nurse and did good service in the hospital not sparing herself in any way indeed so constantly was she employed that the doctor insisted upon her taking a sufficient amount of exercise and strongly advised her to ride this commended itself to her for she rode well and was never happier than when in the saddle she managed to obtain a habit from a colonial lady who was also in the camp her husband managed to procure for her a capital little animal one of those active little ponies used by the boers and so she came to make frequent excursions into the surrounding country you must keep on this side of the river mrs burton said the doctor as long as you do that you are quite safe even beyond the camp lines but don't cross the tugela directly you do that you run risks i can't afford to lose my best nurse you know brenda looked at the sullen waters of the stream rolling through the melancholy veldt and laughed i should be a clever woman to cross that river doctor even if i wanted to you may depend upon my taking every care of myself i shall keep on the right side from sheer inability to get on the wrong one but it was not often that brenda was allowed to ride alone she was not the sort of woman to have to seek a cavalier but as the time drew near when the general intended to make his move his juniors found they had very little leisure and she had perforce to ride alone but even so she had no fear though her father worried a good deal about her but as she always returned safely even he grew gradually accustomed to see her go off unattended every now and again there came upon her a feeling that she was being watched she would look round and see a kaffir staring fixedly at her this happened on several days in succession yet she could not be sure that it was always the same man the natives were all so very much alike to her that it was impossible to distinguish one from another however this espionage was in nowise aggressive on the contrary if espionage it were it was done very skillfully it might be even pure fancy on her part for ever since that meeting with van zwieten in durban her nerve was anything but steady at all events she decided not to say anything to her husband about it lest he should forbid her excursions altogether and now that she had taken to riding again she was very loth to give it up she wondered if it might be possible that van zwieten was about it was possible just possible but she thought not probable he would know that wilfred was in the camp and that he would have no hesitation in denouncing him as a spy and for that reason she did not think he would be so foolish as to trust himself within the british lines at least so long as she kept on this side the tugela he could not molest her he was no fool to risk his life in a mad attempt which would mean certain failure so she comforted herself but the feeling of being watched still remained with her at last the order to advance was given and the men tired of inaction joyfully obeyed harold had been absent two days on scout duty this time across the river which warren's brigade were preparing to negotiate he had been sent out with a small force to make a reconnaissance in the enemy's country she was beginning to feel rather anxious for his return despondent and full of vague foreboding as she was she fancied that a ride would do her good and she set out as usual somewhere about sundown she intended to go only a short way and return before it grew dark the kaffir who saddled her horse watched her ride out of the camp and grinned evilly behind the rugged mountains the sky was a fiery red and was barred with black clouds the air was hot and sultry and there was promise of a storm in those heavy masses lying in the east under the crimson glare the veldt looked grim and ominous the kopies stood up like huge gravestones and where the grass failed the sandy karoo even more barren took its place here and there were farmhouses with red walls and corrugated outbuildings and the dull red light bathed the lonesome scene as if in blood the oppressive feeling in the air recalled to brenda's mind that memorable night at chippingholt when malet had been done to death just such another storm was impending she began to feel nervous as the recollection came upon her and she decided to return for some time her pony had been restive tossing his head and champing his bit he was usually so quiet that she could not understand it but just then as she had made up her mind to return he grew even more distressed and finally he bolted she let him have his head and in nowise lost hers she would be able to pull him up after a few miles on he galloped the bit between his teeth raising the loose red sand and taking her further and further away from the camp past kopjes past kaffir huts stone walls sheep kraals he tore she made several attempts to check him but in vain suddenly he put his foot into a hole stumbled and sent her flying over his head she lay on the ground half stunned the pony relieved of his burden scampered off she was able to realize that she was there alone on the karoo far from the camp and with night just upon her chapter xxiii a dutch lochinvar dusty and draggled from her fall and with a swimming head brenda sat on an ant hill wondering how she could extricate herself from so unpleasant a position the pony was far away lost in the shadows of the karoo and she was miles and miles from camp it might be that the animal would find its own way home and that they would send out in search of her but busy as they were with the hurry and bustle of the advance it was very possible that her absence would not be noticed had her husband been there but she knew that he was far away in the enemy's country taking stock of the boer movements and waiting for the division to come up wilfred was but a scatter brain she could not trust him on the whole she thought it was most unlikely that any one would trouble about her or in the confusion even miss her she was lost in the veldt fortunately she had plenty of courage and when her brain had steadied from the shock she began to look about her one thing was certain she would not and could not remain in the veldt all night if it was fine perhaps there would be no great hardship in that in spite of the cold but a heavy storm was coming on and she would be drenched to the skin the red sun sank down behind the hills dark clouds labored up from the east and the wide plain around her was swallowed up in the gloom the place and the time were eerie and the girl felt a superstitious thrill as she rose painfully to her feet trying hard to collect her thoughts at first it was the cause of the disaster which puzzled her why had the pony run away she had ridden him frequently and there was not an ounce of vice in the little beast that he should suddenly bolt without rhyme or reason was quite incomprehensible perhaps had she looked back and seen the evil grin on the face of the kaffir who had saddled him she would not have been at such a loss to explain the little pony's freak but something she must do she would walk on till she came to a boer farmhouse and get them to take her in for the night then she would get a horse and return to the camp in the morning perhaps she might even chance on some english people seeing that she was in an english colony and one loyal to the queen that there were rebels there it was true but not on that side of the river having a wholesome dread of their foes at close quarters they would not dare to cross so far then she felt safe what she needed was food and shelter kilting up her riding skirt she went forth in the fast gathering darkness in search of them it was weary work plodding over the loose sand and after the first quarter of a mile she was quite worn out it seemed as though she would have to pass the night on the open veldt then it occurred to her that if she shouted some one might hear and come to her rescue and if by chance she did fall into the hands of the enemy they would surely treat her kindly whatever his faults the boer was too religious to be wholly a scoundrel assistance she must have so straightway she hollowed her hands and shouted through them her long shrill cry pierced the air time after time but there was no response the echo died away and the quiet shut down again and she heard the desert talking to itself the faint murmur of the wind rustling over the sand the gurgle of the river and at times the wail of a solitary bird again and again he shouted with a courage born of despair all was silent silent as the grave then a sound fell upon her ears it came nearer and nearer until it took shape and defined itself as the steady gallop of a horse for a moment she was afraid but luckily she had with her a small but serviceable revolver which harold made her carry she drew it from her belt she was prepared to use it if necessary against an enemy even against herself but perhaps it was some well meaning and kindly boer or better still an englishman she resolved to risk attracting his attention anything was better than a night alone on that desolate waste taking her courage in both hands she cried again and the galloping of the horse was now close upon her then a man's voice shouted she replied and ran forward to meet her preserver as she prayed he might prove to be already she thanked god for her deliverance she came up close with him and peered anxiously through the lowering light to take in his features instantly she recognized them her blood seemed to freeze in her veins as she did so those features she knew only too well there was no mistaking that stalwart figure that it should be he of all men waldo van zwieten what mrs burton he said politely as he swung himself off his big black steed well i am surprised this is indeed an unexpected pleasure brenda shrank back and fumbled for her revolver brave as she was the man's mocking suavity terrified her she said not a word but looked at him as he stood strong and tall and masterful beside his horse can you not speak he said impatiently how comes it that i find you here my horse ran away with me and threw me said brenda keeping at a safe distance from the preserver fate had so ironically sent her will you please to conduct me back to the camp mr van zwieten what and run the chance of arrest no thank you but there is a boer farmhouse a couple of miles away near the river i can take you there if you like can i trust you asked brenda in a tremulous voice you can trust the man who loves you if you talk to me like that i won't go with you then i am afraid you will have to pass the night on the veldt mr van zwieten she said with dignity an accident has placed me in your company but not in your power i have a revolver and if you attempt to insult me i shall kill me i suppose no but i will kill myself his face twitched he knew she would do what she said and his love for her was so great that he would prevent that even at the cost of his own life you need have no fear mrs burton he said in a low tone i will treat you with all respect get on my horse and we will make for the farmhouse i speak of unpleasant as it was there seemed nothing for it but to accept his offer the position could not be worse and it might be made better so far she thought she had the upper hand but she was puzzled by his politeness and mistrusted it however she had no time to analyze her sensations for the darkness was coming on apace and the sooner she reached human habitation the better i will go with you she said bravely i will accept your offer i do not think you are a good man and i have used hard words to you i know still i will trust you now van zwieten bowed he said no word but held the stirrup for her to mount with his assistance she swung herself into the saddle and being a good horse woman she settled herself comfortably on it without much difficulty in silence he began to lead the horse across the veldt all the while she kept a tight grasp on her little revolver and a sharp eye on his every action for some time they proceeded thus without a word then van zwieten laughed in a low musical way what a fool i am he said slowly i love you madly i have you in my power and yet i do not take so much as a kiss i am a coward her face burned in the darkness but she gave no sign of fear you call yourself a coward she said calmly i call you a brave man oh i am a spy he cried scornfully you are a spy and for all i know a murderer but you are a brave man mr van zwieten all the same for you can rule yourself i never thought of you as i do at this moment you say that because you wish to conciliate me he retorted angrily not because you think so i am not a good man i know myself to be bad but i love you too well to harm a hair of your head all the same i intend to marry you that is impossible i am married already and if harold were to die well you know what i said that was only supposing i killed him argued van zwieten but suppose he were killed fighting as he may easily be then i would remain a widow for the rest of my days i love my husband i should always remain true to his memory you could never be anything to me not until this moment have i ever been able to feel the faintest glimmer of respect for you even if that is so i wonder that you choose to speak like that to me situated as you are now it is calculated to scatter the good intentions of a better man than i i cannot help it i have told you i am not in your power i am not afraid to die that i prove by not shooting you as you stand there as it is i keep these little bullets for myself van zwieten groaned to think of this woman being wasted on a worthless fool like burton said he he is not a fool you may not think so you cannot expect me to agree oh if you had only listened to me only given me a chance i would have been a better man i think you are a better man or you would not have behaved as you are doing now you are a strange mixture of good and bad he shrugged his shoulders it often happens so he said those who think to find a bad man all bad or a good man all good are invariably disappointed i have met the best of men and hated them for their meanness just as i have met the worst and loved them for some delightful incongruity we are a pie bald lot indeed then again for a few moments they went on silently in the distance now could be seen a light and on the wind came the barking of dogs the murmur of the river continued all the while like the drone of the bagpipes you see i have not deceived you he said there is the farm there are women there the men are out with their commandoes rebels you call them i suppose you wonder what i am doing here on this side of the tugela i do considering wilfred burton is in the camp and it would be very easy for him to denounce you you are not the man to run unnecessary risks as a rule the risk i am running is for your sake no i won't explain myself now if necessary i must show a clean pair of heels that fortunately i am well able to do but here we are at the farm that is tant' trana on the doorstep he lifted her from the horse and she saw the stout woman whom he called tant' trana waiting on the door to receive them the look she gave brenda was by no means one of kindly welcome rather was it full of hostility but she seemed to fear van zwieten and she set herself to do her best to make the english lady comfortable when he had gone out to look after his horse tant' trana set the best she had in the way of food before brenda but the girl was utterly exhausted and could not eat she drank a cup of coffee and the boer woman watched her dourly as she drank it then it appeared that tant' trana spoke english i am no child she said no i have lived long and the dear lord has watched over me but never did i expect to see an englishwoman at my table beloved lord thy wrath is heavy upon me i am very sorry said brenda considerably taken aback by this outburst i won't trouble you long only till morning but tant' trana continued without heeding her she was so fat that it took her some time to recover her breath the dear lord gave this land to us to the chosen of israel and you english you seed of satan come to take it from us she shook her great fist in brenda's face but never fear our burghers shall drive you into the sea oom paul is our moses two sons and a husband have i fighting for the land of milk and honey we have two thousand morgen and you would take it from us beloved lord let our moses and his hosts smite the ungodly amalekites how long the old woman went on raving thus brenda did not know she began to feel sleepy the face of tant' trana seemed to grow larger and more red then it receded and her voice seemed to grow more faint to come from far away although the woman was talking her loudest brenda had just grasped the idea that her coffee had been drugged when she lost her senses with one last effort she pulled out her little revolver it dropped from her hand as her head fell back the boer woman picked it up and cursed like deborah senseless and white brenda lay in the big chair tant' trana looking on and raving the while then van zwieten entered the room a smile of satisfaction flitted across his face how long she remained thus insensible brenda knew not she came gradually to herself then she wondered if she could be on board ship there was a rocking motion and she felt as though she were imprisoned then her senses grew more clear and she awoke to the fact that she was on horseback in the arms of van zwieten he held her steadily in front of him on the saddle and the horse was trotting steadily over the grass and a thunderous black sky was overhead she uttered a cry and gave herself up for lost once again she felt for her revolver van zwieten guessed what she was after and laughed cruelly no it's not there mrs burton he said i had to arrange that i'm glad though you've woke up i want to have a talk with you put me down put me down gasped the girl put you down repeated he clasping her the tighter hardly after all the trouble i have had to get you here that is too much to ask dear brenda your promise you promised to treat me well and i have done so as i told you i would not harm a hair of your dear head and i have not done so and i will not do so i had to drug your coffee because i knew that by no other means should i be able to get you away all's fair in love and war you know this is both love and war i told you that in durban don't you remember where are you taking me to the boer lines we have crossed the river yes there is a ford hard by the farmhouse that of course was the reason i took you there in another hour we shall be safe amongst my own people thence you will go to pretoria and then and then when the war is all over you will marry me i will die first she screamed trying to struggle you will not be allowed to die the little revolver looked pretty ah so pretty in your hands but it was dangerous i love you too well to lose you like that and now that i have you wholly in my power you cannot say that i am behaving badly oh put me down do put me down dear mr van zwieten don't spoil your good action in saving me on the veldt by saving you saving you exclaimed the dutchman how innocent you are child why you don't think our meeting was accidental do you i had you brought there i knew exactly what would happen and my calculations were not very far out were they you you oh how can you tell me such a thing i don't believe it it is a lie gently please gently said he restraining her tenderly she was struggling to free herself from his grasp even as she knew at the risk of life and limb i can be cruel as well as kind i tell you it was i who brought you on to the veldt the kaffir boy who attended to your horse is my servant i knew how you rode every day for i followed you up from durban and have watched you constantly i told the boy to prepare a special bit for your horse one that would burn his mouth after a while oh that is an old trick which i learned in your virtuous england when the little beast began to feel the burning he naturally bolted what else would you expect him to do i did not anticipate he would throw you though that was not included in my plans the rest you know again she tried to struggle free from his grasp for god's sake let me down she cried she felt she would go into hysterics every moment that is the one thing i will not do i have you at last and i keep you you are mine now husband or no husband not if i can help it shall you ever see him again she strove to pierce the black darkness that was all around she strained and strained her eyes but there was nothing then she thought she saw a light but she could not be sure on the vain chance that somebody might hear she screamed loudly once and then again and again be quiet i say roared van zwieten savagely understand that i won't lose you that i shoot you first and myself too for that matter he spurred his horse they were not yet beyond the territory under british patrol he seemed to know perfectly well where he was making for she began to feel sick and faint with the motion and the fierce clutch of the man the horse was galloping hard now with his double burden she felt he could not last long at that pace but van zwieten had set his teeth hard to it and urged him on and on speaking not a word oh god save me from this man she cried as though in answer to her prayer there was a terrible clap of thunder a flare of lightning overspread the sky and by its light she could see his face was deadly pale and oh so cruel before he could swear for his horse shied at the crash before even she could cry out the rain came down with a hiss and a swirl almost a solid mass of water once again her thoughts went back to that night long ago when malet had been murdered was she about to meet death too then with an oath he drove the spur into the animal and terrified it made another bound forward the rain lashed their faces they were already drenched to the skin then came another fearful thunderclap she felt as though her head must burst there was a gleam far away there in the distance the light from some farmhouse probably help help she screamed oh harold harold van zwieten swore loudly but his oaths were drowned in the thunder overhead the horse reared snorting with terror then she felt the dutchman's arms lessen their grip and in a paroxysm of fright and despair she flung herself to the ground she fell into a kind of morass and she could hear van zwieten's cry of rage as the animal sprang forward the next moment half stunned and dazed as she was she was up and running for dear life toward the light now not far distant in vain did van zwieten struggle with his terrified horse the animal plunged and reared and every peal of thunder increased its state of frenzy he heard the girl shriek and by a lightning flash he saw her tearing across toward the light in the distance a farmhouse showed up black in the glare then as once again he dug his spurs and turned his horse's head he heard a shot it was followed by another and another and the next flash showed him several figures in front of the house once again brenda screamed for help a lusty british cheer was her reply it reached the ears of the horseman and he knew well what it meant he galloped off through the roar and conflict of the elements like a madman he had lost her for the second time she had escaped him her heart bounding she ran forward with redoubled energy shouting ever her husband's name there was another shot and another flash of lightning across the sky it seemed to her that the very heavens were open she threw up her arms and fell against the farmhouse fence then she heard a voice give out some order it was her husband's voice chapter xxiv an unexpected meeting brenda's reasoning power was not at fault in that moment of excitement harold with his small patrol party had crossed the river she too was across the river van zwieten had told her that it was harold's voice she had heard she could not be mistaken it was no matter of the wish being father to the thought it was his voice she had heard the voice of her own husband he was there in the farmhouse with his party thank god she cried raising herself with difficulty where van zwieten was she did not know he could not harm her now harold was there to protect her clinging to the stones of the fence in the drenching rain she cried his name aloud again there was silence then the sound of many voices and the tramp of feet who goes there asked a gruff military voice i an englishwoman mrs burton let me in the gruff voice uttered an exclamation of astonishment and there sounded the dull thud of a rifle being grounded immediately afterward she heard a light footstep on the veranda of the house and her husband's voice surprised and incredulous brenda oh harold harold it is i let me in let me in the gate in the wall was pushed open and several privates emerged someone carrying a lantern swung it so that the light fell on her pale and haggard face then with a low cry of astonishment her husband picked her up in his arms and carried her into the house good god brenda what are you doing how did you come here she could not speak she was sobbing on his breast he placed her gently on the hard sofa then she found her voice but she could think of nothing say nothing she could only rejoice in having found him oh harold harold thank god i have been led to you my poor girl you are cold and wet and exhausted here drink this brandy and i'll get something cooked for you don't exhaust yourself more by trying to explain that will come after he had thought of her far away safe and sound in spearman's camp even now he had some faint notion that van zwieten had something to do with this though how he could have managed it he couldn't for the life of him conjecture she smiled lovingly at him and submitted to be wheeled in the chair to the fire her habit was soaking wet and steaming now in the heat he knelt beside her and took her hand the room was of no great size it was furnished quite roughly with a few chairs and a sofa and a table of unpainted deal pictures from the illustrated london news and the graphic were on the walls there was a portrait of president kruger looking even more grim than usual over the mantelpiece from its presence she judged that the owners of the place were rebels outside the rain still came down in torrents and in a room close by she could hear the men keeping up their spirits and doing their best to make all gay within making her take off her soaking habit her husband wrapped her in his military cloak he asked no questions for he saw that she was not in a fit state of mind to answer them she began once or twice to try and tell him but he would not listen when you have something to eat dear and have got these wet things off then i am ready to listen to all the miracles you have to tell me for i can't conceive how you came here in this plight except by a miracle then a woman who so far belied the traditions of boer female beauty as to be exceeding lean instead of stout entered the room with a tray of smoking dishes she was a kindly creature and smiled pleasantly she spoke nothing but low dutch and answered to the name of tant' wilhelmina if she were at heart a rebel she showed no sign of hostility outwardly she bustled brenda into another room and there supplied her with garments dry certainly but of the most wonderful design and colour clothed in these things which were in truth the boer woman's sunday finery brenda came back to the sitting room even such garments could not take away from her beauty though they effectually concealed every line of her figure she sat down to the table and ate harold had gone to see his men then she sipped a little of the brandy and sat herself down by the fire she felt as though she would never be warm but after all she had undergone this peace and rest was heavenly well dearest said her husband entering quickly how do you feel now better much better come and sit by me harold and i will tell you how i come to be here you are just dying to know and trying not to show it for my sake he unbuckled his sword and drew a chair beside his wife i am very much astonished he said taking her hand in his but i have an idea before you say a word is it van zwieten yes i thought you might guess as much i left the camp for a ride and my pony bolted mr van zwieten it appears through the agency of a kaffir arranged it all by tampering with the bit i was thrown there i lay alone on the veldt he came up and carried me off on his horse when the storm burst i managed to wrench myself free and ran toward the lights in the house but i never never expected to find you here dearest it is god's mercy that has led me to you i have only been here a few hours he explained warren's division had started and we are to remain until it comes up how strange that we should meet here so van zwieten is at his tricks again the brute how i wish i could get a shot at him did he come near the house with you no when he heard the shots he rode away at least i think so but i am safe with you harold for the time being brenda but it is just as likely as not van zwieten knowing where you are will return with a boer force and try to take the house this is the enemy's country and they have not yet retired before the advance i expect the division about dawn but there will be time for van zwieten to attack before then harold promise to shoot me before i fall into his hands the perspiration broke out on the young man's forehead if the worst comes brenda i will he said solemnly but i hope to shoot him of course he may not bring any boers up after all they must know of warren's advance and i dare say they'll be afraid to linger outside their entrenchments how did van zwieten find you on the veldt he watched the camp and followed me oh harold the whole thing was a scheme of his own to get possession of me when i escaped he was taking me to the boer camp and he intended to send me to pretoria to marry you i suppose after i was shot how did he treat you brenda mrs burton met her husband's gaze fearlessly with all courtesy she said if i had been his sister he could not have treated me better and i had my revolver you know until he took it from me the scoundrel i am glad you were well treated i have to thank him for so much consideration but if he had not harold clenched his fist i would have killed myself said his wife with equal fierceness you can trust me harold you don't suppose anything anything even torture could change me no dear i know you are the bravest little woman in the world i have the utmost faith in you i should be a cur if i had not tell me more about this brute's plotting this she did omitting no detail from the time when van zwieten had picked her up on the veldt to the time of her meeting with him her husband he ground his teeth as he listened yet he was relieved to find things were no worse in spite of the dutchman's villainy he was inclined to think better of him than he had hitherto done dishonourable as he was he had at least treated a defenceless woman with respect at the conclusion of the story he kissed her again for her bravery dearest you have been splendid i am a lucky fellow to have so plucky a little soul for my wife curse the man i long for the moment when i shall be face to face with him he deserves nothing better than a bullet and he'll get it if i can shoot straight no don't shoot him said brenda he behaved well to me he is a spy and a scoundrel but he is not a brute and harold i really believe he loves me truly who would not love you my own said her husband tenderly yes i can see he loves you it is the best feeling in his black heart all the same i wish he would transfer this chivalrous affection to some other quarter and leave you alone i am afraid he will never leave me alone until he dies then he must die cried her husband fiercely i shall protect you from these insults at any cost curse him i wish i had shot him at chippingholt when he accused me of murdering malet but we will talk of this another time brenda you are worn out lie down on the sofa dear and try to sleep let me put my cloak over you but you harold i must keep my eyes about me i have an idea that van zwieten will bring his boers up before dawn if you think so would it not be better to retreat towards the advancing column no i have my orders to stay here though of course no attack was anticipated here i'll stay brenda and do my duty i have a dozen men and in this house i daresay we can hold out until our advance guard arrives i am not afraid for myself but for you dearest do not be afraid for me i would rather be here than in the camp if we are to die we die together i won't die neither shall you we'll baffle van zwieten yet so far fortune has been on our side now go to sleep i must attend to my duty brenda obeyed she was worn out with emotion and fatigue so much so that she could not sleep she lay flat on her back on the hard sofa staring at the whitewashed ceiling on which the flicker of the dying lamp made the shadows dance harold had taken away the lamp in case the steady light should attract attention from the outside if van zwieten was about it was not improbable that he would fire where he saw a light brenda hoped with all her soul that he would not return she could not bear to think that she had been the means of bringing harold and his men into peril but she sadly feared that knowing where she was the dutchman would bring up some of the enemy who were not far away and would try to capture the farmhouse before the advance column came up full of the thought of it worn out by anxiety and excited by the novelty of the situation she could not close her eyes but tossed and turned on her hard couch longing for the daylight the suspense was almost unbearable the hours passed slowly now and then harold would come in to give her a word of comfort and she always replied with a bright smile and a cheerful word the men in the other parts of the house relieved each other in watching captain burton had honestly told them what they might expect there was nothing to be gained in minimising matters each man there were a dozen of them had his rifle and revolver with a few rounds of cartridges it was obvious they could not hold the place against any prolonged attack on account of their shortness of ammunition but if the boers did not commence operations until dawn as it was improbable they would do they on the other hand would not have much time warren's column was on the march and would be there betimes in the morning and then the enemy would be forced to fall back on their entrenchments among the mountains unless they chose to run the risk of capture by the superior force on the whole harold felt sanguine that he and his men would come out of it all right and there was always the chance that van zwieten might not bring up his force or that he might make overelaborate preparation and thus delay the attack if he did at worst he could rely upon the arrival of the column very shortly he determined that when all was safe he would send brenda back to the camp that done he could march forward to the relief of ladysmith with a light heart twice brenda had escaped this man she should do so a third time toward dawn the rain ceased and the thunderclouds rolled away leaving a clear and starry sky there was no moon but the surrounding objects were faintly outlined in a kind of luminous twilight the animals about the house commenced to wake and sniff the morning air burton went on to the veranda and looked out on the wild waste veldt uncanny in the cold light of early dawn he could discern no sign of an approaching enemy nevertheless he felt anything but easy in his mind and determined on a definite course of action if van zwieten did come he would find the bird he wanted to capture flown beyond his reach captain burton returned to the sitting room and woke brenda from the uneasy slumber into which she had fallen dearest he said sitting down and drawing her to him i have a presentiment that van zwieten will attack this house and i want to put you beyond his reach i will send you forward with one of my men there is a horse here which i can get from the boer woman he will take you to the advancing column and you will be sent back safely to the camp but she flatly refused to do this i won't leave you here to be shot i know you can't come yourself and i won't go without you i suppose we could not all leave the place no i have my orders to remain here until the column comes up i can't disobey brenda you must go no no don't send me away i will there was a shout outside and harold sprang to his feet i hope to god it is not too late he cried and hurried out but it was too late across the veldt a large body of boers were riding the east was saffron colour and everything for a considerable distance could be seen clearly the sentry who had shouted pointed out the advancing column to his captain and harold went round the house and gave orders to bolt and bar all the windows then he returned to his wife and insisted that she should leave with one of the men i must send a messenger back to tell them we are being attacked and hurry them up you must go brenda no no a thousand times no god help us then he groaned and went off to despatch his messenger the enemy was riding at a canter across the grass he took one of his lancers round by the back where the horses were picketed and told him to ride with all speed to the advancing column and report the danger the man took his horse and stole quietly away taking a wide detour to avoid the lynx eyes of the boers so he was away and out of sight before they reached the farmhouse by the front brenda could see them coming could see van zwieten leading she knew him by his golden beard she ran to change her things and by the time the boers had dismounted near the fence running round the house she was back in her riding habit she got a revolver from her husband and by his orders remained in the sitting room as the safest place then he kissed her fondly and went out his men posted at doors and windows were all on the alert coolly courageous as the british soldier always is in time of peril for the rest they were in god's hands the yellow in the east changed to a fiery red and all the earth was bathed in roseate hues from the verandah captain burton could see the wide veldt rolling in grassy waves to the foot of the distant mountains and a gleam of the winding river crimson in the glare the enemy were grouped some distance away from the fence and he went out with two men to ask their intentions of course he knew too well what they were but even in war there is a certain etiquette to be observed after a while van zwieten with a white handkerchief at the end of a stick came forward also with two men and stopped at the fence whence he could talk to the english officer well you scoundrel captain burton said fiercely for his soul loathed this man who was trying so hard to take his wife away from him what do you want i want mrs burton and i want you you shall have neither or at best our dead bodies the other man changed colour don't be a fool burton he said i have a number of men here and you must give in surrender and i promise you that you shall go free and my wife i can't let her go van zwieten said sullenly i have risked too much for her sake to do that she must come with me captain burton stepped forward a pace but he still kept on the verandah his orderlies stepped forward also stolid and courageous you villains said burton savagely how dare you make such a proposal to me if it were not for the flag you carry i would shoot you where you stand if i were only one of your lot i should do so in spite of it i hope to god that i shall kill you and i will some day you have insulted my wife for the last time you scoundrel i never insulted mrs burton as she will tell you herself the dutchman said coolly and she will not be your wife long i shall claim her as mine over your corpse do so if you can but i want no more talk retire your men surrender to the president of the transvaal republic was the counter demand i hold this house for her majesty the queen i refuse to surrender your blood be on your own head then van zwieten turned as though to retire suddenly he sprang aside and flung up his hand the boers with him instantly had their rifles to their shoulders and two shots rang out harold had just time to throw himself down but one of his men was shot the poor fellow flung up his arms with a cry it had not died away before a volley came from the british soldiers within the farm but by this time van zwieten and his companions had decamped and expecting the return fire had thrown themselves down the larger body of boers fired and under cover of this the three scoundrels rolled and afterwards ran into safety harold sprang back through the door whither the other soldier had preceded him he picked up the dead man in his arms and with bullets pattering about him like rain carried the body indoors then the door was closed and the siege began as the first shots came ping ping against the red stone walls the sun uprose in a blaze of glory and all the veldt was flooded with golden splendour chapter xxv besieged the fence round the house was made of stone and the boers took advantage of this as cover whilst some of them sheltered behind the trunks of the red gums even then the besieged had the advantage for they were protected by the walls of the farmhouse and could shoot without exposing themselves to van zwieten the disappointment of not having succeeded in shooting harold in the first dastardly attack was very great had their leader been killed he imagined that the soldiers would have surrendered quite forgetting that it was not the custom of englishmen to yield to anything but death now however there was nothing for it but to take the place before relief could arrive by all his gods he swore that brenda should be his mrs burton herself remained in the sitting room revolver in hand far from being afraid the girl much to her own surprise was filled with the terrible joy of battle indeed she was in the highest spirits the boers fired at the windows and wherever they saw a puff of smoke as the bullets sang and the smell of powder became stronger brenda could hardly contain her excitement the boer woman was on her knees in a back room praying with all her might that the accursed rooineks would be taken and killed her husband and sons were with the armies of the republic and her whole heart was with her countrymen outside how gladly had she dared would she have opened the door to them harold ordered his men to reserve their fire his aim was not so much to score a victory as to hold the house until help arrived on their side the enemy were equally careful and the fight progressed but slowly there were thirty boers more or less and of these three were already dead while two were wounded of those in the house only the man shot under the white flag was dead van zwieten looking anxiously over the plain fearing every moment to see some sign of the british advance cursed the slowness of the affair at last he picked some men and sent them round to try and get at the horses of the besieged but harold had got them under shelter in a shed with five men in front to guard them the boers creeping round the corner were met by a volley which killed four and wounded two they fled swearing and captain burton rejoiced reserve your fire men we shall hold out after all by heaven we will sir one of the men answered we'll fight to the last rather than an english lady should fall into the hands of these dirty rascals ho give 'em beans you beggars and this the beggars in question proceeded to do then van zwieten sent forward a dozen men on to the verandah with a rush their advance was covered by a steady fire from the rear though not one of the besiegers showed himself simultaneously another body attacked the back shed wherein the horses were housed and in spite of the british fire succeeded in effecting their entrance to the yard then they rushed the shed which was an open one two englishmen fell and there was no one to fill their places for their comrades were fighting desperately on the verandah in front van zwieten seeing his advantage led the remainder of his force to the other side of the house where there was a wide window it opened into the room where the boer woman was kneeling she flung open the shutters van zwieten jumped in followed by half a dozen of his men and the first those within knew of it was when they found themselves attacked in the rear they right about faced put their backs to the wall and fought like men then as a reward for her treachery a stray bullet pierced the brain of the boer woman meanwhile the men who forced entrance into the yard were steadily gaining ground but hearing the firing within the house they turned back by the front again in order to come to the rescue of their comrades the party on the veranda broke through the door and hurled themselves forward boer after boer fell before the british fire for harold had now concentrated his men what there were left of them gradually he was driven back to the sitting room a shout of triumph from outside announced that those who had remained had succeeded in capturing the horses within the whole place was dense with smoke brenda in obedience to her husband's orders was lying flat on the floor beside the sofa she gave up all for lost but determined she would not be taken alive she was only waiting until her husband fell in the midst of it all she could discern van zwieten rifles were useless now it was hand to hand work the end was near there in the little room harold stood with three of his men beside him the others were either dead or dying but the boers had got off by no means cheaply at least twenty of them had been done for the four englishmen with their backs to the wall fought on using revolver muzzle and butt end until at last their cartridges gave out and they threw down their weapons with a curse and surrendered there was nothing for it van zwieten gave vent to a yell of triumph his men threw themselves on burton but the englishman was too quick for them he stepped back quickly and levelled his revolver he had one chamber loaded i have just one left he said hoarsely stand up to it van zwieten for i am keeping it for you finish him men roared the dutchman no no cried brenda and before a man could move she had flung her arms around her husband and stood between him and them the last shot dear is for me she said there was a pause they held back harold never flinched his wife clung to him desperately his face was streaming with blood from the graze of a bullet but he was determined to make good use of that last shot beside van zwieten stood a huge man with a white flowing beard at last the dutchman made a dash forward and attempted to take brenda from her husband's arm you are mine he cried madly mine you shall not die coward hissed burton take your lead like the dog you are he fired but she struggling to free herself from the dutchman's grasp fell heavily against his right arm and spoilt his aim the bullet whizzed overhead he threw down his weapon and prepared for the worst he put her behind him sobbing she fell on her knees and clasped her arms around his legs she felt for her revolver that she might be sure of death when he died fire rang out from van zwieten spare the woman kill the man two boers levelled but the old man with the white beard rushed forward and struck them aside they fell wide hold he cried let no man fire damn you piet bok what do you mean asked van zwieten savagely ah piet bok cried harold seeing a chance of life and of saving his wife i am your prisoner again i yield to you fire men shouted van zwieten fire i tell you he was seething with rage at the fear lest his prey was going to escape him then turning to the old man he said piet bok this is my business it is the business of the republic retorted piet coolly and at the same moment he struck down a boer who was about to fire i'll shoot the first man who disobeys my orders he said clear the room i am in command here it was done then they set to work to drag out the bodies of the dead and tend the wounded soon harold and his wife piet bok and van zwieten were left alone for the third time the dutchman had been baffled the man whom of all others he would have had dead still lived harold knowing well that piet bok would stand his friend said nothing for the moment but wrapped his arms round brenda and faced the two men the issues of life and death were in their hands will you sit down englishman said piet bok i see you are wounded a mere scratch replied harold but my wife will sit with your permission your wife echoed the boer leader who spoke english well enough you never told me she was the rooinek's wife he added turning to van zwieten i did not think it was necessary growled the other besides i thought that would have ceased to be by now yes i can well believe that cried brenda with sudden energy mynheer bok do not believe what this man says he tried to carry me off from my husband last night and when i escaped to this place he brought you and your men up with the sole object of having my husband shot he would shoot him now if he dared that he shall not do whilst i am here cried piet bok you are both prisoners of the republic and as such you shall be treated nothing of the sort cried van zwieten mad with rage i demand that the man be shot and the woman be given to me piet bok signed to harold to remain silent on what grounds on the grounds that this woman was engaged to marry me with the consent of her father and that this man has married her against her father's will is this true asked the boer leader no cried brenda it is not true at one time my father deceived by this wicked van zwieten did wish me to marry him but when he found out his true character he consented to my marriage with captain burton i never was engaged to him i always hated him this is my husband she laid her hand on harold's shoulder give me to that man and i will kill myself she raves said van zwieten he has turned her against me that is another lie said harold fiercely you don't believe him piet bok no i don't believe him replied the big man quietly i believe the lady my friend he added turning to van zwieten can you wish to marry a woman who openly declares hatred for you besides she is already the wife of this english soldier and she loves him the dutchman winced i demand his death he cried on what grounds he is a murderer that is untrue brenda said quietly and you know it mr van zwieten oh i wish i could meet you face to face and fight it out harold said between his teeth only death will stop that cursed tongue of yours a murderer repeated piet bok looking at captain burton that is a serious matter state your case van zwieten glibly enough he complied he related the events which had taken place at chippingholt the death of mr malet the finding of the revolver belonging to harold and ended by stating his conviction that the crime had been committed by captain burton and he killed malet because he was on our side because he was supplying information about the accursed english to me for the use of the republic he it is wholly untrue piet bok cried harold furious at the man's audacious mendacity i did not kill malet i did not know at that time that he was betraying his own country to van zwieten this man's one idea is to get me put out of the way that he may marry my wife who hates him and he cares not how he achieves his desire so long as he does achieve it i hate him oh how i hate him cried brenda i will kill myself rather than have anything to do with him if my husband dies i will die too oh mynheer bok save me save my husband from that man if you do not shoot the murderer van zwieten said in his turn you are no friend to the republic piet bok the big boer turned round and cursed him for his words i am a true burgher of the transvaal said piet bok with vehemence and you are an outlander one of those rats who want to creep into our corn rick and grow fat the whole of the war is the doing of such as you what do you know about me in connection with my own country nothing and what you say about these people is untrue the woman hates you you would kill her husband to marry her against her will as to the rooinek he is not the kind of man to murder with my own eyes i saw him spare my boy hans you shall harm neither of them what will you do then shouted van zwieten furiously send them to pretoria as prisoners yes but not in your charge mark you you would kill them on the road i command here van zwieten go out mynheer and get your men together the british are advancing and i have no fancy for being trapped go but these two said the other i will be responsible for these two thundered piet bok do you want to be shot yourself that you will be unless you obey instantly very unwillingly van zwieten turned and went and they heard his voice outside shouting to his men brenda sprang forward and kissed bok's hand thank you mynheer for your goodness god bless you piet bok you are a brick cried harold enthusiastically and since it seems my fate to be a prisoner i would rather be your prisoner than anyone else's you spared my boy's life man was the answer and i am not ungrateful i know van zwieten is a bad man but he is powerful with our oom paul he will make trouble when you are sent to pretoria the old man bent forward and whispered if i can help you to escape i will hush not a word my children i hate van zwieten he is one of those who have ruined our country come now we must go considerably cheered by the friendly spirit displayed by the old man brenda and her husband went out on to the verandah here they found the boers they had buried their dead and had secured the other prisoners ready to start the english dead were left unburied much to harold's wrath and he begged bok to let him and his surviving fellows bury them before leaving but the permission was refused we must get away there is not time your column will be upon us immediately i know mount englishmen and you lady see we have found a saddle for you ah you cannot say we burghers are not civilised no there was no help for it brenda mounted and found the saddle comfortable enough as it afterwards transpired van zwieten had brought it on a spare horse so sure had he been of capturing brenda how he had managed to procure it in the there boer entrenchments it was impossible to say but it was and brenda on it now but not as the dutchman had no doubt fondly pictured to himself his captive with an expression black as thunder he was riding at the head of the troop piet bok remained in the rear between brenda and her husband as they left the house harold looked in vain for any sign of general warren's division prisoners they were and prisoners they seemed likely to remain with every probability of being sent on to pretoria where they would be at the mercy of the intrigues of van zwieten once again but piet bok saw the heavy glower of the dutchman and had his own views as to the reason for it you expected your column to come up he said in a low tone so did we our spies have kept us correctly informed but it seems there is some delay in crossing the tugela are you disputing the passage no we are not we intend to offer no resistance to your reaching the mountains why surely you should dispute the river passage no we are about to never mind we know what we are doing your men are very brave oh yes but your generals ah well the dear lord has shown them what they should do for the benefit of the burghers not another word would piet bok say but captain burton gathered from his looks and speech that the division was being led into a trap the boers were past masters in the art of ensnaring their enemies and on this occasion they were quite capable of entrapping the whole of buller's army amongst the mountains if harold had only been alone he would have made a dash for freedom and hastened to warn his commanding officer but as he was placed that was impossible he could not risk his wife's safety even for that of his division he could only comfort himself with the thought that the british generals had been rendered more wary by their late reverses and trust that they would succeed in avoiding this especial trap for some hours the little troop trotted over the veldt and drew nearer to the mountains in which the boers had their entrenchments hitherto van zwieten had kept away from brenda but now he ranged up beside her while harold was in front with piet bok the man looked pale while his eyes burned like fire brenda shuddered as she glanced at him and turned her horse away you are not safe from me yet he said noting the action and though you shrink from me now you will come to me later i have finished with kindly methods now i will be your master your husband shall die yes in spite of that old fool and when he is dead i will marry you don't think you have beaten me or ever will i am not afraid of you though you threaten me ever so often she replied calmly for i see that god is thwarting all your wicked schemes twice before i escaped you this is the third time you are strong mr van zwieten but you are not so strong as god bah why do you preach to me i know what i am doing you do not she said steadily but i do you are marching to your death yes it is true i believe firmly that you will die in the midst of your wickedness you talk like a child said he uneasily for he was inclined to be superstitious and her solemn tone of conviction made him uneasy you can laugh at me if you please but i am certain that what i say is true you will die die in but before she could finish her dismal prophecy van zwieten thoroughly dismayed by her words had put spurs to his horse and ridden away at full speed chapter xxvi in captivity after the excitement of that day and night came five days of quiet quiet at least for captain and mrs burton held prisoners as they were in a boer house on the slope of a rocky hill sparsely covered with grass it was the homestead of a sheep farm and the animals fed amongst the hills and when the seasons served down on the plain the stone house was solidly built it was of one storey with a roof of corrugated iron and was comfortable enough after the dutch fashion so that on the whole brenda and her husband were not unpleasantly situated more over they were allowed to be together a privilege which they valued highly indeed it was the sole thing which rendered this captivity tolerable as it happened piet bok was unable to send them to pretoria as he had wished the boers were now engaged with buller's division and were falling back to a hill called spion kop a name hardly known at that time but fated in two or three days to be spoken of all over the world not a burgher could be spared to escort them to the capital but strangely enough a sufficient number were told off to guard the farm house harold was somewhat suspicious of this arrangement suspicious that somehow van zwieten had had to do with it but he had no means of making certain the dutchman had never come near them but they feared him all the more now that he was out of sight and fully expected some fresh trouble as he had warned mrs burton he had not done with them yet occasionally they were visited by piet bok and the old man still seemed as kindly disposed as ever but as yet he could do nothing to help them so for five days they had to make the best of their irksome captivity not even a book or a paper could they find however putting aside the constant dread of van zwieten they were not unhappy the house stood so high that there was a splendid view of a large plain and on the left a huddle of hills beyond these the fighting was going on and the prisoners could hear the boom of the cannon and the shriek of shells at times they could see the smoke of the battle afar off harold hoped that the advance of the army would bring them help at last but the fighting was in a more westerly direction and the hoped for help never came if we could only escape brenda he said for the hundredth time it is maddening to be shut up here and to listen to all that we must make one desperate attempt to get away you are not afraid i know i am not afraid replied his wife but we must not be rash we have no weapons no horses no food i don't see how we are to manage it nor do i unless piet bok will help us these men outside would give us no quarter if we tried to get away they are just dying to get rid of us brenda shuddered harold don't it is terrible to think of i feel sure all will come right in the end it won't if van zwieten can help it he will have enough to do to look after himself harold that man will die how do you know do you mean a violent death and that soon yes that is just what i do mean my mother was a highland woman and had what they call second sight i have not got it myself i suppose because i am not a pure celt but i have enough of the seer in me to have a presentiment about that man i feel certain that he will die by violence and that shortly i can't explain myself more clearly one never can explain a feeling of that sort you told this to van zwieten himself yes and i frightened him perhaps that is why he has not been near us i should not have thought he was superstitious brenda nor you either for that matter i am not as a rule was her reply but i feel that what i say is true van zwieten will die harold sturdy stolid englishman as he was tried to argue her out of this idea but he gave it up as hopeless she had made up her mind that their enemy was a dead man or would be dead within a few days strange to say it was on that very day that he paid them his first visit he looked as handsome and as burly as ever going by appearances he had a good many years of villainy before him yet he came up to the veranda and saluted mrs burton with a low bow of which she took no notice you are surprised to see me he said with his usual cool insolence i cannot say that i am surprised at anything you do was harold's disdainful reply but if you have come to make the same proposition you made before i warn you that i shall not listen to it so patiently the dutchman cast a quick glance at the slender figure of the other man i am not afraid of you he sneered you have no weapons neither sword nor revolver i can use my fists even on such a big bully as you as you please but i don't see much chance of delivering my message until you moderate your tone what is your message asked brenda speaking for the first time i come to offer you freedom on what conditions there are none i love you still if i had my way i would kill your husband and marry you but unfortunately said van zwieten with a sneer i am amongst a very moral people piet bok has told the boer generals about what they are pleased to call my wickedness and i have been informed that if i persist in my plans i may say good bye to all advancement amongst the godly boers now i am a poor man and cannot afford to lose all i have gained ambition for me must be stronger than love so mrs burton i give you up thank god cried she clasping her hands adding as an afterthought if i could only believe you oh you can believe me he said gloomily if i were only a rich man rich enough to give up my position here i would never rest until you were mine but the choice lies now between you and my position i choose to lose you from this moment you need have no fear of me you can go with your husband where you will you do not love me i know it now but him you do love unworthy though he is that is a lie captain burton cried starting up hush harold is it worth while arguing about let him go on well mr van zwieten you have come to tell us this what else i have come to offer you my assistance to escape oh that is what i hardly expected to hear you say and you must pardon me if i don't believe you as you please he said again but you can escape to night if you will the men here now i shall take away with me shortly two horses will be left behind food is in the house and here are a couple of revolvers one for you and one for burton they took the weapons in silence could this be van zwieten they did not know him in this new rle of self abnegation and the suspicions of both husband and wife were thoroughly aroused but the revolvers were good ones and they were loaded could it be that he spoke truly and that he was anxious now to retrieve his past to give up his plotting and spying and to live a virtuous life amongst the too moral boers who had indeed perhaps forced him to do this thing still brenda looked doubtfully at him for compulsory righteousness was somewhat hard to credit i see you don't believe me he said after a pause well perhaps you are right it is rather late in the day for me to turn saint but you may be sure i should not do this unless i had some very strong inducement if you are taken to pretoria you will only remain to vex my eyes and i want to get you out of sight that is my reason for giving you your freedom to night i will send a messenger who will guide you to the british outposts they are not so far off as you think buller has advanced almost to spion kop and he has taken several of our positions if he gets spion kop and i understand warren intends to capture it if he can he will have the key to our position and will march on to ladysmith but he shrugged his shoulders there is many a slip you know well i will go in and get my men will you follow my messenger i can't say yet captain burton said bluntly you speak fair enough but this may be a trick for all i know how should i benefit by a trick van zwieten asked if i wanted to kill you i could do it now and no one would be the wiser the boers here would shoot you with pleasure but if i killed you and took mrs burton why then good bye to my chance of becoming president of the confederate states of south africa no i will let you go it suits me better love as i said must yield to ambition but if you do not believe me stay here my messenger shall come at eight o'clock to night follow him or not as you please good bye mrs burton you little know what it is to me to give you up but you must say i afford you every chance of being happy with your husband brenda looked at him she began to think he was acting in good faith after all i am not ungrateful she said gently we will follow your messenger good bye and she held out her hand to him van zwieten bent over it and kissed it then he drew himself up looked at harold steadfastly and turned away in silence do you believe in him asked brenda after a pause i don't know upon my soul i don't know he is such a scoundrel i wonder you could let him kiss your hand brenda craft must be met by craft she replied in a whisper you silly boy you don't mean to say you are jealous of that can't you see that i wanted to disarm his suspicions so that we might get away safely then you don't believe in him no he has some scheme in his head hush it's not safe to talk about it now when he's gone meanwhile let him think we accept his offer it would really seem as though van zwieten were acting straightforwardly for the first time in his life the boers who had been guarding the place got their rifles saddled the horses and headed by van zwieten took themselves off down the mountain side and were shortly afterward to be seen riding across the veldt in a northerly direction captain burton still suspicious could not believe in his good fortune with brenda he proceeded to explore the house it was empty they searched the orchard the sheep kraals the kaffir huts in fact the whole domain but they could find no trace of a single soul no weapons had been left but they had the revolvers in the stable were two horses already saddled harold pointed this out to his wife ready you see for the journey said he van zwieten is evidently very sure that we shall accept his offer well we'll not disappoint him so far as the horses are concerned replied brenda but as to waiting for his messenger i don't think we'll do that why brenda what do you mean we don't know an inch of the country probably this messenger of van zwieten's will know it rather too well for our liking i don't trust the arrangement in the least believe me dear he will only lead us into some trap and we shall be prisoners again i don't see that van zwieten need have given himself the trouble to do that we were his prisoners already i can't see through it at present either but nevertheless i'm sure there's something at the back of his ostensible generosity captain burton was at a loss how to interpret it on the whole he was inclined to trust to his wife's instinct he had no sort of premise on which to argue against it so they had something to eat and decided to leave at sundown beyond the hills they knew the british were engaging the enemy so if they made due west they had every hope of coming up with the outposts of the advancing column there was of course always the chance that they might not get even so far safely but that they preferred to risk rather than trust in mr van zwieten their horses were wiry little animals enough and if put to it could show a very pretty pace they fed and watered them now preparatory to their start on the whole they were sanguine then came a surprise as they were making their own meal they heard from outside a voice hailing them in english harold rushed to the door and returned shortly with piet bok the old man looked anxious and hurried forward to shake brenda by the hand thank the dear lord you are safe he said with emotion i feared it might be otherwise that you had fallen into that man's snare then it was a snare cried brenda at this confirmation of her own feelings tell us mynheer bok what was his plan ach is it not to tell it you and save you from it i am here he rubbed his hands i will show van zwieten that others can be slim as he beloved lord he is the seed of satan that man he took away the guards but he has left us the two revolvers and a couple of mounts all ready saddled quite so and he is to send a messenger soon is he not to lead you to the british camp yes yes believe him not that messenger will not lead you to your camp but to an ambuscade of boers headed by van zwieten himself then your husband here will be shot and you will be carried off the scoundrel the double dyed villain but why all this mynheer we were in his power already no you were not you must understand that i have power with the burghers yes and i told them your story and they were amazed at the wickedness of this man and he was told to go out from amongst us lest the dear lord should send evil on the host then he said he would desist from his wicked schemes and send you on to pretoria to be dealt with by the president but i overheard his conversation with the messenger whom he intends to send to you and i know his plan you are to be carried off as i have told you and in durance vile kept until the war is over your husband will be shot probably by van zwieten himself but of all this he will say not a word to the burghers and thus he will maintain his place amongst them you see why he does not act openly i see said brenda her color rising now what are we to do come with me at once said piet bok i will lead you by another route to your outposts and so shall we thwart this son of the pit but you must come at once there is not a moment to lose but the messenger of course we do not wait for him it would mean death to you or to him right you are then let's get off straight away it's getting dark already ach yes that is well come along then their trust in the old man was implicit he had always proved a friend hitherto the sun was setting in floods of gold over the mountain tops as they rode down the path which descended to the veldt heavy rains had rendered the ground sodden piet bok headed for a point in the hills where he said there was a pass other than the one in which van zwieten was waiting unluckily as they started across the veldt they saw a horseman coming toward them at full speed the messenger cried brenda what are we to do now mynheer the old man unslung his gun kill him he said quietly else he will ride on and tell van zwieten if he sees me with you he will guess the truth it is well known in laager that i am the enemy of van zwieten must he really be killed asked brenda with a shudder it was terrible to her that this man should be shot in cold blood it is his life or mine dear said her husband pulling out his revolver to be ready if piet bok should fail but the approaching boer was not going to trust himself at close quarters he circled round them and held out a white flag in token of friendship harold laughed grimly as he recognized the old trick piet bok sighted and fired but the fellow flung himself flat down on his horse's neck and the shot missed him he rode off with a defiant whoop a big dutch oath escaped from the lips of piet bok and he caught brenda's horse by the bridle we must ride for it he said the man recognized me and you too he will hasten back to van zwieten and they will be after us in no time we must make for the hills how can i thank you bok said harold gratefully almighty that is right you spared my boy hans by this time the messenger was a mere speck on the horizon he was riding like the wind to take this news to his chief the three fugitives made a straight line for the pass urging their horses to their best the sun had dropped behind the mountains and the shadows were gathering fast on the veldt for several hours they tore on until they reached the mouth of the pass there they pulled up to give themselves and their animals breath i think we can count ourselves safe now said piet bok wiping his brow but we must push on through the pass at the other side let us hope we shall come up with your men the track was narrow and winding and full of mud which fouled the horses and made the climbing doubly hard it was quite dark there but piet knew every inch of the path and rode on ahead fearless and confident in about an hour they emerged there were the lights of the british camp twinkling a mile and a half away as they commenced the descent they heard a shot ring out and brenda gave a cry of dismay piet bok had fallen from his saddle ride ride for your lives cried the old man he has come round by the other pass and so it was van zwieten instead of following at their rear had pushed through the other pass and had cut them off but he had made one mistake he had allowed them to get out of the pass on to the higher ground instead of cutting them off from the camp as shot followed shot harold caught brenda's horse by the bridle headlong they tore down toward the plain the light or rather the dark was all against the pursuers they gave up firing and made to overtake them but the sound of the muskets had already been heard in the camp and they could hear the bugles ringing out whether the brave old boer who had saved them was dead or not they did not know it was beyond their power to aid him they urged their horses on and on for in their speed lay the only hope of escape courage brenda cried harold stick to it they've heard the firing in camp i will dear i will then her husband looked round and an exclamation of mingled relief and triumph came from him they had given up the chase they've had enough of it hurrah he cried they were now within a short distance of the camp and could hear the commands being given consequent on what evidently had been taken for the commencement of a surprise on the part of the boers those behind them had turned and fled now in the opposite direction all of them save van zwieten he stood up and fired twice but his shot fell wide then harold turned and tried what his revolver would do at that range van zwieten's arm fell useless then he galloped off none too soon for a squadron of mounted infantry came on the scene just at the moment what's all this shouted the captain in command we have escaped shouted harold burton and mrs burton what is it you old man cried a friendly voice a voice they knew well for the fourth time brenda had escaped her enemy chapter xxvii nemesis having no ambition toward enacting the rle of heroine of an adelphi melodrama brenda was beginning to weary of this game of hide and seek however she was safe for the time being as even the redoubtable van zwieten could hardly be expected to take her from the midst of the british army harold reported the mishap which had led to the loss of his men and afterward rejoined his company he wished his wife to go back to spearman's camp but she begged so hard to remain that at last he consented permission was obtained from the authorities and brenda betook herself to her old task of nursing the wounded she related to her friend the doctor as much of her adventures as she could without trenching too closely on her private affairs and great surprise was expressed at her perils and her lucky escape but to wilfred who came to see her and his brother as soon as he heard of their rescue she related everything in detail by jove what a scoundrel that fellow is said that young man i wonder when he intends to leave you alone never i fear replied brenda unless he is killed i shall never be safe from him i'll shoot him myself if i get a chance he is a danger to society it must be some one's business to put him out of the way you have had a bad time brenda but i don't think you need fear the man any more what makes you say that i have an idea that he has come to the end of his tether so have i she said and i told him so but wilfred tell me about my father he has gone back to durban as you know to see the authorities about your disappearance he thinks you have been taken prisoner by the boers and that you are at pretoria by now he is going to try and get you exchanged there is no need for that thank god said brenda cheerfully i must let him know at once that will be difficult unless you send a message from ladysmith when do you think we shall be there if the luck holds good in a couple of days we have taken most of the boer positions now warren intends to try for spion kop to night if he captures it we shall hold the key to the boer position ah you see wilfred your forebodings are all wrong we are yet in the wood not out of it replied he significantly however i will give buller and warren all praise they have done well all the same i still condemn this plan of campaign only a miracle can render it successful well we shall see what happens when spion kop is taken do try and look on the bright side of things wilfred but the young man departed still shaking his head there was no doubt that he was very depressing company his face wore a look of settled gloom most painful to behold and he was always prognosticating calamity in the face of the most promising operations at the same time he invariably refrained from pessimism in his letters to his newspaper which were usually cheerful and full of devoted praise of the behavior of both troops and officers it was anxious work waiting in the hospital while harold was in the field but brenda had not much time for thought she was nursing the wounded with all her heart and soul and was an angel of light amongst the weary wounded soldiers the doctor called her his right hand as well he might she deprived herself of rest and food to be by her patients only when compelled to did she lie down and then it was in her clothes ready to be up and doing at the call of duty her best qualities came out in this most arduous work the grand attack on spion kop was to be made at night in order to effect a surprise all day long the operations went on in the field toward sunset harold's company had to dislodge a number of boers who had entrenched themselves on the slope of the mountain the position was taken and the enemy fell back but not without considerable loss of life on both sides amongst the wounded was harold who was shot through the lung it was dark when the news was brought into the camp and the ambulance bearers started under a rising moon for this miniature battlefield quite unaware of her husband's mishap brenda was busy attending a dying man but he was beyond her aid and died within a very short time of his being brought in she was closing his eyes with a sigh at the horrors of war when one of the doctors told her that she was wanted with a presentiment of bad news she went out and found wilfred waiting to speak to her he was greatly agitated and took her hand as if to give her courage brenda i have bad news for you it is harold she cried pale to the lips yes it is harold i have only just heard he is dead no i hope not i don't know but he fell while leading the attack on one of the small kopjes they are just going out to bring in the wounded i thought yes i'll come said brenda anticipating his speech is it far no not very make haste god grant we may find him alive she needed no second bidding but hastily gathered together some medical comforts wrapped herself in a cloak and came out in silence they walked toward the fatal spot which had been pointed out to wilfred by a private who had seen harold fall she did not weep her emotion was too deep for tears the moment which she had been dreading all these months had arrived unexpectedly as all such moments do now she felt that the actual event was not so terrible as the expectation had been there was a chance that he might be alive he was wiry healthy clean blooded and clean living and the mauser bullets as brenda had seen inflicted a clean wound full of silent prayer she walked on had she heard of this in england she would have been distracted but somehow since she was on the spot and would soon be with him it did not seem quite so terrible at all events he had fallen in the forefront of battle doing his work and not by the treachery of van zwieten if he died he could not die more gloriously there was comfort in that thought i saw van zwieten to day said wilfred suddenly you did where when asked brenda wondering if after all the scoundrel could have had anything to do with this mishap to her husband on the lower slopes i was looking through my field glass and saw him quite plainly riding about on a big black horse i recognized him by his long golden beard i am certain it was he that was why i wanted you to come with me to see after harold i don't understand because as van zwieten is about the place he is bound to hear that harold has been shot he has spies everywhere and from one of our prisoners i heard that he had described harold's appearance to several boer sharp shooters that the poor chap might be picked off do you know the prisoner's name yes and he's a fine old fellow who did good service to you piet bok then he was not killed at the time we escaped no only touched on the right arm he was taken prisoner this morning i would have come and told you but i couldn't get away i saw him by chance and he recognized me from my resemblance to harold i told him he was wrong and then he informed me of van zwieten's new villainy by this time the man who picked off harold has no doubt told van zwieten and has received his reward and that scoundrel will probably come down to see if the news is true what shrieked brenda oh don't wilfred if he finds harold still alive he will kill him that's what i thought and that's why i got you to come with me i feel certain that the brute will be there she uttered a cry of mingled terror and pain oh wilfred do not let us lose a moment harold my darling she began to run come brenda keep as quiet as you can you'll need all your strength a glorious moon filled the world with its pale radiance the shadows of the mountains and kopjes were black as indian ink in the white light here and there were points of fire and in the distance a glimpse of the white tents of the camp to the right rose the great mass of spion kop with its flat table top dark and menacing but a few hours and there would be a deadly struggle on that pinnacle already the generals were maturing their plans for the assault occasionally the boom of a gun could be heard for the boers had not yet desisted from firing in spite of the lateness of the hour brenda paid no heed to all this she strained her eyes toward the rising ground they were approaching was he dead or alive all her life was bound up in the answer to that question the indian bearers swung along at a slow trot and she followed closely on wilfred's arm he felt her shiver although the night was warm and did his best to console her and she never forgot his brotherly kindness at that terrible hour they climbed up the slope which earlier in the day had been swept by rifle fire now the boers had retreated to another point of vantage and the position was held by a small force of our men as the ambulance party approached it was challenged and the word was given in a few minutes the bearers were within the entrenchments glad you've come said the officer in charge there are many poor fellows here who require your attention the enemy are removing their dead now he addressed these remarks to the doctor but he saluted when he saw brenda whom he knew i expected you mrs burton your husband is over yonder we have made him as comfortable as possible then he is not dead gasped brenda turning faint oh no he said cheerily he is worth a dozen dead men you'll soon pull him round over there he pointed to the left and she hurried away wilfred lingered behind to speak to the officer have you noticed a particularly tall man with the boers he asked a man with a golden beard yes he asked after burton it seems he was a friend of his before the war has he seen him asked wilfred turning pale for well he knew the reason of van zwieten's inquiries no i think not but he intends to look him up shortly i think your brother will pull through burton and he hurried away to attend to his duties wilfred stood still and meditated he grasped his revolver the man has lived too long he murmured i must do it then he moved toward the group round his brother brenda was supporting his head and a doctor was examining the wound in the poor fellow's chest we must wait till we get him to the hospital he said have him put into the ambulance mrs burton has he a chance doctor she asked with quivering lips i can't say yet the bullet has pierced the lung hope for the best then he hurried away with his attendants and brenda was left alone with her husband and wilfred harold was quite unconscious but breathing faintly and as she bent over him with an agonized face she prayed that god would spare his life wilfred stood beside her and looked down silently on that countenance waxen in the light of the lantern as he stood there as brenda placed harold's head on her knees both heard a mocking voice beside them well mrs burton you are a widow at last she gave a cry of horror at the ill omened words and wilfred turned with a bound to clutch van zwieten by the throat you hound he cried you miserable dog and he hurled the big man to the ground taken by surprise the dutchman had fallen but he rose to his feet with an ugly scowl cursing bitterly i'll pay you out for this he said menacingly at present my business is with mrs burton i refuse to speak to you cried she you are a wicked man and god will punish you i rather think that it is you who have been punished he sneered your husband is dead or pretty near it now it is my turn he is not dead he will live when you are lying in your grave leave me you have done harm enough but he has not paid for it cried wilfred savagely no nor will he pay cried van zwieten defiantly wilfred pulled out his revolver i will make you pay he said you shall fight me the dutchman was no coward but he drew back from the terrible expression on the young man's face accentuated as it was in the strong moonlight i refuse to fight with you he said sullenly this matter has nothing to do with you if i choose to marry your brother's widow that is my business mind your own you shall marry no one said wilfred harshly for i intend to kill you brenda did not speak she listened absently while the two men wrangled van zwieten looked at her for a moment then he turned his back on wilfred i will not fight you he repeated the other man sprang forward and struck him on the cheek with his fist will that make you fight with a roar of rage van zwieten turned and flung himself forward he caught the younger man in his arms like a child and threw him on the grass then he drew out his revolver and fired at the prostrate man but brenda had looked up and seeing his intention had sprung to her feet and grasped his arm the shot went wide and in his rage van zwieten struck her the woman he loved struck her to the ground and before he could recover himself sufficiently to fire a second time he fell with a hoarse cry shot twice through the breast by wilfred burton nemesis has come up with you at last said the young man picking up brenda in his arms the sound of the shots had attracted the attention of the men near at hand good god burton what have you done cried an officer killed some vermin was the reply here bring the ambulance along and put burton into it wilfred shrieked brenda who had recovered her breath is he dead no said van zwieten faintly not dead but dying i have lost no one attempted to molest wilfred i can explain myself to the commanding officer he said he will approve of what i have done by this time the other boers had taken their departure or there might have been trouble at this violation of the armistice brenda aided the men to place harold in the ambulance and when she had made him comfortable returned to the side of wilfred who was explaining his conduct to the officer in command van zwieten heard her footstep or he must have felt her presence near him he opened his eyes i am done for he said i suppose it is just but i loved you brenda much as she hated him she could not see him die there without making an effort to save him she tried to staunch the wound but it was impossible the doctor had long since taken his departure seeing that all human aid was useless she moistened the man's lips with brandy thank you he said faintly will you forgive me yes i forgive you she whispered but you must ask forgiveness of god van zwieten shook his head feebly it is too late for that ask burton to forgive me he has punished me he can afford to be generous wilfred overheard the words i forgive you the ill you have done my family but i do not forgive you for seeking the hospitality of my country and betraying it come brenda i can tell you something about that said van zwieten in a weak voice come near quite unsuspicious wilfred knelt down beside him in an instant van zwieten raised his revolver and shot him through the throat he fell back with the blood pouring from his mouth van zwieten laughed quits he said then he fell back dead all was confusion brenda knelt beside her brother in law and took his head in her lap while the others crowded round van zwieten's dead body wilfred opened his eyes saw brenda's eyes bending over him and whispered bend down quick she put her ear to his mouth and heard him whisper in broken words in my breast pocket look yourself packet confession i shot malet you oh gasped brenda why wilfred burton raised himself up with one last expiring effort for england he cried for england god bless eng then he too fell back a corpse brenda fainted chapter xxviii calm after storm two weeks later mrs burton was in maritzburg by the sick bed of her husband as prophesied by wilfred the attempt to relieve ladysmith by storming the impregnable positions of the enemy had failed certainly warren had been so successful as to have seized spion kop but only to abandon it on finding the position untenable then buller very wisely had fallen back on his original line of defence across the tugela and the retreat had been conducted in a masterly fashion without the loss of a man or a gun brenda and her wounded husband had gone back also to spearman's camp and later on had gone on to maritzburg wilfred was left in his lonely grave under the shadow of spion kop where also lay the body of van zwieten harold's wound was dangerous but had not proved fatal he had been invalided home by the doctors and so soon as he might be able to travel he was to sail for england but when that would be it was difficult to say for some days he had hovered between life and death but now he had turned the corner and was gradually winning his way back to life under the loving and skillful care of his wife he was out of danger and on a fair way to recovery but it would be many a long day before he would be able to fight again in the meantime mr scarse hearing that his daughter was safe and sound had now returned from durban and was staying at the same hotel he was thankful to know that at last she was to be spared the persecutions of van zwieten whose death he openly rejoiced in he was greatly astonished at the news that wilfred had killed malet but he hardly censured him so severely as a little englander might have been expected to do in the circumstances but indeed mr scarse was by no means so virulent against his country now as he had been in the past his visit to south africa had opened his eyes to the other side of the question particularly to the many failings of the boers he had learned from experience that england was not invariably wrong that however she might blunder she had usually right on her side in fact both as a father and a politician mr scarse was a reformed character harold was terribly distressed to hear of the death of his brother for a long time brenda kept the news from him fearing its effect in his weak state but the day came when it could no longer be withheld and she was obliged to tell him the truth it was a glorious tropical morning her father had gone out and she was seated by her husband's bed holding his hand in her own his beard had grown he was thin and haggard but his eyes were bright and full of intelligence he was anxious and able now to hear all that had to be told and she told him everything he was amazed wilfred killed malet he said hardly believing his ears but he had a sprained ankle on that night it is impossible his sprain was feigned to protect himself replied brenda sadly it is all in his confession he left a written confession yes he wrote everything as it happened on that night and carried the statement about with him to be placed in the hands of you or myself when he died hush harold dear you must not speak here is my father mr scarse entered on tiptoe to inquire how the invalid was getting on he brought in some fruit always a welcome gift to the convalescent he had heard enough to acquaint him with the subject under discussion so busy had brenda been in nursing her husband that she had not found time to tell the whole story to her father now he asked her for details and she went over them again for his benefit but why did wilfred kill the man he asked from sheer patriotic feeling answered his daughter he found out that mr malet was supplying information about our defences to van zwieten and he remonstrated with him malet laughed at his scruples and denied his complicity then wilfred searched mr malet's desk and found papers which proved conclusively his treachery then it was he decided to kill him to save the honor of the family well said scarse reflectively murder is a terrible crime but if ever it is excusable surely it is in such circumstances as these so i think chimed in harold a man who betrays his country should not be allowed to live in his place i would have acted just as wilfred did it was not a murder it was well deserved extermination it is terrible nevertheless read the confession brenda said mr scarse no i can tell you the story better harold must not be wearied and the confession is long wilfred has stated at great length the reasons which led him to this act and sets out a strong defence of it he never regretted it at all events go on brenda dear child i am anxious to hear how he did it she glanced at harold to see if he was listening and began i need not weary you with his own defence she said as i have told you from papers in mr malet's desk he found out that he was a traitor and was supplying van zwieten with information concerning the plans of the government the number of men and guns which we could place in the field and many other things which the transvaal authorities wished to know had kruger and his gang not known that we were wholly unprepared they would not have dared to defy great britain and risk this war mr malet it appears is responsible for a great deal indeed for the whole war the scoundrel harold said weakly i am glad indeed that wilfred shot him i would have done so myself to ward off suspicions from his doings malet posed as an imperialist he saw van zwieten only at intervals it was to obtain possession of some papers from malet that van zwieten came down to chippingholt and for that reason he extorted an invitation from you father i thought he was anxious to come mr scarse said now i can see it all she continued wilfred heard that van zwieten was at the cottage and kept a sharp eye on malet he found out that he was to meet van zwieten on that night and give him some documents he then made up his mind to kill him to save as i have said the honor of the family as well as to punish him for his wickedness in betraying his own country shortly before nine o'clock van zwieten came to the manor and entered the library by one of the french windows it was his voice that lady jenny heard when she went to see if her husband was back from his walk indeed it was malet who brought van zwieten to the library to give him the papers when lady jenny was on her way to the rectory to see you harold wilfred escorted her she mentioned that she had heard voices in the library and wondered with whom her husband had been speaking wilfred guessed at once that the man was at his scoundrelly work and was more than ever determined to put a stop to it to get away from lady jenny without exciting her suspicion and also to prove an alibi in case he shot the man he pretended to sprain his ankle lady jenny was quite unsuspicious and went on to the rectory alone as you know she never reached it having been stopped by the storm as soon as she was out of sight wilfred hastened back to the house with the intention of confronting both men and killing malet if he did not take the papers back from van zwieten he also entered the library by the french window so the servants never saw him come in he found the room empty as van zwieten had gone away and malet with him i suppose it was to receive further instructions wilfred saw the revolvers belonging to harold on a side table for mr malet had been using them that afternoon he took one found that it was loaded and hastened after the pair knowing that van zwieten was at our cottage he went first in that direction but for a long time he could see neither of them at last he caught sight of malet in the orchards just before the storm he was talking with a man whom wilfred took to be you father my brother i suppose yes replied brenda it was uncle robert he heard high words between the two and saw the struggle that was when the crape scarf was torn undoubtedly malet must have torn it and held it in his hand without thinking well wilfred saw malet throw the other man to the ground just when the storm broke and hurry away to get back to shelter in the manor but the storm was so violent that he took shelter instead under a tree wilfred crept up to him and waited but it was so dark that he could not see him plainly enough to shoot straight and he was of course unwilling to risk failure then a flash of lightning revealed mr malet wilfred sprang forward and grasped him by the shoulder he cried out i heard him myself i was only a short distance away when the darkness closed down again wilfred put the muzzle of the revolver close to his head and blew his brains out then he ran away and in the darkness tripped over a stump the revolver flew out of his hand and he lost it van zwieten found it yes wilfred was a good deal troubled about it for he knew that harold's name was on it and he feared lest he should on that account be accused of the murder as i was indeed said harold yes dear i know but not officially if for instance you had been arrested on the charge then wilfred would have come forward and have told the whole story as it was he kept silence and what did he do after he had killed malet asked mr scarse he went back to the place where lady jenny had left him and waited for some time in case she should return you see to exonerate himself he thought it well to keep up the fiction of the sprained ankle then as lady jenny did not return he went home and gave out that his ankle was sprained but didn't the doctors find out the truth no he took good care not to show his foot to any one he wrapped it up in wet cloths and made a great fuss about it but in the excitement over the inquest the doctor took no notice of it i wonder lady jenny didn't find out the fraud said harold in that case wilfred would have owned up to it and confessed the whole thing and i don't believe she would have minded much if she had known what a traitor her husband was no i dare say she would have applauded wilfred she is a true patriot is lady jenny said harold with a feeble laugh besides on account of robert's wife she and her husband had become estranged for many a long day but did van zwieten never guess no said brenda reflectively i don't think he did he believed lady jenny herself had done it out of revenge but he could not prove that and under the circumstances lest his own affairs should come out he thought it wiser to hold his tongue well that is the story and a very painful one it is i am sure that wilfred acted for the best and did what he conceived to be his duty both to his country and his family but it is dreadful to think he should have stained his hands with blood i don't altogether agree with you my dear said mr scarse energetically if malet had been detected in his treasonable dealings under martial law he would have been shot openly as it was wilfred executed the sentence privately i am not one to defend murder you know but i cannot bring myself to look upon this as murder wilfred was insane on the subject of patriotism said harold he was hardly responsible for his actions when he shot malet i don't blame him the reptile deserved his punishment and van zwieten deserved his fate wilfred did no more than was right and he rid the world of two scoundrels you forget van zwieten fired first put in brenda wilfred only defended himself i can't pretend i am sorry that van zwieten is dead because so long as he lived he would never have ceased to persecute me but let his evil die with him harold so far as that goes i never want to hear his name now you are overtaxing your strength talking dear said brenda arranging the bedclothes you must be quiet and try and rest yes do said mr scarse i want to have a few words with brenda so harold lay back and after a time fell into a sleep his wife told off one of the nurses to stay beside him and herself went out with her father when they had gone a short distance he explained why he wished to speak privately with her brenda he said a will was found on van zwieten it seems that there is a sum of some five thousand pounds standing to his credit at one of the london banks really father i never thought he was so well off evidently spying paid to whom has he left it to you my dear to me she could hardly believe her ears i would not take it if i were starving i hated the man how could i touch his money but brenda think for a moment is it not foolish to throw it away five thousand pounds is a large sum no no no repeated the girl vehemently i will not touch it i tell you that money was made out of spying and working evil against england i am sure harold would think as i do about it and so harold did think later on when she returned she found him just awakened out of a refreshing sleep and she told him of van zwieten's strange bequest he refused at once to accept it and commended her for having forestalled him in the decision we can live on our own means small as they are dear and when the war is over i will beat my sword into a ploughshare and come out here and turn farmer that is if we are successful said his wife smiling oh i have no fear as to that in a month or two there will be equal rights for white man and black from the zambesi to the cape but in any case there'll be no more fighting for me brenda i shall never be the same man again who says so she asked quickly the doctor he says this wound will always trouble me and that i shall never be able to stand the english winters here the air is balmy and the climate mild in that case we'll do just as you suggest dearest there is nothing to keep us in england my father is wrapped up in his politics and my aunt and uncle care only for themselves yes you are right as you always are harold when the war is over we will settle here we shall never think less of dear old england because we are exiles eh brenda exiles we shall not be exiles here this is part of the british empire wherever the map is colored red there is england harold dear do you know i cannot get poor wilfred out of my thoughts in his own way he was a true hero he gave his life for his country yes brenda i agree just as much as many another man is doing here at this moment i cannot help feeling relieved that the mystery of malet's death is cleared up and i am not ashamed now that i know it was my brother who fired the shot may such justice ever be done to traitors she knelt beside the bed and took his hands soothingly in her own don't talk any more about these things dearest they excite you i shouldn't have mentioned it let the past lie buried all i know and all i care for is that you are alive and that i have you wholly to myself we will never be parted harold we may be poor in the world's goods but we are rich indeed in love and that is the best of all riches dearest amen she said and kissed her husband tenderly the end
