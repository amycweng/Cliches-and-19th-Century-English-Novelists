the bells ringing the people into evening service seemed to feel the depressing influence of the weather and their brazen voices sounded hoarse and grumbling as if they rang under protest cold toonot a brisk sharp frostfor here in melbourne frost and snow are unknown but a persevering insinuating gnawing cold just disagreeable enough to make one shiver and shake with anxiety to get home to a bright fire and dry clothes overhead a leadencoloured sky with great masses of black clouds from out whose sombre bosoms poured the steady rain splashing noisily on the shining roofs and swelling the gutters in the streets to miniature torrents and then the winda gusty chilly windthat came along unexpectedly and drove the unwilling rain against the umbrellas of struggling pedestrians or else took a mean advantage of its power and turned their umbrellas inside out with a shrill whistle of triumph the steady light streamed out from the painted church windows and the dull blurred glare of the street lamps was reflected in the wet pavements ugh a night not fit for a dog to be out in and yet there were a good many people hurrying along to the church in answer to the clamorous voices of the bells some folk howeverwise in their generationpreferred staying at home to sitting in church with damp boots and a general sense of stickiness about their clothes and though possibly their souls suffered from such an omission their bodies were certainly more comfortable among these godless people who thus preferred comfort to religion were two young men occupying a room on a first floor the windows of which looked across to the church now full of damp and steaming worshippers a room in a boardinghouseespecially one where boarders only pay twentyfive shillings a weekis not generally a very luxurious apartment and this special room was certainly no exception to the rule it was square with a fairly lofty ceiling and the walls were covered with a dull red paper which being mellowed by time had assumed a somewhat rusty hue it was rapidly growing dark outside and there was no light in the room save that which came from a roaring coal fire blazing brightly up the chimney and illuminating the apartment in a curiously fantastic manner it sent out red shafts of light into dark corners as if to find out what was hidden there and then being disappointed would sink back into a dull sulky glow only to fall into a chaotic mass and blaze merrily up once more the apartment wherein the fire played these elfish tricks was furnished comfortably but the furniture had a somewhat dingy look the carpet was threadbare except under the table where there could be traced some vestiges of its original pattern a cottage piano was pushed into a corner slanting ways and beside it was a great untidy pile of music at one end of the room a desk covered with papers and immediately above it a shelf containing a small array of wellworn books near the desk stood an aggravatingly bright sideboard whereon were some glasses a jug of water and a halfempty bottle of whisky four or five lounging chairs of wickerwork were scattered about covered with rugs of wallaby fur whilst the walls and mantelpiece were almost covered with photographs mostly of women but here and there a male face showing the wellknown features of beethoven chopin and other famous musicians this somewhat incongruous apartment was a private sittingroom in an east melbourne boardinghouse and was at present in the occupation of ezra lazarus journalist ezra lazarus himself was seated at the piano playing snatches of music while on the hearthrug smoking a pipe lay a man propped up on his elbow with his head resting on his hand staring into the burning coals and listening to his friend playing ezra lazarus was a young man of medium height with a slender figure a pale face rather dreamy dark eyes and black hair and beard carefully trimmed he dressed neatly and in contrast to most of his race wore no jewellery why he had become a journalist no one knewhimself least of allas his tastes did not lie in the direction of newspaper work for having all the hebraic love of music he was an accomplished pianist as for the reststaid in his demeanour softspoken in his language and much given to solitary wanderings yet he was no misanthrope and those who knew him intimately found him a most charming companion full of quaint ideas and bookish lore but he was essentially a man of ideality and shrank from contact with the workaday world for such a nature as this a journalistic sphere was most unsuitable and he felt it to be so but having drifted into such a position he lacked the energy to extricate himself from his uncongenial employment and accepted his fate with oriental apathy recompensing himself in some measure by giving every spare moment to the study of music the man lying before the fire was the direct opposite of ezra both in appearance and temperament a tall sinewyfigured young fellow of sixandtwenty with restless keen grey eyes under stronglymarked eyebrows and a sensitive mouth almost hidden by a small fair moustache his nose was thin and straight with delicatelycut nostrils and his head was well set on his broad shoulders albeit he had a trick of throwing it back which gave him a somewhat haughty carriage he had a fair complexion with that reddishbrown hue which comes from constantly living in the open air and altogether looked like a man addicted to sport rather than to study this was keith stewart who having passed most of his life in gippsland and in wandering about australia generally had a year previously come down to melbourne with the laudable intention of devoting himself to literature that he was poor might be surmised from his shabby wellbrushed clothes and his face constantly wore that expression of watchfulness habitual to those who have to fight the world in their youth and be on their guard against everyone that two such dissimilar natures as these could find any reciprocity appears strange but curiously enough some undercurrent of sympathy had drawn them together from the first time they met jew and gentile musician and student different nationalities different trains of thought yet the mere fact that they could both live in an ideal world of their own creation heedless of the restless life which seethed around seemed to form a bond of concord between them and their mutual isolation drew them almost imperceptibly together keith had only been boarding in the house a week consequently ezra knew nothing about his friends life beyond the fact that he was poor and ambitious as stewart never volunteered any information about himself ezra with the delicacy of a sensitive nature shrank from forcing himself on his confidence the inexhaustible subjects of books and music a walk by the banks of the yarra or an occasional visit to the theatre had been so far the limit of their social companionship their inner selves were still unknown to each other to all however there comes a moment when the desire to unburden the mind to a sympathetic nature is strong and it was in such a moment that ezra lazarus first learned the past life of stewart on this dreary sunday night ezra let his fingers wander over the piano vaguely following his thoughts and the result was a queer mingling of melodiesnow a bizarre polonaise of chopin with its fantastic blending of patriotic joy and despairing pain then a rush of stormy chords preluding a spanish dance instinct with the amorous languor and fierce passion of the south outside the shrill wind could be heard sweeping past a sheet of rain would lash wildly against the windows and at intervals the musical thunder of the organ sounded from the adjacent church keith smoked away steadily and listened drowsily to the pleasant mingling of sounds until ezra began to play the traviata music with its feverish brilliancy and undercurrent of sadness then he suddenly started clenched his hand and taking his pipe from his mouth heaved an impatient sigh upon hearing which lazarus stopped playing and turned slowly round a link of memory he said in his soft voice referring to the music stewart replaced his pipe blew a thick wreath of smoke and sighed again yes he replied after a pause it recalls to mea woman ezra laughed half sadly half mockingly always the eternal feminine of george sand keith sat up crosslegged in front of the fire and shrugged his shoulders dont be cynical old chap he said glancing round im sick of hearing the incessant railing against womengood heavens are we men so pure ourselves that we can afford to cast stones against the sex to which our mothers and sisters belong i did not mean to be cynical replied ezra clasping his hands round one of his knees i only quoted sand because when a man is thinking it is generallya woman or a debtor a crimeor a sorrow interposed the other quickly we can ring the changes on all of them who is cynical now asked the jew with a smile not i denied keith emphatically drawing hard at his pipe or if i am it is only that thin veneer of cynicism under which we hide our natural feelings nowadays but the music took me back to the time when plancus was consulexactly twelve months ago bah plancus is consul still dont be downhearted my friend you are still in the pleasant city of prague pleasant that is as it may be i think it a very disagreeable city without money bohemianism is charming in novels but in real life it is generally a hunt after what murger calls that voracious animal the halfcrown and after women ah bah lais and phryne both charming but slightly improper not to say expensive take the other side of the shield said the jew gently lucretia andandby jove i cant recollect the name of any other virtuous woman who is the lady of the music my affianced wife retorted stewart curtly ah said ezra thoughtfully then we have a feeling in common i am also engaged stewart laughed gaily and we both think our ladyloves perfect he said lightly dulcinea is the fairest woman in the worldpoor don quixote mine is to me said ezra emphatically of course answered stewart with a smile i can picture her tall dark and stately an imperial daughter of judah with the beauty of bathsheba and the majesty of esther entirely wrong replied lazarus dryly she is neither tall dark nor stately but the exact oppositei take your meaning said keith composedly well my dulcinea is like the sketch i have givenbeautiful clever poor anda governess and you havent seen her for a year noa whole twelvemonthshe is up sandhurst way trying to hammer dates and the rule of three into the thick heads of five small brats and iwell im an unsuccessful literary man doing what is vulgarly known as a perish what made you take up writing asked lazarus what made me take up writing repeated stewart staring vaguely into the fire lord knowsdestiny i supposeive had a queer sort of life altogether i was born of poor but honest parents quite the orthodox style of thing isnt it are your parents alive dead laconically there was a pause of a few moments during which time keith was evidently deep in thought according to sir walter scott he observed at length every scotchman has a pedigree ive got one as long as the tail of a kite only not so useful id sell all my ancestors as readily as charles surface did his for a few pounds my people claim to be connected with the royal stewarts your name is spelt differently its spelt correctly retorted keith coolly in the good old scottish fashion as for the other its the french method acclimatised by mary stuart when she married the dauphin of france well now i know your pedigree what is the story of your life my lifeoh im like cannings knifegrinder story ive got none to tell my father and mother found royal descent was not bread and butter so they sold the paternal acres and came out to australia where i was born the gold fever was raging then but i suppose they inherited the bad luck of the stewarts for they did not make a penny then they started a farm in gippsland and ruined themselves my father died of a broken heart and my mother soon followed so i was left an orphan with next to nothing i wandered all over australia and did anything that turned up suppressing the family pride i took a situation in a sandhurst store kept by a man called proggins and there i met eugnie rainsford who as i told you taught the juvenile progginses i had a desultory sort of education from my father and having read a good deal i determined to take to literature inspired i suppose by the poetic melancholy of the australian bush i wrote poetry with the usual success i then went on the stage and found i wasnt a heavenborn genius by any means so i became a member of the staff of a small country paper wrote brilliant articles about the weather and crops varied by pasteandscissors work burned the midnight oil and wrote some articles which were accepted in melbourne so with the usual prudence of genius i threw up my billet and came down here to set the thames or rather the yarra on fire needless to remark i didnt succeed or i shouldnt be here so there is my history in a nutshell and miss rainsford oh i engaged myself to her before i left sandhurst said keith his face growing tender bless herthe letters she has written me have been my bulwark against despairah what a poor devil a man is in this world without a good womans love to comfort him are you doing anything now said ezra thoughtfully nothing im leading a handtomouth heretodaygonetomorrow existence im a vagabond on the face of the earth a modern cain bonnie prince charlie in exilethe infernal luck of my royal ancestors still sticks to me but ah bah shrugging his shoulders dont lets talk any more old chap we can resume the subject tomorrow meanwhile play me something im in a poetic mood and would like to build castles in the air ezra laughed and turning to the piano began to play one of henselts morceaux a pathetic dreamy melody which came stealing softly through the room and filled the soul of the young man with vague yearnings staring idly into the heart of the burning coals he saw amid the bluish flames and red glimmer of the fire a vision of the dear dead days of long agoshadows appeared the shadows of last year a glowing sunset bathing a wide plain in delicate crimson hues a white gate leading to a garden bright with flowers and over the gate the shadow of a beautiful woman stood talking to the shadow of a manhimself mnenosynesaddest of deitieswaved her wand and the shadows talked and when will you come back keith asked the girl shadow when i am a great man replied the other shadow proudly i am riding forth like poes knight in search of el dorado el dorado is far away returned the sweet voice of the girl it is the holy grail of wealth and can never be discovered i will find it replied the man shadow hopefully meanwhile you will wait and hope i will wait and hope replied the girl smiling sadly and the shadows parted the rain beat steadily against the panes the soft music stole through the room and stewart with idle gaze stared into the burning heart of the fire as if he expected to find there the el dorado of his dreams chapter ii keith meets with an adventure after a storm comes a calm so next morning the sun was shining brightly in the blue sky and the earth had that clean wholesome appearance always to be seen after heavy rains the high wind had dried the streets the drenched foliage of the trees in the fitzroy gardens looked fresh and green and there was a slight chilliness in the atmosphere which was highly invigorating indeed it was like a spring morning mildly inspiriting whilst all around there seemed to be a pleasant sense of newborn gladness quickening both animal and vegetable life after breakfast ezra who was going to the office of the penny whistle the paper for which he worked asked keith to walk into town with him and as the young man had nothing particular to do he gladly assented they strolled slowly through the gardens admiring the glistening green of the trees the white statues sharply accentuated against their emerald background and the vivid dashes of bright colour given by the few flowers then in bloom stewart appeared to have quite recovered from his megrims of the previous night and strolled gaily along every now and then inhaling a long breath of the keen air ezra who was watching him closely saw from his actions his intense appreciation of his surroundings and was satisfied that the young man possessed in a high degree that poetical instinct which has such an affinity with the joyousness or gloom of nature ah this is a morning when it is good to live said keith brightly i always envied the satyrs and dryades of heathendom with their intense animal enjoyment of naturenot sensuality but exuberant capability of enjoying a simple life like that with which hawthorn endowed donatallo suggested ezra poor donatallo said stewart with a sigh he is a delightful illustration of the proverb where ignorance is blisshe was happy till he lovedso was undine till she obtained a soul you seem to have read a great deal observed lazarus looking at him oh faith my reading has been somewhat desultory replied stewart carelessly all is fish that comes to my net and the result is a queer jumble of information but let us leave this pleasant gossiping and come down to this matteroffact world how do you think i can better my position i hardly know as yet replied the jew thoughtfully caressing his beard but if you want immediate work i can put you in the way of obtaining employment literary work unfortunately noa clerkship in aawell an office ugh i hate the idea of being cribbed and confined in an office its such an artificial existence however beggars cant be choosers so tell me all about it my father wants a clerk said ezra deliberately and if i recommended you i think you could get the position humph and what is your fathers occupation not a very aristocratic onea pawnbroker keith stopped short and looked at his companion in surprise i cant imagine you being the son of a pawnbroker he said in a puzzled tone why not asked ezra serenely i must be the son of some one yes but a pawnbroker its so horribly unpoetical your father ought to have been a man of lettersof vague speculations and abstruse theoriesa modern rabbi judah holding disputations about the talmud lazarus shrugged his shoulders and walked slowly onward followed by his companion my dear lad the days of maimonides are past and we are essentially a moneymaking race the curse which jehovah pronounced on the jews was the same as that of midasthey turn everything they touch into gold a pleasant enough punishment midas did not find it so but to resumemy father jacob lazarus has his shop in russell street so i will speak to him today and if he is agreeable i will take you with me tomorrow ive no doubt youll get the billet but the wages will be small at all events they will keep body and soul together till i find my el dorado you refer to literary fame i suppose how did you first take to writing i think you asked me that question last night said keith smiling and i told you i couldnt explain like pope i lisped in numbers and the numbers came ive no doubt they were sufficiently bad im sure i dont know why all authors begin with verse perhaps its because rhymes are so easyfountain suggests mountain and dove is invariably followed by love have you had any articles accepted since your arrival in melbourne one or two but generally speaking no one acknowledges that a possible shakespeare or dickens is embodied in me ive sent plays to managers which have been declined on the plea that all plays come from london i have seen editors and have been told there was no room on the presspublishers have seen me and pointed out that a colonial novel means ruinationencouraging for the future brainworkers of australia isnt it we must all serve our apprenticeship answered lazarus quietly the longest lane has a turning no doubt but my particular lane seems devilish long ezra laughed and they walked down collins street watching the crowd of people hurrying along to business the cabs darting here and there and the cable tramcars sliding smoothly along pausing a moment near the scotch church they heard a street organ playing a bright melody what tune is that asked keith as they resumed their walk sounds awfully pretty song from prince carnival replied ezra referring to an opera then running at the bonbon theatre caprice sings it oh caprice id like to see that opera said keith you might take me to the theatre tonight to see it very well assented ezra you will like capriceshe is very charming and if rumour speaks truly very wicked added to which she is the besthearted woman in the world finished the jew dryly what a contradiction laughed stewart women are always contradictorytis a privilege of the sex and one they take full advantage of this airy badinage came to an end somewhat abruptly for just as they arrived near the victoria coffee palace they were startled by the shriek of a woman on the other side of the street a gaudilydressed girl was crying and wringing her hands while a child of about seven years of age was standing paralysed with fear directly in the way of a tramcar that came rushing down the incline the two men stood horrorstruck at what seemed to be the inevitable death of the child for though the driver put on the brakes the speed was too great and destruction appeared inevitable suddenly keith seemed to recover the use of his limbs and with a sudden spring bounded forward and tore the child off the fatal track himself falling together with the child to the ground he was not a moment too soon for hardly had he fallen before the car at a slower speed rolled past and ultimately came to a standstill at the foot of the incline stewart arose to his feet considerably shaken his clothes torn and covered with mud and a painful feeling in the arm on which he had fallen ezra crossed over to him and the rescued child was standing on the footpath in the grasp of the gaudilydressed girl who spoke volubly regardless of the crowd of people standing by the conductor of the car came to inquire into the affair and having found that no one was hurt retired and the tram was soon sliding down the street the crowd dispersed gradually until only the child ezra keith and the shrillvoiced girl were left oh gracious good eavens said this young lady who appeared to be a nursemaid and spoke rapidly without any stops to think as you should have bin nearly squashed by that ingine and all comin of runnin out into the road an taking no notice of me as was postin a letter in the pillarbox not seeing anythin thro want of eyes at the back of me ead the child a quaint thinfaced little girl with dark eyes and glorious reddishcoloured hair took no notice of this outburst but pulled keiths coat to attract his attention thank you man she said in a thin reedy voice i will tell mumsey and she will say nice things to you and i will give you a kiss keith was touched in his soft heart by this nave appeal and bending down kissed the pale little face presented to him much to the alarm of the nursemaid who lifted up her hands in horror oh gracious good eavens she piped shrilly as to what your mar will say miss megs i dont know akissin strange gents in the hopen street not but what he dont deserve it adragin you from under the ingine as oughtnt to be let run to spile hold your tongue bliggings said ezra sharply you ought to look more carefully after meg or shell be killed some day oh gracious and good eavens cried bliggings sniffing if it aint mr lazarhouse and beggin your pardon sir it aint my fault as is well known to you as children will ookit unbeknownt to the most wary there there said lazarus bending down to kiss meg least said soonest mended thanks to my friend here its no worse which he ought to git a meddler asserted miss bliggings on whose feminine heart keiths handsome face had made an impression but gracious and good eavens they only gives em for drowndin though i never lets miss megs go near water ingines bein unexpected in their actions and not to be counted on in their movins goodbye meg said lazarus cutting short bliggings in despair tell your mamma ill call and see her about this and bring the man said meg glancing at keith yes and bring the man repeated ezra upon which meg being satisfied made a quaintlike curtsey to both men and was going away when she suddenly came back and pulling keiths coat till he bent down put her arms round his neck and kissed him mumsey will be nice she murmured and then trotted quietly off with bliggings who kept expressing her opinion that oh gracious good eavens she was red up to her eyes at such conduct a somewhat unnecessary assertion seeing her complexion was permanently the colour of beetroot come into lanes hotel and have a glass of brandy said ezra when meg and her attendant had disappeared you need it after the shaking you have had what is the childs name asked keith as he went into the bar you seem to know her ezra laughed softly and ordered a glass of brandy for his friend a curious way fate has of working he said rather irrelevantly she has played into your hands today for that child is kitty marchursts better known as caprice i didnt know she had a child said keith who is the father is she married no she is not married as to the father its a long story ill tell you all about it some day meanwhile you have done her a service she will never forget much good it will be to me said keith disbelievingly youve exactly hit it replied ezra composedly she can do you a great deal of good seeing that she is the reigning favourite of the stage at present i will introduce you to her tonight and then well ezra shrugged his shoulders and replied slowly the best friend an ambitious man can have is a clever woman a wiser man than i made that remark chapter iii prince carnival the bonbon was the smallest prettiest and most luxurious theatre in melbourne and was exclusively devoted to farcical comedy burlesque and operabouffe the latter class of entertainment being now the attraction there was no pit the circle and boxes being raised but little above the level of the stalls the decorations were pink white and gold the seats being covered with pale rosecoloured plush with curtains and hangings to match while the electric lights shining through pink globes gave quite a warm glow to the theatre the dome was decorated with allegorical figures representing momus the god of laughter and apollo the god of music while all round the walls were exquisitelypainted medallions of scenes from celebrated operas and burlesques the proscenium was a broad frame of dullish gold the curtain of roseate plush and on either side of the stage were lifesize statues of offenbach and planch in white marble altogether a charming theatre more like a cosy drawingroom than a place of public entertainment at the entrance was a high flight of white marble stairs leading to a wide corridor the walls of which were hidden by enormous mirrors and at intervals stood white marble statues of the greek divinities holding aloft electric lights on the one side was the smokingrooma luxurious loungeand on the other a refreshment bar all glass and glitter which was crowded between the acts by the thirsty patrons of the play ezra and keith arrived about nine oclock just as the first act of prince carnival was over and finding the salon tolerably full lazarus sat down near one of the small marbletopped tables and lighting his cigarette proceeded to point out to keith all the notabilities present the first to whom he called stewarts attention was a group of three one a tall portlylooking man with a red cleanshaven face and black hair was irreproachably attired in evening dress and chatted to a fairhaired youth with a supercilious smile and a short baldheaded old gentleman you see those three said ezra indicating the group the dark man of the ponderous samuel johnson type is ted mortimer the lessee of the theatre the idiot with the eyeglass is lord santon who has come out from london to see us barbarians and the apoplectic party with the bald head is no less a personage than mr columbus wilks the great globetrotter who is going to write a book about australia and new zealand that will take him some time observed keith with a smile not at all said lazarus coolly he will run through the whole of australasia in a few weeks be the guest of the governors of the different colonies and then give his impressions of our government politics trade amusements and scenery in a series of brilliant articles whose truth and accuracy will be quite in accordance with the time which he has taken to collect his materials but he cannot judge of things so rapidly of course not but he will view everything through the rosecoloured spectacles of champagne and adulation so his book will depict our land as a kind of nineteenthcentury utopia and lord santon an hereditary legislator who is being fted for his title and will go back to his ancestral halls with the firm conviction that we are a kindhearted race ofsavages you are severe said keith in an amused tone you ought to give a lecture entitled men i have noticed it would certainly draw yes all the women not the men they dont care for hearing remarks about themselves but there is the bell for the rising of the curtain so we had better go to our seats they left the now empty salon and went into the dress circle which holds the same rank in the colonies as the stalls do in the london theatres though the house was crowded they succeeded in getting excellent seats being in fact those always reserved for the critics of the penny whistle the orchestra played a lively waltz to which the gods in the gallery kept time and then the curtain drew up on a charming scene representing a square in rome prince carnival was one of those frivolous french operas with a slightly naughty plot witty dialogue brilliant music and plenty of opportunity for gay dresses and picturesque scenery the principals and chorus consisted mostly of girls with just a sprinkling of men so that their deeper voices might balance the shrillness of those of the women of the plot the least said the better as it was merely a string of intrigues connected by piquant couplets and sparkling choruses with occasional ballets intervening as far as keith could gather it had something to do with the adventures of the quack cagliostra in rome who was the comic man of the play and figured in various disguises the most successful being that of a prominent politician cagliostra tries to gain the affections of a young girl beloved by a mountebank called prince carnival who thwarts him all through the play the second act was the carnival at rome and a crowd of masquers were singing a riotous chorus and pelting one another with flowers suddenly during a lull in this fantastic medley a high clear voice was heard executing a brilliant shake and immediately afterwards caprice bounded gaily on to the stage singing a melodious waltz song to which the masquers moved in measured time she was dressed in a harlequin costume a mask on her face a fools baton in her hand and innumerable silver bells hanging from her cap and dress which jingled incessantly as she danced but what attracted keiths attention were the diamonds she woreseveral stars and a necklace she seemed one splendid blaze of jewels and his eyes ached watching their flash and glitter during the rapid gyrations of her restless figure are those paste jewels he asked ezra in a whisper paste echoed that young man with a soft satirical laugh caprice wear paste jewels ask the men shes ruined where all their thousands wentwhere all their lands horses shares salaries disappeared to paste bah my dear fellow you dont know the number of ruined homes and broken hearts those diamonds represent the act proceeded the dialogue scintillating with wit and the choruses becoming more riotous intrigue followed after intrigue and situation after situation in all of which caprice was the central figure until the climax was reached in a wild bizarre chorus in which she danced a vigorous cancan with cagliostra and finished by bounding on his shoulders to form the tableau as the curtain fell amid the enthusiastic applause of the audience ezra and stewart went out into the smokingroom to light their cigarettes and heard on all sides eulogies of caprice shed make her fortune on the london stage said santon to mortimer got such a lot of the devil in herehby jove why the deuce dont she show in town aha replied mortimer shrewdly im not going to let her go if i can help it dont tempt away my only ewe lamb when youve got so many flocks of your own she doesnt look much like a lamb said columbus wilks dryly then she doesnt belie her looks retorted mortimer coolly my dear sir shes got the temper of a fiend but shes such a favourite that i put up with her tantrums for the sake of the cash while this conversation was going on ezra and his friend were smoking quietly in a corner of the room chatting about the opera when the jew suddenly drew keiths attention to a tall man talking to a friend in a confidential manner he had a thin sharplooking face keen blue eyes and fair hair and beard that gentleman said lazarus could probably tell you something about those diamonds he is an american called hiram jackson fenton manager of the neversaydie life insurance company rumourwhich is true in this case contrary to its usual customsays he is caprices latest fancy he must have a lot of money to satisfy her whims said keith looking at the american money ezra shrugged his shoulders he hasnt much actual cash for he lives far above his income however with a little judicious dabbling in the share market and an occasional help from the children of israel he manages to get along all right our friend caprice will ruin him shortly and then hell return to the great republic i presumegood riddance of bad rubbish for australia and who is that colourlesslooking little man who has just come up he is rather washed out isnt he said ezra critically that is his assistant manager evan malton for some inexplicable reason they are inseparable oh and is mr malton also smitten with caprice very badlymore shame to him as hes only been married for twelve monthshe neglects his young wife and dances attendance at the heels of his divinity doesnt hiram jwhats his name object not at all you see theyre both mixed up in speculation and work together for their mutual benefit malton is the lazarusi dont mean myselfwho picks up the crumbs of love that fall from mr dives fentons table it cant last long said keith in disgust it will last till malton gets rid of fenton or fenton gets the better of maltonthen therell be a row and the weakest will go to the wall tell me whom do you think will win i should say fenton replied keith glancing from the effeminate countenance of malton to the shrewd powerful face of the american exactly he is i fancy the stronger villain of the two villain yes i call any man a villain who neglects his wife for the sake of a lightolove as for fenton he is the most unscrupulous man i know you seem to be pretty well acquainted with the scandal of melbourne society said stewart as they went back to their seats of course it is my duty the press is ubiquitous but tell me your opinion of caprice judging by her acting tonight shes a devil wait till the end of this act and youll swear shes an angel which will be correct bothshes a mixture the curtain again drew up amid the shuffling of the audience settling themselves in their places and represented a fte in the gardens of cagliostras palace brilliant with coloured lights and fantasticallydressed people according to the story cagliostra has obtained possession of his prize and woos her successfully when prince carnival enters and sings a ballad so long ago in the hope of touching the heart of his false love caprice dressed in a tightfitting costume of silk and velvet which showed off her beautiful figure to perfection stood in the centre of the stage with a sad smile and sang the waltzrefrain of the song with great feeling for it was long ago love that time of joy and woe love yet still that heart of thine is mine dear love is mine she gave to the jingling words a touch of pathos which was exquisitely beautiful i believe she feels what she sings whispered keith if you knew her story you would scarcely wonder at that said ezra bitterly the song was redemanded but caprice refused to respond and the clamour still continuing she shrugged her shoulders and walked coolly up the stage shes in a temper tonight said mortimer to santon they can applaud till theyre black in the face but devil an answer theyll get from her the jade she isnt called caprice for nothing and so it happened for the audience finding she would not gratify them subsided into a sulky silence and caprice went coolly on with the dialogue cagliostra repentant surrenders the girl to prince carnival and the opera ended with a repetition of the galop chorus wherein keith saw the sadeyed woman of a few moments before once more a mocking jibing fiend dancing and singing with a reckless abandon that halffascinated and halfdisgusted him what a contradiction said keith as they left the theatre one moment all tears the next all laughter with a spice of the devil in both replied ezra cynically she is the sphinx woman of heineher lips caress while her claws wound they had a drink and a smoke together after which they went round to the stagedoor as ezra in pursuance of improving keiths fortunes was anxious to introduce him to caprice lazarus appeared to be wellknown to the doorkeeper for after a few words with him they were admitted to the mysterious region behind the scenes caprice wrapped up in a heavy fur cloak was standing on the stage talking to fenton all around was comparatively quiet as the sceneshifters having ended their duties for the night had left the theatre stewart could hardly believe that the little goldenhaired woman he saw before him was the brilliant being of the previous hour she looked so pale and weary but soon another side of her versatile nature showed itself for fenton saying something to displease her she rebuked him sharply and turned her back on the discomfited american in doing so she caught sight of lazarus and ran quickly towards him with outstretched hand my dear mr lazarus she said rapidly im so glad to see you meg told me all about her accident today and how narrowly she escaped death good god if i had lost her but the gentleman who saved herwhere is he he is here said lazarus indicating keith who stood blushing and confused before this divinity of the stage in another moment with a sudden impulse she was by his side holding his two hands in her own you have done what i can never repay she said rapidly in a low voice saved my childs life and you will not find me ungrateful words are idle but if actions can prove gratitude you may command me i hope the young lady is all right stammered keith as she dropped his hands oh yes rather shaken but quite well answered caprice in a relieved tone dear me how careless i am let me introduce you to these gentlemenmr fenton mr malton and last but not least mr mortimer the three gentlemen bowed coldly fenton in particular eyeing keith in a supercilious manner which made him blush with rage as he thought it was owing to his shabby clothes is my carriage there said caprice in reply to a speech of maltons oh then i may as well go goodnight everybody mr stewart will you give me your arm and she walked off with the delighted keith leaving fenton and malton transfixed with rage while mortimer and ezra looked on chuckling caprice talked brightly to her new friend till he placed her in her brougham then suddenly became grave come down and have supper with me on sunday fortnight she said leaning out of the window mr lazarus will be your guide goodbye at present giving him her gloved hand god bless you for saving my child the carriage drove off but not before keith had seen that tears were falling down her face whereat he marvelled at this strange nature and stood looking after the carriage shes not as bad as they say he said aloud ezra who was just behind him laughed aloud i knew youd say she was an angel chapter iv lazarus it was a very little shop of squat appearance as if the upper storey had gradually crushed down the lower three gilt balls dangling in midair over the wide door indicated the calling of the owner and in order that there should be no mistake the dusty rainstreaked windows displayed the legend lazarus pawnbroker in blistered golden letters there were three windows in the upper storey and these being innocent of blinds or curtains with the addition of one or two panes being broken gave the top of the house a somewhat dismantled look the lower windows however made up for the blankness of the upper ones being full of marvels and behind their dingy glass could be seen innumerable articles representing the battered wrecks of former prosperity gold and silver watches with little parchment labels attached setting forth their value displayed themselves in a tempting row and their chains were gracefully festooned between them intermixed with strings of red coral oldfashioned lockets and bracelets of jet and amber wornout silver teapots were placed dismally at the back in company with cracked cups and saucers of apparently rare old worcester and svres china dingy velvet trays containing innumerable coins and medals of every description antique jewellery of a mode long since out of date were incongruously mingled with revolvers guns spoons cruets and japanned trays decorated with sprawling golden dragons richlychased indian daggers tarnished silver mugs in company with deadlylooking american bowie knives banknotes of long since insolvent banks were displayed as curiosities while a childs rattle lay next to a book of beauty from out whose pages looked forth simpering faces of the time of dorsay and lady blessington and over all this queer heterogeneous mixture the dust lay thick and grey as if trying for very pity to hide these remnants of past splendours and ruined lives the shop was broad lowroofed and shallow with a choky atmosphere of dust through which the golden sunlight slanted in heavy solidlooking beams on the one side there was a row of little partitions like bathingboxes designed to secure secrecy to those who transacted business with mr lazarus and on the other long rows of old clothes were hanging up against the wall looking like the phantoms of their former owners at the back a door covered with faded green baize and decorated with brassheaded nails gave admittance to the private office of the presiding genius of the place the whole appearance of the shop was gloomy in the extreme and the floor being covered with boxes and bundles with a little clearing here and there it was naturally rather embarrassing to strangers especially as the bright sunlight outside prevented them seeing an inch before their noses when they first entered the dismal den wherein mr lazarus sat like a spider waiting for unwary flies in one of the bathing machines aforesaid a large redfaced woman with a gruff voice and a strong odour of gin was trying to conclude a bargain with a small whitefaced jewish youth whose black beady eyes were scornfully examining a dilapidated teapot which the gruff lady asserted was silver and which the jewish youth emphatically declared was not the gruff female who answered to the name of tibsey grew wrathful at this opposition and prepared to do battle old uns knows more nor youngers she growled in an angry tone taint by the sauce of babes and sucklers as im goin to be teached old your row squeaked isaiah that being the shrill boys name five bob and dear at

isaiah in a high voice like a steam whistle to which mrs tibsey replied in a rolling bass a duet which grew wilder and wilder till the sudden opening of the green baize door reduced them both to silence an old man appearedsuch a little old manvery much bent and dressed in a greasy old ulster which covered him right down to his ragged carpet slippers he had white hair and beard piercing black eyes under shaggy white eyebrows sharplycut features and a complexion like dirty parchment seared all over with innumerable lines you again he said in a feeble jewish voice oh you devilyouyou here a fit of coughing seized him and he contented himself with glaring at mrs tibsey upon which he was immediately confronted by that indomitable female who seized the teapot and shook it in his face five bob she shrieked five bob for this too muchfar too much said lazarus in dismay say four my dear four ten i want ten said mrs tibsey no no four you say ten but you mean four say six four then take it

coming into collision with ezra and keith who were just entering a whirlwind in petticoats said keith startled by this ragged apparition askin your parding gents both said mrs tibsey dropping a very shaky curtsey but a young limb hinsides bin puttin my back hup like the wrigglin heel e hare and if youre goin to pop anythink dont let it be a silver teapot cause old sating hinside is the cuss of orphens and widders and having relieved her mind mrs tibsey flounced indignantly away to refresh herself with her favourite beverage complimentary to your parent observed keith as they entered the shop oh theyre much worse sometimes said ezra complacently isaiah wheres my father in is room replied isaiah resuming the reading of a sporting newspaper ezra opened the green baize door without knocking and entered followed by keith a small square room even dingier than the shop at one side a truckle bed pushed up against the wall and next to it a large iron safe a rusty grate with a starvedlooking fire had an old battered kettle simmering on its hob at the back a square dirtypaned window through which the light fell on a small table covered with greasy green cloth and piled up with papers at this table sat old lazarus mumbling over some figures he looked up suddenly when the young men entered and cackled a greeting to his son after which effort he was seized with a violent fit of coughing which seemed to shake him to pieces the paroxysm having passed he began to talk in his feeble jewish voice he he my dear looking sharply at keith is this the young man you spoke of

old man cautiously im quite agreeable replied keith complacently hoping that by the time his trial is over he would be on the staff of some paper what are the hours nine my dear said lazarus stroking his beard nine till six with halfanhour for something to eat in the daya bun and a cup of coffeedont be extravagant i cant very well be on such a salary replied stewart well mr lazarus as its all

and took keiths arm come along he said ive got an engagement good boy good boy muttered his parent nodding his head make money my dear make here another fit of coughing interrupted him and ezra hurried keith away faugh said ezra lifting up his hat when they were in the street how i hate the miasma of that place its like the upas tree and kills all who come within its circle do you think your father knows caprice asked keith as they walked down bourke street cant tell you answered lazarus coolly i shouldnt be surprisedhe knows half the women in melbourne when a spendthrift wants money he goes to my father when a woman is in trouble she goes there also in spite of her lovers caprice is such an extravagant woman that ive no doubt shes had dealings with my father if the secret life of lazarus the pawnbroker were only written it would be very interesting i assure you im glad i got the place said keith thoughtfully it isnt much but will keep me alive till i get on my feet you are sure to drop into a newspaper appointment replied ezra and of course i will do my best for you youre very good answered keith gratefully ha ha what queer tricks the jade fortune plays us i come to melbourne full of poetic dreams and find my fate in a pawnbrokers officeit isnt romantic but its bread and butter youre not the first poet who has gone to the pawnbroker i expect im the first that ever went on such good terms retorted keith shrewdly chapter v a womans appeal according to some writer human beings are moulded by circumstances and truly kitty marchurst better known as caprice was an excellent illustration of this remark the daughter of a ballarat clergyman she was a charming and pureminded girl and would doubtless have married and become a happy woman but for the intervention of circumstances in the form of m gaston vandeloup this gentleman an exconvict and a brilliant and fascinating scoundrel ruined the simple confiding girl and left her to starve in the streets of melbourne from this terrible fate however she was rescued by mrs villiers who had known her as a child and it seemed as though she would once more be happy when circumstances again intervened and through her connection with a poisoning case she was again thrown on the world weary of existence she was about to drown herself in the yarra when vandeloup met her and tried to push her in with a sudden craving for life she struggled with him and he being weak for want of food fell in and was drowned while the unhappy girl fled away she knew not whither a blind instinct led her to the home for fallen women founded by a miss rawlins who had herself been an unfortunate and here for a time the weary brokenhearted woman found rest a child of which vandeloup was the father came to cheer her loneliness and she called the little one margaret hoping it would comfort her in the future but the seeds of evil implanted in her breast by vandeloup began to bear fruit and with returning health came a craving for excitement she grew weary of the narrow ascetic life she was leadingfor young blood bounded through her veinsand she was still beautiful and brilliant so much against the wishes of the matron of the institution she left the place and returned to the stage the wopples family with whom she had previously acted had gone to america and she was alone in the world without a single friend she called herself caprice for her real name and history were too notorious for such a public career as she had chosen all avoided her and this worked her ruin had one door been open to herhad one kind hand been stretched forth to save hershe might have redeemed the past but the selfrighteous pharisees of the world condemned her and in despair she determined to defy the world by giving it back scorn for scorn it was a terribly hard and dreary life she led at firstno friends very little money and a child to support the future looked black enough before her but she determined to succeed and fortune at length favoured her she was playing a minor part in a christmas burlesque when the lady who acted the principal character suddenly fell ill and kitty had to take her place at a very short notice she however acquitted herself so well that with one bound she became a popular favourite and the star still continuing ill for the rest of the run of the piece she was able to consolidate the favourable impression she had made she awoke to find herself famous and played part after part in burlesque and modern comedy always with great success in a word she became the fashion and found herself both rich and famous ted mortimer the manager of the bonbon theatre persuaded her to try operabouffe and she made her first appearance in the grand duchess with complete success she followed up her triumph by playing the title rles in girofl girofla la perichole and boccaccio scoring brilliantly each time and now she had created the part of prince carnival which proved to be her greatest success night after night the bonbon was crowded and the opera had a long and successful run while kitty now at the height of her fame set herself to work to accomplish her revenge on the world she hated women for the way they had scorned her and she detested men for the free and easy manner in which they approached her so she made up her mind to ruin all she could and succeeded admirably one after another not only the gilded youth of melbourne but staid sober men became entangled in her meshes and many a man lived to curse the hour he first met kitty marchurst her house at toorak was furnished like a palace and her dresses jewels horses and extravagances formed a fruitful topic of conversation in clubs and drawingrooms she flung away thousands of pounds in the most reckless manner and as soon as she had ruined one man took up with another and turned her back on the poor one with a cynical sneer her greatest delight was to take away other womens husbands and many happy homes had she broken up by her wiles and fascinations consequently she was hated and feared by all the women in melbourne and was wrathfully denounced as a base adventuress without one redeeming feature they were wrong she loved her child kitty simply idolised meg and was always in terror lest she should lose her consequently when she heard how keith had rescued her child from a terrible death her gratitude knew no bounds she heard of the young mans ambitions from ezra and determined to help him as far as it lay in her power thus for the first time for many years her conduct was actuated by a kindly feeling the drawingroom in kittys house at toorak was a large lofty apartment furnished in a most luxurious style rich carpets low lounging chairs innumerable rugs and heavy velvet curtains a magnificent grand piano great masses of tropical foliage in fantasticallycoloured jars priceless cabinets of china and costly wellselected pictures one of her lovers a rich squatter had furnished it for her when he had lost all his money and found her cold and cruel he went off to the wilds of south america to try and forget her there were three french windows at the end of the room which led out on to a broad verandah and beyond was the lawn girdled by laurels kitty sat at a writingdesk reading letters and the morning sun shining through the window made a halo round her golden head no one who saw her beautiful childish face and sad blue eyes would have dreamed how cruel and relentless a soul lay beneath that fair exterior at her feet sat meg dressed in a sagegreen frock with her auburn curls falling over her face playing with a box of bricks and every now and then her mother would steal an affectionate glance at her curiously enough kitty was reading a letter from the very man who had given her the house and who was now dying in a pauper hospital in san francisco i forgive you freely he wrote but ah kitty you might have feigned a love you did not feel if only to spare me the degradation of dying a pauper alone and without friends the womans face grew dark as she read these pitiful words and crushing up the letter in her hands she threw it into the wastepaper basket with a cynical sneer bah she muttered contemptuously does he think to impose on me with such tricks feign a love yes kiss and caress him to gratify his vanity did i not give him fair warning of the end and now he whimpers about mercymercy from me to himpshaw let him die and go to his pauper grave ill not shed a tear and she laughed harshly at this moment meg who had been building two edifices of bricks began to talk to herself this said meg putting the top brick on one building is the house of good but the other is the house of sin mumsey raising her eyes which house would you like to live in in the house of good dear said kitty in a tremulous voice touched by the artless question of the child come to mumsey darling and tell her what you have been doing meg nothing loath accepted this invitation and climbing up on her mothers knee threw her arms round kittys neck i had some bread and milk she said confidentially then i went and saw my guinea pigs dottyyou know mumsey the one with the long hairoh he squeakedhe did squeak i think he was hungry have you been a good little girl good echoed meg doubtfully well not very good i was cross with bliggings she put soap into my eyes its naughty to be cross darling said her mother smoothing the childs hair what makes you naughty mother said meg nodding her head sagely its the wicked spirit kitty laughed and kissing the child drew her closer to her mumsey yes darling i should like to give the man who stopped the wheels a present what would you like to give him my precious this took some consideration and meg puckered up her small face into a frown i think she decided at length the man would like a knife a knife cuts love meg not if you get a penny for it asserted meg wisely bliggings told me let me get a knife for the man mumsey very well dear said kitty smiling the man will then know my little daughter has a kind heart meg is a very good girl asserted that small personage gravely and climbing down off her mothers knee she began to play with the bricks while kitty went on with her correspondence the next letter evidently did not give kitty much satisfaction judging by the frown on her face she had written to hiram j fenton asking for some money and he had curtly refused to give her any more she tore up the letter threw it into the wastepaper basket and smiled sardonically you wont wont you she muttered angrily very well my friend there are plenty of others to give me money if you wont at this moment there came a ring at the door and shortly after the servant entered with a card kitty took it carelessly and then started mrs malton she muttered in a puzzled tone evan maltons wife what does she want i wonder i thought i was too wicked for virtue to call on meit appears im not she glanced at the card again then made up her mind show the lady in she said calmly and when the servant disappeared she called meg mumseys sweetheart must go away for a few minutes what for asked mumseys sweetheart setting her small mouth mumsey has to see a lady on business meg collected the bricks in a pinafore and walked off to the french window when she turned meg will play outside she said shaking her curls and will come in when mumsey calls scarcely had meg vanished when the servant threw open the door and announced mrs malton a tall slender girl entered the room quickly and as the door closed behind paused a moment and looked steadily at kitty through her thick veil mrs malton said kitty interrogatively the visitor bowed and throwing back her veil displayed a face of great beauty but she had a restless pitiful look in her eyes and occasionally she moistened her dry lips with her tongue will you take a seat said the actress politely taking in at a glance the beautiful tired face and quiet dark costume of her visitor thank you replied mrs malton in a low clear voice and sat down in the chair indicated by her hostess nervously clasping and unclasping her hands over the ivory handle of her umbrella she glanced at kitty again in a shrinking kind of manner then with a sudden effort burst out quickly i have calledi have called to see you about mymy husband kittys lip curled and she resumed her seat with an enigmatical smile yes what about him cannot you guess said mrs malton imploringly kitty shook her head in a supercilious manner i am at a loss to understand the reason of your visit she said in a cold measured manner i am evan maltons wife said the other rapidly we have only been married a yearandand we have one child i presume you did not call to inform me of your domestic affairs replied kitty mercilessly he was so fond of mewe loved one another devotedly tilltill till he met me i suppose said kitty coolly throwing herself back with an amused laugh ive heard that complaint

love my husband and you have parted usoh dodogive him back to me my dear mrs malton replied the actress coldly i do not encourage him i assure you hes a bore and i detest bores but he loves youhe loves youhe worships the ground you tread on a waste of good material for his devotion will never be rewarded then you dont love him said mrs malton breathlessly kitty rose to her feet and laughed bitterly love himlove any one she muttered with a choking cry i hate the whole lot of them do you think i care for their flattery their kisses their protestationsbah i know the value of such things lovei hate the word yet my husband comes here said the other timidly kitty turned on her fiercely can i help that is it the candles fault that the moths are attracted i dont ask your husband to come if he finds in me what he misses in you it is your fault not mineyour errand is useless i cannot help you she turned to go but the young woman sprang forward and caught her dress you shall not goyou shall not she almost shrieked you and fenton are dragging us both to perdition he has ruined himself for your sake and his friendgod help himhis friend has insulted me with words of love am i the guardian of your virtue said kitty pitilessly mrs malton stood wringing her hands oh god have you no pity i am a woman like yourselfmy husband should protect me but he leaves me for youand in a whisper you dont know allhe has given you presents rich presents and to do so has committed a crime a crime hush hush glancing fearfully around not so loudnot so loudyes he has embezzled money thousands of pounds for your sake kitty gave a cry and grasped at a chair for support iidid notnot ask him for his presents no but it was for your sakeyour sake you must help him i laughed kitty mockingly help him help himhelp any man my good woman if he went into the prisoners dock tomorrow i would not lift one finger to save him mrs malton fell on her knees oh my god dont talk like that she cried wildly you will ruin himyou will ruin him kitty swept round with a cold glitter like steel in her eyes yes it is my business to ruin men when i was poor and anxious to lead a good life any outstretched hand might have saved me but no i was a pariah and outcastthey closed their doors against me i asked for bread they gave me a stonethey made of me a scourge for their own evil doingthis

motherso am i you love your childi love mine yet you would make my innocent child suffer for its fathers crime oh if you have any feelings of a mother spare the father for the sake of the child kitty stood irresolute while the woman at her feet burst into wild and passionate weeping at this moment meg entered the room by the window and paused for a moment mumsey she said why does the lady cry kitty would have interposed but mrs malton stretched out her hands to meg with a quiet indrawing of her breath i am crying for my little girl is she dead asked meg coming to the kneeling woman and touching her shoulder poor ladypoor poor lady kitty could contain herself no longer with a sudden impulse she bent down and raised the weeping woman i will do what i can she said huskily and sank into a chair thank god cried mrs malton advancing but kitty waved her off while meg stood looking from one to the other in amazement go go mrs malton bent down and kissed her hand may god be merciful to you as you have been to me and without another word she departed mumsey said meg trying to take her mothers hands from her face were you cross to the lady no darling no replied kitty drawing meg close to her mother was kind to the lady because of her little girl good mumsey dear mumsey meg loves you and she put her arms round kittys neck while the poor woman leaned her aching head against the innocent breast of her child and burst into tears chapter vi the annoyance of hiram j fenton it is a curious fact that melbourne has in its social and business aspects a strong leaven of americanism and visitors from the great republic find themselves quite at home in the metropolis of the south there are the same bold speculative qualities the same restless pursuit of pleasure and the same rapidity and promptness of action which characterises the citizen of san francisco or new york consequently there are many americans to be found in a city so congenial to their tastes and of these hiram j fenton was one he had come over from the states as the agent of a drygoods firm and travelling all through the australasian colonies soon saw the enormous capabilities of wealth that lay before him gifted with a ready tongue and a persuasive manner he interested several opulent victorians in a scheme for floating a life insurance company a prospectus was drawn up which promised incalculable wealth to those who would take shares and by means of mr fentons brilliant command of words and skilful manipulation of figures the neversaydie insurance company soon became an accomplished fact a handsome suite of offices was taken in collins street a large staff of clerks engaged a genial medical man whose smile itself was a recommendation remained on the premises to examine intending policyholders and the emissaries of the company went to the four quarters of the globe to trumpet forth the praises of the affair and persuade people to insure their lives the company prospered a handsome dividend was soon declared and thanks to his yankee sharpness mr fenton now found himself occupying the enviable position of manager with a large salary he was a handsome man in a bold sensual way with a certain dash and swagger about him which impressed strangers favourably but a physiognomist would have mistrusted his too ready tongue and the keen glance of his eye there is no greater mistake than to suppose a villain cannot meet an honest eye for as a matter of fact a successful villain having his nerves under admirable control can stare any one out of countenance and the keen rapid glance can take in at once the weak points of a stranger mr fenton occupied pleasant apartments went into society a great deal and altogether was a very popular man cold calculating and farseeing as he was he had yet a weak spot in his character and this was extreme partiality for the female sex any woman provided she was pretty could twist him round her finger and as kitty marchurst now had him in her toils she took full advantage of his infatuation there was a certain amount of notoriety in being the lover of the now famous caprice but fenton had to pay pretty dearly for his position kitty spent his money like water and when he ventured to remonstrate laughed in his face and told him he could go if he liked an intimation which only made him resolve to stick closer to her nevertheless about this time relations were rather strained between them and any one knowing the facts of the case would have seen that the end was not far off as to evan malton he was fentons assistant manager and was the moon to the astute americans sun weak irresolute and foolish he was nevertheless by some strange contradiction a capital business man this arose from his long training in office work he could do nothing by himself but guided by fenton he made an admirable subordinate and was amenable to his superior in every way he admired fenton greatly copied him in his dress and mannerisms affected a rakish demeanour towards his friends mistress and thoroughly neglected his poor wife a neglect of which fenton tried to take advantage had malton known this it would doubtless have changed his feelings towards the american for though he thought he was justified in leading a fast life he strongly objected to his wife showing any liking for any one but himself fenton however believing in no womans virtue did not despair but protected kitty openly to delude malton into a false security and made love to mrs malton sub ros it was quite warm out of doors in spite of the season and out on kittys lawn were a group of people laughing and talking together kitty in a comfortable chair was chatting to keith and ezra who had just arrived and there were several other ladies present including milly maxwell who was the second lady at the bonbondarkbrowed majestic and passionate dora avenant who looked like a doll and had the brains of one and mrs wadby who wrote scandal and dresses for the penny whistle under the nom de plume of baby as to the gentlemen there were present ted mortimer bland and smiling slingsby the parliamentary reporter delp the theatrical critic toltby the low comedian at the bonbon and about halfadozen others who were more or less connected with the stage and the press the men were smoking chatting or drinking according to their various tastes whilst the ladies were sipping their afternoon tea and of course the conversation was mostly about theatrical matters in the drawingroom however close to the window sat meg buried in a big armchair reading a fairy tale and a pretty picture she made with her little loose white dress and her glorious hair falling about her pale face and the beautiful princess read meg in ecstasy fell asleep in the magic castle for one hundred yearsoh breaking off suddenly how hungry she must have been when she woke up meg shook her head over this problem and resumed the story and a great forest grew round the castle which could not be got through till the handsome prince arrived here the drawingroom door opened and meg looked up half expecting to see the handsome prince it was only fenton however and he disliked meg intensely a dislike which that young person was by no means backward in returning so she went calmly on reading her book well wheres mother asked fenton in his slightly nasal voice looking at the little figure with a frown mumseys in the garden replied meg with great dignity flinging back her curls just where you ought to be said fenton illnaturedly getting fresh air im reading a fairy tale explained meg closing her book mumsey said i could do what i liked your mother dont rear you well retorted the american and he walked away when a peal of laughter made him turn round what funny faces you make said the child i feel quite laughy id like to spank you observed fenton with no very amiable expression of countenance youre a bad man said meg indignantly i dont know a baddernot a bit like my mr keith oh sneered fenton and who is mr keith he is a very nice gentleman replied meg pursing up her lips he stopped the wheels going over me i wish he hadnt muttered fenton vindictively meg go and tell mother i want her right away i shant retorted meg obstinately youre a rude man ill make you smart said fenton catching her arm oh mumsey cried the child in a tone of relief and fenton turned just to see kitty looking at him like an enraged tigress you lay a finger on my child she said viciously and ill kill you the american released his hold on meg with an awkward laugh and took a seat why dont you teach her manners he growled thats my business flashed out kitty haughtily and now you are here i wish to speak with you meg my treasure run out and say mumsey wont be long mumseys going to be cross with you now said meg consolingly to fenton and then ran out laughing the man looking angrily after her left alone kitty sat down near fenton and began to talk i asked you for five hundred she said coldly yesand i refused sulkily so i saw by your letter what is your reason thats my business mine also why did you refuse she reiterated im sick of your extravagance caprice laughed in a sneering way that brought the blush to his cheek do you think im dependent on you for money she said with scorn i know fifty better men than you who would give me the money if i asked them then go and ask them he returned brutally kitty sprang to her feet of course i will that means your dismissal fenton caught at her dress in genuine alarm no no dont go you know i love you so well she interrupted that you refuse me a paltry five hundred pounds i would give it to you but i havent got it then get it she said coolly im nearly ruined he cried desperately then retire and make room for better men youre a devil hissed fenton no doubt i told you what to expect when i first met you do you mean to say you will throw me over because ive no money left he said fiercely grasping her wrist like an old glove she retorted ill kill you first bah you are melodramatic oh kitty kitty with a sudden change to tenderness dont call me by that name said the woman in a low harsh voice kitty marchurst is dead she died when she went on the stage and all womanly pity died with her you are speaking to caprice the most notorious woman in melbourne fenton sat sullenly silent glancing every now and then at her beautiful scornful face if you wont give me money she said at length mindful of her promise to mrs malton you can do something else whats that eagerly mrs malton was here mrs malton he interrupted springing to his feet what did she say several unpleasant things about your love for her said kitty coolly its a lie he began but kitty shrugged her shoulders bah im not jealous i only care for your money not for you but about this visit her husband has embezzled money in your office fenton turned a little pale and looked steadily at her embezzled money the scoundrel he said furiously yes isnt he said kitty derisively not a noble upright gentleman like hiram fenton he turned from her with an oath ive been a good friend to him right along he said in an angry tone he was fixed up for life if hed only behaved himself now ill put him in prison so that you can make love to his wife retorted kitty coolly i dont care two straws about his wife replied fenton with a scowl you are the only woman i love then promise me to help this unhappy man certainly not you are asking me to compound a felony im not a lawyer she said coldly and dont understand legal terms i am only asking you to save him from gaol for his wifes sake you dont love him jealously bah do i love any one except myself and your child with a sneer let my child be will you help evan malton no the law must take its course then ill help him myself but how thats my businessthe money must be replacedfind out how much is missing and let me know whats the good youve not got the cash do what i ask very well sulkily i cant pay the money myself but ill give him time to repay it you will yes and kitty shamefacedly ill let you have that five hundred good boy said kitty approvingly and laughed she had gained both her points so could afford to do so at this moment meg entered the room from the garden followed by keith on seeing whom fentons face darkened mumsey said meg bounding up to kitty ive given him the knife and he says its lovelydont you turning to keith words fail me to express my appreciation said stewart with a smile looking at the largevery large ivoryhandled knife and its got an inscription from megbeautiful it will cut love mr stewart said kitty with a laugh oh no interposed meg hes given me a lucky sixpence he says were engaged now and when i grow up mumsey im going to marry him is this true asks kitty gaily are you going to rob me of my daughter this is dreadful what do you say mr fenton mr fenton smiled in a ghastly manner then hurried away muttering under his breath its bad temper observed stewart looking after him no my dear said kitty airily its jealousy chapter vii mirth and laughter kittys supper parties were always delightful though slightly godless the guests were usually men and women of the world connected with art literature and the drama so a general tone of brilliancy permeated the atmosphere the hostess herself was an admirable conversationalist and what with the wine the laughter and the influence of the midnight hour the excitement seemed contagious every one was amusing and witty stories caustic remarks and sarcastic epigrams followed one after the other in reckless profusion very pretty the suppertable looked though it must be confessed rather disorderly it was not a very large table but accommodated the present company admirably and under the soft light of the tapers with which the room was illuminated the silver and glass sparked brilliantly halffilled glasses of champagne and burgundy crumbs on the white tablecloth and a general array of disorderly plates showed that supper was over the guests had pushed away their chairs and were smoking and chatting while a light breeze came in through the open french window and somewhat cooled the temperature of the room the smoky atmosphere the flashing of the light on the bare shoulders of the women gay feminine laughter and the general air of unconventionality fascinated keith as he sat beside his hostess listening to the desultory conversation and occasionally joining in slingsby was speaking about a new book which had come out and this gave rise to a brilliant rattle of pungent wit its called connies crime a mixture of blood and atheism yes so they say a hashup of the newgate calendar and queen mab with a dash of realism to render it attractive awfully bad for the public bah they read worse in papers the penny whistle was bewailing the prevalence of criminal literature yet you cant take up a nights issue without finding a divorce case or a murderthe pot calling the kettle black with a vengeance dont suppose either it or shilling shockers have much to do with the morals of the publicwere all going to the deuce pessimistic but true its a game of follow my leader with father adam at the head gad he ought to have arrived at his destination by this time oh well all find that out when we get there but you forget we start in this new country with all the oldworld civilisation yes and all the oldworld vices which are a natural concomitant of aforesaid civilisation how abusive you all are said kitty shrugging her shoulders people are not so bad as you make out no theyre worse said delp lightly put on your diamonds and go through victoria like that young person in moores song rich and rare were the gems she wore you wont be treated as well i promise you im afraid im very careless of my diamonds laughed kitty i certainly take them home from the theatre every night but i generally put the case safely away in the drawer of my lookingglass a very safe place observed lazarus approvingly for illustration see poes story of the purloined letter all the same i wouldnt trust to fiction for suggestions said fenton gaily some night youll be minus your jewels ill take the risk retorted kitty rising im going into the drawingroom mr lazarus you come also i have got the score of that new operabouff eblis and i want you to try it bah a failure in town growled mortimer that doesnt necessarily mean a failure in melbourne replied kitty and with this parting shot she went away followed by the ladies and ezra lazarus keith remained behind and lighting a fresh cigarette listened to the conversation which was now slightly horsey i know whats going to win the cup never knew a man who didnt this is true devilmaycare an outsider they generally win but dont prophesy too soon no or like casandra your prophecies wont be believed who is casandraanother dark un noa woman talking about women i wish youd get more chorus girls mortimer got quite enough of coursequantity not quality theyve been snubbing you wrong again they never snub any one who can give them diamonds which you cant no by jove i wish i had some myselfsay caprices dont grudge them to her dear boythe savings of years every one grinned meanwhile keith grew tired of this scintillating talk and leaving ezra rattling away at a gallop in the drawingroom he arose and went out into the hall glancing carelessly up the stairs he saw a little figure in white coming down why meg said keith going to the foot of the stairs to receive her what are you doing at this hour of the night meg wants mumsey said the child putting her arms round his neck mumseys busy replied keith lifting her up ill take you back to bed dear dont want to go to bed said the child though she could hardly keep her eyes open keith laughed and rocked her slowly to and fro in his arms for a few minutes humming softly till meg grew tired will meg go to bed now he whispered seeing she had closed her eyes yes megs sleepy keith went upstairs with the quiet little figure in his arms and seeing an open door leading to a room in which there was a subdued light caused by the lowering of the gas he went in and finding megs cot placed her in it and tucked her carefully in goodnight dear he whispered kissing her goodnight mumsey goodnight god murmured meg thinking she was saying her prayers and fell fast asleep keith went downstairs again and met fenton in the hall say exclaimed that gentleman where have you been putting meg to bed replied stewart laughing i found her wandering about like an unquiet spirit and having no desire for a conversation with fenton he strolled off to the drawingroom leaving the american looking after him with an angry frown no one was in the drawingroom but ezra and the ladiesthe former being seated at the piano playing over the music of eblis while kitty marchurst stood beside him looking over his shoulder lazarus had just finished a valse which was not by any means original being made out of reminiscences of other music theres only one decent thing in the whole opera said kitty impatientlythis and she hummed a few bars its called womans deceit disagreeable title said keith idly but a capital song retorted kitty eblis sings itthats the principal character you seem anxious to play the devil said stewart with a smile what do you mean keith shrugged his shoulders eblis is the oriental name for the devil oh i understand kittys quick perception seized the idea at once yes there would be some fun in playing such a character then give myself and lazarus a commission to write you a part i am anxious to make a start and i think lazarus would write charming music ill be librettist and of course can write the character to suit you kitty glanced critically at him can you compose music she asked lazarus in answer he played a charming gavotte bright and crisp with a quaint rhythm very pretty said kitty critically but not my style play something with a little more go in it like this he brought his hands down on the ivory keys with a tremendous crash and plunged into a wild fantastic galop that made everybody long to dance kitty clapped her hands and her whole face lighted up with enthusiasm as the brilliancy and dash of the melody carried her away bravo she cried when he finished thats what i want write me music like that and ill engage to have it produced youll do now sir turning to keith whats your idea rather a burlesque than operabouffe he answered what would you say to faust upset ah bah weve had so many burlesques on faust not such a one as i propose to write i intend to twist the whole legend round make miss faust a girton girl who has grown old and longs for love invokes the power of evil enter caprice as miss mephistopheles a female demon rejuvenates miss faust by paint and powder takes her to see mr marguerite who is a young athlete and so throughout the whole legend to conclude with miss mephistopheles falling in love with mr marguerite and disputing possession with miss faust ha ha laughed kitty what a capital idea it will be new at all events but i wont decide till i see the first act complete if its as good as it promises ill get mortimer to stage it after prince carnival keith was delighted as now he seemed to have obtained a chance of seeing what he could do ezra smiled and nodded to stewart i told you shed be a good friend he said the gentlemen all came into the room and in a short time there was a perfect babel of voices talking about everything and everyone suddenly fenton with a halfsmoked cigar in his hand entered the room and crossed over to kitty theres a roughlooking man outside who wants to see you he said quietly whats his name villiers kitty turned a little pale the husband of madame midas she said in an annoyed tone where is he walking up and down in front of the diningroom remain here ill see him she said in a decided tone and without being noticed left the room on entering the diningroom she found mr villiers seated at the suppertable drinking champagne from a halfempty bottle having entered through the window what do you want she asked coming down to him mr villiers was in his usual condition of intoxication and began to weep its kitty dear little kitty he said in a maudlin tone the friend of my dear wife your dear wife said kitty scornfully the woman you deceived so shamefully she was well quit of you when she went to live in england she left me to die alone wept villiers filling his glass again and only lets me have a hundred pounds a year and shes rolling in money quite enough for you to get drunk on retorted kitty what do you want money you shant get a penny yes i shall you talk about me treating my wife badly what about youeh kitty clenched her hands i did treat her badly she said with a cry god help me ive repented it often enough since you were a nice girl till you met vandeloup said villiers ah that confounded frenchman how he made me suffer leave vandeloup alone hes dead and it will do no good you reviling him now at all events he was a man not a drunkard she loves him still blow me hiccupped mr villiers risingloves him still heres a sovereign said kitty thrusting some money into his hand now go away at once i want more you wont get more get away or ill order my servants to turn you out villiers staggered up to her will you indeed who are you to talk to me like this ill go now but ill come back my beauty dont try your fine airs on me ill get money from you when i want it if i dont ill make you repent it kitty stood looking at him like a statue of marble and pointed to the open window i spare you for your wifes sake she said coldly go villiers lurched towards the window then turning round shook his fist at her ive not done with you yet my fine madam he said thickly youll be sorry for these fine airs you he staggered out without saying the vile word and disappeared in the darkness a vile word and yet what was that mrs malton said about her child blushing for her father god help her would meg live to blush for her mother kitty put out her hands with a sob when a burst of laughter from the next room sounded in her ears the momentary fit of tenderness was over and with a harsh laugh she poured out a glass of champagne and drank it off my world is there she muttered i must part with the child for her own good and she will lead that virtuous happy life which a miserable wretch like myself can never hope to reach chapter viii a mysterious affair the penny whistle was a purely sensational newspaper and all those who liked spicy articles and exaggerated details purchased it in order to gratify their tastes its circulation was enormous and its sale increased still more when the following article appeared in its columns on the tuesday after kittys supper party burglary at the house of a wellknown actress we often hear accounts of great jewel robberies having taken place in london but nothing of the kind at least in any noticeable degree has been perpetrated in the colonies until last sunday night or to speak more exactly monday morning when the house of caprice the wellknown actress was entered and jewels to the amount of were stolen the house in question is situated in toorak almost immediately on the banks of the yarrayarra and as far as we can learn the following are the circumstances connected with the affair on sunday night caprice entertained a number of friends at a supper party and the servants all being downstairs attending to the guests the upper part of the house was left entirely uninhabited it is at this time probably between twelve and one oclock that the burglary is supposed to have been perpetrated the company departed about three oclock and on going up to her room caprice found the window wide open knowing that it had been closed she suspected something was wrong and went to the place where she kept her diamonds only to find them gone she sent at once for her servants and an examination was made it was found that the house had evidently been entered from the outside as the window was not very far from the ground and some ivy growing on the wall made a kind of natural ladder which any man of ordinary agility could scale curiously enough caprices child aged seven was asleep in the room but appears to have heard nothing next morning another examination was made and it was found that the ivy was broken in several places showing clearly the mode of entrance the window had not been latched as no chance of a burglary was apprehended the house always having been looked upon as a remarkably safe one the diamonds were usually kept in a small safe but on returning from the theatre on saturday night they had been placed in the drawer of the lookingglass where they were judged to be safe as it was not thought likely any thief would look in so unlikely a place for valuable jewellery below will be found a plan of the house and grounds as furnished by our special reporter and the probable track of the burglars indicated illustration floor plan of first and ground floor it will be seen from this plan that the drawingroom and diningroom in both of which the guests were assembled are in the front of the house so that the most likely thing is that the burglar or burglars entered the grounds by the gate or along the banks of the river and climbed up into the house by the window c shown on the plan after securing the plunder two modes of exit were available either as indicated by the dotted line which would take the thief out of the gate into the road from whence it would be easy to escape or along the banks of the river as shown by the other lines in either case escape was perfectly easy of course the danger lay in detection while in the house but this was considerably guarded against by the fact that the noise and laughter going on below effectually drowned all sounds of any one entering the house the thief must have known that the diamonds were in the bedroom and that a number of people would be present on sunday night therefore he chose a time when he would be most likely to escape detection we believe that a detective has gone down to toorak to make inquiries and we have no doubt that the thief will soon be secured as it would be impossible for such valuable jewels to be disposed of in melbourne or other colonial cities without arousing suspicion it was fenton who insisted upon a detective being employed to investigate the robbery as for some extraordinary reason kitty seemed unwilling to allow the matter to be inquired into the detective who accompanied fenton to kittys house was known by the name of naball and on the retirement of kilsip had taken his place he was only of the age of thirty but remarkably clever and had already distinguished himself in several difficult cases detective work was a positive mania with him and he was never so happy as when engaged on a difficult caseit had for him the same fascination as an abstruse mathematical problem would have for an enthusiastic student to kilsip belonged the proud honour of having discovered this genius and it seemed as though the pupil would soon surpass the master in his wonderful instinct for unravelling criminal puzzles mr naball was an ordinarylooking young man who always dressed fashionably and had very little to say for himself so that few guessed the keen astute brain that was hidden under this somewhat foppish exterior he listened to everything said to him and rarely ventured an opinion but the thieves of melbourne well knew that when the toff as they called naball was on their track there was very little chance of escape from punishment on this day when they were on their way to toorak fenton was excited over the matter and ventured all kinds of theories on the subject while mr naball smoked a cigarette and admired the fit of his gloves do you think the thief will try and dispose of them in melbourne he asked possibly returned naball if hes a born fool im certain i know the thief said fenton quietly i told you that the man villiers was seen about the place on the night of the robbery by whom myself and caprice who saw him last caprice oh said naball imperturbably then shes the best person to see on the subject hes a bad lot said fenton he was mixed up in that poisoning case eight years ago the midas case yes caprice or rather kitty marchurst was concerned in it also so i believe replied naball every one was innocent except jarper and vandeloupone was hanged the other committed suicide i dont see what it has to do with the present case simply this said fenton sharply annoyed at the others tone villiers is a scoundrel and wouldnt stop at robbery if he could make some money over it he knew caprice had diamonds worth five thousand of course every one in melbourne knows that did he know where they were kept theres a safe in the room and a thief of course would go there firstpreciselybut you forget the diamonds were taken out of the drawer of her lookingglassa most unlikely place for a thief to examine the man who stole the jewels must have known where they were kept oh said fenton and looked astonished as he was quite unable to explain this he was about to reply when the train having arrived at its destination they got out and walked to kittys house she was in the drawingroom writing letters and looked pale and haggard her eyes having dark circles beneath them which told of a sleepless night when the two men entered the room she welcomed them gracefully and then resumed her seat as they began to talk i have brought you mr naball to look after this affair said fenton looking at her you are very kind she replied coldly but the fact is i have not yet decided about placing it in the hands of the police but the diamondsbegan fenton in amazement were mine finished kitty coolly and as the loss is mine not yours i will act as i think fit in the matter then turning her back on the discomfited fenton she addressed herself to the detective i should like your opinion on the subject she said graciously and then i will see if the case can be gone on with naball who had been keeping his keen eyes on her face the whole time bowed tell me all the details of the robbery he observed cautiously they are simple enough replied kitty folding her hands i bring them home from the theatre every night and usually put them in the safe which is in my room on saturday night however i was tired and i must confess rather careless and as the case was on my dressingtable i placed it in the drawer of my lookingglass to save me the trouble of going to the safe i gave a supper party on sunday night and when every one had gone away i went upstairs to bed and found the window open recollecting where i had put the diamonds i opened the drawer and found them gone my servants examined the ground beneath the window and found footmarks on the mould of the flowerbed so i suppose the thief must have entered by the window stolen the jewels and made off with them when she had finished naball remained silent for a minute but just as fenton was about to speak he interposed i will ask you a few questions madame he said thoughtfully when did you see the diamonds last about six oclock on sunday night i opened the drawer to get something and saw the case not the diamonds they were in the case are you sure where else would they be some one might have stolen them previously and left the case there to avert suspicion kitty shook her head impossible the case is also gone besides i locked the case on saturday night and had the key with me no other key could have opened it and had the case been forced i would have seen it at once see lifting up her arm i always wear this bracelet and the key is attached to it by a chain naball glanced carelessly at it and went on with his questions you generally kept the diamonds in the safe yes and it was quite an oversight not placing them in there on saturday quite no one knew they were in the drawer of your lookingglass on that particular night no one here fenton interposed you get along too fast he said quickly everyone at the suppertable knew you kept them there you said it to them yourself naball glanced sharply at kitty i know i did she replied quietly but i spoke as if the diamonds were always kept there which they were not i did not say they were in the drawer on that particular night you mentioned it generally said naball tranquilly yes all the people present were my guests and i hardly think any of them would rob me of my diamonds were any of the servants in the room when you made the remark said the detective slowly no none and the door was closed naball paused a moment i tell you what he said slowly the diamonds were stolen between six oclock and the time you went to bed about three oclock said kitty precisely you saw the diamonds last at six they were gone by three you mentioned where you kept them at the suppertable now the thief must have overheard you youyou suspect my guests sir cried kitty angrily certainly not said the detective quietly but i suspect villiers villiers yes mr fenton tells me you saw him on that night kitty flashed a look of anger on the american who bore it unmoved yes he was outside and wanted to see me i saw him gave him some money and he left then i tell you he overheard you say where you kept the diamonds because he was hiding outside the window so after seeing you he committed the robbery thats what i think said fenton you cried kitty what have you got to do with it i dont believe he stole them and whether he did or not im not going to continue this case youll lose your diamonds cried fenton thats my business she returned rising haughtily at all events i have decided to let the matter rest so mr naball will have all his trouble for nothing should i desire to reopen the affair i will let you both know at present good morning and with a sweeping bow she turned and left the room fenton stared after her in blank amazement good god what a fool he cried rising whats to be done now naball shrugged his shoulders nothing he replied since she declines to give me power to investigate i must throw the affair up but also rising and putting on his hat id like to have a look at the ground beneath the window they both went out naball silent and fenton in great wrath talking of kittys conduct what an idiot she is he cried what is she going on in this way for i dont know she must have some motive women dont require a motive for anything said naball imperturbably proceeding to examine the ground under the window through which the thief had made his exit the flowerbed was filled with tall hollyhocks and some of these were broken as if some heavy body had fallen from above he clambered down by the ivy murmured naball to himself as he bent down the ivy is broken here and there the flowers are also broken so he fell on them in a heapprobably having missed his footing humph clever man as he did not step again on the flowerbed but jumped from where he fell on to the grass humph grass hard and rather dry no chance of footmarks question is which way did he go by the gate of course said fenton impatiently the detective walked across the lawn to the gate but could find no trace of footmarks as the lawn was dry and the footpath leading out into the pavement of the street was asphalted no he did not go by the gate as a man in such rags as villiers would have been sure to be seen coming out of a private house that would be suspicious besides he would have been afraid of the police exactly hes been in prison two or three times since his connection with the midas case and has got a wholesome dread of the law no he did not go by the gate but by the river the river repeated fenton in amazement naball did not answer but walked back to the window then along the side of the house turned the corner and went down the sloping green bank which led to the river still he could see no footmarks the grass ended at an iron fence and beyond was the uncultivated vegetation rank and unwholesome that clothed the banks of the river between this and the grass however there was a strip of black earth and this naball examined carefully but could find nothing if villiers had come this way he could only have climbed the fence by first standing on this earth in order to get near enough but apparently he had not done so he did not come this way he said as they walked back but how could he have left the place asked fenton by the gate the gate you said he would be afraid of the police so he would had he been doing anything wrong had he stolen the diamonds he would have gone down by the bank of the river rather than chance meeting a policeman on the street but what does this prove that had he met a policeman he could have explained everything and referred him to caprice as to his interview and right to come out of the house in a word it proves he did not steal the diamonds then who in heavens name did i dont give an opinion unless im certain said naball deliberately but ill tell you what i think you heard caprice say she wont go on with the case yes i cant understand her reason i can she stole the diamonds herself chapter ix an unknown benefactor everyone was greatly excited over the great jewel robbery especially as it had taken place at the house of so celebrated a person as caprice and numerous were the conjectures as to the discovery of the thieves when however it became known that the lady in question declined to allow an investigation to be made and was apparently contented to lose five thousand pounds worth of diamonds the excitement grew intense what was her motive for acting in such a strange way all melbourne asked itself this question but without obtaining a satisfactory answer reference was made to kittys antecedents in connection with the midas poisoning case and the public were quite prepared to hear any evil of her particularly as her career since then had been anything but pure the name of villiers was mentioned and then it transpired that villiers had been seen outside her house on the night of the robbery it was curious that another crime should have happened where these two formerly implicated in a murder case should have come together and disagreeable rumours began to circulate then by some unexplained means the opinion of naball became known regarding his assertion that caprice had stolen the diamonds herself here was another mystery why on earth should she steal her own jewels one theory was that she required money and had sold them for this purpose pretending that they were stolen in order to satisfy the lovers who gave them to her this was clearly absurd as caprice cared nothing for the opinion of her lovers and moreover the donors of the diamonds were long since dead or ruined so the idea of the detective was unanimously laughed at but then the fact remained she would not allow an investigation to be made and how was this to be accounted for one idea was mooted that villiers had stolen the diamonds and she would not prosecute him because he was the husband of the woman who had been kind to her in this case however she would have easily got back her jewels by a threat of prosecution whereas they were still missing other solutions of the problem were offered but they were unsatisfactory and melbourne settled itself down to the opinion that the whole affair was a mystery which would never be solved keith and ezra had both been puzzled over the affair and offered kitty their services to unravel the mystery but she curtly dismissed them with the remark that she wished the affair left alone so they had to obey her and remain in ignorance like the rest of the public affairs thus went on as usual and the weeks slipped by with no further information being forthcoming meanwhile prince carnival was still running to crowded houses and kitty appeared nightly being now a still greater attraction on account of the robbery of which she was the heroine she had fulfilled her promise to keith in seeing mortimer about the chances of production for faust upset the manager was doubtful about the success of the experiment of trying colonial work and told kitty plainly he could not afford to lose money on such a speculation its all stuff he said to her when she urged him to give the young men a chance i can get operas from london whose success is already assured and i dont see why i should waste money on the crude production of two unknown colonials thats all very true retorted caprice and from a business point of view correct but considering you make your money out of colonial audiences i dont see why you shouldnt give at least one chance to see what colonial brains can do as to crudity wait and see i dont want you to take the opera if it is bad but if you approve of it give it a chance in the end mortimer promised that if he approved of the libretto and music he would try the piece at the end of the run of prince carnival but put eblis in rehearsal in case his forebodings of failure should be justified when however the first act was finished and shown to him he was graciously pleased to say there was good stuff in it and began to be a little more hopeful as to its success so keith worked hard all day at his employment and at night on his libretto to which ezra put bright tuneful music with the usual sanguine expectations of youth they never dreamt of failure and keith wrote the most enthusiastic letters to his betrothed announcing the gratifying fact that he had got his foot on the lowest rung of the ladder of fame as to his uncongenial employment at the pawnshop he strove to conquer his repugnance to it and succeeded in winning the approval of old lazarus by his assiduous attention to business he attended to the books and as time went on the pawnbroker actually let him pay money into the bank so great had his confidence in the young man become he increased keiths salary and even then chuckled to himself over his cleverness in retaining such a clever servant at so low a price though his business was ostensibly that of a pawnbroker he was in the habit of conducting very much more delicate transactions in his dingy little den at the back of the shop he sat like a great spider waiting for flies and the flies generally came in at a little door which led from the room into a dirty yard and there was a kind of narrow rightofway which gave admittance to this yard from the street by this humble way many wellknown people came particularly at nightthe fast young man who had backed the wrong horse the speculative sharebroker and the spendthrift society lady all came here in quest of money which they always got provided their security was good and of course they paid an exorbitant percentage lazarus had dealings with all sorts and conditions of men and women but he was as silent as the grave over their affairs and no one knew what secrets that dirty old hebrew carried in his breast of these nocturnal visitors keith saw nothing as he left at six oclock after which isaiah shut up the shop and the front of the house was left in profound darkness while business went on in the little back room it was now a fortnight since the robbery and the nine days wonder having ceased to amuse people were beginning to forget all about it keith still lived in east melbourne with ezra and on going home one night was surprised to find a letter from the manager of the hibernian bank which informed him that the sum of five hundred pounds had been placed to his credit stewart went next day to find out the name of his unknown benefactor but the manager refused to tell him as he had been pledged to secrecy so keith returned to ezra in a state of great perplexity to talk over the affair they sat in ezras sittingroom and discussed the matter late at night with great assiduity but were unable to come to any conclusion you dont know any one who would do you a good turn asked lazarus when he heard this news nono one replied keith i havent a single relative in the colonies and no friend rich enough to give me so much moneyunless it were your father with a sudden inspiration he laughed ezra scornfully hed as soon part with his blood why i asked him to give me some money so that i could marry and he refused what he wouldnt do for his son he certainly would not do for a stranger its very queer observed keith meditatively it cant be caprice not likely she needs all her money herself said ezra besides i hear shes been rather hard up of late i suppose fenton will soon go broke and then le roi est mort vive le roi what a pity she goes on like that said keith regretfully i like her so much yes and she likes you retorted ezra pointedly dont you get entangled in the nets or youll forget all about the girl at sandhurst does she know youre engaged no i wouldnt tell her if i were you said the jew significantly or shell withdraw the light of her countenance and then it will be all up with our burlesque pooh nonsense replied stewart with an uneasy laugh i wonder wholl be fentons successor yourself not i im not far enough gone for that besides ive no money true except your anonymous five hundred which would be nothing to caprice so as she wants money i expect it will be old meddlechip but hes married true o sir galahad retorted ezra sarcastically but hes an unholy old man for all thatshell ensnare him and well see how long it will take her to break the richest man in the colonies oh the deuce take kitty marchurst and her affairs said keith impatiently i want to know who sent me this money better not ask murmured ezra curiosity is a vice remember adam and eve bluebeards wife etcetera take the goods the gods bestow and dont try to find out where they come from but now you are rich youll be giving up the shop no ill stay on for a time till i find that the five hundred is really and truly mine who knows some day it may take to itself wings and fly it certainly would with some young men said ezra but i dont think you are that sort you are right i want to save up all my money for eugnie ah you are going to marry her when i get rich yes you wont marry her if caprice can help it why disbelievingly because shes fallen in love with you and her love like the gifts of the danaes is fatal rubbish im not a child caprice will never take my heart from eugnie hercules remarked ezra musingly was a strong man yet he became the slave of a woman solomon was a wise mansame result my friend you are neither hercules nor solomon therefore keith departed hurriedly chapter x naball makes a discovery when kilsip undertook to educate naball in the business of a detective he gave him an epigrammatical piece of advice cultivate curiosity this golden rule naball constantly followed and found it of infinite service to him in his difficult profession he was always on the lookout for queer cases and when he discovered one that piqued his curiosity he never rested until he found out all about it the red indian follows the trail of his enemy by noting the most trivial signs which to others with a less highly cultivated instinct would appear worthless and naball was a social red indian following up the trail of a mystery by a constant attention to surrounding events a casual observation a fleeting expression a scrap of paperthese were the signposts which led him to a satisfactory conclusion and he never neglected any opportunity of exercising his faculties by this constant practice he sharpened his senses in a wonderful degree and cultivated to the highest extent the unerring instinct which he possessed in discovering crimes consequently when he found there was no legal authority to be given him in unravelling the mystery of the diamond robbery he determined to investigate it on his own account in order to satisfy his curiosity to a casual spectator it appeared to be a mere vulgar burglary in which the thieves had got off with their plunder and until his interview with caprice the detective had supposed it to be so but when he went over in his own mind the peculiar circumstances of that interview he saw there was a complicated criminal case to be investigated so he set himself to work to unravel the mystery and gratify his inquiring mind in the first place he drew up a statement of the case pure and simple and then deducing different theories from the circumstances he tried to get a point from whence to start he placed his ideas in the form of questions and answers as follows q was villiers outside on the verandah when caprice mentioned where her diamonds were kept a to all appearances he was q had he any inducement to steal the diamonds a undoubtedly he was poor and wanted money proved by his calling on caprice and asking for some he said he would be revenged because she did not give him more than a sovereign and there would be no sweeter revenge than to steal her diamonds as it would punish her and benefit himself q did he know the room where the diamonds were kept a yes caprice said her bedroom and as villiers had been several times to the house before he knew where it was q did caprice know villiers had stolen her jewels a extremely probably hence her refusal to prosecute as he was the husband of madame midas whom she had treated so basely the refusal to prosecute villiers might be in caprices opinion an act of expiation when he had got thus far naball paused after all this was pure theory he had not a single well authenticated fact to go on but all the circumstances of the case seemed to point to villiers so he determined to go on the trail of villiers and find out what he was doing mr villiers had of late been under the espionage of the police owing to some shady transactions with which he was connected so naball knew exactly where to find him and putting on an overcoat he sallied forth in the direction of the slums in little bourke street with the intention of calling on a chinaman named ah goon who kept an opium den in that unsavoury locality to his drinking habits villiers now added that of being a confirmed opium smoker and was on terms of intimacy with ah goon in whose den he was accustomed to pass his evenings naball therefore intended to watch for villiers and find out if possible when owing to drink and opium combined he was not master of himself what he had done on the night of the robbery after leaving caprice he soon entered little bourke street and plunged into the labyrinth of slums which he knew thoroughly it was a clear starry night but the cool fresh air was tainted in this locality by the foul miasma which pervaded the neighbourhood and even the detective accustomed as he was to the place felt disgusted with the sickly odours that permeated the atmosphere ah goons house was in a narrow rightofway off one of the larger alleys and there was a faint candle burning in the window to attract customers pausing at the door a moment naball listened to hear if there was any european within the monotonous chant of a chinese beggar could be heard coming down the alley and every now and then the screams of two women fighting while occasionally a number of noisy larrikins would come tramping heavily along forming a strong contrast to the silent softfooted orientals pushing open the door naball entered the den a small lowceilinged room which was filled with a dull smoky atmosphere at the end was a gaudylooking shrine all yellow red and green with tinsel flowers and long red bills with fantastic chinese letters on them in long rows candles were burning in front of this and cast a feeble light aroundon a pile of bamboo canes and baskets heaped up against the wall on strangelooking chinese stools of canework on bizarre ivory carvings set on shelves and on a low raised platform at the end of the room whereon the opiumsmokers reclined above this groundfloor were two or three other broad shallow shelves in each of which a chinaman was lying sunk deep in an opium slumber there was also a kerosene lamp on the lower floor beside which ah goon was reclining and deftly preparing a pipe of opium for a fat stolidlooking chinaman who watched the process with silent apathy ah goon looked up as the detective entered and a bland smile spread over his face as he nodded to him and went on preparing his pipe while naball stood watching the queer operation there was an oil lamp with a clear flame in front of ah goon who was holding a kind of darningneedle dipping this into a thick brown stickylooking substance contained in a small pot he twirled the needle rapidly spinning round the glutinous mass like treacle then he placed it in the flame of the lamp and turned it slowly round and round for a short time until it was ready then having placed it in the small hole of the opium pipe which he held ready in his other hand he gave it to his countryman who received it with a grunt of satisfaction and lying back took the long stem between his lips and inhaled the smoke with long steady breaths when his pipe was done which was accomplished in three or four whiffs he devoted himself to preparing another while ah goon arose to his feet to speak to naball he was a tall man with a thin yellowskinned emaciated face cunning oblong eyes and flattish nose his pigtail of courseblack hair craftily lengthened by thick twisted silkwas coiled on top of his head and his dress consisting of a dull blue blouse wide trousers of the same colour and thick whitesoled chinese slippers by no means added to his personal beauty standing before naball with an unctuous smile on his face and his long slender hands clasped in front of him ah goon waited for the detective to speak naball glanced rapidly round the apartment and not seeing villiers addressed himself to the stolid celestial who was looking slyly at him ah goon where is the white man who comes here every night plenty he come allee muchee nightme no have seen replied ah goon blinking his black eyes yes i know that retorted naball quickly but this one is shortblack hair and whiskerssmokes opiumdrinks a lotis called villiers whether ah goon recognised the gentleman thus elegantly described was doubtful at all events he put on a stolid air me no sabee he answered naball held out a halfa crown upon which ah goon fixed his eyes lovingly where is he the money was too much for ah goons cupidity so he gave in him playee fantanayah he answered in a singsong voice allee same oh mr naball did not waste any words but threw the halfcrown to the expectant ah goon and turned towards the door just as he reached it there was a noise of hurried footsteps outside and villiers voice husky and savage was heard ah goon you yellow devil where are you and there came a heavy kick at the door in a moment naball drew back into a shadowy corner and placed his finger on his lips to ensure silence a pantomime which the intelligent ah goon understood at once villiers opened the door and lurched noisily into the room stopping for a minute on the threshold dazed by the yellow smoky glare here you ah goon he cried catching sight of the chinaman i want some moneymore money ah goon no have murmured that individual clutching his halfcrown ive lost all i had on that infernal fantan of yours shrieked villiers not heeding him but my luck must changegive me another fiver ah goon no have reiterated the chinaman edging away from the excited villiers curse your no have he said fiercely why ive only had twenty pounds from you and those diamonds were worth fifty diamonds naball pricked up his ears at this he was winning after all kitty did not steal her jewels but this was the thief or perhaps an accomplice give me more money cried villiers lurching forward and would have laid his hand on the shoulder of the shrinking chinaman when naball stepped out of his corner whats the matter he asked in his silky voice villiers turned on the newcomer with a sudden start and stared suspiciously at him but the detective being muffled up in a heavy ulster with his hat pulled over his eyes he did not recognise him what do you want he said ungraciously nothing replied naball quickly im only strolling round the chinese quarter out of curiosity and heard you rowing this poor devil poor devil sneered villiers with a glance of fury at ah goon who had complacently resumed his occupation of preparing an opium pipe hes rich enough indeed said the detective carelesslyto lend money whats that to you growled villiers with a snarl i spose i can borrow money if i like certainly if youve got good security to give villiers glared angrily at the young man dont know what youre talking about he said sulkily security explained naball smoothly means borrowing money on land clothes oror diamonds villiers gave a sudden start and was about to reply when the door opened violently and a bold handsome woman dressed in a bright green silk dashed into the room and swooped down on ah goon well my dear she said effusively ere i am bin to the theatre and ere you are preparing that pisin of yours oh i must ave one pipe tonight just one andwho the blazes are you catching sight of the two strangers shut up said villiers and made a step towards her for just on the bosom of her dress sparkled a small crescent of diamonds set in silver the womans eyes caught his covetous glance and she put her hand over the ornament no you dont she said scowling lay a finger on me and illah she ended with a stifled cry for without warning villiers had sprung on her and his hands were round her throat ah goon and another chinaman jumped up and threw themselves on the two trying to separate them the woman got villiers hands off her and started to sing out freely so naball began to think of retreating as the noise would bring all the undesirable bullies of the neighbourhood into the unsavoury den while thus hesitating the woman flung the diamond ornament away from her with an oath and it fell at naballs feet in a moment the detective had picked it up and slipped in into his pocket villiers seeing the ornament was gone flung the woman from him with a howl of fury and turned to look for it when the door was burst violently open and a crowd of chinese all chattering in their high shrill voices like magpies surged into the room ah goon with many gesticulations began to explain villiers to swear and the woman to shriek so in the midst of this pandemonium naball slipped away and was soon walking swiftly down little bourke street with the diamond ornament safe in his pocket i believe this is one of the stolen jewels he muttered exultingly and villiers was the thief after all humph im not so sure of that well ill find out the truth when i see how she looks on being shown this little bit of evidence chapter xi what naball overheard it is said that counsel comes in the silence of the night so next morning mr naball having been thinking deeply about his curious discovery decided upon his plan of action it was evidently no good to go straight to caprice and show her the diamond crescent as judging from her general conduct with regard to the robbery she would deny that the jewel belonged to her the detective therefore determined to ascertain from some independent person whether the jewel was really the property of caprice and after some consideration came to the conclusion that fenton would be the most likely individual to supply the necessary information hes her lover argued naball to himself as he walked along the street so he ought to know what jewellery shes got i dare say he gave her a lot himself but hang it he went on disconsolately i dont know why im bothering about this affair nothing will come of it for some reason best known to herself caprice wont let me follow up the case i cant make it out either she stole the jewels herself or villiers did and she wont prosecute him ah women are rum things concluded the detective with a regretful sigh he had by this time arrived at the neversaydie insurance office and on entering the door found himself in a large lofty apartment with a long shiny counter at one end and a long shiny clerk behind it this individual who looked as if he were rubbed all over with fresh butter so glistening was his skin received him with a stereotyped smile and asked in a soft oily voice what he was pleased to want take my card up to mr fenton said naball producing his pasteboard from an elegant cardcase and tell him i want to see him for a few minutes the oleaginous clerk disappeared and several other clerks looked up from their writing at the detective with idle curiosity naball glanced sharply at their faces and smiled blandly to himself as he recognised several whom he had seen in very equivocal places little did the clerks know that this apparently indolent young man knew a good deal about their private lives and was anticipating coming into contact with several of them in a professional manner presently the oily clerk returned with a request to mr naball to walk into the managers office which that gentleman did in a leisurely manner and the shiny clerk closing the door softly returned to his position behind the shiny counter mr fenton sat at a handsome writingtable which was piled up with disorderly papers and looked sharply at the detective as he took a seat well naball he said in his strident voice what is the matter cant give you more than five minutestimes money here yes sir five minutes will do replied the detective tapping his varnished boots with his cane its about that robbery oh indeed mr fenton laid down his pen and leaning back in his chair prepared to listen yes ive been looking after villiers quite right said the american thats the man i suspectfixed up anything eh not yet but i was down little bourke street last night in an opium den to which villiers goes and i found this fenton took the diamond crescent which naball held out to him and looked at it closely humphset in silverrather toney he said well is this part of the swag thats what i want to find out said naball quickly you know the peculiar way in which caprice has treated this robbery i know shes a fool retorted fenton politely she ought to go right along in this matter but for some silly reason she wont no and thats why ive come to you im going down to see her when i leave here and its likely shell deny that this belongs to her now i want your evidence to put against her denial is this the property of caprice fenton examined the jewel again and nodded yes sir he replied with a nasal drawl guess i gave her this i thought youd recognise it said naball replacing the jewel in his pocket so now ill go and see her in order to find out how villiers got hold of it stole it i reckon im not so sure of that replied the detective coolly i dont believe caprice cares two straws about villiers being the husband of madame midas if he stole the diamonds shed lag him as sure as fate no as i told you before shes got a finger in this pie herself and villiers is helping her but the diamonds were stolen on that night objected the american i know thatdont you remember you told me that caprice had an interview in the supper room with villiers well i believe she went upstairs took the diamonds and gave them to villiers to dispose of for what reason thats what id like to find out retorted naball she evidently wanted a sum of money for something now are you aware that she wanted money why shes always wanting money no doubtbut this must have been a specially large sum fenton glanced keenly at naballs impassive face drummed impatiently with his fingers on the table then evidently made up his mind tell you what he said rapidly she did want a large sum of moneyfact is a friend of hers got into a fix and his wife went howling to her so she said she would replace the money and ive no doubt sold her diamonds to do so i thought it was something like that said naball coolly but why the deuce couldnt she sell her diamonds openly without all this row guess youd better ask her said fenton rising to his feet she wont let me meddle with the affair so i cant do anythingif shes fool enough to lose or sell five thousand pounds worth of diamonds i cant help it and now sir the five minutes glancing at his watch are up long ago replied naball rising to his feet well im curious about this case and im going to get at it somehow so at present im off down to see caprice about this and he tapped his breastpocket where the jewel was placed you wont get anything out of her said fenton yawning if all you surmise is true i dont care what she says observed naball going to the door i can discover all i want from the expression of her face when she knows what ive got and where i got it with this naball disappeared and fenton returning to his desk flung himself back in his chair why the devil wont she prosecute he muttered savagely to himself guess she knows more about this robbery than she says but even thenconfound it im mixed having come to this unsatisfactory conclusion mr fenton went on with his work and dismissed all thoughts of the diamond robbery from his mind meanwhile naball was on his way down to toorak meditating over the revelation made to him by fenton about caprices sudden fit of generosity i didnt think she was so tenderhearted murmured naball full of perplexity she must have had some strong reason for selling her diamonds i wonder who the man isand the wife called humph this is quite a new game for caprice when he left the station and walked to the house instead of ringing the frontdoor bell he strolled round the corner to the verandah on which the drawingroom windows looked out he did this becausewondering if villiers was concerned in the robberyhe wanted to see the window by which he entered the diningroom on the night of the robbery softfooted and stealthy in his motions the detective made no noise and was just pausing on the edge of the verandah wondering whether he would go forward or return to the front door when he heard kittys voice in the drawingroom raised in a tone of surprise mrs malton hullo said naball to himself thats the name of fentons assistant manager now i wonder what his wife is calling here about ill wait and hear so the detective filled with curiosity took up his position close to one of the windows so that he could hear every word that was said but of course was unable to see anything going on inside he commenced to listen out of mere curiosity but soon the conversation took a turn which interested him greatly and to his mind threw a great deal of light on the diamond robbery why have you called to see me again asked kitty in a cold tone because i want to thank you for saving my husband replied mrs malton they told me you were busy but i have waited in the next room for halfanhour to see you my husband is safe i congratulate youand him answered caprice in an ironical tone it is to be hoped mr evan malton wont embezzle any more money naball outside could hardly refrain from giving a low whistle so this was the man mentioned by fentonhis own familiar friendand kitty marchurst had helped him in heavens name why it is due to your kindness that he is safe said mrs malton in a faltering tone you replaced the money not at all said caprice i never replaced a sixpence but you did you did said mrs malton vehemently falling on her knees before kitty every penny of the money has been paid back and only you could have done it i did not pay a penny i tell you said caprice still i have had something to do with it i knew it i knew it cried the poor wife kissing the hand of the actress may god bless you for doing this good action i wouldnt have done it had it not been for the sake of your child said kitty coldly wonderful thought the listener kitty marchurst has a heart goodbye goodbye said mrs malton rising to her feet i may never see you again ive no doubt of that replied caprice with a cynical laugh youve got all you wanted so now you leave me no no cried the other woman vehemently i am not ungrateful i will visit you if you will let me i am sorry for you i pity you keep your pity and your visits for some one elsei want neither but your heart my heart is stone it was hardened long long ago leave mei have done all i can for younow go mrs malton made a step forward and catching kitty in her arms kissed her god bless you she cried in a low voice and as she kissed her she felt a hot tear fall on her hand it was caprice who wept but with a stifled sigh she pushed mrs malton away you are a good woman she said hoarsely go go and if you ever think of me let it be as one who however bad her life did at least one good action she sank back into a chair covering her face with her hands while mrs malton with a look of pity on her face and a low god bless you left the room meanwhile the detective outside was smitten with a kind of remorse at having overheard this pathetic scene ive found out what caprice wanted the money for he muttered but im sorry for hervery sorry i never knew before she was a womani thought she was a fiend kitty drying her eyes arose from her seat and dragged herself slowly across the room to the window near which the detective was standing he heard her coming and tried to escape and in another moment kitty had opened the window and they were face to face mr naball she cried with a sudden angry light in her eyes you have heard every word said naball looking straight at her wrathful face chapter xii naball tells a story kitty looked at him in silence with flashing eyes and then laughed bitterly and how long is it since you added the spy business to your usual work she asked with a sneer on her colourless face since a few moments ago replied naball coolly i came to see you on business and hearing you in conversation with a lady did not like to interrupt till you were disengaged im very much obliged to you for your courtesy said caprice scornfully but now you have satisfied your curiosity m le mouchard ill trouble you to take yourself off certainly after ive had a few moments conversation with you i decline to listen said kitty haughtily i think you had better observed naball significantly as its about the robbery of your jewels i forbade you to go on any further with that matter you did but i disobeyed your injunction so i understand replied kitty indignantly and may i ask if you have discovered anything yesthis and he showed the diamond crescent to caprice she started violently and her pale face flushed a deep red where did you get it she asked from randolph villiers villiers she echoed in surprise how did it come into his possession that is what i want to discover then you may save yourself the trouble for you will never know i understand that said naball quietly nothing can be done unless you permit me to go on i forbid you to go on she retorted angrily naball bowed very well he said quietly then there is nothing for me but to leave no i dont think there is assented kitty coldly turning to reenter the house but before i go went on the detective playing his great card i will leave your jewel with you that said kitty glancing over her shoulder at the crescentthat is not mine mr fenton says it is mr fenton echoed caprice jeeringly and how does mr fenton know i should think he was the best person to know retorted naball nettled at her mockery a good many people think the same way said kitty disdainfully but in this case mr fenton is wrongi never saw those diamonds before then how did it come into mr villiers possession i dont know not being in mr villiers confidence oh said naball significantly you are quite certain you are not i dont understand you replied kitty coldly explain yourself certainly if you wish it said the detective smoothly i will tell it in the form of a little storyhave i your permission to be seated she nodded carelessly whereupon naball sat down on one of the lounging chairs and crossing his legs settled himself composedly while kitty standing near him with looselyclasped hands looked idly at the green lawn with its brilliant border of manycoloured flowers there was once a woman called folly who livedlet us sayin cloudland began naball airily rubbish said kitty angrily nothing of the sort retorted naball coolly it is truth in disguise i have been to schooli have read spensers faery queenif you please we will consider this story though not in verse as one of the lost cantos of the poem kitty shrugged her shoulders with contempt i think youre mad she said coldly perhaps i am retorted naball sharply but theres method in my madness as you will soon find outso to go on with the lost canto of the faery queen this woman folly was reputed to have a hard heartno doubt she had but there was one soft spot in itlove for her child many men loved this charming folly and paid dearly for the privilege one man misnamed strength loved her madly and gave her many jewels strength had a friend called weakness and though they were so dissimilar in character they worked together weakness also loved folly though he had a wife and to gain follys love he stole a lot of money his wife discovered this and going to folly implored her to help weakness but in vain till at last she gained her point by appealing to the one soft spot in follys heartlove for her child she was successful and folly promised to save the husband by replacing the money which she could do through the agency of strength who was her lover folly however did not know where to get the money so in despair determined to part with her jewels she dared not do so openly lest the inhabitants of cloudland should find out what weakness had done so she enlisted the services of a man called vice here said naball gaily we will leave the narrative style and finish the story dramatically kitty who had grown pale made no sign so naball resumed scene a supperroom with a window opentime nightsupper endedguests awayenter vice through open windowhelps himself to champagne folly informed of presence of vice enters the room and orders him outhe refuses to leave till he gets moneyshe refuses to give it to him suddenly an idea strikes her and she tells vice she will give him money if he sells her jewels for her secretlyvice consents folly goes up to her room gets jewels gives them to vice who goes away and breaks down shrubs under window which is opened by folly to show every one that a burglar has stolen the jewels rumours of the theft get aboutbloodhound goes on the tracktraces vice to his denfinds one jewelcomes to show it to follyoverhears wife of weakness thanking folly for replacing money stolen by her husbandexit wife of weaknessenter bloodhound to folly who denies having ever seen jewel before bloodhound tells a story to folly which folly denies yes denies broke in kitty angrily your story is wrong pardon me said naball rising allegorical i can understand what you mean said kitty after a pause but its all wrong i never paid this money for malton pardon meweakness said naball politely bah why keep up this transparent deception your story is excellent and i understand all about folly vice and strength but you are wrongthat jewel is not mine i never paid the money and i dont know anything about maltons business so you can leave me at once and never show your face again but the jewel said the detective holding it out kitty snatched it out of his hand and flung it across the lawn it flashed brilliantly in the sunlight and fell just on the verge of the flowerbed you can follow itbloodhound she said disdainfully and entering the house closed the window after her naball stood for a moment smiling in a gratified manner to himself then sauntering slowly across the lawn picked up the jewel and replaced it in his pocket i knew i was right he murmured quietly as he strolled to the gate she stole the diamonds to pay maltons debt and villiers got this for payment as an accomplice i wish i could get on with the case but she wont let mewhat a pity dear dear what a pity he had by this time reached the gate and was passing through it when a hansom drove up from out which fenton jumped well he asked when he saw naball well said naball dusting his varnished boots with a silk handkerchief what does she say asked fenton inquiringly what a woman generally does sayeverything but the truth going to see her yes said fenton paying his cab fare can i do anything two things observed naball quietly in the first place let me have your cab and in the second give this to caprice with my compliments and he handed the crescent of diamonds to fenton why didnt you give it to her yourself asked fenton taking it because she said it wasnt hers replied naball getting into the cab i cant do anything more in the matter its a beautiful case spoiled why spoiled asked fenton pausing at the gate because theres a woman in it replied naball goodbye and the cab drove off in a cloud of dust leaving fenton at the gate looking in a puzzled manner at the diamond crescent why the deuce did she deny this being hers he asked himself as he opened the gate i know it welli ought to considering i paid for ittheres some game in this he rang the bell which was answered by bliggings who in reply to his question as to whether kitty was at home burst out into a volley of language oh gracious an good eavens missus ave bin talkin to a lady this mornin and is that upset as never waschalk is black to her complexing and penny hices ot to the chill of her feets humph said fenton entering the house and leisurely taking off his hat just tell your mistress i want to see her oh gracious an good eavens cried bliggings shes alyin down in company with a linseed poultase an a cup of tea both bein good for removin eadaches great scot said fenton impatiently pushing the voluble bliggings aside ill go and see her straight off myself he went upstairs and knocked at the sittingroom door hearing a faint voice telling him to come in he entered the room which he found in semidarkness with the pungent aroma of eau de cologne pervading the atmosphere what do you want asked kitty fretfully thinking it was the servant to see you replied fenton gruffly oh its you cried caprice sitting up on the sofa looking pale and wan in her white dress im glad of thative just seen that naball and hes been accusing me of stealing my own jewels well did you asked fenton complacently of course i didnt she retorted angrily why should i naball thinks i did it to replace the money malton stole how did he find out that asked fenton who knew quite well he had told him about it himself he overheard mrs malton thanking me retorted kitty impatiently the money has been replaced so i suppose you did it yes i did said fenton boldly for your sake youre a good fellow fenton said kitty in a softened tone im glad you did what i asked younow go away for i must get a sleep or ill never be able to act tonight but what about this jewel asked fenton taking the crescent out of his pocket naball said you denied it being yours so i did replied caprice pettishly but why i gave it to you well you can give it to me again she said coolly put it on the table and go away fenton thought a moment then going over to the table placed the jewel thereon and turned once more to caprice look here kitty he said slowly did you do anything with those diamonds perhaps i did and perhaps i didnt replied caprice enigmatically at all events im not going to have any more fuss made over them well goodbye at present said fenton carelessly i say you might give me a kiss after fixing up maltons affair so i willat the theatre tonight do leave me my head is so bad not so bad as you are you little devil murmured fenton closing the sittingroom door softly after him well i guess therell be no more trouble about those diamonds at all events chapter xiii the gossip of clubs it was called the skylarks club because like those tuneful birds the members were up very early in the morning not that the aforesaid members were early risers by any meansbut because they never went to bed till three or four oclock to put it plainly they stayed up nearly all night and it seemed to be a point of honour with them that as long as a quorum were on the premises the club should be kept open most of the members were dissipated and led fast lives drank a good deal gambled away large sums betted freely and to all appearances were going to the dogs as fast as they possibly could the code of morality was not very strict and the skylarks generally viewed each others good or bad luck in a cynical manner occasionally a member disappeared from his accustomed place and it was generally understood he had gone under or in other words was vegetating on some upcountry station doubtless cursing the skylarks freely as the cause of his ruin other clubs in melbourne were fastnot a doubt about thatbut every one declared that the skylarks overstepped all bounds of decency whatever devilment was to be done they would do it and as they had no characters to lose they generally amused themselves by trying to destroy other peoples good name and generally succeeded it was a bohemian club and among its members were stockbrokers musicians journalists and actors so that whatever the moral tone of the place the conversation was generally brilliant albeit rather malicious one way and another there was a good deal of money floating about for if the members worked hard at business during the day they also worked hard at pleasure during the night so systematically burned the candle at both ends fay ce que vouldras was their motto and they certainly carried it out to the very last letter keith stewart was a member of this delectable fraternity having been introduced by ezra lazarus and thanks to his mysterious five hundred pounds was able to cut a very decent figure among the members he was still in the pawnbrokers office although he very much wanted to leave it but having passed his word to old lazarus to stay six months he was determined to do so it was now about three months since the diamond robbery and after being a nine days wonder it had passed out of the minds of every one nothing more was heard of the theft and after a great number of surmises more or less wrong the matter was allowed to drop as a new divorce case of a novel character now engrossed the public mind prince carnival had been withdrawn after a very successful run and kitty marchurst was now appearing in eblis which as she expected had turned out a failure under these circumstances prince carnival was revived pending the production of faust upset a new burlesque by messrs stewart and lazarus both these young men had worked hard at the piece and mortimer having approved of the first act had determined to put the play on the stage first because he saw it was by no means a bad piece and secondly he had nothing else handy to bring forward if he could have obtained a new and successful operabouffe from london faust upset would have been ignominiously shelved but luckily for keith and his friends all the late operabouffes had been failures so mortimer made a virtue of necessity and gave them a chance it was about eleven oclock at night and the smokingroom of the skylarks was full some of the members had been there for some hours others had dropped in after the theatres were closed and here and there could be seen a reporter scribbling his notes for publication next day a luxurious apartment it was with lounging chairs covered with crimson plush plenty of mirrors and a number of marbletopped tables which were now covered with various beverages every one was talking loudly and the waiters were flitting about actively employed in ministering to the creature comforts of the patrons of the club what with the dusky atmosphere caused by the smoking the babel of voices the jingle of glasses and the constant moving about of the restless crowd it looked like some fantastic nightmare keith was seated in a corner smoking a cigarette and waiting for ezra who had promised to meet him there and in the meantime was idly watching the crowd of his friends and listening to their gossip malton was also lounging about the room chatting to his friends on current topics anything going on in the house asked pelk a theatrical critic of slingsby who had just entered that gentleman shrugged his shoulders a slanging match as usual he replied taking a seat and ringing the bell some members have got an idea that abuse is wit i dont think much of the victorian parliament its better than the new south wales one at all events said keith smiling thats not saying much retorted slingsby lighting a cigar the sydney men are more like fractious children than anything else though to be sure thats only proper seeing our parliaments are nurseries for sucking politicians thats severe but truethe truth is always disagreeable perhaps thats the reason so few people speak it exactlytruth is a sour old maid whom nobody wants not you at all events slingsby noits a matter of choicevideo meliora proboque deteriora sequor dont be

much older since the hansom cab murder case but as lively as ever entered the room and danced up to the coterie well gentlemen he said gaily what is the news good news bad news and such news as youve never heard of quoted keith lazily thank you my local gratiano replied felix quickly recognising the quotation as from the merchant of venice by the way theres a letter for you outside oh thanks said stewart rising ill go and get it and he sauntered out lazily humph ejaculated felix looking after him our friend is the author of faust upset i understand yes replied toltby deuced good piece that

our friend is rather sweet there so is she said felix significantly case of reciprocity dear boy shes given fenton the goby yes and meddlechip is elevated to the vacancy wonder how long it will be before she breaks him oh even with her talents for squandering caprice cant burst up the richest man in victoria said slingsby vulgarly when she does give him up i suppose stewart will succeed him not enough cash pooh what is cash compared to love eh a good deal in this case as fenton found out speak of the devil said felix quickly here comes the gentleman in question fenton looking harassed and worn entered the room and glanced round seeing rolleston he came over to him and began to talk guess you look happy boys he said in his nasal voice its more than you do replied rolleston scanning him keenly no ive overworked myself said fenton coolly i need pulling up a bit go and see a doctortry tonics ah bah glass of champagne will fix me straight here waiter bring in a bottle of heidsieck any of you boys join all the boys assenting to the hospitable proposition fenton ordered two bottles and lighted a huge cigar when the waiter came back with the wine keith also entered with a soft look on his face which puzzled rolleston he had put on his overcoat ah said that astute gentleman you look pleasedyour letter was pleasant yes very replied keith laconically then it was from a woman said fenton humph thats generally anything but pleasant grunted slingsby no doubt to such a don juan as you said pelk amid a general laugh the waiter was opening the wine so slowly that fenton lost patience and snatched one bottle up from the table guess we had better fix those two up at once he said any one got a knife keith put his hand in his pocket and produced therefrom megs present great csar what a pigsticker said fenton holding it up what made you buy such a thing stewart asked felix laughing i didnt buy it replied keith its a present from a lady a very young lady i should say said slingsby drily not much idea of taste matter of opinion said keith serenely i like the knife for the sake of the donorher names on the handle fenton by this time had opened the bottle and laid the knife down on the table from whence felix picked it up and examined it from meg he read in an amused tone gad stewart i thought it was the mother not the daughter fenton shot a fiery glance at keith who laughed in rather an embarrassed manner it was just the childs whim he said laughing i saved her from the tramcar so she gave me this as a souvenir and taking up the knife he shut it with a sharp click and slipped it into his overcoat pocket when they had all finished the wine fenton said he had to see mortimer about some business halfpast ten he said looking at his watch theyll just be about through ive got to see mortimer tonight observed keith and im waiting here for lazarus about the new play i reckon said fenton well youd better walk up with me keith shook his head no thanks i must wait for lazarus then come and have a game of billiards in the meantime said felix rising take off your coat youll find it hot all right assented keith readily here alfred and slipping off his coat handed it to a waiter who was just passing hang this up for me the waiter took the coat threw it over his arm and vanished while keith and felix strolled leisurely away in the direction of the billiardroom how the deuce does stewart run it asked fenton looking after them he cant get much salary at old lazarus place case of god tempering the wind to the shorn lamb said slingsby ironically hang it i dont think he ought to be a member of the club a confounded pawnbrokers clerk it is rather a topsyturvy business aint it but you see in the colonies jacks as good as his master and in some cases a deal better said pelk referring to the relative positions of malton and fenton particularly when jacks got a pretty wife finished toltby significantly fenton knew this was a hint at his penchant for mrs malton but he did not very well see how he could take it to himself particularly when he saw every one smiling so he smiled back saturninely at the circle youre devilish witty boys he said coldly guess the wine has sharpened your brains as he strolled away in his usual cool manner slingsby looked after him our friends hard hit over mrs malton he said at length every one knows that grinned toltby except the husband yes the husband is generally the last to find out these things remarked pelk drily and the conversation ended meanwhile rolleston and keith were playing their game of billiards a pastime in which the former was an adept and soon defeated keith who threw down his cue in half anger you always win he said pettishly its no use playing with you oh yes it is said felix cheerfully i know im a good player so if you play with me it will improve you very muchthat remark sounds conceited but its truecome and have another game not tonight replied keith ive got to keep my appointment with mortimerits no use waiting for lazarus oh yes it is cried a new voice and lazarus made his appearance at the door of the billiardroom im sorry for having kept you waiting but it was unavoidable ill tell you all about it as we walk up all right replied keith and turned to go followed by ezra who nodded to rolleston goodnight cried that gentleman making a cannon good luck be with you amen responded keith laughing and disappeared with ezra chapter xiv a struggle for fame the two young men walked slowly up the street in the direction of the bonbon theatre passing into swanston street just as the town hall clock struck eleven it was a beautiful moonlight night but no breeze was blowing and the heat which the earth had drawn to her bosom during the day was now exhaled from the warm ground in a faint humid vapour crowds of people were in the streets sauntering idly along evidently unwilling to go to bed the great buildings stood up white and spectrallike on the one side of the street while on the other they loomed out black against the clear sky the garish flare of the innumerable street lamps seemed out of place under the serene splendour of the heavens and the frequent cries of the street boys and noisy rattling of passing cabs jarred on the ear at least keith thought so for after walking in silence for some time he turned with a gesture of irritation to his companion isnt this noise disagreeable he said impatiently under such a perfect sky the city ought to lie dead like a fantastic dream of the arabian nights but the gas lamps and incessant restlessness of melbourne vulgarises the whole thing poetical certainly replied ezra rousing himself from his abstraction but i should not care to inhabit an enchanted city to me there is something grand in this restless crowd of people all instinct with life and ambitionthe gas lamps jar on your dream but they are evidences of civilisation and the hoarse murmur of the mob is like the mutterings of a distant storm or white waves breaking on a lonely coast no my friend leave the enchanted cities to dreamland and live the busy life of the nineteenth century your ideas and wishes are singularly at variance said keith smiling the city suggests poetical thoughts to you but you reject them and lower yourself to the narrow things of everyday i am a man and must live as one replied the jew with a sigh its hard enough to do soheaven knowswithout creating paradises at whose doors we must ever stand like lost peris whats the matter with you tonight asked keith abruptly nothing particular only ive had a quarrel with my father is that all my dear lazarus your father lives in an atmosphere of quarrellingits bread and meat to himso you neednt fret over a few words what was the quarrel about money humphgenerally a fruitful cause of dissension tell me all about it you know how i love rachel said lazarus quietly well i am anxious to marry her and have a home of my own its weary work living in tents like a bedouin i get a good salary its true but i asked my father to give me a sufficient sum of ready money to buy a piece of land and a house i might have saved myself the troublehe refused and we had angry words so parted in anger i wouldnt bother about it if i were you said keith consolingly words break no bonesbesides this burlesque may bring us a lot of money and then you can marry rachel when you please i dont expect much money out of it replied the jew with a frown its our first piece and mortimer will drive a hard bargain with usbut you seem very hopeful tonight i have cause to eugnie has written me a letter in which she says she is coming to melbourne thats good news indeed is she going to stay i think so said keith gaily i told you she was a governess so she has replied to an advertisement in the argus and hopes to get the situation i trust she will observed ezra smiling at keiths delight she will do you a lot of good by her presence and guard you from the spells of armida alias caprice thanks for the warning but ive not been ensnared by the fair enchantress yet and never mean to but here we are at the theatre i hope we get good terms from mortimer so do i for rachels sake we are both preux chevaliers anxious to gain for our ladyloves not fame but money oh base desire it may be base but its very necessary replied the prudent jew and they both entered the stagedoor of the theatre mortimers sanctum was a very wellfurnished room displaying considerable taste on the part of the occupant for the manager of the bonbon was sybaritic in his ideas the floor was covered with a heavy velvet carpet and the walls adorned with excellent pictures while the furniture was all chosen for comfort as well as for ornament mortimer was seated at his desk with a confused mass of papers before him and leaning back in a chair near him was caprice who looked rather pale and worn there was a lamp on the table with a heavy shade which concentrated all the light into a circle and kittys pale face with its aureole of fair hair seen in the powerful radiance appeared strange and unreal dark circles under her heavy eyes faint lines round the small mouth and the weary look now habitual to her all combined to give her face a wan and spiritual look which made even mortimer shiver as he looked at her hang it kitty he said roughly dont look so dismal you ought to see a doctor what for she asked listlessly im quite well humph i dont think so youve been going down the hill steadily the last few months look how thin you area bag of bones so was rachel replied caprice with a faint smile well she didnt live very long besides you aint rachel growled mortimer and i dont want you to get ill just now no you could hardly supply my place said caprice with a sneer dont you bother yourself mortimer im not going to die yet when i do i shant be sorry life hasnt been so pleasant to me that i should wish to live i dont know what you want grumbled the manager youve got all melbourne at your feet i cant say much for melbournes morality then retorted caprice bitterly circumstances have made me what i am but im getting tired of the cakes and ale business if i could only secure the future of my child id turn religious mary magdalen yes a case of history repeating itself isnt it she replied with a harsh laugh strange said mortimer scrutinising her narrowly the worse a woman is in her youth the more devout she becomes in her old age on the authority of m de la rochefoucauld i suppose answered caprice old age gives good advice when it no longer can give bad example who told you that a man you never knewvandeloup i dont know that my not being acquainted with him was much to be regretted no i dont think it was replied caprice coolly he had twice your brainsto know him was a liberal education in cheap cynicism gad youve been an apt pupil kitty laughed and rising from her seat began to walk to and fro i wish those boys would come she said restlessly i want to go home then go said mortimer you neednt stay oh yes i need she replied i want to see that they get good terms for their play ill give them a fair price said mortimer but im not going to be so liberal as you expect ive no doubt of that i believe youre sweet on that stewart perhaps i am meddlechip wont like that pish i dont care two straws for meddlechip no but you do for his money of course that goes without saying youre a hardened little devil caprice god knows ive had enough to make me hard she replied bitterly throwing herself down in her chair with a frown there was a knock at the door at this moment and in reply to mortimers invitation to come in ezra and keith appeared well you two are late said mortimer glancing at his watch a quarterpast eleven im very sorry said ezra quietly but it was my fault i was telling stewart about some business well we wont take long to settle this affair remarked mortimer looking over his papers be seated gentlemen keith took off his overcoat and threw it over the back of a chair on which kittys furlined mantle was already resting caprice who had flushed up on the advance of stewart leaned back in her chair while keith sat down near her and ezra took a position opposite close to mortimer now then gentlemen said mortimer playing with a papercutter about this burlesquewhat is your opinion thats rather a curious question to ask an author replied keith gaily we naturally think it excellent i hope the public will think the same observed mortimer drily but i dont mean that i want to know your terms of course said ezra smoothly but just tell us what you are prepared to give im buyer gentlemen you are sellers replied the manager shrewdly i cant take up your position kitty leaned back in her chair and bent over close to keiths ear ask five pounds a night she whispered stewart glanced at ezra and seeing he was in doubt as to what to say spoke out loudly speaking for myself and partner i think well take five pounds a night yes ill agree to that observed ezra eagerly ive no doubt you will rejoined mortimer raising his eyebrows thats thirty pounds a week fifteen pounds apiecea very nice sum gentlemenif you get it then what do you propose to give asked keith one pound for every performance stewart laughed do you take us for born fools he asked angrily no i do not replied mortimer catching his chin between finger and thumb and looking critically at the two young men i take you for very clever boys who are just making a start and im willing to help youat my own pricewhich is one pound a night the games not worth the candle said ezra in a disappointed tone oh yes it is retorted mortimer it gives you a chance now look here ive no desire to take advantage of my position which as you see is a very strong one in what way asked caprice elevating her eyebrows mortimer explained in his slow voice as followsi can write home to london and get successful plays with big reputations already made yes and pay big prices for them that may be replied the manager imperturbably but if i give a good price i get a good article that is sure to recoup me for my outlay i dont say that faust upset isnt good but at the same time its an experiment australians dont like their own raw material they never get the chance of seeing it said keith bitterly you of course look at it from a business point of view as is only proper but seeing that you draw all your money from colonial pockets why not give colonial brains a chance because colonial brains dont pay colonial pockets do said mortimer coolly besides i am giving you a chance and that at considerable risk to myself i will put on this burlesque in good style because caprice is dead set on it but business is business and i cant afford to lose money on an untried production suppose it turns out a great success said ezra we the authors only make six pounds a week while you take all the profits certainly retorted mortimer ive taken the risk then if we make a great success of this burlesque said keith you will give us better terms for the next thing we write well yes said the manager in a hesitating manner but of course though your position is improved mine is still the same i understand as long as you have the run of the london market you can treat colonial playwrights as you choose youve stated the case exactly its an unfair advantage no doubt but business is business i hold the trump card its a bad lookout for the literary and musical future of australia when such men as you hold the cards said ezra gloomily but its no use arguing the case ive heard all this sort of thing before the australians are too busy making money to trouble about such a contemptible thing as literary work ill tell you what mortimer broke in caprice give them two pounds a night for the piece not i yes you will or i dont show at the bonbon you forget your engagement my dear said mortimer complacently no i dont retorted kitty snapping her fingers that for my engagement i dont care if i broke it tomorrow youve got your remedy no doubt try it and see what youll make of it mortimer looked uneasily at her he knew he had the law on his side but caprice was so reckless that she cared for nothing and would do what she pleased in spite of both him and the law besides he could not afford to lose her so he met her half way tell you what he said genially ive no wish to be hard on you boysill give you one pound a night for a week and if the burlesque is a success two poundsthere thats fair i suppose its the best terms we can get said keith recklessly anything for the chance of having a play put on the stage what do you say lazarus i accept replied the jew briefly in that case said kitty rising i neednt stay any longer mr lazarus will you take me to my carriage allow me said keith advancing kitty recoiled and an angry light flashed in her eyes no thank you she said coldly snatching up her cloak mr lazarus will see me down and without another word she swept out of the room followed by ezra who was much astonished at the rebuff keith had received whats that for asked mortimer looking up i thought you were the white boy there im sure i dont know said keith in a puzzled tone she has been rather cold to me for the last three months but she never snubbed me till now oh shes never the same two minutes together said mortimer turning once more to his desk have a drink keith nodded whereupon mortimer who was the most hospitable of men brought forth whisky and seltzer as he was filling the glasses ezra reentered with keiths coat caprice carried this downstairs with her by mistake he said giving it to keith and called me back to return it gad she went off in such a whirlwind of passion i dont wonder she took it im glad she left the chair said mortimer coolly will you join us no thanks replied ezra putting on his hat ive got to go back to the office goodnight see you tomorrow keith you can settle with mortimer about the agreement and thereupon he vanished keith and mortimer sat down and the latter drafted out an agreement about the play which he promised to send to his lawyer and then if the young men approved of it the whole affair could be settled right off this took a considerable time and it was about halfpast twelve when keith having said goodnight to mortimer left the theatre he walked down collins street smoking his cigarette and thinking about his good luck and eugnie how delighted she would be at his success he would make lots of money and then he could marry her after wandering about for some considerable time he turned homeward walking up bourke street he entered russell street and went on towards east melbourne passing along in front of lazarus shop he saw a man leaning against the door what are you doing there asked keith sharply going up to him the man struck out feebly with his fists and giving an indistinct growl lurched heavily against keith who promptly knocked him down and had a tussle with him the moon was shining brightly and as the light fell on his face keith recognised him instantlyit was randolph villiers youd better go home villiers he said quickly raising him to his feet youll be getting into trouble go to devil said mr villiers in a husky voice lurching into the centre of the street im out on business i know what i know and if you knew what i knew youd know a loteh wouldnt you and he leered at stewart pah youre drunk said stewart in disgust turning on his heel youd better get home or youll get into some mischief no i wont growled villiers but i know some un as will who oh i knowi know retorted villiers and went lurching down the street setting the words to a popular tune i know a thing or two yes i dojust a few keith looked at the drunken man rolling heavily down the streeta black misshapen figure in the moonlightand then turning away with a laugh walked thence to east melbourne thinking of eugnie chapter xv the russell street crime the next morning a rumour crept through the city that a murder had been committed in a house in russell street and many people proceeded to the spot indicated to find out if it were true they discovered that for once rumour had not lied and lazarus the pawnbroker one of the best known characters in the city had been found dead in his bed with his throat cut the house being guarded by the police who were very reticent no distinct information could be gained and it was not until the penny whistle came out at four oclock that the true facts of the crime were ascertained a general rush was made by the public for copies of the paper and by nightfall nothing was talked of throughout melbourne but the russell street crime the version given by the penny whistle which was written by a highly imaginative reporter was as follows and headed by attractive titles terrible crime in russell street lazarus has passed in his checks an unknown assassin is in our midst it is often said that truth is stranger than fiction and we have now an excellent illustration of this proverb a crime has been committed before which the marvellous romances of gaboriau sink into insignificance and the guilty wretch who has stained his soul with murder is still at large the bare facts of the case are as follows early this morning it was noticed by a policeman that the shop of lazarus a wellknown pawnbroker was not opened and knowing the methodical habits of the old man the policeman was much surprised however thinking that lazarus might have overslept himself he passed on and had gone but a few yards when a boy called isaiah jacobs rushed into the street from an alley which led to the back of the house the lad was much terrified and it was with considerable difficulty that the policeman elicited from him the following story he had come to his work as usual at eight oclock and went round to the back door in order to get into the house this door was generally open and lazarus waiting for him but on this morning it was closed and although the boy knocked several times no response was made he then noticed that the window which is on the lefthand side of the door going in was wide open and becoming impatient he climbed up to it and looked in to see if the old man was asleep to his consternation he saw lazarus lying on the floor in a pool of blood and seized with a sudden terror he dropped from the window and rushed into the street on hearing this the policeman sent him for sergeant mansard who soon arrived on the scene with several other members of the force they went round to the back and found the door closed and the window open as the boy had described having tried the door and found it locked the police burst it open and entered the house to view a scene which baffles description the murdered man was lying nearly nude in the middle of the room in a pool of blood his throat was cut from ear to ear and judging from the bruises and cuts on his hands and arms there must have been a terrible struggle before the murderer accomplished his act the bedclothes all stained with blood were lying half on the bed and half on the floor so that it is surmised that the deceased must have been attacked while asleep and woke suddenly to fight for his life a large iron safe which stood near the head of the bed was wide open the keys being in the lock and all the drawers pulled out a lot of papers which had evidently been in the safe were lying on the floor but in spite of a rigid examination no money could be found so it is presumed that the murder was effected for the sake of robbery on one sheet of the bed were several stains of blood as if the assassin had wiped his hands thereon but the weapon with which the crime was committed cannot be found a door looking into the shop was closed and bolted so the murderer must have made his entry through the window and departing the same way forgot to close it the body of the deceased has been removed to the morgue and an inquest will be held today the case has been placed in the hands of detective naball who is now on the spot taking such notes as he deems necessary for the elucidation of this terrible mystery hereunder will be found a plan of the room in which the murder was committed and also the alley leading to the street we wish our readers to take particular note of this as we wish to give our theory as to the way in which the murderer went about his diabolical work russell street shop alley a c fireplace b f g e d illustration diagram of pawn shop a door leading into shopfound bolted b bed with clothes in disorder c safe found open with all valuables abstracted d window found open by which assassin probably entered e door leading to alleyfound locked f alley leading to street by which entrance was gained to back of house g place where body of murdered man was discovered in the first place there is no doubt that the motive of the crime was robbery as is proved by the open safe rifled of its contents the murderer evidently knew that lazarus slept in the back room and had the keys of the safeas we have since ascertainedunder his pillow he must also have known the position of the safe and bed for had he groped about for them he would have awakened the old man who would have instantly have given the alarm the window d is about five feet from the ground and was fastened with an ordinary catch as it never seemed to have entered the old mans head that an attempt would be made to rob him our theory is that the murderer is a man who knew the deceased and had been frequently in the back room so as to assure himself of the position of things last night he must have entered the alleyat what hour we are not prepared to say as the time of the murder can only be determined by medical evidenceand opened the window by slipping the blade of his knife between the upper and lower parts and pushing back the latch he then climbed softly into the room and going straight to the bed found the deceased asleep very likely he did not intend to kill him had he slept on but in trying to abstract the keys from under the pillow lazarus must have sprung up and tried to give the alarm instantly the murderers clutch was on his throat but the old man struggling off the bed fought with terrible strength for his life the struggle took them into the centre of the room and there lazarus becoming exhausted must have fallen and the murderer with diabolical coolness must have cut his throat so as to effectually silence him then taking the keys from under the pillow he must have opened the safe taken what he wished and made his escape through the window and from thence into the street probably no one was about and he could slink away unperceived for had he met any one his clothes spotted with the blood of his victim would have attracted attention we conclude he must have had a dark lantern in order to see the contents of the safe but as none has been found he must have taken it with him together with the knife with which the crime was committed this is all we can learn at the present time but whether any sounds of a struggle were heard can only be discovered from the witnesses at the inquest tomorrow of one thing we are certain the murderer cannot escape as his bloodstained clothes must necessarily have been noticed by even the most casual observer we will issue a special edition of the penny whistle tomorrow with a full account of the inquest and the witnesses examined thereat chapter xvi the inquest there was naturally a great deal of excitement over the murder as apart from the magnitude of the crime lazarus was a wellknown character in melbourne he knew more secrets than any priest and many a person of apparently spotless character felt a sensation of relief when they heard that the old jew was dead lazarus was not the sort of man to keep a diary so to many people it was fortunate that he had died unexpectedly and carried a number of disagreeable secrets with him to the grave the report of the inquest was followed with great interest for though it was generally thought that robbing was the motive for the crime yet some hinted that considering the character of the old man there might be more cogent reasons for the committal of the murder one of these sceptics was naball in whose hands the case had been placed for elucidation i dont believe it was robbery he said to a brother detective old lazarus knew a good many dangerous secrets and i wouldnt be a bit surprised to find that the murderer was some poor devil whom he had in his power but the open safe said the detective pish that can easily be accounted for there may have been papers implicating the murderer or the robbery might have been a blind oroh theres dozens of reasonshowever well find it all out at the inquest in opening the proceedings the coroner mentioned all the circumstances in connection with the murder which had come to the knowledge of the police and said that as yet no clue had been found likely to lead to the detection of the assassin but without doubt the evidence of the witnesses about to be examined would afford some starting point the first witness called was the policeman who had found the body and he deposed to the circumstances which led to the discovery he was succeeded by dr chisholm who had examined the body of the deceased and having been sworn in the usual manner deposed as follows i am a duly qualified medical practitioner i have examined the body of the deceased it is that of an old mani should say about seventy years of agevery badly nourished i found hardly any food in the stomach there were many bruises and excoriations on the body which i have no doubt are due to the struggle between the murderer and his victim i examined the neck back and limbs but could find no fractures the throat was cut evidently by some very sharp instrument as the windpipe was completely severed i examined the body about nine oclock in the morningit was then warm and according to my belief the deceased must have been dead eight or nine hours coronerare you certain of that dr chisholmnot absolutely it is a very difficult thing to tell exactly by the temperature of the body what length of time has elapsed since death after a sudden and violent death the body often parts with its heat slowly as i think it has done in this case besides the night was very hot which would be an additional reason for the body cooling slowly coronerwas the body rigid when you examined it dr chisholmyes rigor mortis had set in it generally occurs within six hours of death but it might occur earlier if there had been violent muscular exertion as there was in this case i think that the deceased was awakened from his sleep and struggled with his murderer till he became exhausted then the murderer cut his throat with a remarkably sharp knife coronerand according to your theory death took place about midnight dr chisholmyesi think so but as i said before it is very difficult to tell the next witness called was isaiah jacobs who gave his evidence in an aggressively shrill voice but the coroner was unable to elicit more from him than had already been published in the penny whistle after the echo of the young israelites shrill voice had died away keith stewart was sworn and deposed as follows i was clerk to the deceased and had occupied the position for some months on the day previous to the murder i had received a hundred pounds in twenty bank notes of five pounds each which i gave to the deceased and saw him place them in his safe he always slept on the premises and kept his keys under his pillow he told me that he always had a loaded revolver on the table beside his bed on the night or rather morning of the murder i was passing along russell street on my way home i saw a man standing near the shop i knew him as randolph villiers i asked him what he was doing but could get no very decided answerhe was quite intoxicated and went off down the street coronerabout what time was this stewarttwo oclock coroneryou are certain stewartquitei heard it striking from the town hall tower coronerwas villiers intoxication real or feigned stewartreal as far as i could see coronerit was a moonlight night i believe stewartyes the moon was very bright coronerdid you notice anything peculiar about villiers was he confused were his clothes in disorder any marks of blood stewartno i saw nothing extraordinary about him he is generally more or less drunk so i did not notice him particularly coroneri believe mr stewart you belong to the skylarks club stewarti do coronerand yet you are a clerk in a pawnbrokers officearent the two things rather incongruous stewartno doubt but i am in a position to be a member of the skylarks club and as to being a clerk to lazarus its merely a matter of honour when he engaged me he stipulated that i should stay for six months and though i unexpectedly came in for some money i felt myself bound in honour to keep my agreement coronerthank you that will do mr stewart call mrs tibsey that lady large redfaced and energetic was sworn and gave her evidence in a voluble manner she had evidently been drinking as there was a strong odour of gin in the air and kept curtseying to the coroner every time she answered my names tibsey my lordmaria tibsey ive bin married twice my first being called bliggings and died of gunpowderblowed up in a quarry explosion my second also dead sir ad no lungs and a corf which tored him to bits only one child sir tilda bliggings out in service my lord coroneryes yes mrs tibsey we dont want to learn all these domestic affairs come to the point mrs tibseyabout sating siri called im sating sir cause he were a robber of the widder and orfinme sir and my darter i was atalking to my darter on that night your worships she aving visited me i lives near old sating as it was andy to drop in to pop anything and about twelve i eard a

worship it werent my bisiniss i didnt think it were murder coroneryou are quite sure it was twelve oclock mrs tibseyi swears hit miss matilda bliggings was then called and deposed she also heard the scream and that her mother had said it must be old lazarus it was twelve oclock ezra lazarus was then called but could give no material evidence he said he had quarrelled with his father on the day preceding the murder and had not seen him since the next witness called caused a sensation as it was none other than mr randolph villiers who stated my name is villiers i do nothing i know old lazarus i was passing through russell street and leaned up against the shop doori was drunkon my way to little bourke street i remember meeting mr stewartthink it was two but aint sure coronerwhere were you before you met mr stewart villiersabout the town somewhere coroneralone villierssometimes i was sometimes i wasnt this ended all the evidence procurable and the coroner summed up the crime had evidently been committed for the purpose of robbery as the hundred pounds which mr stewart swore had been placed in the safe by the deceased were gone the knife with which the deed had been committed had not yet been found in fact all the evidence was of the barest character according to dr chisholms evidence the deceased had been murdered about midnight and as mrs tibsey and her daughter heard a scream also at that time all the evidence seemed to point to that hour as having been the time of death mr stewart met villiers at two oclock and villiers stated that he had only been in russell street a few minutes before he met mr stewart the jury would be kind enough to bring in a verdict in accordance with the facts before them the jury had a long argument some wanted to bring in a charge of murder against villiers as he certainly had not accounted for his presence in russell street but the evidence altogether was so vague that they at length came to the conclusion it would be best to leave the matter to the police and brought in a verdict that the deceased had met his death at the hands of some person or persons unknown great dissatisfaction was expressed by the public at this verdict as in the opinion of most people villiers was the guilty man a regular battle was fought in the newspapers over the whole affair but one man said nothing that man was naball chapter xvii a council of three when the inquest was over naball went straight home and carefully read all the notes he had taken of the evidence given after doing so he came to the conclusion that the person on whom most suspicion rested was keith stewart in the first place said naball thoughtfully eyeing his papers stewart was the clerk of old lazarus and knew what was in the safe and where the keys were kept he is a member of an expensive club which he cant possibly afford to pay for out of his salary as a clerk as to his coming in for money thats boshif he had agreement or no agreement he wouldnt have remained with old lazarus he states that he left the theatre at halfpast twelve and the doctor says the death took place at midnight but then he wasnt sure and it might have taken place at halfpast one which would give stewart time to commit the crime he could not account for his time between leaving the theatre and seeing villiers except by saying he had been walking which is a very weak explanation humph i think ill see mr stewart and ask him a few questions mr naball glanced at himself in the mirror arranged the set of his tie dusted his varnished boots and then sallied forth in search of keith passing along swanston street he went into a florists and purchased himself a smart buttonhole of white flowers then held a short council of war with himself as to where to find stewart wonder where he lives muttered the detective in perplexity let me see whats the time glancing at his watchnearly five hes a great friend of mr lazarus and i know lazarus is subeditor of the penny whistle ill go along and ask himhes sure to be in just now he walked rapidly along to the newspaper office and being admitted to ezras room found that young man just putting on his coat preparatory to going away his labours for the day now being concluded well mr naball asked ezra in his soft voice what can i do for youanything about this unfortunate affair yes said naball bluntly i want to see mr stewart oh you do broke in a new voice and stewart stepped out of an adjoining room where he had been waiting for his friend what is the matter nothing much observed naball in a frank voice but as this case has been put into my hands i want to ask you a few questions am i in the way asked lazarus taking up his hat by no means replied naball politely in fact you may be of assistance well fire away said keith coolly lighting a cigarette im ready to answer anything naball glanced keenly at both the young men before he began to talk and noted their appearance keith had a rather haggard look as though he had been leading a dissipated life while ezras face looked careworn and pale cut up over his fathers death i guess said naball to himself poor chapbut as for the other it looks like late hours and drink i must find out all about your private life mr stewart im waiting said keith impatiently i wish you wouldnt keep me very long ive got to meet a train from the country tonight naball closed both doors of the room and resuming his seat looked steadily at keith who seated astride a chair leaned his elbows on the back and smoked nonchalantly are you aware asked naball deliberately if the late mr lazarus had any enemies i can answer that question best said ezra quickly before keith could speak yes he had plenty my father as you know was a moneylender as well as a pawnbroker and as he took advantage of his possession of money to extort high interest i know it made a lot of people feel bitter against him considering that you are his son sir said naball in a tone of rebuke you do not speak very well of the dead i have not much cause to rejoined ezra bitterly he was father to me in name only but you need not make any commentsmy duty to my fathers memory is between myself and my conscience i have answered your questionhe had many enemies so i believe also said keith slowly but i dont think any one was so hostile as to desire his death as you dont think so observed naball sharply i myself believe that the murder was committed for the sake of robbery thats easily seen said ezra calmly from the fact of the safe being open and the money gone that might have been a blind retorted naball quickly but you talk of money being stolen i think mr stewart in your evidence today you said they were bank notes yes twenty tenpound notes replied keith do you know the numbers of them no i never thought of taking the numbers and you handed them to mr lazarus i did at halfpast fivehe put them in his safe were there any other valuables in the safe i dont know retorted keith coldly i was not in the confidence of my employer do you know said naball turning to ezra the young jew smiled bitterly i also was not in my fathers confidence he said so know nothing there was some gold and silver money also in the safe said keith to naball knocking the ashes off his cigarette humph thats not much guide replied the detective its the notes i wantif i could only find the numbers of those noteswhere did they come from a man at ballarat called forbes oh ill write to mr forbes of ballarat said naball making a note but if those notes are put in circulation do you know of any means by which i can identify them keith shook his head then suddenly gave a cry yes i can tell you how to identify one of the notes that will be quite sufficient said the detective eagerly how that boy isaiah said stewart hes great on backing horses and frequently tells me about racing when i was making up my cash on that night the notes were lying on the desk and as the door of mr lazarus room was open isaiah was afraid to speak aloud about his tip so he wrote it down but how can that identify the banknote asked the perplexed detective because the young scamp wrote his tip back flatiron on the back of a tenpound note in pencil asked naball no in ink so one of the notes that were stolen has the inscription back flatiron on the back of it exactly naball scribbled a line or two in his pocketbook and shut it with a snap if that note goes into circulation he said in a satisfied tone ill soon trace it to its original holder and then asked ezra and then reiterated naball quietly ill lay my hands on the man who killed your father and now mr stewart i want to ask you a few questions about yourself go on said keith imperturbably i hope you dont think i killed lazarus i thinknothing replied naball quietly i only want to find out as much as i can you were at the bonbon theatre on that night yes talking to mr mortimer any one else with you yes replied ezra i was and caprice we left about halfpast eleven and you mr stewart i left at halfpast twelve where did you go then i was excited over some business i had done and strolled about the city anywhere in particular no i went along collins street up william street round about the law courts and then came down bourke street on my way home how long were you thus wandering about i think about an hour and a half because as i turned into russell street the clock struck two why did you turn into russell street why echoed keith in surprise because i wanted to go home i went through russell street down flinders street and then walked to east melbourne past the fitzroy gardens oh and you saw villiers standing about the shop yes he was leaning against the door drunk very what did you do i ordered him off did he go yes rolled down the street towards bourke street singing some song you noticed nothing peculiar about him no was the door of the alley leading to the back open or shut i dont knowi never noticed after villiers disappeared you went home i didstraight home naball pondered for a few moments stewart certainly told all he knew with perfect frankness but then was he telling the truth do you want to ask me any more questions asked keith rising naball made up his mind and spoke out roughly i want to know how you with a small salary can afford to belong to an expensive club like the skylarks keiths face grew as black as thunder who the devil gave you permission to pry into my private affairs no one except myself retorted naball boldly for though inferior to stewart in size he by no means wanted pluck but im engaged in a serious case and it will be best for you to speak out frankly you surely dont suspect stewart of the murder interposed ezra warmly i suspect nobody retorted naball im only asking him a question and if hes wise hell answer it keith thought for a moment he saw that for some extraordinary reason or another naball suspected him so in order to be on the safe side resolved to take the detectives advice and answer the question it is as you say a serious matter he observed quietly and i am the last person in the world not to give any assistance to the finding out of the criminal ask what you please and i will answer this reply somewhat staggered naball but as he had strong suspicions about stewarts innocence he put down the apparent frankness of the answer to crafty diplomacy i only want to know he said mildly how a gentleman in your position can afford to belong to an expensive club because i can afford to do so replied keith calmly when i first came to melbourne i had no money and was engaged by mr lazarus as his clerk with the understanding i should stay with him six months to this i agreed but shortly afterwards a sum of five hundred pounds was placed to my credit and afforded me a chance of living in good style i wished to leave the pawnshop but mr lazarus reminded me of my position and i had to stay that is all who placed this five hundred to your credit asked naball i dont know you dont know echoed naball in surprise do you mean to say that a large sum like that was placed to your credit by a person whom you dont know i do and i can substantiate that statement said ezra quietly naball looked from one to the other in perplexity puzzled what to ask next then he felt the only thing to be done was to go away and think the matter over but he did not intend to lose sight of keith and this absurd statement about the five hundred only seemed to strengthen his suspicions so he determined to have him shadowed thank you mr stewart he said quietly i have nothing more to ask what time did you say you were going to meet a country train i mentioned no time replied keith sharply baffled by this answer naball tried another way will you kindly give me your address he asked pulling out his pocketbook i may want to communicate with you vances boardinghouse powlett street east melbourne mr naball noted this in his book and then with a slight nod took his leave damn him cried keith fiercely he suspects me of this crime pooh thats nonsense replied ezra as they went out you can easily prove an alibi no i cant replied keith in a hard tone from halfpast twelve oclock till two i was by myself and no one saw me i say i was wandering about the streets he thinks i was in russell street committing a murder i dont think you need be a bit afraid of anyone suspecting you said ezra bitterly why they might as well think i killed my father you yes i had a quarrel with him and then he was murdered oh i assure you they could get up an excellent case against me but you could prove an alibi thats just where it is said ezra coolly i cant why not because after leaving kitty marchurst i went down the street to the penny whistle office and found it closed i then walked home along collins street through the fitzroy gardens it was a beautiful night and as i was thinking over my quarrel with my father i sat down on one of the seats for a time so i did not get home till two oclock in the morning no one saw me and ive got quite as much difficulty in proving an alibi as you have do you think naball suspects you no nor do i think he suspects you but ive got a suspicion that he suspects some one and that some one is called randolph villiers chapter xviii circumstantial evidence when naball left the two young men he went straight to the detective office in order to get some one to look after keith stewart and see that he did not leave melbourne naball did not believe that he was going to meet any one that night and wanted to find out why he was going to the station if he wanted to give me the slip he thought he wouldnt have told me he was going to the railway stationhumph cant make out what hes up to the gentleman who was to act as mr stewarts shadow was a short rednosed man with a humbled appearance and a chronic sniffle he was sparing of words and communicated with his fellowman by a series of nods and winks which did duty with him for conversation tulch said naball when this extraordinary being appeared i want you to go to vances boardinghouse powlett street east melbourne and keep your eye on a man called keith stewart an interrogatory sniff from tulch ah i forgot you dont know his personal appearance said naball thoughtfully hes tall with fair hair wears a suit of homespunhumphthat wont do there are dozens of young men of that description heretell you what ill give you a note to deliver to him personally muffle yourself up in an ulster when you deliver it so that he wont know youunderstand mr tulch sniffed in the affirmative follow him wherever he goes and tell me what hes up to said naball scribbling a note to stewart and handing it to tulch thats allclear out a farewell sniffle and tulch was gone humph muttered naball to himself now id like to know the meaning of all thisi dont believe this cockandbull story about stewart having money left him in this mysterious mannerpeople dont do that sort of thing nowadaysi believe hes been robbing the old man for some time and was found outso silenced him by using his knife knife repeated naball thats not been found yeti must see about thisnow theres villiersi wonder if he could help me it was curious that he should have been about the shop at that special timehes a bad lotgad ill go and see what i can find out from him knowing mr villiers habits he had no difficulty in discovering his whereabouts ah goons was where villiers generally dwelt so after naball had partaken of a nice little dinner he went off to little bourke street it was now between seven and eight oclock which was the time villiers generally dined so naball not finding him at ah goons betook himself to a cookshop in the neighbourhood to which he was directed by a solidlooking chinaman it was a lowroofed place consisting of a series of apartments all opening one into the other by squat little doorways the atmosphere was dull and smoky and the acrid smell of burning wood saluted naballs nostrils when he entered near the doorway a chinaman was rolling out rice bread to the thinness of paper then cutting it into little squares he wrapped each round a kind of sausage meat and placed the rolls thus prepared on a tray for cooking in the next apartment was a large boiler with the lid off filled with water in which ten or twelve turkeys skewered and trussed were bobbing up and down amid the froth and scum of the boiling water a crowd of chinese all chattering in their high shrill voices were moving about half seen in the smoky atmosphere through which candle and lamp light flamed feebly villiers in a kind of little cell apartment was having his supper when the detective entered before him was a large bowl filled with soup and in this were squares of thin rice bread and portions of turkey and duck mixed up into a savoury mess and flavoured with the dark brown fluid which the chinese use instead of salt oh its you growled villiers looking up with a scowl what do you want you my friend said naball cheerfully taking a seat oh do you said villiers rubbing his bleared eyes inflamed by the pungent smoke of the woodfire i spose you think i killed old lazarus no i dont retorted the detective looking straight at him but i think you know more than you tell he he grinned the other sardonically perhaps i doperhaps i dontits my business and mine also said naball somewhat nettled you forget the case is in my hands dont care whose hands its in retorted villiers finishing his soup taint any trouble of mine the detective bit his lip at the impenetrable way in which villiers met his advances suddenly a thought flashed across his mind and he bent forward with a meaning smile got any more diamonds villiers pushed back his chair from the table and stared at naball what diamonds he asked in a husky voice come now said naball with a wink we know all about thateh ah goon is a good pawnbroker isnt he ah goon gasped villiers turning a little pale yes though he did only lend twenty pounds on those diamonds look here mr jackodandy said villiers bringing his fist down on the table i dont want no beating about the bush i dont what do you mean curse you i mean that i know all about your little games replied naball leaning over the table i know caprice stole her own jewels for some purpose and gave you some of the swag to shut your mouth and i know that youre going to tell me all you know about this russell street business or by jove ill have you arrested on suspicion villiers gave a howl like a wild beast and flinging himself across the table tried to grapple with the detective but recoiled with a shriek of wrath and alarm as he saw the shining barrel of a revolver levelled at his head wont do villiers said naball smoothly try some other game whereupon villiers seeing that the detective was too strong for him sat down sulkily in his chair and after invoking a blessing on naballs eyes invited him to speak out the detective replaced the revolver in his pocket whence it could be easily seized if necessary and smiled complacently at his sullenfaced friend aha he said producing a dainty cigarette this is much better have you a light villiers flung down a lucifer match with a husky curse which naball quite disregarding took up the match and lighted his cigarette watching the blue smoke curling from his lips for a few moments he turned languidly to villiers and began to talk you see i know all about it he said quietly you were too drunk to remember that night when you tried to take a diamond crescent off that woman and i expect ah goon never told you it was you who took it then growled villiers fiercely in your own words perhaps it was perhaps it wasnt replied naball in an irritating tone at all events its quite safe you had better answer all my questions because you bear too bad a character not to be suspected of the crime particularly as you were about russell street on that night yes i was said villiers angrily and who saw mekeith stewarta mighty fine witness he is aha thought the astute naball he does know something then i could put a spoke in stewarts wheel grumbled the other viciously i dont think so replied the detective fingering his cigarette he is far above youhes got money is going to make a name by a successful play and if report speaks truly caprice loves him i dont care a farthing whether she does or not said villiers loudly shed love any one who has money stewarts got some has he where did he get it im sure i dont know i do indeed where never you mind said villiers suspiciously i know my own knowing remember what i said observed naball quietly and tell me all if i tell you all what will you do asked villiers ill save your neck from the gallows replied naball smoothly not good enough oh very well said the detective rising ive no more to say im off to the magistrate what for naball fixed his keen eyes on the bloated face of the other to get a warrant for your arrest you cant do that cant iyoull see no wait a bit said villiers in alarm i can easily prove myself innocent indeed then youd better do so now before a warrant is out for your arrest you wont give me any money not a centits not a question of money with you but life or death villiers deliberated for a moment and then apparently made up his mind sit down he said sullenly ill tell you all i know naball resumed his seat lighted a fresh cigarette and prepared to listen i was rather drunk on the night of the murder he said but not so bad as stewart thought me he saw me at the shopdoor at two oclock but i was there a quarter of an hour before did you see anything i saw the gate which led into the alley open replied villiers no one was about so i walked in what for asked naball glancing at him keenly oh nothing replied villiers indifferently the fact was i saw a policeman coming along and though i was pretty drunk id sense enough to know i might be run in so i went into the alley and closed the gate till he passed and then you came out no i didnt i walked to the back of the house just to see where it led to i saw the window wide open and looked in and saw the murdered man villiers nodded yes the moonlight was streaming in at the window and i could see quite plainly i was in a fright as i thought seeing i had no business on the premises i might be accused so i got down from the window and went off closing the gate of the alley after me it wasnt wise of you to stay about the premises said naball i know that rejoined villiers tartly but i couldnt get away because i saw stewart coming up the street just as i was wondering where to go i then pretended to be drunk so that i could get away without suspicion why didnt you run asked naball because he was too close and besides he might have given chase thinking i had been robbing the shop then with the open window and the murdered man it would have been all up with me i dont know if it isnt all up with you now said naball drily how do i know you are innocent because i know who killed lazarus the deuce you dowho stewart himself humph thats what i thought but what proof have you villiers put his hand in his pocket and brought out a large knife i found this just under the window he said handing it to naball youll see theres blood on the handle so im sure it was with it the crime was committed but how do you know its stewarts knife asked naball villiers placed his finger on one side of the handle read that he said briefly from meg read naball exactly said villiers meg is kitty marchursts child and she gave it to keith stewart by jove it looks suspicious said naball he is in possession of a large sum of money and cant tell how he got it he cant account for his time on the night of the murder and this knife with his name on it is found close to the window through which the murderer enteredhumphthings look black against him i suppose youll arrest him at once said villiers malignantly then you suppose wrong retorted naball ill have him looked after so that he wont escape but ill hold my tongue about this and so will you until when until i find out more about stewart i must discover if the knife was in his possession on the night of the murder and also if this story about his money is true again i want to wait till some of these stolen bank notes are in circulation so as to get more evidence against him but what am i to do asked villiers sulkily you are to hold your tongue said naball rising to his feet or else i may make things unpleasant for youits a good thing for your own sake you have told me all told you all muttered villiers as naball took his departure im not so sure about that chapter xix a lovers meeting it is a great blessing that the future is hidden from our anxious eyes otherwise to use a familiar expression we would go out in a coach and four to meet our troubles if keith stewart had only known that the detective suspected him of the murder of lazarus and was surely but slowly finding out strong evidence in favour of such a presumption he no doubt would have been much troubled but he thought that naballs hints at the interview were not worth thinking about for strong in the belief of his own innocence such an idea of his being accused of the crime never entered his mind in spite of the disagreeable event which had occurred keith felt very happy on this night he was young he had a good sum of money in the bank the gift of some beneficent fairy he was going to make his dbut as a dramatic author and above all he was going to see eugnie again therefore as he sat at dinner his heart was merry and to him the future looked bright and cheerful things seemed so pleasant that with the sanguine expectations of youth he began to build castles in the air if this burlesques a success he thought ill write a novel and save every penny i make then ill go to london after marrying eugnie and see if i cant make a name therewith perseverance im bound to do it poor youth he did not know the difficulty of making a name in london he was quite unaware that the literary market was overstocked and that many criticisms depend on the state of the critics liver he did not know any of these things so he went on eating his dinner and building castles in the air all of which buildings were inhabited by eugnie from these pleasant dreams he was aroused by the entrance of the housemaid a fat young person who breathed hard and rolled up to keith puffing and panting like a locomotive if you please said the young lady the man what man asked keith sharply hes waiting to see you returned the housemaid stolidly from experience keith knew it was useless to expect sense from the housemaid so he got up from the table and went out to the frontdoor where a bundle with a head at one end and a pair of boots at the other held out a letter for me asked keith taking it the bundle sniffed in an affirmative manner so stewart opened the letter and read it quickly it only contained a line from naball that if he heard of any new development of the case he would let keith know so that young gentleman wondering why the detective took the trouble to write to him slipped the letter in his pocket and nodded to the bundle all right he said quickly no answer and he shut the door in the bundles face whereupon the bundle sniffed i know him now said mr tulch to himself in a husky voice as he walked away id know im if he was dooplicated twice hover having come to this satisfactory conclusion mr tulch took up his position a short distance away and began his dreary task of watching the house and it was dreary work the long hot day was over and the long hot night had begun it was just a quarter past seven and the sky was a cloudless expanse of darkish blue blazing with stars a soft wind was whispering among the leaves of the trees and making little whirls of white dust in the road every now and then a gay party of men and women on their way to some amusement would pass the spy but he remained passively at his post watching the sunblistered varnished door of vances boardinghouse at last his patience was rewarded for somewhere about halfpast seven keith came hurriedly out and sped rapidly down the street whats he arter sniffed mr tulch stretching his cramped limbs ill ave to ketch im hup and he rolled as quickly as he was able after the tall figure of the young man a tram came along and without stopping it keith jumped on the dummythe spy breathless with running sprang on the step of the end car and got inside keeping his eye on keith the tram car went rapidly along flinders street stopping every now and then to pick up or drop passengers at which keith seemed impatient at last spencer street station was reached and keith sprang out so did tulch keeping close to his heels stewart walked impatiently up and down one of the long platforms which shortly began to fill with people expecting their friends the shrill whistle of an approaching engine was heard a red light suddenly appeared advancing rapidly and presently the long train with its lighted carriages drew up inside the station such a hurryscurry people jumping out of the train to meet those pressing forward on the platform porters calling to one another boxes rugs portmanteaus bundles all strewing the grounda babel of voices and at intervals the shrill whistle of a departing train amid all this confusion tulch missed keith and was in a terrible state for he knew what naball would say he dived hither and thither among the crowd with surprising activity and at last came in sight of stewart putting a young lady into a cab in front of which was the luggage he tried to hear the address given the cabman but was unsuccessful so he rapidly jumped into another cab and told him to follow the cabby obeyed at once and whipping up his horse which was a remarkably good one he easily kept the first cab in sight the front cab drove up collins street as far as the treasury buildings and then turned off to the left going towards fitzroy it stopped at the buttercup hotel in gertrude street and stewart alighting helped the young lady out then the luggage was taken care of by the porter of the hotel and keith with his charge vanished through the swing doors of the private entrance on seeing this tulch dismissed his cab went into the bar of an hotel on the opposite side of the street and ordering a pint of beer sat watching the door of the buttercup hotel meanwhile keith and eugnie had been shown into a private room and the landlady a stout buxom woman in a silk dress and lace cap made her appearance miss rainsford she said interrogatively advancing towards the girl yes replied eugnie brightly you are mrs scarth i suppose did you get mrs proggins letter oh yes thats all right replied the landlady nodding your room is ready and i will do anything i can for you mrs proggins is an old friend of mine and im only too happy to oblige her thank you said eugnie taking off her hat let me introduce mr stewart to you he kindly came to the station to meet me mrs scarth nodded with a smile for mrs proggins had informed her of the relationship between the two young people then observing she would go and order some tea for eugnie sailed majestically out of the room why did you introduce me to that old thing asked keith in a discontented tone policy my dear replied eugnie mildly mrs proggins wrote to her to look after me and im very glad otherwise a young lady with you as escort would hardly have found shelter for the night in this place i always like to be in favour with the powers that be eugnie rainsford was a tall darkcomplexioned girl with clearly cut features and coils of black hair twisted round the top of her wellshaped head she was dressed in a blue serge costume with a red ribbon round her throat and another round her waist a handsome girl with a pleasant smile and there was a look in her flashing dark eyes which showed that she had a will of her own keith stood beside her as fair as she was dark and a handsomer couple could not have been found in melbourne well here i am at last keith said eugnie slipping her arm through his arent you pleased to see me very replied stewart emphatically let me look at youah you are more beautiful than ever what delightful stories you do tell said eugnie with a blush i wish i could believe them now my friend let me return the compliment by looking at you she took his face between her hands and looked at it keenly beneath the searching glare of the gas then shook her head you are much paler than you used to be she said critically there are dark circles under your eyes deep lines down the side of your mouth and your face looks haggard is it work oror the other thing do you mean dissipation eugnie said keith with a smile taking a seat well i expect i have been rather dissipated but now you are here ill be a good boy have you been worried asked miss rainsford keith sighed yes very much worried over this terrible case i suppose youve seen all about it eugnie nodded yes ive read all about it in the papers now i suppose youve nothing to do nonot that i care muchyou see ive got this burlesque coming off and then theres that money the five hundred pounds said miss rainsford reflectively have you found out who sent you that no i cant imagine who did so unless it was caprice caprice yes replied keith hurriedly flushing a little the actress i told you about who is going to play the principal part in faust upset oh it was all the comment miss rainsford made but there was a world of meaning in the ejaculation from what ive heard of the lady i dont think its likely she said quietly well at all events i suppose id better use the money yes i suppose so youre not very encouraging eugnie said her lover angrily well observed the girl deliberately if you think this money came from caprice i certainly would not touch it why dont you ask her i cant shes been so disagreeable to me lately oh eugnie rainsford was of a very jealous temperament and she began to feel vaguely jealous of this actress whom keith seemed to know so well she remained silent for a few moments during which keith felt somewhat awkward he was not in love with kitty nor as far as he knew was she in love with him yet he saw that some instinct had warned eugnie against this woman come eugnie said keith putting his arm round her slender waist you mustnt be angry with me the first night we meet im not angry said the girl turning her face towards him but id like to see this caprice so you shall dearon the stage why not in private keith frowned and pulled his moustache in a perplexed manner well shes hardly a fit person for a girl to see pshaw replied eugnie impatiently im not a girl but a woman and am not afraid of anything like that and besidesbesides with hesitation im going to see her what do you mean asked keith abruptly withdrawing his arm nothing only i saw an advertisement in the paper wanting a governess for a little girl i answered it and found it was miss marchurst who wanted a governess she engaged me and im going there tomorrow no no cried keith vehemently you must notyou shall not go eugnie raised her eyes to his have you any reason for wishing me not to go yes every reasonshes a bad lot i thought you knew her so i do but men may know women of that class and women like you may not i dont agree with you said eugnie rising what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander and if you persist in wishing me not to go ill begin to think youve some reason i have none except what ive stated said keith doggedly then ill go tomorrow replied eugnie quietly at all events ive got the right to have a personal interview whether i take the situation or not you must not see her that decides it said eugnie composedly i will eugnie dont go or ill begin to think you dont trust me yes i do butbut youve been so much with this caprice lately that i want to see her i dont care two straws about her i know that but i wish to see her you intend to go i do keith snatched up his hat and stick then ill say goodbye he said angrily if you disregard my wishes so much you cant love me yes i can you are jealous of this confounded woman perhaps i am keith looked at her angrily for a momentthen dashed out of the room whereon eugnie burst out laughing what a dear old boy he is she said to herself he thinks im jealous well with a frown perhaps i am i wonder if he knew that i gave him the five hundred pounds what hed say he doesnt know that im a rich woman now so i can test his love for me im sure hes as true as steel she picked up her hat and going over to the mirror leaned her elbows on the mantelpiece looked searchingly at her beautiful face are you jealous you foolish woman she said with a laugh yes my dear you are at all events youll see your rival tomorrow im afraid ill make keith a dreadful wife she said with a sigh turning away for i think every woman is in love with him poor keith how angry he was she burst out laughing and left the room chapter xx the rivals eugnie rainsford was a very clever young woman much too clever to pass her life in the upcountry wilds of australia and no doubt she would have left her solitude in some way even had not fortune favoured her luckily however fortune did favour her and in a rather curious way for a rich sharebroker having seen her fell in love with her and wanted to marry her she however refused telling him that she was engaged to marry keith stewart whereupon he made inquiries and she told him the whole story he was so delighted with her fidelity to a poor man that he made his will in her favour feeling sure that as he had no relations she would be the most deserving person to leave it to a carriage accident killed him six months afterwards and eugnie found herself a very rich woman with as many thousands as she had pence before she took her good fortune very calmly telling no one about it not even her employers but after consultation with the lawyer she sent five hundred pounds to keith with instructions to the bank that he was not to know where it came from then she set herself to work out a little scheme she had in her head to find out if he were true to her in many of the letters he had written she had been struck with the frequent mention of one name caprice and on making inquiries found out all about the actress she bought a photograph of her and was struck with the pathetic face of a woman who was said to lead so vile a life dreading lest keith should have fallen in love with this divinity of the stage she determined to go down to melbourne and see for herself by chance however she found in a newspaper an advertisement that kitty marchurst wanted a governess for her little girl and seeing at once an excellent opportunity of finding out if her suspicions were correct wrote offering herself for the situation kitty on her side remembered the name of eugnie rainsford as that of the girl to whom keith told her he was engaged so curious to see what she was like engaged her for a governess at once eugnie was delighted when she received this letter and still in the character of a poor and friendless girl she left mr chine the lawyer to manage her property after binding him to secrecy and came down to take the situation keiths evident desire that she should not accept the situation made her all the more determined to do so and twelve oclock the next day found her in the drawingroom of caprices house waiting for the entrance of her future mistress when kitty entered the room she could not help admiring the handsome woman before her and on her part eugnie was astonished to see the bright vivacity of the melancholy face for caprices features were sad only when in repose the two women stood opposite to one another for a moment mentally making up their minds about each other kitty was the first to speak miss rainsford i believe yes i came to see you aboutabout the situation governess for my little girl said kitty nodding her head yes i want some one whom i can trust i hope you will be able to trust me caprice looked keenly at her and then burst out into a torrent of words yes i think i can trust youbut the question is will you take care of my childi mean will you accept the trust you have come from the countryyou dont know who i am yes i domiss marchurst no not miss marchurstcaprice she waited for a moment to see what effect this notorious name would have on her visitor but to her surprise eugnie simply bowed yes i know she replied caprice arose and advanced towards her you know she exclaimed vehemently and yet can sit down in the same room with a woman of my character are you not afraid ill contaminate youdo you not shrink from a pariah like menoyou do notgreat heavens with a bitter laugh sitting down again and i thought the age of miracles was pastah bah but you are only a girl my dear and dont understand eugnie arose and crossed over to her i do understand i am a woman and feel for a woman kitty caught her hand and gave a gasping cry god bless you she whispered in a husky voice then in a moment she had dashed the tears away from her eyes and sat up again in her bright resolute manner no woman has spoken so kindly as you have for many years she said quickly and i thank you i can give you my child and you will take care of her for me when i am far away what do you mean asked eugnie puzzled meanthat i am not fit to live with my child that i am going to send her to england with you that she may forget she ever had a mother but why do this said eugnie in a pitying tone when you can keep her with you i cannot let her grow up in the atmosphere of sin i live in then why not leave this sinful life and go to england with your child kitty shook her head with a dreary smile impossibleto leave off this life would kill me besides i saw a doctor some time ago and he told me i had not very long to live there is something wrong with my heart i dont care if i do die so long as my child is safeyou will look after her yes replied eugnie firmly i will look after her kitty approached her timidly may i kiss you she said faintly and seeing her answer in the girls eyes she bent down and kissed her forehead now i must introduce you to your new pupil she said cheerfully overcoming her momentary weakness wait a moment said eugnie as caprice went to the bellpull i want to ask you about mr stewart caprice turned round quickly yeswhatabout him does he love you caprice came over to the fire and looked closely at her you are the girl he is engaged to yes then make your mind easy my dear he loves no one but you eugnie gave a sigh of relief at which kitty smiled a little scornfully ah you love him so much as that she said half pathetically its a pity my dear hes not worth it what do you mean dont be angry miss rainsford said kitty quietly i dont mean that he loves any one else but hes not the man i took him for i dont understand i wouldnt try to if i were you replied kitty significantly i helped him when i first met him because he saved my childs life he came down here and i liked him still more you loved him no love and i parted company long ago i liked him but though i do my best to help him i dont care for him so much as i did my dear hes not worthy of you thats all very well but i dont see the reason of course not what woman in love ever does see reason however make your mind easy things are all right i will tell you the reason some day but i want to know now curiosity is a womans vice said kitty lightly dont worry yourself miss rainsford whatever i know of keith stewart wont alter him in your eyesnow dont say anything more about it ill ring for meg eugnie tried to get a more explicit answer out of her but kitty only laughed it cant be anything so very bad she said to herself or this woman would not laugh at it meg came in quietly a demure pensivefaced little child and after kitty had kissed her she presented her to eugnie this is your new governess meg she said smoothing the childs hair and i want you to love her very much meg hung back for a few moments with the awkward timidity of a child but eugnies soft voice and caressing manner soon gained her confidence i like you very much she said at length nestling to eugnies side as much as mumsey meg said kitty with a sad smile oh nevernever as much as mumsey cried meg leaving her newfound friend for her mother theres no one so good and kind as mumsey kitty kissed the child vehemently and then bit her lips to stop the tears coming to her eyes mumsey said meg at length can i tell the lady a secret yes dear replied kitty smiling thereupon meg slipped off kittys lap and ran to eugnie what is this great secret asked eugnie bending down with a laugh meg put her mouth to eugnies ear and whispered when i grow up im going to marry keith you see said kitty overhearing the whisper my daughter is your rival and a very dangerous one replied eugnie with a sigh touching the auburn hair meg was sent off after this and then kitty arranged all about the salary with eugnie after which she accompanied her to the door to say goodbye im sorry i put any distrust into your heart about mr stewart she said but dont trouble my dear get him to give up his dissipated habits and youll no doubt find hell make an excellent husband ah said eugnie to herself as she walked to the station it was only dissipation she meantas if anything like that could hurt keith in my eyes then she began to think of the strange woman she had leftwith her sudden changes of temperament from laughter to tearswith her extraordinary nature halfvice halfvirtue of the love she bore for her child and the strong will that could send that child away for ever from her lonely life chapter xxi a first night at the bonbon faust upset had been put into rehearsal at once and three weeks after the murder of lazarus it was to be produced mortimer had hurried on the production of the burlesque with the uttermost speed as prince carnival was now playing to empty houses the bonbon company were kept hard at work and what with rehearsals during the day the performance of the operabouffe in the evening and rehearsals afterwards till two in the morning they were all pretty well wornout in spite of kittys indomitable spirit she was looking haggard and ill for the incessant work was beginning to tell on her system the doctor told her plainly that she was killing herself and that absolute rest was what she required but in spite of those warnings she never gave herself a moments peace i dont care two straws if i die she said recklessly to dr chinston ive made arrangements for the future of my child and theres nothing else for me to live for she was determined to make the burlesque a success and worked hard at rehearsals getting the author and composer to alter some things and cut out others making several valuable suggestions as to stagemanagement and in every way doing her best but though friendly towards keith yet he was conscious of a kind of reserve in her manner towards him and thought it was due to the knowledge that he was engaged to eugnie he had become reconciled to his sweetheart and she went down every day to teach meg at toorak it had been arranged that in three months she was to go to england with meg and kitty guaranteed to pay a certain sum annually for the salary of the governess and the maintenance of the child of course eugnie never meant to take any money as she had become strongly attached to meg but still kept up her semblance of poverty till such time as she judged it fit to tell keith meanwhile in spite of keiths opposition she lived with caprice and led a very quiet life for what with the state of her health and constant rehearsals kitty gave no sunday receptions but while stewart fumed and fretted over the fact of his sweetheart staying with a woman of bad character like caprice and attended to all the rehearsals of the burlesque naball was silently winding his net round him the detective had made inquiries at the skylarks club and found that keith had been there on that night in the company of fenton on discovering this he went to fenton and discovered that stewart had lent the american the knife with which the crime had been committed to cut the wires of a champagne bottle and afterwards slipped it into his coat pocket from the club he went to the bonbon theatre and as the detective knew from keiths own admission had left there at halfpast twelve and then said naball to himself he told me he wandered about the streets till two oclock and then saw villiersrubbishhe went straight to russell street and committed the crime it had taken naball some time to collect the necessary evidence and it was only on the day previous to the production of faust upset that he was able to get a warrant for keiths arrest so he determined to let the performance take place before he arrested him if its a success said naball to himself as he slipped the warrant in his pocket hell have had one jolly hour to himself and if its a failurewell hell be glad enough to go to gaol so with this philosophical conclusion mr naball settled in his own mind that he would go to the theatre keith wanted eugnie to go to a box with him in order to see the play but she said she would rather go to the stalls by herself in order to judge of the effect the burlesque had on the audience after a good deal of argument stewart gave way so on the momentous night she took her seat in the stalls eager to see the first bid her lover made for fame tulch had been recalled from his task of watching stewart as naball judged that the vanity of an author seeing his work on the stage would be enough to keep the young man in melbourne but tulch true to his instincts of finishing a job properly took his place in the gallery and kept his eye on keith who sat with ezra in a private box the jew was calm and placid as having succeeded to his fathers fortune he had not staked everything like keith on the burlesque being a success still for his partners sake as well as his own he was anxious that it should go well such a crowded house as it waseverybody in melbourne was therefor a new play by a colonial author was a rare thing and a burlesque by a colonial author with original music by a colonial composer was almost unheard of the critics who were present felt an unwonted sense of responsibility tonight for as this was the first production of the piece on any stage they had to give an opinion on their own responsibility hitherto the generality of plays produced in melbourne had their good and bad points settled long before by london critics so it was comparatively easy to give a verdict but tonight it was quite a different thing therefore the gentlemen of the press intended to be extra careful in their remarks although faust upset was called a burlesque it was more of an operabouffe as there was an absence of puns and rhyme about the dialogue besides which the lyrics were really cleverly written and the music brisk and sparkling keith had taken the old medival legend of faust and reversed it entirelyall the male characters of the story he made female and vice versa there was a good deal of satire in the piece about the higher education of women and the devotion of young men to athletics to the exclusion of brain work in fact the libretto was of a decidedly gilbertian flavour albeit rather more frivolous while the music was entirely of the offenbachian school light tuneful and rapid after a medley overture containing a number of taking melodies in the piece the curtain rose on the study of miss faust a bluestocking of the deepest dye who after devoting her life to acquiring knowledge finds herself at the age of fifty an old maid with no one to care for her the character was played by toltby who was a genuine humorist and he succeeded in making a great deal out of the part without ever condescending to vulgarity his appearance as a lank long maiden in a dingy sagegreen gown with wan face and tousled hair was ludicrous in the extreme the opening chorus was sung by a number of pretty girls in caps and gowns and on their going out to meet their lovers miss faust overcome with loneliness summons to her aid the powers of evil and in response miss mephistopheles appears kitty looked charming as she stood in the centre of the red limelight she was arrayed in the traditional dress of red but as a female demon wore a petticoat and her face was also left untouched miss faust fainted in her chair and miss mephistopheles with a bright light in her eyes and a reckless devil maycare look on her expressive face whirled down to the footlights and dashed into a rattling galop song yes this is i which melody ran all through the opera with the assistance of various cosmetics new dress and sundry other articles of feminine toilet which were brought in by a number of small imps miss mephistopheles succeeds in making miss faust young shows her a vision of mr marguerite a young athlete and finally changes the scene to the marketplace where there was a chorus of young men in praise of athletic sports it would be useless to give the plot in detail as keith followed the lines of the legend pretty closely miss faust meets mr marguerite who is beloved by miss siebel a sporting young woman there was the garden scene with a lawn tennis ground a vision on the brocken of the future of women with grotesque ballets and fantastic dresses the scene of the duel which was a quarrel scene between mrs valentine and miss faust after the style of madame angot then miss mephistopheles runs off with mr marguerite having fallen in love with him the lovers are followed and thrown into a prison which is changed by the magic power of miss mephistopheles to a racecourse in which scene there is a bewildering array of betting men pugilists pretty girls and fortunetellers miss mephistopheles then resigns mr marguerite to miss siebel and wants to carry off miss faust to the nether regions when a flaw is discovered in the deed and everything is settled amicably the whole play ending with the galop chorus of the first number when the curtain fell on the first act the audience were somewhat bewildered it was such an entirely new departure from the story of faust that they almost resented it but as the piece progressed they saw the real cleverness of the satire and when the curtain came down they called loudly for the author and composer who came forward and bowed their acknowledgments when mortimer heard the eulogies lavished on the piece he drew a long breath of relief jove i thought it was going to fail he said and i believe it would have if caprice hadnt pulled it out of the fire and indeed caprice with her wonderful spirits and reckless abandon had carried the whole play with her and saved it at the most critical moment a young man sitting near eugnie summed up his idea of the piece in a few words its a deuced clever play he said but caprice makes it goif any one else plays her part the theatre will be empty eugnie turned angrily to look for the author of this remark but could not see him just as she was turning away a shrill voice near her said aint caprice a stunner ive seen er lots of times at old lazaruss the speaker was a small whitefaced jewish youth being none other than isaiah miss rainsford pondered over these words as she walked out of the theatre goes to old lazaruss she said to herself that was the old man who was killed i wonder why she went there there was a crowd in the vestibule of the theatre and she saw keith standing in the corner looking as pale as death talking to a man she went up to congratulate him on the success of the performance but something in his face made her afraid whats the matter keith she asked touching him hush he said in a hoarse whisper dont say a wordim arrested arrested what for she gasped the man standing next to keith interposed for the murder of jacob lazarus he said in a low voice eugnie closed her eyes with a sensation of horror and caught hold of the wall for support when she opened her eyes again keith and the detective had both vanished arrested for the murder of lazarus she muttered my god it cant be true chapter xxii eugnie v naball as a rule first performances in melbourne take place on saturday night consequently the criticisms on faust upset were in mondays papers simultaneously with the notices of the burlesque there appeared an announcement that the author of the piece had been arrested for the murder of jacob lazarus keith was very little known in melbourne so his arrest personally caused little talk but the fact that a successful author and a murderer were one and the same person caused a great sensation the criticisms on the burlesque were as a rule good and though some of the papers picked out faults yet it was generally agreed that the piece had been a wonderful success but the sensation of a successful colonial production having taken place was merged in the greater sensation of the discovery of the russell street murderer keith stewart protesting his innocence of the charge had immediately been taken off to gaol and eugnie was unable to see him until she got the permission of the proper authorities but feeling certain that he had not committed the crime she called on ezra at the penny whistle early on monday morning on sending up her card she was shown into ezras room and there found that naball was present the detective who was fully convinced of keiths guilt had called in order to find out for certain from ezra all about the prisoners movements on the night in question when eugnie entered the room ezra who looked pale and careworn arose and greeted her warmly he then introduced her to naball who looked keenly at the sad face of the woman who was engaged to the man he had hunted down mr naball said ezra indicating the detective has called upon me to find out about stewarts movements on the night my father was murdered yes thats so replied naball with a shrewd glance at the jew well said eugnie impatiently surely you can explain them for keith told me you were with him all the time ezra looked dismal no i wasnt with him all the time i only met him at the bonbon and i left before he did yes interposed the detective smoothly and according to mr mortimer stewart left there about halfpast twelve oclock and then i presume said eugnie with fine disdain you think he went and murdered lazarus right off well observed naball deliberately smoothing his gloves according to the doctors evidence the crime was committed about twelve oclock or a little later now stewart cant say where he was between the time he left the theatre and the time he met villiers he was wandering about the streets explained eugnie naball smiled cynically yes so he says and so every one else says who knows keith stewart retorted the girl he is incapable of such an act naball shrugged his shoulders as much as to say that he had nothing to urge against such an eminently feminine argument eugnie looked angrily at the detective and then turned in despair to the jew you dont believe him guilty she asked no on my soul i do not he replied fervently still appearances look black against him miss rainsford thought for a few moments and at last bluntly asked naball the same question do you believe him guilty as far as my experience goes said the detective coolly i do why naball produced a little pocketknife and began to trim his nails the evidence is circumstantial he said shrugging his shoulders but the evidence is conclusive would you mind telling me what the evidence is the detective shut his knife with a sharp click slipped it into his waistcoat pocket and leaning over the table looked steadily at eugnie miss rainsford he said gravely i admire you very much for the way you stand up for stewart but believe me that though i would gladly see him free yet the proofs are too strong to suppose him innocent eugnie bent her head coldly would you mind telling me the evidence she reiterated naball rather perplexed looked at ezra yes tell her all you know said that gentleman i think myself stewart is innocent and perhaps miss rainsford may throw some light on the mystery i dont call it a mystery retorted naball impatiently its as clear as day im willing to tell all i know but as to miss rainsford throwing any light on the subject its absurd eugnie questioned him for the third time in the same words would you mind telling me the evidence certainly said naball sharply stewart was in employment of the deceased as his clerk he came to melbourne with no money and according to his own account given in this very room and in the presence of this gentleman he becomes possessed of a sum of five hundred pounds which was mysteriously placed to his credit at the hibernian bank i went to the bank and discovered from the manager that such a sum had been placed to the prisoners credit but he refused to tell me by whom so as was only natural i concluded that stewart had robbed his employer of the money and under a feigned name placed it to his credit my reasons for such a belief are thishe had full command of all the books and could cook the accounts as he liked he did so and obtained this money lazarus however who i know was a very sharp man had suspicions and determined to examine the books this of course meant ruin to stewart so he made up his mind to kill his master he was at the skylarks club on the night of the murder and gave mr fenton the manager of the neversaydie insurance company his knife to open a champagne bottle that knife was one given to him by the child of kitty marchurst and has on it an inscription from meg on receiving it back he placed it in the pocket of his overcoat and walked to the bonbon after an interview with mr mortimer he left the bonbon at halfpast twelve oclock went up to russell street and entering by the back window the position of which he knew thoroughly killed the old man then he took the keys from under the pillow and robbed the safe of various things including banknotes to the amount of one hundred pounds which he knew were placed therein while leaving the place he dropped his knife outside the window he then wanders about the streets perhaps goes home but horrorstruck with the dread of being found out returns to the scene of his crime and there sees villiers whom he questions but getting no response from him thinks villiers is drunk villiers however was only shamming and tells me some time afterwards that he picked up a knife under the open window and was cognisant of the murder i obtain the knife and it is the one stewart had in the club with the inscription on it i think therefore the evidence is very clear in what way asked eugnie quietly the detective became a little exasperated good heavens he said in an annoyed tone of voice there are three strong proofs first he is possessed of a large sum of money he cant account for second he is unable to prove an alibi and third his knife covered with blood is found on the scene of the crime so far so good said eugnie ironically your reasoning is excellent mr naball but untrue untrue i repeat untrue she replied with regard to the five hundred poundsi paid that into his credit you said ezra while naball stared at her thunderstruck a poor girl im not a poor girl said miss rainsford coolly on the contrary im worth fifty thousand pounds left to me by a sharebroker in sandhurst i did not tell keith of my fortune as i wanted him to love me for myself but as i knew he was poor i placed to his credit the sum of five hundred pounds so that settles your first proof mr naball well its certainly very curious said naball after a pause i hardly know what to thinkwhat about my second proof oh thats more difficult to prove said eugnie but i quite believe he did wander about hes rather absentminded i know your answer to my second proof is weak replied naball sardonically and the third about the knife well said miss rainsford knitting her brows he had it at the club you say and slipped it into his overcoat pocket exactly then he went to the bonbon he did and what happened to his overcoat there asked eugnie i can tell you replied ezra he took it off and in mistake caprice carried it downstairs with her fur mantle oh did she take it away with her asked naball quickly no said ezra quietly she found out she had it when she was putting on her mantle in the carriage and called me back to return it i took it upstairs again and gave it to keith who put it on and the knife was still in the pocket said eugnie i suppose so replied ezra rather confused i didnt even know the knife was there what do you think asked miss rainsford turning to naball that astute young man wrinkled his brows i see what you are driving at he said rapidly you think that caprice took the knife out of the pocket saw the whole chance in a flash and committed the crime no no cried eugnie horror struck im sure i dont believe she could be guilty of a crime humph i dont know so much about that said naball disbelievingly what nonsense broke in ezra angrily she could not have done such a thingshe had no motive naball did not reply to this remark but rising from his seat walked hurriedly up and down the room in a state of great excitement he had been fully convinced of the guilt of stewart but the conversation of eugnie had shaken his belief and he began to puzzle over the new aspect of the case i wonder if caprice ever had any dealings with lazarus he said to himself thinking of the diamond robbery yes broke in eugnie sharply she hadat least in answer to naballs questioning look when i was at the theatre on saturday night a boy near me said he had seen her at lazaruss place a boy asked ezra sharply what boy i dont know she replied a thin palefaced jewishlooking boy with a shrill voice isaiah said naball and ezra with one voice and then looked at one another amazed at this new discovery by jove said the detective this is becoming exciting you are sure you heard the boy say that yes im surequite sure answered eugnie firmly but i dont think that could prove caprice guilty much as i wish to serve keith i dont want to ruin her naball glanced at her keenly then turned to ezra send for the boy he said sharply and well find out all about caprices visits to your fathers place it mightnt have anything to do with the murder said ezra ringing the bell for the messenger true replied naball but on the other hand it might have a good deal to do with the diamond robbery chapter xxiii the cypher when the messenger had been despatched naball drew his seat up to the table and began to make some notes after which he turned to eugnie i was firmly convinced of stewarts guilt he said quietly but what you have told me throws a new light on the subject i said you could not do thati beg your pardonyou can eugnie bowed her head in acknowledgment of the apology and asked him a question in a hesitating manner you dont think caprice is guilty i think nothing at present he replied evasively not even that stewart is innocent when i see the boy ill tell you what i think they talked on together for a few minutes and then there came a knock at the door in reply to ezras permission to enter the door opened and isaiah appeared on the threshold holding some papers in his hand oh youve come said ezra as the boy shut the door after him yes did you want me demanded isaiah in a jerky manner cos i never knowed you did didnt you meet a messenger asked naball turning his head round isaiah deposited the papers he carried on ezras desk and shook his head no i never met any one i didnt he answered mr ezra asked me to bring all letters that came to the old un so as these came i did thats right said lazarus looking through the letters bytheway isaiah this gentleman wants to ask you a few questions what mr naball said isaiah in alarm oh sir i never had nothing to do with it naball smiled no no thats all right he said goodnaturedly it would take a bigger man than a sprat like you to commit such a crime but tell me do you know caprice isaiah leered significantly ive seen her on the stage thats all never off drivin about the streets anywhere else isaiah glanced uneasily at ezra who laughed go on isaiah its all right well ive seen her at the old uns place oh indeed said naball quickly often yeslots of timesat nightcame to do business i spose when did you see her last oh not for a long time replied isaiah but do you remember the week them diamonds were stolen yes yes said naball eagerly isaiah nodded well she came to see the old un then naball suppressed his exultation with difficulty and asked isaiah another question i saythose banknotes that were stolen i never stole em no one said you did retorted naball tartly but you wrote something on the back of one of em isaiah turned scarlet and shifted from one leg to the other well you see he murmured apologetically mr stewart wanted to know a good un to back for the cup so i was afraid of the old un hearing and as there wasnt no paper i wrote on the back of one of em back flatiron in pencil no in ink mr stewart he laughs and nods then puts the notes in the cash box and puts em in the safe thats all right said naball dismissing him you can go isaiah put on his hat put his hands in his pockets and departed whistling a tune when the door closed on him naball turned to his two companions with an exulting light in his eyes what do you think now mr naball asked eugnie think i think as ive done all along he replied caprice stole those jewels herself and sold them to old lazarus but whats that got to do with the death of my father asked ezra perhaps nothingperhaps a lot said the detective i dont know but that boys evidence has given me a clue supposeim only supposing mind youcaprice stole her own diamonds with villiers as an accomplice suppose she took them to old lazarus and sold em suppose villiers thinking the old man has them in his safe goes to rob him and commits the murder to do so suppose all thati should think there would be a very pretty case against villiers yes but keiths knife said eugnie ah now you have me answered naball puzzled i dont know unless villiers managed to get it while stewart was fighting with him on that night and covered it in blood in order to throw suspicion on him all your ideas are theoretical said ezra drily perhaps caprice never stole her own jewels or sold them to my father yes she did ill swear retorted naball decisively why wouldnt she prosecute why did i find villiers with one of the jewels you bet she stole them for some freak and i daresay villiers committed the murder to get them back i dont think my father would have kept such valuable jewels as that about the premises no hed put em in the bank no he wouldnt retorted ezra he sent all his jewels to amsterdam and here holding up a letter is an envelope with the dutch postmark by jove ejaculated naball under his breath what a queer thing if it should turn out to be those diamonds of caprices open the letter suppose it does turn out to be the diamonds said ezra slowly tearing the envelope wellnaball drew a long breathit will be the beginning of the end i hope it will end in keiths being released said eugnie looking at ezra with intense anxiety that gentleman took out the letter and glancing at it for a moment gave vent to an ejaculation of disgust whats the matter asked eugnie and naball together the letter is in cypher said lazarus tossing it over to the detective i dont think well be able to read it oh well have a try said naball quickly spreading oat the letter lets have a look at it the letter was as follows dsidanmo seaf utnes teh ssteon ryiks sgenlil gto teher tdhnoaus sgennid it lses teher hduenrd bneiertns what the deuce does it mean asked naball in a puzzled tone its a cypher evidently of which my father alone possesses the key said ezra ill have a look among his papers and if i find it it will soon make sense of this jumble of words its like a chinese puzzle observed naball glancing at it i never could find out these things let me look said eugnie taking the letter i used to be rather good at puzzles well find this one out said naball significantly and youll do some good for stewart you think its about caprices diamonds she asked i think its about caprices diamonds he replied i think the words have been written backwards said ezra looking over her shoulder eugnie shook her head i dont think so she replied scanning the letter closely if so the word it would have been written ti try a word of three letters if theres one suggested naball and you can see how the letters are placed heres one spelt gto what word can be made out of that got said ezra eagerly well if so in the cypher it reads the first letter g the last letter t and the middle letter at the end what do you think of that asked naball bluntly that the sender of this has taken the first and last letters of a word and written them in rotation i dont understand said naball in a puzzled tone i think i do said eugnie quickly let us take another word and instead of guessing it try my idea here is a word teher now mr naball take a sheet of paper and write down what i say naball got some paper and a pencil now said eugnie this word teher the first letter is t now the second letter which i think is the end one of the proper word is eplace that at the end naball wrote te the third letter of the cypher and the second of the proper word is hput that next the t and the fourth letter of the cypher and third of the proper word is eplace that at the end also naball added two letters as instructed thee now said eugnie theres only one letter left which must naturally be in the middle naball finished his writing thus three that is three he said with a cry of triumph by jove miss rainsford you are clever lets make certain by trying another letter take ssteon suggested ezra naball wrote the letters as follows s s t e o n then he wrote them in a line down the first column and up the second which made the word stones glad weve got it right after all he said delightedly and then the whole three of them went to work on the same system with the result that the letter read thus diamonds safe unset the stones risky selling got three thousand sending it less three hundred bernstein ah said naball when he read this wasnt i right so i think said ezra sadly my father evidently bought the jewels from her and sent them to amsterdam to be sold still said eugnie impatiently this does not clear up the mystery of the murder you dont think caprice did it said ezra no replied the detective but villiers might have done it in order to recover the jewels but i tell you what theres only one thing to be done well go down and see caprice this was agreed to and without losing a moment they started i may be wrong as i was before said naball when they were in the train but ill lay any money that villiers has seen caprice since the murder you dont think shes an accomplice cried eugnie i think nothing retorted naball till i see caprice chapter xxiv what kitty knew the trio soon arrived at kittys house and ezra was just about to ring the frontdoor bell when suddenly naball touched his arm to stop him hist he said in a quick whisper listen a womans voice talking in a high key and then the deep tones of a mans voice like the growl of an angry beast what did i tell you whispered naball again villiers and caprice both in the drawingroom wait a moment count twenty and then ring the bell he stepped round the corner of the porch stepped stealthily on to the verandah and then stole softly towards one of the french windows in order to listen he was correct in his surmise the two speakers were kitty marchurst and randolph villiers youd better give me what i ask growled villiers in a threatening tone or ill go straight and tell how you were at lazaruss on the night of the murder perhaps youll tell i killed him said caprice with a sneer perhaps i will retorted villiers theres no knowing theres this much knowing said kitty deliberately that i wont give you a single penny if i am called on to explain my movements i cant do so but it will be the worse for you it will place at this moment the bell rang and caprice started in alarm hush she cried advancing towards villiers come to me again i must not be seen talking with you here go awaynot by the door she said with an angry stamp of her foot as villiers went towards the door by the windowno one will see you villiers moved towards the french window opened it and was just about to step out when naball stepped forward im afraid some one will he said serenely pushing villiers back into the room and closing the window naball cried kitty and villiers in a breath exactly replied that gentleman taking a chair ive come to have a talk with you both how dare you force your way into my house cried kitty angrily while villiers stood looking sullenly at the detective its about the diamond robbery went on naball as if he never heard her leave the house she cried stamping her foot and about the murder he finished off looking from one to the other kitty glanced at villiers who looked at her with a scowl and sank into a chair just as he did so the drawingroom door opened and eugnie entered followed by ezra lazarus i dont understand the meaning of all this said caprice with a sneer but you seem to have a good idea of dramatic effect perhaps so replied naball lazily kitty shrugged her shoulders and turned to eugnie perhaps you can explain all this miss rainsford she said coolly yes answered eugnie slowly its about mr stewart you know he has been arrested for this murder know repeated kitty impatiently of course i know im sure i ought tomorn noon and night ive heard nothing else i dont know how it will affect the piece im sure never mind the piece said ezra a trifle sternly i dont mind that as long as i save my friend i hope you will said caprice heartily i am certain he never committed the crime what do you say turning to the detective im beginning to be of your opinion replied naball candidly i did think him guilty once fixing his eyes on villiers but now i dont what about the knife i gave you asked villiers abruptly ah said naball musingly what indeed i found it on the scene of the crime said villiers in a defiant manner so you said dont you believe me humph at this ambiguous murmur villiers gave a savage growl and would have replied but kitty stopped him by waving her hand its no good talking like this she said quickly there is some reason for you all coming here what is it ill tell you said naball in a sharp official tone do you remember the diamond robbery at this place well those diamonds were sold to old lazarus and he sent them to amsterdam for sale the person who stole those diamonds thought they were still in the safe of jacob lazarus and the person who stole those diamonds murdered jacob lazarus to recover them he finished triumphantly and then waited to see what effect his accusation would have on kitty to his astonishment however she never moved a muscle of her face but asked calmly and who is the thief and the murderer thats what i want to find out naturally but why come to me because you know i she cried rising to her feet in anger i know nothing yes you do and so does villiers there persisted naball villiers glanced strangely at kitty and growled sullenly now look here miss marchurst said naball rapidly its no use beating about the bushi know more than you think you denied that you stole your own jewels but i know you did in order to pay the money embezzled by malton lazaruss boy saw you go to his place during the week of the robbery late at night you did so in order to dispose of the jewels the crescent i took from villiers down bourke street was given to him by you as an accomplice and i listened at that window today and heard villiers say you were on the russell street premises on the night of the murder now what do you say kitty still on her feet was deadly pale but looked rapidly at naball you have made up a very clever case she said quietly but entirely wrongyes entirely i did not take my own jewels as i told you before therefore i was unable to pay the money for mr malton i did go to see lazarus one night during the week of the robbery in order to get some money but was unable to do so i never gave the crescent to villiers as he will tell you and lastly as you overheard him state i was at lazaruss on the night of the murder but did not think it necessary to state so i went there after i left the bonbon and made no secret of my doing so as my coachman can inform you i found the door locked and no light inside so thinking the old man had gone to bed i came away and went home so you see your very clever case means nothing is this true asked naball turning to villiers is what true asked that gentleman angrily what she says some of it well yes most of it youd better go a little further said kitty quietly and say all of it did i give you the diamond crescent no you didnt then who did asked naball pertinaciously i shant tell you growled villiers oh yes you will said the detective because if you know who stole the diamonds you know the murderer of lazarus no i dont retorted villiers savagely i tell you i saw her round about the place on that night and i picked up the knife i gave you thats all i know humph well see about that you are sure that the person who stole the diamonds committed the crime asked caprice with a strange smile on her pale lips well im pretty sure it looks uncommon like it and you think i stole the diamonds yes retorted naball bluntly i believe you did in that case by your own reasoning im a murderess said caprice i dont say that said the detective but i believe you know who did it looking significantly at villiers im afraid your reasonings and your assertions are at variance said kitty quietly i dont know who committed the murder but i do know who stole my diamonds who asked ezra in an excited tone keith stewart keith stewart echoed all impossible eugnie stepped forward with a frown on her pale face and looked at kitty i dont believe it she said and you are a wicked woman to say so unfortunately its true replied caprice with a sigh i have kept the secret as long as i could but now its impossible to do so any longer keith stewart was at my place on the night of the robbery and heard me say where my diamonds were he was coming to the drawingroom and saw my child descending the stairs having got out of bed he picked her up and put her in bed again the temptation was too strong to resist i suppose and he opened the drawer of the mirror and took the jewels he then got out of the window and came round by the front of the house so as to enter by the frontdoor meg was awake all the time and told it to me in her childish way how he had gone to the window and got out of it i told her not to speak of it and kept silence why did you keep silence asked naball why cried kitty her face flushing with anger because he saved my child from death he might have stolen anything of mine but i would have kept silent nor would i have betrayed him now but that you accuse me of murder there was a dead silence in the room as every one was touched by the way in which kitty spoke then villiers gave a coarse laugh ha ha he said harshly you said naball that the person who stole the diamonds committed the murder also so youve got the right man in gaol naball cast a look of commiseration at eugnie and said nothing wait a moment cried ezra stepping forward weve got to find the stolen banknotes first i dont believe keith stewart committed such a base crime he is no murderer no cried eugnie springing to her feet nor is he a thief i will prove his innocence im afraid thats difficult said naball reflectively things look black against him of course they do said villiers coarsely who knows he is innocent eugnie stepped in front of the ruffian and raised her hand to the ceiling there is one who knows he is innocentgod chapter xxv the evidence of a banknote all this time while his friends were trying to prove his innocence keith was mewed up in prison having now been there a week the disgrace of being arrested on such a charge had aged him considerably and his face had changed from a healthy bronzed colour to a waxen paleness while the circles under his eyes and the deep lines furrowing his brow showed how deeply he was affected by the position in which he found himself he steadily denied that he committed the crime imputed to him and regarding the knife found by villiers could only say that after putting it in his pocket at the club he thought no more of it till next morning when having occasion to use it he found it had disappeared some time after the interview with kitty when she told how keith had stolen the diamonds eugnie was admitted to the presence of her unfortunate lover she had tried to see him before but had always been refused so when she did gain her object at last and they stood face to face both were so overcome with emotion that they could hardly speak keith held out his arms to her with a smile on his wan face and with an inarticulate cry she flung herself on his breast weeping bitterly dont cry dear he said soothingly making her sit down on the bed there there and he quieted her as if she had been a little child i cant help it she said drying her eyes it seems so terrible to see you here no doubt replied keith quietly but i know i am innocent and that robs the disgrace of a good deal of its sting i know you are innocent answered eugnie but how to prove it i thought things would have turned out all right but when we saw kitty marchurst she said i had stolen her diamonds finished stewart with a satirical laugh ive no doubt she fully believes it and i thank her for having held her tongue so long but she was never more mistaken in her life i did put meg back to bed but i came down the stairs again and did not leave the room by the window but how is it the child saw you of course you know i know everything yes naball told me all meg says she saw a man she thought was me getting out of the window ive no doubt she did see a man but not me but why should she think it you asked eugnie puzzled simply in this way i put her to bed when she was halfasleep and she knew i was in the room with her when i left she fell asleep and as her slumber was fitful as i am sure it was seeing she came downstairs she no doubt woke up at the sound of the window being opened and saw a man getting out you know how an hours sleep passes as a moment when one wakes so ive no doubt meg thought shed just closed her eyes and opened them again to see me getting out of the window i understand said eugnie but who could it have been i believe it was villiers observed keith thoughtfully he was about the house on that night he was in want of money so no doubt when caprice left him in the supperroom he walked upstairs to the bedroom stole the diamonds and left by the window he could easily do this as every one was in the drawingroom then naball found that diamond clasp in his possession or at least in the possession of the chinaman to whom he sold it but if he sold all those diamonds to old lazarus he must have got a good deal of money for them why did he not leave the country keith sighed im sure i dont know it seems all so mysterious he said dismally what do you think should be done eugnie i think ill see naball again or some other detective and sift the whole affair to the bottom keith looked at her with a pitying smile my dear child that will cost a lot of money and you have not eugnie gave a laugh she was not going to tell him just yet so she gave an evasive answer ive got my salary she said gaily some of it was paid to me the other day see and taking out her purse she emptied it into his hand oh what a lot of money said keith smiling a fivepound note three sovereigns and two onepound notes which makes exactly ten pounds remarked eugnie with a smile and im going to pay it all away to naball to get you out of this trouble stewart kissed her and smoothed out the notes one after the other its no use eugnie he said offering her the notes back it will take more than that to help me besides you forget i have five hundred pounds in the bank yes she said turning away her face five hundred and youll have itifif i die she turned to him and threw her arms round his neck oh my darling my darling she cried vehemently why do you say such things you will not die you will live to be happy and famous famous he said bitterly no im not famous yet but notorious enough theres only one chance of escape for me and that is to trace those notes that were stolentwenty fivepound notes like this taking up the fivepound note but you havent got the numbers no but as i told naball that boy wrote something on the back of one of them here keith turned over the fivepound note and then giving a cry of surprise sprang to his feet eugnie look look she snatched the note from him and there on the back were traced in ink the words back flatiron one of the notes said keith hoarsely one of the notes stolen on that night by the person who murdered jacob lazarus eugnie had also risen to her feet and her face wore a look of horror she looked at her lover and he looked back again with the same name in their thoughts kitty marchurst good god said stewart moistening his dry lips with his tongue can she be guilty after all i cant believe it said eugnie determinedly though naball says he thinks she did it but i certainly got this note from her she may have received it from some one else cried keith eagerly god knows i dont want to die myself but to put the rope round the neck of that unhappy womanhorrible and he covered his face with his hands eugnie put on her gloves and then touched his arm im going she said in a quiet voice going he repeated springing to his feet yes to see naball and show him the note but kitty marchurst dont trouble about her said eugnie a trifle coldly she is all right and ive no doubt can explain where she got this note wherever it was you can depend it was not from the dead mans safe goodbye keith kissing him this note gives us the clue and before many days are over you will be free and the murderer of jacob lazarus will be in this cell chapter xxvi on the track when eugnie left the prison she went straight to naballs office and finding him in told all about the wonderful discovery of the veritable fivepound note endorsed in isaiahs writing to say that naball was astonished would be a mild way to state his feelings on receipt of this intelligence its an uncommon piece of luck he said looking at the note we might have searched for a twelvemonth and never come across this piece of evidence i think well get to the bottom of things this time you got it from kitty marchurst yes i got it yesterday in payment of my salary naball whistled softly things look uncommon black against that young woman he observed thoughtfully i didnt half believe that story of hers about stewarts stealing the diamonds and now this note turning up in her possessionhumph but you dont think shes guilty said eugnie clasping her hands i dont say anything replied naball savagely for the difficulties of this case were beginning to irritate him i only say things look black against capriceshes as deep as a well what are you going to do now asked miss rainsford in a trembling voice as she rose to go the detective placed his hat jauntily on one side of his head drew on his gloves then taking his cane walked to the door of the office which he he held open for eugnie to pass through what are you going to do now she repeated when they were standing in the street im going down to toorak said naball quietly to trace this note beginning with kitty marchurst as the last holder of it shell tell lies but whether she does or not ill get to the bottom of this affair goodday miss rainsford and taking off his hat with a flourish he left her abruptly and strolled leisurely down the street eugnie watched him with eager eyes until he was out of sight and then turned round to walk home oh my dear my dear she murmured if i can only save you from this terrible dangerbut not at the cost of that poor womans lifeoh not that the detective on his way down to toorak went over the case in his own mind in order to see against whom the evidence was strongest at last after considerable cogitation he came to the conclusion that after all villiers must be the guilty man and that kitty knew more about the crime than she chose to tell i cant get over villiers having had that diamond crescent he thought looking out of the carriage windows she denied it was hers and then fenton told me he gave it to her i wonder if he had anything to do with the affairhumphnot likely if she thought it was him shed tell at once perhaps she really thinks stewart stole the diamonds pish i dont believe it shes had a finger in the pie whoever did it and this murder is the outcome of the robbery well ill see if she can account for her possession of this fivepound notethats the main thing kitty marchurst was at home and sent a message to the detective that she would see him in a few minutes so naball walked up and down the long drawingroom with some impatience if shell only tell the truth he muttered restlessly but im getting to doubt her so that i cant be sure theres one thing keith stewarts fate rests entirely with her now so if he saved her childs life as she says he did this is the time to prove her gratitude at this moment the door opened and caprice entered she looked pale and weary for the trials of the last few months had not been endured without leaving some mark of their passage naball did not know whether this haggardlooking woman was guilty or innocent but he could not help pitying her so wornout did she seem you are not well he said when she seated herself kitty sighed wearily and pushed the loose hair off her forehead no she replied listlessly im getting wornout over this trouble its no good my telling you anything because you dont believe me what is the matter now have you got further proof of my guilt i dont know said naball coolly producing the fivepound note unless you call this proof a fivepound note she said contemptuously well it is a fivepound note explained naball smoothly but not an ordinary onein fact it is one of the notes stolen from lazaruss safe oh how do you know that by a very curious thing one of the notes placed in the safe on the night of the murder was endorsed by the officeboy with the words back flatiron and strange to say the endorsed note has turned up and that is it exactly now do you understand kitty shrugged her shoulders i understand that you have secured an excellent piece of evidence nothing more where did you get the note from miss rainsford from miss rainsford repeated kitty in surprise but you surely dont suspect no i dont interposed the detective because she was able to tell me where she got the note from well i presume she got it from me yes replied naball rather surprised at this cool admission she received it yesterday from you oh then you think im guilty not if you can tell me where you got the note from certainly i canfrom mortimerpaid to me the day before yesterday your salary not exactly answered kitty if it had been youd never be able to trace the note further back no i was at the theatre in the morning and found myself short of money so i asked mortimer for some he gave me that fivepound note and as he took it from his waistcoat pocket ive no doubt hell be able to recollect from whom he received it why because mortimer doesnt carry fivers in his waistcoat pocket generally said caprice impatiently so he must have put that note there for some special reason youd better go and ask him certainly said naball and arose to his feet im very much obliged to you then you dont think me guilty asked kitty with a smile upon my word i dont know what to think said the detective dismally the whole case seems mixed up ill tell you when i find the man who cant account for the possession of this fiver kitty smiled and then naball took his leave going straight from toorak to the bonbon theatre where he found mortimer in his sanctum up to the ears in business as usual well naball said the manager looking up sharply whats up look sharp im awfully busy i only want to know where you got this asked naball giving him the fivepound note mortimer took it up and looked perplexed how the deuce should i know i get so many why do you want to know oh nothing i just want to trace the note caprice said you gave it to her the day before yesterday eh did i yes you took it from your waistcoat pocket of course to be sure she wanted some money yes i kept it apart because it was made moneywon it off malton at euchre malton repeated naball in amazement are you sure yes quite you know im generally unlucky at cards and this is about the first fiver ive made so i kept it just to bring me luck but caprice wanted money so i handed over my luck to her theres nothing wrong eh oh dear no replied naball not the slightestonly some professional business because i shouldnt like to get any poor devil into a row said mortimer now be off with you im busy goodday goodday goodday naball departed curiously perplexed in his feelings he had never thought of malton in the light of a possible criminal and yet it was so very strange that this note should have been traced back to him then he remembered the conversation he had overheard between mrs malton and kitty concerning the embezzlement when kitty denied that she had paid the money by jove said naball a sudden thought striking him he was present at that supper and was in a regular hole for want of money i wouldnt be a bit surprised if he stole those diamonds to replace the money and his wifes thanking caprice was all a blind and then this notehumphthings look rather fishy my friend when he arrived at the neversaydie insurance company office he sent in his card to the assistant manager and in a few minutes was shown into maltons room where that individual received him with visible uneasiness well naball and what brings you here he asked watching the detectives face stealthily only a little business in which i want your help said naball taking the note out of his pocketbook can you tell me where you got that maltons pinkandwhite complexion grew a little pale but he laughed in a forced manner as he glanced at the note got this he said i cant tell you was it ever in my possession it was asserted naball you gave it to mortimer the day before yesterday oh yes i remember now said malton quickly he won it off me at cards exactly where did you get the note malton shifted uneasily in his seat and his nether lip twitched uneasily im afraid i can hardly remember he murmured pushing back his chair naballs suspicions were now rapidly ripening to certainties if malton were innocent why these signs of agitation he wriggled and twisted about like an eel yet never once met the keen eye of the detective youd better remember said naball mercilessly or it will be the worse for you why asked malton trying to appear composed because explained naball in a low voice that note is one of those stolen by the man who murdered jacob lazarus malton with a smothered exclamation started to his feet and then shaking in every limb sat down again no no he stammered thats absurd it cant bei tell you it cant be oh but it can be and it is i tell you the note is endorsed back flatiron which was done by the officeboy a few moments before the notes were put in the safe by stewart they were gone after the murder so there is no doubt they were taken by the man who committed the crime i got this note from miss rainsford who received it from caprice she in her turn got it from mortimer and he has referred us to you now where did you get it malton drummed nervously on the table i cant tell you he said in a tremulous voice you must its impossible i tell you what sir said naball coolly if you dont tell it means trouble for you and the other man what other man asked malton shakily the man you got this note from malton thought for a moment and then apparently made up his mind you saw i was taken aback he asked naball curiously the detective nodded its because im sorry for what i have to tell youthe man i got the note from was ezra lazarus naball jumped to his feet with a cry the dead mans son he said yes the dead mans son replied malton slowly naball stood for a few minutes then putting the note in his pocketbook once more took up his hat and moved to the door where are you going asked malton rising to see mr ezra lazarus said naball pausing a moment in the meantime till i have certain proof of his guilt you hold your tongue and he walked out leaving malton standing at his desk as if turned into stone naball on his way to the newspaper office rapidly ran over in his own mind all the details of the case against ezra his father wouldnt give him any money and he wanted to get married to that girl father and son had a quarrel on the day preceding the murder he was at the bonbon on that night and took caprice downstairs to her carriage she gave him stewarts coat to take back to him again in that coat was the knife found by villiers under the window she left the theatre long before stewartwhere did he go to his office orgood heavens if it should turn out to be true ezra received him looking rather knocked up but his face though pale was quite placid and naball wondered how a man guilty of such a terrible crime as parricide could be so calm you look tired he said taking a seat i am tired admitted ezra wearily ive been busy with my fathers affairs humph thought naball counting his gains i suppose any fresh development of the case asked ezra yes said naball solemnly i received this note today and traced it back to malton he says it was given to him by you ezra examined the note with great interest and on turning it over saw the fatal words endorsed he looked up quickly to naball this is one of the notes that were stolen he asked yes replied naball and malton said it was given to him by you by me repeated ezra in amazement how on earth could i come across this note thats what i want to find out said naball ezra looked at him for a moment then the whole situation seemed to burst on him and with a stifled groan the unhappy young man fell back into his chair burying his face in his hands good god he cried you dont suspect me of killing my father if you are innocent you can explain where you got the note i cannoti cannot cried ezra feverishly i had to pay some money to malton and did so last week there were some fivepound notes among that money but i cannot tell where this particular one came from where did you get the money asked naball from the hibernian bank oh but if you had to pay malton money why did you not do so by cheque because i wanted some money myself and did not care about drawing two cheques so i drew one covering what i owed to him and a little over humph naball thought a moment you are sure of this yes its the only way i can account for having the note whoever killed my father must have paid it into the bank and it came round to me by some fatality where were you on the night of the murder at the bonbon theatre afterwards at this office you can prove an alibi im afraid i cant i was all alone look here mr lazarus said naball in a kind tone i must say things look black against you but im not satisfied yet about the real criminal today is saturday so ill go to the bank the first thing on monday and find out what i can theres so many suspected of this business that one more or less dont matter ezra groaned you dont think im guilty he asked imploringly naball looked keenly at him no i believe you innocent he replied abruptly chapter xxvii meg proves useful the next day was sunday and caprice quite wornout with the excitement of the week and the strain of the performances of faust upset was lying in bed the burlesque had become a great success but the papers with their usual kindly generosity towards authors declared that it was due not so much to the intrinsic merit of the work as to the wonderfully clever acting of caprice last night however she had acted badly going through her part with mechanical precision but without that dash which usually characterised her performance the worry of this murder case anxiety for the future of her child and pity for the unfortunate young man now in prison had all wrought on her nerves so that she felt overcome with extreme lassitude and lay supinely in bed with halfclosed eyes incapable of the slightest exertion from this state of tranquillity she was aroused by the entrance of eugnie who was also looking pale and worn she had learned all about the tracing of the fivepound note to ezra and had now come to tell kitty about it the room was in a kind of semidarkness as all the blinds had been pulled down to keep out the dazzling sunlight and the atmosphere was permeated by the smell of some pungent scent which kitty had been using to bathe her aching head eugnie came straight to the bed and bent over it on which kitty opened her eyes and smiled faintly oh is it you miss rainsford she said drowsily i did not expect you today no replied eugnie i came to tell you all about that fivepound note but im sorry to find you so ill im wornout said kitty fretfully all the worry and trouble of my earlier years are beginning to tell on me and the anxiety of this case is the climax i believe ill die soon and i dont much care for i have your promise about the child you havemy solemn promise thank you i dont mind when i die my life has been a very unhappy one ive had more than my share of sorrow and now i would like to go to sleep and slumber onon for ever she finished the sentence in a sleepy tone then suddenly recollecting why eugnie had come down she opened her eyes wide and spoke briskly well what about this fivepound note to whom did it originally belong id better go through the whole history said eugnie slowly i received it from you exactly interrupted caprice raising herself on her elbow and i got it from mortimer who gave it to him mr malton for a gambling debt malton repeated kitty vivaciously why is hedid they suspect him of the murder no because he says he got the note from ezra lazarus and he cannot tell from whom he received it kitty was wide awake by this time and sitting up in bed pushed the fair curls off her forehead but my dear she said rapidly surely they dont suspect that poor young man of murdering his father not exactly suspect him observed eugnie but you see mr lazarus cannot account for the possession of that particular note so that makes things look bad against him i dont see why said caprice impatiently im sure i couldnt account for every individual fivepound note i receiveits absurdis that all the case they have against him i think so but mr naball says says interrupted kitty impatiently naballs a fool i often heard what a clever detective he was but im afraid i cant see it hes mismanaged the whole of this case shamefully why he suspects every one all round on the slightest suspicion first he thought it was me because i was at lazaruss place on that night then he swore it was villiers because he found the knife meg gave mr stewart then poor mr stewart is arrested simply because he cannot prove an alibi i daresay when he found malton had the note he suspected him and now ill be bound he has firmly settled in his own mind that ezra lazarus killed his own fatherpish my dear i tell you again naballs a fool that may be observed the other woman bitterly but hes a fool on whose folly keiths life depends not a bit of it said caprice cheerfully well find some way to save him yet the only evidence against him is that knife and i dont believe it was in his possession at the bonbon theatre why not because no one could have taken it out of his overcoat pocket there i took the coat downstairs by mistake but im sure i never abstracted the knife ezra lazarus took it back and ill swear in spite of mr naball he didnt take it its not likely mortimer would go fiddling in another mans pockets so i believe the knife was taken from the coat pocket without his knowledge at the club but who took it and how asked eugnie with great interest my dear replied kitty with a shrug how do i know perhaps after receiving back the knife from fenton and putting it in his pocket he hung his coat up again in that case anyone who saw him put the knife away could have stolen it but who would do so thats what our clever naball ought to find out said caprice with a disdainful smile only hes such an idiot i tell you whom i suspectmind you its only suspicionand yet appearances are quite as black against him as any one else who is it malton malton repeated eugnie starting up none other said kitty coolly he was at the club and i know was hard up for money his wife came to me one day and told me he had embezzled a lot of money at his office then after the crime she came to me and thanked me for paying it i never did so fenton said he did but i doubt it as there isnt much of the philanthropist about him so the only one who could have replaced the money was malton himself how well easily enough he was at the clubsaw keiths knife and knowing he was lazaruss clerk the idea flashed across his mind of murdering the old man with the knife and dropping it about so as to throw suspicion on stewart so by some means i dont know how he obtains the knife before stewart leaves the club commits the crime gets the money circulates the notes and when taxed with the possession of a marked one says he got it from ezra lazarusvery weak my dear very weak indeed ezra says he paid him some money so naturally doesnt know each individual note so such a thing favours mr maltons little plan so there you are my dear ive made up a complete case against malton and quite as feasible as any of naballs theories upon my word said kitty gaily i ought to have been a detective eugnie was walking to and fro hurriedly if this is so he ought to be arrested she said quickly then go and tell naball my dear said kitty in a mocking voice hell arrest any one on suspicion i wonder half the population of melbourne arent in jail charged with the murder oh naballs a brilliant man he says the man who committed the murder stole my diamondspish and you say keith stole them said eugnie reproachfully therefore therefore the lesser crime includes the greater finished kitty coolly no my dear i dont believe he is a murderer but as to the diamonds what am i to think after what meg told me meg meg said that young person dancing into the room holding a disreputable doll in her arms mumsey want meg yes said kitty as meg came to the bedside come up here dear and tell mumsey how you are meg is quite well and so is megs daughter holding out the doll for kitty to kiss but mumsey why is the lady so sad eugnie who had remained silent since kittys speech now came forward and kissed the child im not sad dear she said quietly taking her seat by the bed only i want meg to tell me something meg nodded a fairy tale she asked sedately kitty laughed though she looked anxious no my dear not a fairy tale she said smoothing the childs hair mumsey wants you to tell the story of the man who got out of the window my mr keith said meg at once kitty glanced at eugnie who sat with bowed head gazing steadfastly at her hands you see she observed with a sigh the child says it was mr keith miss rainsford reechoed the sigh then looked at meg meg dear she said in her soft persuasive voice come here dear and sit on my knee meg nothing loth scrambled down off the bed and soon established herself on eugnies lap where she sat shaking her auburn curls kitty glanced affectionately at the serious little face and picked up her doll which was lying on the counterpane now meg she said gaily you tell miss rainsford the story of the man and the window ill play with this megs daughter observed meg reprovingly yes megs daughter repeated kitty with a smile come meg said eugnie smoothing the childs hair tell me all about the man it was my mr keith you know began meg resting her cheek against eugnies breast he took me upstairscause i was so sleepyan he put me to bed an then i sleeped right off and how long did you sleep dear asked eugnie oh a minute said meg just a minute then i didnt feel sleepy and opened my eyes widequite wideas wide as this lifting up her face in confirmation and mr keith he was getting out of the window how do you know it was mr keith asked eugnie quickly cause he put me in bed said meg wisely and he was there all the time he didnt speak to you when he was near the window no he got out and tumbled i laughed when he tumbled finished meg triumphantly then i sleeped again right off eugnie put the girl down off her knee and turned to kitty i believe keith did put the child to bed she said quietly but i think she must have slept for some time and that the man she saw getting out of the window was some one else of course being awakened by the noise she would only think she had slept a minute a minute a minute repeated meg who had climbed back on to the bed and was jumping the doll up and down but who could the second man have been asked kitty perplexed you know naballs theory that the man who stole the diamonds committed the murder said eugnie you think malton is guilty of the murder why not of the robbery also he was present at the supperparty and knew where the jewels were kept kitty drew her brows together and was about to speak when meg held up her doll for inspection look at the locket she said triumphantly its like bliggingss locketall gold kitty smiled and touched the socalled locket which was in reality part of a gold sleevelink and was tied round the neck of the doll with a bit of cotton who gave you this she said bliggings no meg found it herself here after the man had got out of the window eugnie gave a cry and started up but kitty in a moment had seized the doll and wrenched off the gold link which meg called the locket when did you find this meg she asked the child in a tone of suppressed excitement after the man went out of the window said meg proudly in the dark asked her mother no when meg was dressed and the sun was shining said meg trying to get back the locket wait a moment dear said kitty pushing the child away miss rainsford do you know what this link means i half guess faltered eugnie clasping her hands then you guess right cried kitty raising herself on her elbow it means that the man who stole the jewels dropped this link and i know who he is because i gave it to him myself keith said eugnie faintly keith repeated caprice in a tone of scorn no not keith whom i have suspected wrongfully all these months but my very good friend hiram j fenton fenton echoed eugnie in surprise yes he must have committed the crime said kitty in anger grinding her teeth the coward he knew i suspected keith and let another man bear the stigma of his crime i spared keith when i thought him guilty because he saved my childs life but ill not spare fenton now i know he is a thief what will you do asked eugnie quickly what will i do cried caprice with a devilish light shining in her beautiful eyes ill put him in prisonring the bell for pen ink and paperill write him to come down here tonight to see me and when he comes ill have naball waiting to arrest him but keith faltered eugnie as for keith said caprice throwing herself back in the bed im sure hell soon be free for its my belief that fenton stole the diamonds but was too cowardly to commit a murder no he did not do it himself but he got some one else to do it and that some one cried eugnie is evan malton said caprice solemnly chapter xxviii malton makes a discovery evan malton had a house in carlton not a very fashionable locality certainly but the residence of the assistant manager was a comfortable one his wife and child were invariably to be found at home but malton himself was always awayeither at his club the theatre or at some dance he was one of those weak men who can deny themselves nothing and kept his wife and child stinted for money while he spent his income on himself but with such tastes as he possessed his income did not go very far so in a moment of weakness he embezzled money in order to gratify his desires when he told his wife what he had done the news came like a thunderclap on her she knew her husband was weak pleasureloving and idle but she never dreamt he could be a criminal with the desire of a woman to find excuses for the conduct of a man she loved mrs malton thought that his crime was due to the evil influence of kitty marchurst hence her visit and appeal to the actress it seemed to have been successful for the money had been replaced though kitty denied having paid it and mrs malton breathed freely her husband loved her in a kind of a way he did not mind being unfaithful himself but he would have been bitterly angered had he found her following his example this type of husband is not uncommon he likes to be a butterfly abroad to lead a manoftheworld existence neglecting his home yet he always expects on his return to find a hearty welcome and a lovingwife of course as mrs malton was a handsome woman with a neglectful husband the inevitable event happened and fenton the bosom friend of the husband fell in love with the solitary wife she repelled his advances proudly as she really loved her husband but the effect of long months of neglect were beginning to tell on her and she asked herself bitterly if it was worth while for her to remain faithful to a husband who neglected her on the sunday afternoon following the interview malton had with naball she sat down in her drawingroom idly watching the child playing at her feet malton had come home in a fearful temper the night before and had been in bed all sunday dinner had been early and she had left him in the diningroom with a scowling face evidently drinking more than was good for him what is the use of trying to make his life happy she said to herself with a sneer he cares no more for me than he does for the child if i were to allow his dearest friend to betray me i dont believe he would care a fig about it while she was thus talking the door opened and her husband came into the room with a sullen look on his face he was as she saw in a temper and ready for a domestic battle but determined not to give him a chance she sat in her chair in silent disdain well he said throwing himself on the sofa havent you got a word to say for yourself what can i say she replied listlessly anything dont sit there like a cursed sphynx how do you expect a man to come home when he finds things so disagreeable she looked at him scornfully you find things disagreeable she said slowly you who have neglected me ever since our marriage who have passed your time with actresses and betting men you who go to the devil said malton sulkily cutting short her catalogue of his vices i dont want you to preach ill go where i like and do what i like yet you deny me the right to do the same what do you mean mean she cried rising to her feet mean that im tired of this sordid way of living im tired of seeing you at the beck and call of every woman except your wife i have tried to do my duty by you and the child yet you neglect me for others you squander your honestly earned money and then embezzle thousands of pounds i tell you im sick of this life evan malton and if you dont take care ill make a change he listened in amazement to this tirade coming from his meek wife then with a coarse laugh flung himself back on the sofa youll make a change he said with a sneer youi suppose that means bolting with another manyou do my lady and ill kill you and your lover as well my lover as you call him could break your neck easily she said contemptuously then you have a lover he cried starting to his feet in a transport of fury you tell me thatyou a wife and a motherin the presence of our child without a word she touched the bell and a maidservant appeared mrs malton pointed to the child take her away she said coldly and when the door closed again she turned once more to her husband now that the child is away she said calmly i do tell you i have a wouldbe lover stay she cried holding up her hand i said a wouldbe lover had i been as careless of your honour as you have been of mine i would not now be living with you evan malton listened in dogged silence and then burst out into a torrent of words ah i knew it would be socurse you what woman was ever satisfied with a husband yes and such a husband as you have been she said sarcastically he stepped forward with an oath to strike her then restraining himself by an effort said in a harsh voice tell me his name mrs malton walked over to a writingdesk unlocked it and taking from thence a bundle of letters flung them on the floor before him youll find all about him there malton bent down picked up the letters and staggered back with a cry as he recognised the writing my god fenton he cried exactly she said coolly your dear friend fenton who came to me with words of love on his lips and lies in his heart to get me to elope with himin the last letter you see he asked me to go with him to valparaiso oh did he muttered malton vindictively and you were going i suppose if i had been going she replied with grave scorn i would not now be here for he leaves for valparaiso tonight tonight yes i presume hes followed your example and embezzled money at all events i refused his offer and left him as i now leave you evan malton with the hope that this discovery may teach you a lesson where are you going he cried hoarsely as she moved towards the door she turned with a cold smile i am going to our child and you and i he said vindictively im going to hiram fentons house to give him back those letters hell go to valparaiso will he no he wont tonight the police shall know all all what his wife cried in sudden terror all about the diamond robbery and the russell street murder she shrank back from him with a cry but he came straight to the door and taking her by the arm flung her brutally on the floor you lie there he hissed out ill deal with him first and afterwards with you she heard the door close and knew that he had left the house then gathering herself up slowly and painfully she went to the chamber of her child and sank on her knees beside the cot meanwhile malton with his brain on fire his heart beating with jealous rage and the bundle of letters in his breastpocket was rapidly walking down the hill intending to go to fentons rooms and tax him with his treachery it was partly on this account that he wished to see him but there was also a more serious cause for in the event of fenton bolting as he intended to do things would be very awkward for his assistant manager curse him muttered malton as he hailed a hansom and told the man to drive to east melbourne does he think im such a fool as to let him go now no no my boy weve floated together for a good time and by jove well sink together like all weak men he was unable to restrain his temper and was now working himself up into a state of fury which boded ill for the peace of mr fenton fast as the cab was rolling along it seemed hours to the impatient man and it was with a cry of joy that he jumped out at fentons door keeping the hansom waiting in case he should find the american absent the woman who opened the door told him that mr fenton had gone out about halfanhour ago with a black bag in his hand and had told her he was going to see some friends curse the man groaned malton who saw what this meant at once hes off i must followbut where i dont suppose hed leave his address in his room but ill see if i can find anything there can i give him any message sir asked the woman who was still holding the door open yes that is ill write him a note show me up to his sittingroom yes sir and in a few minutes malton found himself alone in the room so lately occupied by his enemy he sat down at the writingtable till the woman closed the door then springing to his feet began to examine the desk with feverish energy to see if mr fenton had left any trace as to his whereabouts there was a newspaper lying on a small table near and malton seizing this looked at the shipping announcements to see by what boat fenton intended to go to south america hes certain to go there he said as he ran his finger eagerly down the column or he wouldnt have told my wife here oh here it isthe don pedro for valparaiso at eight monday morning hes going by that boat now he went on putting down the paper and pulling out his watch its about six oclockwhy did he leave tonight eh i suppose he means to go on board so as to avoid suspicion by going so early in the morning he cant have gone back to see my wife or she would have told me for ill swear shes true confound him where can he have gone he turned over the papers on the desk in feverish eagerness as if he expected to find an address left for him when suddenly slipped in between the sheets of the blottingpad he found a note in caprices handwriting asking fenton to come down to toorak on that night melton struck a blow on the desk with his fist when he read this hes gone there ill swear he cried putting the letter in his pocket it was only because caprice laughed at him that he made love to my wife now shes whistled him back hell try and get her to go off with him to valparaiso ah hiram fenton youre not off yet and never will besink or swim together my boysink or swim together he called the woman gave her a short note for fenton in order to avert suspicion then getting into the cab once more told the man to drive to toorak as quickly as possible if i dont find you there my friend he muttered angrily ill go straight down to the don pedro at sandridge you wont escape mesink or swim together sink or swim together the evening sky was overcast with gloomy clouds between the rifts of which could be seen the sharp clear light of the sky and then it began to rain a tropical downpour which flooded the streets and turned the gutters to miniature torrents a vivid flash of lightning flare in the sky and the white face of the man in the hansom could be seen for a moment then sounded a deep roll of thunder as if warning hiram fenton that his friend and victim was on his track chapter xxix light at last it was certainly a remarkable thing that when kitty had prepared her trap for fenton just on the eve of his going away by having naball in hiding to arrest him that malton the only man who could effectually accuse the american should also have come down to toorak in the nick of time but then coincidences do happen in real life as well as in novels and had kitty carefully constructed the whole scene with an eye to dramatic effect it could hardly have turned out better eugnie sat with the actress in the drawingroom waiting for the arrival of fenton and talking to naball who was seated near them the detective had listened to all with the keenest interest but much to kittys disgust seemed doubtful of the americans guilt you were quick enough in accusing other people she said angrily myself among the number and now when i show you plain proof you disbelieve i dont think the proof is strong enough thats all replied naball drily we have only the word of a child that she picked up the link in the bedroom meg never tells falsehoods interposed eugnie quickly i daresay not he replied coolly however fenton may have lost this link before no he didnt said caprice decisively he had the links on when he was at supper i saw them and i ought to know because i gave them to him myself but why should fenton steal your diamonds hes got lots of money argued naball who was rather annoyed at kitty finding out more than he had i dont know why he should retorted the actress its not my business or yours to discover motivesall i know is he did it and im going to have him arrested perhaps hell be suspicious and wont come oh yes he will he thinks i believe stewart to be the thief and as to coming i can whistle him back at any moment hark as a ring came at the door there he is get behind that screen miss rainsford you go into the next room till i call naball promptly did as he was told so did eugnie and when fenton entered the room he only found kitty calmly seated beside a little table reading a book fenton was looking wonderfully well but with a watchful look on his face as if he feared discovery he had a good sum of money with him his passage to valparaiso and never for a moment thought that he was on the edge of an abyss of course kitty did not know he was about to abscond and never thought how near her prey had escaped she received him quietly with friendly interest and fenton pulling a chair next to hers began to talk eagerly never dreaming that an officer of the law was listening to every word not only that but outside crouching on the verandah was a dark figure with a livid face listening to what the man inside was saying hiram fenton utterly unconscious was surrounded on all sides by his enemies and went on telling all his plans to kitty never thinking how near he was to the felons dock from which he was flying and what did you want to see me about asked fenton taking caprices hand nothing in particular she replied carelessly the fact is i havent seen you for such a long time then you do care for me a little caprice shrugged her shoulders as much as i do for any man but i didnt ask you to come here to make love i want to talk seriously about giving up the stage she was leading him on so that he should betray himself to the detective and he walked straight into the trap oh youre tired of acting said fenton thoughtfully yes and of melbourne i want to go away fenton started and wondered if she knew he was going away also he thought for a moment and then replied then why not come with me with you cried kitty derisively what about mrs malton i tell you i dont care two straws about mrs malton he rejoined angrily i was only amusing myself with her amusing himself the man outside ground his teeth together in anger and clutched the packet of letters fiercely and what about your dear friendher husband oh malton said fenton carelessly i dont know nor do i care he was a very useful man to me for a time but now im off offwhere to valparaiso yes im sick of australia so i sail tomorrow morning for south america will you come with me kitty kitty looked doubtful i dont know we have no money i have plenty ive arranged all that and if theres a row my dear friend malton will have to bear it but now kitty ive told you all you must come with me we can live a delightful life in south america i know it well and some of the places are paradises come say youll come tonight he put his arms round her and pressed a kiss on her lips she shuddered at the impure caress then pushing him away arose to her feet dont touch me she said harshly youyou thief in a moment fenton was on his feet with an apprehensive look on his face thief thief he cried fiercely what do you mean mean she said turning on him like a tiger that i know now who stole my diamonds mr hiram fenton do you accuse me he asked with a pale face gripping her wrist yes i do said kitty wrenching her wrist away and ive got a proofthis broken sleevelink dropped by you in my room on the night of the robbery its a lie its true i accuse you of stealing my diamonds detective naball arrest that man fenton started as naball stepped out from behind the screen and then folded his arms with an evil smile so he said coolly this is a trap i see but im not to be caught in it you say i stole your diamonds i do said kitty boldly and your proof is that you picked up a broken sleevelink yes then mr detective said fenton holding out both his wrists to naball if you examine these you will see neither of the links are broken naball with an ejaculation of surprise examined both the links and found what he said was correctneither of the sleevelinks were broken have you not made a mistake he said to caprice no i have not she replied coolly when he found he had lost a sleevelink he got another made in order to avert suspicion i say hiram fenton stole my diamonds and i give him in charge naball stepped forward but the american who was now uneasy at the turn affairs had taken waved him back wait a moment he said quickly i deny the charge and will prove it false tomorrow kitty laughed derisively by which time you will be on your way to valparaiso no im not going to let you go neither am i said naball decisively i arrest you on this charge of robbery now and he laid his hand on the shoulder of the american in a moment fenton twisted himself away and dexterously throwing naball on the ground darted towards one of the french windows not so fast my friend he said sneeringly while naball halfstunned was picking himself up guess ill beat you this time i care nothing for you nor that shedevil there you can prove nothing naball made a bound forward but with a mocking laugh fenton was about to step lightly through the window when he was dashed violently back into naballs arms and malton pale as death sprang into the room hold him he cried clutching fenton who was too much astonished to make any resistance dont let him go hes guiltyi can prove it eugnie had hurried into the room attracted by the noise and kitty was standing near her the two women clinging together for protection naball held fenton firmly while malton in a frenzy of rage spoke rapidly he is guilty of the robbery he shrieked menacing fenton with his fists he embezzled money with me and had it been found out we would both have been put in prison he stole the diamonds on the night of the supper by going upstairs to your room and then leaving by the window so as to make people think it was a burglary a cursed lie growled fenton making an effort to shake naball off no it isnt cried malton furiously villiers can prove it you met him as you were coming round the house and gave him some diamonds to make him hold his tongue oh the crescent cried naball yes yes and then he sold the diamonds to old lazarus and afterwards murdered him yes he killed jacob lazarus fentons nostrils dilated he drew a deep breath and gave a cry of anger but malton went on speaking rapidly i got that note not from ezra lazarus but from fenton and lied to shield him but now when i find out he makes love to my wife ill do anything to hang him see these lettersyour cursed letters flinging them on the ground before fenton you liar thief murderer youre done for at last not yet yelled fenton and with a sudden effort he flung naball off and dashed for the window but malton sprang on him like a wild cat and they both rolled on the floor naball jumped up and went to maltons help when suddenly the american with a supreme effort wrenched himself clear of them and ran once more for the window seeing this kitty who had remained a passive spectator tried to stop him but with an oath he hurled her from him and she falling against a table knocked it over and fell senseless on the ground fenton with a cry of anger dashed through the window and disappeared into the darkness but quick as he was malton was quicker for seeing his enemy escape him he also sprang through the window and gave chase naball breathless and covered in blood was about to go also when a cry from eugnie stopped him the girl was kneeling down beside kitty while the frightened servants crowded in at the door oh she is dead dead cried eugnie looking down at the still face no she cant be brandybring some brandy a servant entered with the brandy and eugnie filling a glass forced some of the liquid between kittys clenched teeth naball also took a glass as he was wornout with the struggle then hastily putting on his hat went out leaving kitty lying to all appearances dead in eugnies arms meanwhile malton was close on the heels of the american who had cleared out by the gate and was making for the railway station there were few people about but the spectacle of two men racing bareheaded soon brought a crowd around fenton with deep curses sped on through the driving rain and at last flew on to the platform followed by malton who gasped out seize him murderer murderer the stationmaster a porter and some passengers who were waiting all sprang forward at this so fenton seeing himself surrounded gave one yell of rage and jumping on the line ran along my god cried the stationmaster the train is coming down he will be killed he tried to hold malton who was mad with anger at seeing his prey escape him and foaming with anger wrenched himself away youll be killed cried the porter but malton with a hoarse cry sprang on to the line and sped after fenton through the driving rain it was pitch dark and the rain swept along in slanting sheets through which gleamed the red and green of the signals malton only actuated by a mad desire to seize fenton staggered blindly over the sleepers stumbling at every step suddenly he heard the hard breathing of the man he was pursuing and the foremost figure loomed up dark and misshapen in the thick night they were now near the railway bridge which crosses the yarrayarra at this point and the steady sweep of the river could be heard as it flowed against the iron girders fenton hearing some one close behind him made a bound forwards then fell on the line with a shriek of despair in a moment malton was on him and the two men rolled on the line fighting like devils curse you hissed malton putting his knee on fentons chest ill kill youill kill you and he dashed fentons head against the iron rails the american in despair flung up his hands and caught malton round the neck once more they fought wrapped in a deadly embrace when suddenly they felt the bridge vibrate and even in their struggle saw rapidly approaching through the darkness the light of the down train malton with a cry of horror tried to release himself from fentons grip but the american held him tight and in another moment the train with a roar was on the bridge and over their bodies one hoarse yell and all was over evan malton and hiram fenton were torn to pieces under the cruel wheels chapter xxx exit kitty marchurst so this was the end of it all the criminal guilty of the two crimes which had agitated melbourne for so many months turned out to be the respected manager of the neversaydie insurance company after the discovery of his guilt the affairs of the company were examined and found to be in a terrible state of confusion fenton aided by malton had embezzled large sums of money and so carefully manipulated the accounts that their defalcations had never been noticed it was true that once they were on the verge of discovery unless some of the money was paid back and this had been accomplished by the robbery of kitty marchursts diamonds as the two guilty men were dead the only man who knew anything about the affair was mr villiers who soon found things made so warm for him that he confessed all he knew about the crime it appeared that on the night of the supper fenton was in great straits for want of money to replace that embezzled by himself and malton hearing kitty state where she kept her diamonds he determined to steal them if he could do so with safety in going to the drawingroom he saw stewart descending the stairs and as the young man told him he had been in kittys room putting the child to bed he thought he could steal the jewels on that night and let stewart bear the blame with this idea he went upstairs took the diamonds from their place and in order to make things doubly secure should his idea of implicating stewart fail he got out of the window and clambered down so as to show that the house had been burglariously entered in stealing round to the front of the house he met villiers who had seen all and in order to make him hold his tongue had given him the small diamond crescent which naball secured in little bourke street of course kitty would not prosecute keith as he had saved her childs life and it was his security in this belief that caused fenton to urge on the detective about the murder villiers as a matter of fact knew very little but when naball said that the man who stole the diamonds also committed the crime he went to fenton and taxed him with it fenton at first indignantly denied the accusation but ultimately confessed to villiers that he had done so after giving back keith his knife at the club he had seen him hang up his coat and dexterously extracted the weapon therefrom unknown to the owner then he went to russell street and committed the crime in reality to gain possession of the diamonds thinking they were in the safe as he did not know that lazarus had sent them to amsterdam therefore the whole mystery was cleared up and after making his confession villiers found public opinion so much against him that he left the colony and disappeared no one knew where the dead bodies of the american and malton were found on the railway line and after an inquiry had been made were duly buried mrs malton went back to live with her father and shortly afterwards married again stewart was released from prison and became quite the hero of the hour as every one sympathised with him for the way in which he had been treated eugnie told him all about her accession to fortune and they agreed to get married and go to europe ezra also now that he was wealthy turned benedict and was united to rachel a short time after his fathers death faust upset ran for some time but was ultimately withdrawn as the part of miss mephistopheles was taken by another woman and she failed to draw the public but caprice ah poor woman she was dying in the struggle with fenton she had fallen in a perilous position and had so injured her spine that there was no hope of recovery it was on a tuesday evening and poor wicked kitty was lying in bed with her weary eyes fixed on meg who was seated on eugnies lap rather puzzled by the whole affair keith and ezra were also present in deference to kittys desire as she wanted to formally give meg over to eugnie to bring her up all the legal formalities had been gone through and now they were waiting for the endalas it was not very far off do you feel easier dear asked eugnie gently bending over the bed yes replied kitty in a slow tired voice better now it will soon be over youyou will look after my child i promise you i will said eugnie fervently would you like to see a minister kitty smiled with a touch of her old cynicism and then her eyes filled with tears a minister yes she said in a faltering voice god help me and i was a ministers daughter look at me now fallen and degraded dying with my life before me and gladyes glad to die in obedience to a sign from eugnie keith had slipped out of the room in order to bring the clergyman and kitty lay quiet with the clear light of the evening shining on her pale face give me my child she said at length and then as she took meg to her breast and kissed her she wept bitterly god bless you my darling she sobbed think of me with pity eugnie nevernever let her know what i was let her believe me to have been a good woman if i have sinned see how i was temptedsee how i have sufferedlet my child think her mother was a good woman eugnie crying bitterly promised this and then tried to take meg away mumsey said meg clinging to her mother why do you cry where are you going im dying meg darling dying said meg to whom the word conveyed no idea dying yes dear going away ill go too no dear no you must stay here and be a good girl mumsey is going far awayto the sky finished poor kitty in a faltering voice to the skythen youll see god said meg at this kitty could bear no more but burst into tears and meg was taken out of the room being pacified with difficulty then keith entered with the clergyman who was left alone with the dying woman for some time when they all returned they saw she was sinking rapidly but she smiled faintly as eugnie approached ive told him all she said in a low voice and he says god will forgive me im sure he will dear said eugnie in a faltering voice strange said the dying woman in a dreamy voice i who never cared for religion should want it now im glad to die for there was nothing to live for but this terrible deathi fear it i dont know where im goingwhere am i going she asked piteously to heaven dear said eugnie heaven repeated kitty her memory going back to her childhood that is where there is neither sun nor moonthe glory of god is there oh ill never go therenevernever the room w t as now filled with floating shadows and all present were kneeling by the bed meg who had been brought back and held by eugnie was beside her mother awed by the solemnity of the scene a pale shaft of clear light came through the window and shone on the disordered white clothes of the bed and the still face of the dying woman no sound save the sighing of the wind outside the sobs of eugnie and the grave tones of the clergymans voice reading the sermon on the mount which in former days had been a great favourite with kitty blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god poor soul she that had not been pure was now dying and dreaded lest her impurity should be brought up against her blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy ah kitty marchurst what mercy did you ever show the inward voice came to her like an accusing spirit and she shrank back in the bed then she opened her eyes i would have been a good woman she said pathetically but ii was so young when i met gaston her voice became inarticulate and with an effort she kissed her child while the clergyman said the lords prayer our father which art in heaven meg meg she murmured meggod bless my little child and those were the last words of kitty marchurst for when the prayer was ended she was lying back with her pure childlike face stilled in death so she went into the outer darkness laden with sins but surely god in his mercy pardoned this woman whose impurity was more the result of circumstances than anything else let us not deny to others the mercy which we ourselves will need some day kitty was dead with all her frailties and passions and as the clergyman arose from his knees he repeated reverently the words of his master he that is without sin among you let him first cast a stone at her finis colston and company printers edinburgh
