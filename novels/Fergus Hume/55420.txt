his household laurence jen was a retired major a bachelor and the proprietor of a small estate at hurstleigh in surrey on leaving the service he decided not unwisely that it was better to be a triton in the country than a minnow in town and acting upon this theory he purchased ashantee from a ruined squire formerly the place had been called sarbylands after its original owners but jen had changed the name in honor of the one campaign in which he had participated he had been present at the downfall of king koffee he had contracted during the expedition an ague which tormented him greatly during his later life and he had received a wound and a medal in gratitude it is to be presumed for these gifts of fortune the major with some irony had converted the name sarbylands into the barbaric appellation of a west african kingdom and here for many years he lived with his two boys these lads named respectively maurice alymer and david sarby were in no way related to the major who as has been stated before was a bachelor but they had entered into his life in rather an odd fashion alymer was the son of a beautiful girl with whom jen had been passionately in love but she did not return his affection and married one of his brother officers who was afterward killed in the ashantee war on returning to england jen cherished a hope that she would reward his love by a second marriage but the shock of her husband's death proved too much for the fragile widow she died within a week after receiving the terrible news and left behind her a wailing infant which was consigned to the cold charity of indifferent relatives it was then that the major displayed the goodness of his heart and the nobility of his character forgetting his own sorrows he obtained permission from the relatives to adopt the child and to take charge of the trifle of property coming to the lad then he bought sarbylands set estate and house in order under the name ashantee and devoted his life to cherishing and training the lad in whose blue eyes he saw a look of his dead love this platonic affection begotten by the deathless memory of the one passion of his life filled his existence completely and rendered him entirely happy with regard to david sarby he had passed with the estate to jen the boy's father a libertine a drunkard and a confirmed gambler had been forced through his vices to sell his ancestral home and within a year of the sale he had dissipated the purchase money in debauchery afterward like the sordid and pitiful coward he had always proved himself to be he committed suicide leaving his only son whose mother had long since been worried into her grave a pauper and an orphan the collateral branches of the old sarby family had died out the relatives on the mother's side refused to have anything to do with a child who if heredity went for anything might prove to be a chip of the old block and little david might have found himself thrown on the parish but that major jen pitying the forlorn condition of the child saved him from so ignominious a fate his heart and his house were large enough to receive another pensioner so he took david back to the old deserted mansion and presented him to maurice as a new playfellow henceforth the two boys grew to manhood under the devoted care of the cheerful old bachelor who had protected their helpless infancy the major was fairly well to do having besides his pension considerable private property and he determined in the goodness of his heart that the boys as he fondly called them should have every advantage in starting life he sent them both to harrow and when they left that school he called upon them to choose their professions maurice more of an athlete than a scholar selected the army and the delighted major who highly approved of his choice entered him at sandhurst of a more reflective nature and studious mind david wished to become a lawyer with a possible idea of ending as lord chancellor and accordingly his guardian sent him to oxford both lads proved themselves worthy of jen's goodness and were soon in active exercise of the professions which they had chosen maurice joined a cavalry regiment and david was admitted to the bar then the major was thankful his boys were provided for and it only remained that each should marry some charming girl and bring their families to gladden an old bachelor's heart at ashantee the major had many day dreams of this sort but alas they were destined never to be fulfilled in the summer of ' fate began her work of casting into dire confusion the hitherto placid lives of the two young men frequently the young barrister and the soldier came to visit their guardian for whom they both cherished a deep affection on the occasion of each visit jen was accustomed to celebrate their presence by a small festival to which he would ask two or three friends with simple craft the old man would invite also pretty girls with their mothers in the hope that his lads might be lured into matrimony the major owing to circumstances heretofore related was a confirmed bachelor but he did not intend that his boys should follow so bad an example he wished maurice to marry miss isabella dallas a charming blonde from the west indies and david he designed as the husband of lady meg brance daughter of lord seamere but jen was mistaken in thinking that he could guide the erratic affections of youth as will hereafter be proved sure enough the lads fell in love but both with the same woman a state of things not anticipated by the major who was too simple to be a matchmaker on this special occasion however no ladies were present at the little dinner and besides jen and his two boys dr etwald was the only guest about this man with the strange name there is something to be said he was tall he was thin with a dark lean face and fiery watchful dark eyes for three years he had been wasting his talents in the neighboring town of deanminster when if intellect were in question he should have been shouldering his way above the crowd of mediocrities in london the man was dispassionate brilliant and persevering he had in him the makings not only of a great physician but of a great man and he was wasting his gifts in a dull provincial town he was unpopular in deanminster owing to the absence of what is termed a good bedside manner and the invalids of the cathedral city and hurstleigh for he had patients in both places resented his brusque ways and avoidance of their scandal mongering tea parties also he was a mystery than which there can be no greater sin in provincial eyes no one knew who etwald was or whence he came or why he wasted his talents in the desert of deanminster and such secret past which he declined to yield up to the most persistent questioner accentuated the distrust caused by his sombre looks and curt speeches provincial society is intolerant of originality etwald had become acquainted with jen professionally and having cured the major of one of his frequent attacks of ague he had passed from being a mere medical attendant into the closer relationship of a friend the boys had met him once or twice but neither of them cared much for his sombre personality and they were not overpleased to find that the major had invited the man to meet them on the occasion of this special dinner but jen good simple soul was rather taken with etwald's mysticism and moreover pitied his loneliness therefore he welcomed this intellectual pariah to his house and board and on this fine june evening etwald was enjoying an excellent dinner in the company of three cheerful companions outside the peaceful landscape was filled with a warm amber light and this poured into the oak paneled dining room through three french windows which opened onto a close shaven lawn dinner was at an end jaggard the major's valet butler and general factotum had placed the wines before his master and was now handing around cigars and cigarettes all being concluded to his satisfaction no easy attainment for jaggard trained in military fashion was very precise he departed closing the door after him the warm light of the evening flashed on the polished table major jen was sufficiently old fashioned to have the cloth removed for desert and lighted up the four faces around it with pale splendor this quartette of countenances is not unworthy of a detailed description major jen's calls for least his face was round and red with a terrific blonde mustache fiercely curled he had merry blue eyes sparse hair more than touched with gray and an expression of good humor which was the index to his character man woman and child trusted jen on the spot nor was it ever said that such trust was misplaced even the most censorious could find no fault with the frank and kindly major and he had more friends and more pensioners and fewer enemies than any man in the shire can any further explanation be required of so simple and easily understood a character lieutenant maurice alymer was also blonde and also had blue eyes and a jaunty mustache somewhat smaller than his senior's his hair was yellow and curly his features were boldly cut and his six foot of flesh and muscle was straight and lithe athlete was stamped strongly on his appearance and if not clever he was at least sufficiently good looking and good natured to make him almost as popular as the major jen always maintained that maurice was the living image of himself when a dashing young officer out in ashantee but as the good major was considerably under the middle height and maurice considerably over it this statement must be accepted with some reserve it passed as one of jen's jokes for a mild quality of which he was noted the other two men had dark and strong faces which differed entirely from the saxon simplicity and good looks of the major and maurice david was clean shaven and almost as swart as etwald and his expression was that of a being with powerful passions held in check by sheer force of will he was broad and strongly built and his smooth black hair parted in the middle was brushed carefully from a bold and rather protuberant forehead the young barrister was somewhat of a dandy but no one who once looked at his face thought of his dress affectations or dapper appearance they saw intellect pride and resolute will stamped upon the pale countenance men with such faces end usually in greatness and it seemed unlikely that david sarby barrister and ambitious youth would prove an exception to the rule lastly etwald it is difficult to describe the indescribable he was austere in face like dante with hollow cheeks and a pallid hue which told of midnight studies if he had passions they could not be discerned in his features eye and mouth and general expression were like a mask what actually lay behind that mask no one ever knew for it was never off his slightly hollow chest his lean and nervous hands and a shock of rather long curling hair tossed from a high forehead gave etwald the air of a student but there was something sinister and menacing in his regard he looked dangerous and more than a trifle uncanny physically mentally morally he was an enigma to the bovine inhabitants of deanminster and hurstleigh major jen sustained the burden of conversation for maurice was absent minded and david physiognomically inclined was silently attempting to read the inscrutable countenance of etwald as for this latter he sat smoking with his brilliant eyes steadily fixed upon maurice the young man felt uneasy under the mesmeric gaze of the doctor and kept twisting and turning in his seat finally he broke out impatiently in the midst of the major's babble and asked etwald a direct question does my face remind you of anyone he demanded rather sharply yes mr alymer replied etwald deliberately it reminds me of a man who died dear me said jen with a sympathetic look was he a friend of yours doctor well no major i can't say that he was in fact added etwald with the air of a man making a simple statement i hated him i hope you don't hate me said maurice rather annoyed no mr alymer i don't hate you replied the doctor in a colorless tone do you believe in palmistry he asked suddenly no said maurice promptly all rubbish added the major selecting a fresh cigar what do you say mr sarby asked etwald turning to the lawyer i am a skeptic also said david with a laugh and you i am a believer here etwald rose and crossed over to where maurice was sitting the young man guessing his errand held out his left hand with a smile etwald scrutinized it closely and returned to his seat life in death he said calmly read that riddle mr alymer life in death chapter ii the ashantee devil stick life in death repeated maurice in puzzled tones and what do you mean by that mystical jargon doctor ah my friend there comes in the riddle paralysis suggested david in a jesting manner but with some seriousness no that is not the answer catalepsy guessed major jen giving his mustache a nervous twist nor that either maurice whose nerves were proof against such fantasies laughed disbelievingly i don't believe you know the answer to your own riddle he said calmly etwald shrugged his shoulders i don't know for certain mr alymer but i can guess tell us your guess doctor as it interests me so nearly i have a right to know bad news comes quickly enough in the telling said the doctor judicially so i shall say nothing more life in death is your fate mr alymer unless he added with a swift and penetrating glance you choose to avert the calamity can i do so yes and in an easy manner never get married maurice flushed crimson and resenting the mocking tone of etwald half rose from his seat but without moving a finger etwald continued in a cold tone you are in love with a young lady and you wish to marry her quite right quite right broke in major jen heartily i want maurice to marry then you want him to meet his fate of life in death said etwald curtly the others stared at him and with the skepticism of thoroughly healthy minds refused to attach much importance to etwald's mysticism jen was the first to speak and he did so in rather a stiff way quite different from his usual jovial style of conversation my dear etwald if i did not know you so well i should take you for a charlatan i am no charlatan major rejoined etwald coolly i ask no money for my performance so it is a performance after all said david carelessly if you choose to call it so only i repeat my warning to mr alymer never get married maurice laughed i am afraid it is too late for me to take your advice doctor he said merrily i am in love i know you are and i admire your taste pardon me doctor said maurice stiffly i mention no names neither do i but i think of one name my friend here david who had been fidgeting with his cigar broke in impatiently now you are making a mystery out of a plain common sense question he said irritably we all know that maurice is in love here he raised his eyes suddenly and looked keenly at his friend with lady meg brance major jen chuckled and rubbed his hands together in a satisfied manner etwald bent his sombre looks on maurice and that young man biting his lip took up the implied challenge in sarby's remark and answered plainly i am not in love with lady meg my dear fellow said he sharply but if you must know i admire this with emphasis miss dallas the brow of sarby grew black and in his turn he rose to his feet i am glad to hear it is only 'admire' he remarked slowly for had the word been any other i should have resented it you and upon what grounds cried alymer flushing out in a rage that is my business and mine too said maurice hotly isabella is i forbid you to call miss dallas by that name declared david in an overbearing manner you you you forbid me come come boys said jen annoyed at this scene between two hot headed young men who were not yet gifted with the self restraint of experience don't talk like this you are at my table there is a stranger here he bowed ceremoniously to etwald or shall i say a friend present say a friend observed etwald calmly although i am about to say that which may cause these two young gentlemen to look upon me as an enemy what do you mean asked maurice turning his still frowning face toward this strange and enigmatic man what i say mr alymer you admire miss dallas why bring her name into the question yes i admire miss dallas and you mr sarby i can tell from your attitude from your look you love miss dallas david was taken aback by this strange speaking yes i i i do love miss dallas i guessed as much resumed etwald with a cold smile now it is strange it is strange that a lady's name should be thus introduced said jen annoyed at the tone of the conversation let us drop the subject another cigar maurice david the wine is with you dr etwald one moment major i wish we three to understand one another here the doctor hesitated then went on in an impressive voice about miss dallas why do you speak of her asked maurice fiercely while david looked loweringly at etwald because i love her you love her the two young men burst out simultaneously with the speech in tones of sheer astonishment and stared at etwald as at some strangle animal that this elderly man etwald was midway between thirty and forty but that looked elderly to these boys of twenty five should dare to love isabella dallas was a thing unheard of she so young so beautiful so full of divine youth and diviner womanhood he so sombre pale and worn with intellectual vigils with a mysterious past a doubtful present and a problematic future maurice and david divided one against the other by their passion for the same woman united in a feeling of rage and contempt against this interloper who dared to make a third in their worship of isabella they looked at etwald they looked at one another and finally both began to laugh jen frowned at the sound of their mirth but etwald in nowise discomposed sat unsmiling in his seat waiting for further developments oh it is too absurd said maurice resuming his seat why etwald put the question with the greatest calmness stared steadily at the young man and waited for the reply which he knew would be difficult to make oh because because never mind explaining mr alymer i can guess your objection i am too old too plain too poor for this charming young lady you on the contrary are young passing well off and handsome all the gifts of fortune are on your side decidedly added the doctor you hold the best hand well we shall see who will win this game as we may call it and what about me said david you forget that i am a third player come etwald you have prophesied about maurice now read my fate no said etwald rising we have talked long enough on this subject it is plain that we three men are in love with the same woman you can't blame me nor i you miss dallas is a sufficiently beautiful excuse for our madness i spoke out simply because i want you both to understand the position you are warned and we can now do battle for the smiles of this charming lady let the best man win nothing could be fairer than that said jen quickly but i agree with you doctor that the subject has been sufficiently discussed but indeed if you will pardon me saying so it should have never been begun let us go to the smoking room thither the three young men went in the wake of the major it was a comfortable room with one wide window which at the present moment was open outside the light of the newly risen moon bathed lawn and trees and flowers in a flood of cold silver and the warm radiance of the lamp poured out rays of gold into the wonderful white world without the three men sat down in comfortable chairs and the major went to get out a particular brand of cigars which he offered to favored guests self contained as ever etwald looked up at the wall near him and seemed to be considering a decoration of savage arms which looked barbaric and wild between two oil paintings when jen came back with the cigars his gaze followed that of his guest and he made a remark about the weapons all those came from ashantee and the west coast of africa said he touching a vicious looking axe this is a sacrificial axe this murderous looking blade is the sword of the executioner of king koffee and this here he laid his fingers lightly upon a slender stick of green wood with a golden top set roughly with large turquoise stones is a poison wand a poison wand echoed etwald a sudden light showing in his cold eyes i never heard of such a thing david who was watching him felt an instinctive feeling that etwald was telling a lie he saw that the man could hardly keep his seat for his eagerness to examine and handle the strange weapon however he said nothing but watched and watched when maurice made a remark about the stick oh that is uncle jen's greatest treasure he said smiling he can tell twenty stories about that innocent looking cane innocent looking echoed jen taking down the green wand how can you say such a thing look here etwald and he laid the stick on the table no don't touch it man he added hastily there is plenty of venom in it yet 'tis as dangerous as a snake bite if you touch this slender iron spike projecting from the end you die again david noted that the tigerish light leaped up in the eyes of etwald but he had sufficient control of his features to preserve a look of courteous curiosity he carefully handled and examined the instrument of death it was a little over a foot long of a hard looking green wood the handle of gold was coarsely molded in a barbaric fashion round the turquoise stones and these of all hues from green to the palest of blue were imbedded like lumps of quartz in the rough gold round this strange implement there lingered a rich and heavy perfume sickly and sensuous see here said jen pressing or rather squeezing the handle i tighten my grip upon this and the sting of the serpent shows itself whereupon etwald glanced at the end of the wood and saw a tiny needle of iron push itself out when jen relaxed his pressure on the gold handle this iron tongue slipped back and disappeared entirely i got this at kumassie explained jen when he had fully exhibited the gruesome mechanism of the devil stick it belonged to the high priest whenever he or the king disliked any man who was too powerful to be openly slain they used this wand what excuse they made i don't know but i suppose it had something to do with fetish worship however the slightest touch of this needle produces death it is poisoned at the tip not exactly the needle within is hollow and a store of poison is contained in the handle up here when squeezed these turquoise stones press a bag within and the poison runs down to the point of the needle in fact the whole infernal contrivance is modeled upon a serpent's fang but it is quite harmless now said david as jen replaced the wand in its old place on the wall else you wouldn't have it there well no doubt the poison has dried up said jen with a nod all the same i shouldn't like to prick myself with that needle i might die finished the major with the naive simplicity of a child you may break you may shatter the vase as you will but the scent of the roses will cling round it still quoted maurice with a laugh no doubt the devil stick can still do harm ugh what a gruesome idea i'd remove it from so conspicuous a position if i were you uncle jen someone might come to grief over it rubbish my boy it has been hanging on the wall for years and has never hurt anyone yet etwald said nothing with his eyes fixed upon the devil stick he meditated deeply the barrister whose belief was that etwald knew more about the wand than he chose to say watched him closely he noticed that the doctor eyed the stick then after a pause let his gaze wander to the face of maurice another pause and he was looking at david who received the fire of this strange man's eyes without blanching there was something so mesmeric in the gaze that david felt uncomfortable and as though he were enveloped in an evil atmosphere to his surprise he found that his eyes also were attracted to the devil stick and a longing to handle it began to possess him clearly etwald was trying to hypnotize him for some evil purpose by an effort of will david broke through these nightmare chains and rose to his feet the next moment he was in the open air in the cold moonlight breathing hard and fast within maurice and the major were talking gaily and the sound of their voices and laughter came clearly to the ears of david but silent in his deep chair sat etwald and the burning glance of his eyes seemed to beam menacingly through the air and compel the young man to evil thoughts david looked at etwald dark and voiceless and over his head in the yellow lamplight he saw the glittering golden handle of the devil stick chapter iii dido some little distance from the major's abode stood a long low rambling house on a slight rise surrounded by deep verandas it was placed in the middle of emerald green lawns smoothly clipped and these lower down were girdled by a belt of ash and sycamores and poplars which shut out the house from the high road the mansion with its flat roof and wide verandas had a tropical look and indeed it had been built by a retired indian nabob at the beginning of this century when he died the house had been sold and now it was occupied by mrs dallas who leased it because of its suggestion of tropical habitation she came from the west indies and had lived in the wigwam as the house was called for over ten years mrs dallas was a large fat and eminently lazy woman who passed most of her time in knitting or sleeping or eating her husband had died before she had come to england and it was the desire to preserve her daughter's health which had brought her so far from the sun baked islands which her soul loved her languid creole nature and lethargic habits were unsuited to brisk practical england and she hated the gray skies the frequent absence of sunlight and the lack of rich and sensuous coloring often she threatened to return to barbadoes but she was too lazy to make the effort of again settling herself in life with all her longings for the fairy islands of the west it seemed as though she would end her days in gray and misty england but she was out of place in this northern land and so was dido this latter was a tall and massively framed negro woman with very little of the traditional merry nature of the black about her she looked rather like a priestess with her stern face and stately mien and indeed in the west indies it was known among the negroes that dido was high in power among the votaries of obi she could charm she could slay by means of vegetable poisons and she could as the negroes firmly believed cause a human being to dwindle peak and pine by means of incantations this black canidia had left a terrible reputation behind her in barbadoes and though in skeptical england her powers were unknown and if they had been made manifest would have been flouted at yet her looks the tragic tones of her voice inspired the white servants of mrs dallas with distrust dido was not a favorite in the servants' part of the wigwam but for this unpopularity she cared little being devoted to isabella dallas she adored her nursling the girl was about twenty years of age tall and straight with dark hair and darker eyes with a mouth veritably like cupid's bow and a figure matchless in contour with her rich southern coloring and passionate temperament she was of irish blood on the paternal side miss dallas looked more like an andalusian lady than a native of the english speaking race she had all the sensuous loveliness of a creole woman and bloomed like a rich tropical flower with poison in its perfume amid the english briar roses of surrey maidenhood if mrs dallas was a bore and her friends said she was the daughter was divine and many young men came to the wigwam to be spellbound by her dark beauty more men than the three who had dined at ashantee were in love with isabella upon her dido exercised a powerful and it must be confessed malignant influence she had fed the quick brain of the girl with weird tales of african witchcraft and fanciful notions of terrestrial and sidereal influences isabella's nature was warped by this domestic necromancy and had she continued to dwell in the west indies she might almost have become a witch herself certainly dido did her best to make her one and taught her nursling spells and incantations to which the girl would listen fearfully half believing half doubting but her residence in england her contact with practical english folk with the sunny side of life saved her from falling into the terrible abyss of african superstition and how terrible it is only the initiated can declare it only needed that she should be removed from the bad influence of the barbaric sybil to render her nature healthy and fill her life with pleasure but dido was like a upas tree and the moral atmosphere with which she surrounded isabella was slowly but surely making the girl morbid and unnatural mrs dallas versed in the negro character half guessed this but she was too indolent to have dido removed moreover strange as it may appear she was more than a trifle afraid of the negress and her unholy arts maurice had met with and had fallen in love with isabella and she returned his affection with all the ardor of her passionate nature his handsome and frank face his sunny nature and optimistic ideas appealed strongly to the girl who had been environed from her earliest infancy by the pessimism of dido maurice saw well how isabella had deteriorated under the bad influence of the negress and he did his best to counteract her insidious morality and morbid teachings he laughed at isabella's stories and superstitions and succeeded in making her ashamed of her weakness in placing faith in such degraded rubbish while with him isabella was a bright and laughing girl quite another sort of being to the grave and nervous creature she was while in the presence of dido she felt that if she married maurice his bright strong nature would save her from a lamentable and melancholy existence and as all her affections and instincts inclined to the young man she hoped to become his wife dido saw her thoughts and hating maurice as one who scoffed at obi she did her best to put evil ideas in the girl's head concerning the young man but as yet she had failed to sow dissension between the lovers on the day after the major's dinner party isabella was sitting in the veranda with a book open on her lap and dido standing gravely near her mrs dallas in the cool depths of the drawing room was indulging in an after luncheon siesta the sunlight poured itself over the velvet lawns drew forth the perfumes from the flower beds and made the earth languorous with heat in the veranda all was cool and restful and pleasingly silent isabella in her white dress looked beautiful and pensive while dido in a reddish hued robe with a crimson 'kerchief twisted round her stately head gleamed in the semi gloom like some gorgeous tropical bird astray in our northern climes both mistress and maid were silent it was dido who spoke first she noticed that the eyes of her mistress constantly strayed in the direction of ashantee and with the jealousy begotten of deep affection she guessed that the girl's thoughts were fixed upon the much hated maurice at once she spoke reproachfully and in the grotesque negro dialect which however coming from dido's mouth inspired no one with merriment aha missy said she in deep guttural tones you tink ob dat yaller ha'r'd man maurice yes i am thinking about him and you know why dido's fierce black eyes flashed out a gleam of rage and she cursed maurice audibly in some barbaric tongue which isabella seemed to understand at all events she interrupted the woman's speech with an imperious gesture no more of that dido you know that i love maurice i wish to marry him why are you so bitter against him he take you from me well if i marry anyone the same thing will happen responded isabella lightly and surely dido you do not want me to remain a spinster all my life no missy no you marry an' ole dido am berry pleased but dat yaller ha'r'd man i no like him if he marry you he take you away he a fool a big fool oh you say that because he does not believe in obi or voodoo dido threw up one dark hand with an ejaculation not in de sunlight dose am de names for de darkness honey in de night dey no no cried isabella with a shudder don't tell me any more of those horrible things aha dat de yaller ha'r who makes you fear cried dido bitterly he hate obi an' me he will not marry you missy yes he will we are engaged your mudder she say no nonsense she likes maurice herself replied isabella uneasily maurice wants our engagement kept quiet for the present but when i do tell major jen and my mother i am sure neither of them will object h'm we see missy we see said dido darkly but why you marry dis man i no like because i marry to please myself not you said isabella sharply oh i know your thoughts dido you would like me to marry david sarby the idea as if he can compare with maurice wrong missy i no wish dat man then dr etwald that horrid gloomy creature him great man said dido solemnly him berry berry great i don't think so retorted isabella rising of course i know that he is clever but as to being great he isn't known beyond this place she walked to the end of the veranda and stood for a moment in the glare of the sunshine suddenly an idea seemed to strike her and she turned toward the negress dido you wouldn't like to see me the wife of dr etwald yes missy him berry big great man but i hate him um he lub you he told ole dido so he seems to have been very confidential said isabella scornfully and from what i have seen dido he has some influence over you no said the negress but while her tongue uttered the denial her eyes rolled uneasily around the lawn as though dreading some invisible presence no missy dido a great one you know she no 'fraid ob dat doctor but him big man missy you marry him no no no i would rather die i love maurice you nebber marry him missy nebber nebber how do you know i make de spell i know de spell say dat doctor he marry you this time isabella burst out into a girlish laugh of genuine amusement the spell seems to know more about me than i do myself said she contemptuously i don't believe in your spells dido i know from maurice that they are nonsense you take care missy obi dat not nonsense said dido in a threatening tone what does dr etwald say about it dido looked sullenly at the fire i no hear him say anytink about obi she replied but de spell it say you marry dat man and no de yaller ha'r well dido we shall see and now she never finished what she was about to say for at that moment dido stretched out one arm and uttered one name batt'sea across the lawn there crept a wizen gray haired little man with a cringing manner he was white but darkish in the skin and there was something negroid about his face this dwarfish little creature was a tramp who had become a pensioner of isabella's he had attached himself to her like some faithful dog and rarely failed to present himself at least once a day what his real name was nobody knew but he said that he was called battersea after the parish in which he had been reared as a foundling battersea was cringing dirty and altogether an unpleasant object to look upon but isabella was sorry for the creature and aided him with food and a trifle of money it may be here mentioned that battersea although he knew nothing of obi was terribly afraid of dido perhaps some instinct in the negro blood for he undoubtedly had something african in his veins made him fear this unknown priestess of fetish worship well battersea said isabella kindly how are you to day very well lady very well indeed i met mr alymer and he gave me half a crown that was generous of him but why because i said that a certain lady was now now laughed isabella no more of that nonsense battersea she turned and ran along the veranda into the house the tramp and the negress were alone what de doctor say asked dido in a low voiced whisper two words the devil stick the negress started and threw up her hands in surprise chapter iv voodoo voodoo evidently there was an understanding between these two strange creatures and thereby an occult connection with the ideas and doings of dr etwald what the trio were plotting against isabella and her lover remains to be seen but it can be guessed easily that the message of the devil stick carried by battersea to dido was of some significance battersea himself knew nothing of its esoteric meaning but to the negress the mention of the emblem conveyed a distinct understanding she let her arms fall listlessly by her side and with an unseeing gaze she stared at the green trees bathed in hot sunshine after a moment or so she muttered to herself in negro jargon and clenched her hands baal the wand of sleep the bringer of death what are you saying dido asked battersea his feeble intellect scared by the fierce gestures and the unknown tongue i say deep things which you no understan' look at ole dido you white man battersea whimpered and rubbing one dirty hand over the other did as he was requested with manifest unwillingness with an intensity of gaze dido glared at him steadily and swept her hands twice or thrice across his face in a moment or so the tramp was in a state of catalepsy and she made use of his spellbound intelligence to gain knowledge there was something terrible in her infernal powers being thus exercised in the full sunlight in the incongruous setting of a homely english landscape de debble stick whar is it in the house of major jen in a little room on the wall with swords and axes as he said this in a monotonous tone dido looked across the tree tops to where the red roofs of ashantee showed themselves against a blue july sky she shook her fist at the distant house and again addressed herself imperiously to battersea commanding tell ole dido ob de debble stick it is green with a handle of gold and blue stones set into the gold dido bent forward and touched the tramp on his temples see widin dat stick she muttered eagerly i wish to see there is a bag in the handle repeated battersea with an effort under the bag a long needle then after a pause the needle is hollow is dere poison in de bag white man no the poison is dried up is dere poison in de hollow ob de needle no said battersea again the poison is dried up at this moment a noise in the house disturbed dido and with a pass or two she released battersea from the hypnotic spell he started rubbed his eyes and looked drowsily at the tall negress who had resumed her impassive attitude what have you been doing dido he asked stupidly obi was the brief reply you hab told ole dido what she wish about de debble stick the devil stick repeated the tramp in wide eyed surprise s'elp me i don't know anything of it dr etwald met me and ses he 'you go to miss dallas' and i ses 'i does' and he ses 'you'll see dido' and i ses 'i will' and he ses 'say to her devil stick' an' i ses 'right y'are sir' but es to knowing dat nuffin said dido with a lordly wave of her hand i black you hab de black blood in youse also i mek you do obi um what's obi what's you torkin of asked battersea rather nervously an' ow does yeou know i hev black blood obi say dat to me your mudder black yah cried battersea derisively you're out of it my mother white but my father here he hesitated and then resumed yes you're right dido my father was a negro a seedee boy who was a fireman on a p and o liner i hab seen dat replied dido nodding her head black blood in youse an' i can do obi on you i send your spirit to de house of massa jen you tell me ob de debble stick battersea drew back and began to whimper again i knows es you wor at that devilry he said nervously when you claps your eyes on me i gets afeard dat's so but i take care ob you now get to de kitchen dere am food for you the old man's eyes brightened in anticipation of a feast and he shuffled off round the corner as quickly as his age would allow him dido looked after him for a moment considering the message he had brought from dr etwald and then began to think of the devil stick she knew very well what it was for her grandmother had been carried off as a slave from the west coast of africa and knew all about ashantee sorcery and fetish rites these she had repeated to her granddaughter dido with the result that dido cherishing these recollections knew exactly how to use the wand of sleep she had spoken about it to dr etwald quite ignorant that jen kept one as a curiosity and now etwald had intimated through battersea that he wished her to do something in connection with the stick what that something might be dido at the present moment could not guess she had exerted her magnetic and hypnotic influence over battersea not that she wished for a detailed description of the wand for already she knew its appearance but because it might happen that it would be necessary to use the tramp for certain purposes connected with the discovery of secrets dido exercised a strong influence over this weak old creature partially on account of his half negro blood and partially because she had terrified his feeble brain by her dark hints of obi worship battersea was supposed to be a christian but the barbaric fluid in his veins inclined him to the terrible grotesqueness of african witchcraft and dido and her words stirred some dim instinct in his mind the negress saw that accident had placed in her way a helpless creature who might be of use in her necromantic business therefore by hypnotizing him once or twice she contrived to keep him within her power all of which fantasy would have been denied by the average british newspaper reader who can not imagine such things taking place in what he calls euphoniously a christian land but this happened for all his denial having dismissed battersea the negress turned to seek isabella she was so devoted to her nursling that she could hardly bear to be away from her and since her infancy isabella had scarcely been absent an hour from her strange attendant the girl had gone into the drawing room where mrs dallas was still sleeping and there relieved for the moment from the prying eyes of the negress she took a letter out of her pocket it was from maurice stating that he was coming to see her that afternoon at three o'clock as he had something particular to say it was now close upon the hour and isabella was wondering how she could get rid of dido whom she did not wish to be present at the coming interview the inborn jealousy of the woman and her advocacy of dr etwald's suit made her an unpleasant third at such a meeting moreover maurice instinctively disliked this sullen creature and was never quite easy in her presence finally isabella decided to slip round by the back of the house and meet maurice at the gate dido was occupied in questioning battersea about the devil stick on the verandah so after a glance to assure herself that the pair were in earnest conversation isabella put on a straw hat and ran lightly away to see her lover she passed out by a side door danced like a fairy across the intervening space of lawn and slipped laughingly into the narrow path which wound through the wood to the avenue near the gates just as she emerged into the open she heard a sharp click and saw maurice approaching he was dressed in his flannels and looked particularly handsome she thought the more so when she beheld his face lighting up at her unexpected appearance the magnetism of love drew them irresistibly together and in less time than it takes to write isabella was lying on the broad breast of her lover and he was fondly kissing her lips my own dear love he murmured softly how good of you to meet me i came down here to escape dido explained isabella slipping her hand within his you don't like her to be with us i don't like her in any case my darling she is like a black shadow of evil always at your heels i must get your mother to forbid her trespassing upon our meetings my dear maurice how can you possibly do that when you refuse to tell my mother of our engagement oh i had a reason for keeping our engagement secret but it is no longer necessary and to day at this moment i am going straight to ask your mother to give me this dear hand in marriage if she consents we will soon get rid of dido but my mother may not consent said isabella a trifle nervously why not i have a profession and a small property we love one another dearly so i don't see what grounds she has for refusal dido well dido can do nothing said maurice in a jesting tone unless you want her to forbid the banns she may even be able to do that replied isabella seriously my mother is afraid of her and is often influenced in her decisions by dido what the black witch bah she is only a servant she is something more than that in barbadoes oh you mean that obi rubbish my dearest said maurice slipping his arm round the slender waist of the girl it is on that very account that i wish to tell your mother of our engagement for i must rescue you from the influence of that dark jezebel she is dangerous i know she is but she hates you i don't care for her hate replied maurice carelessly it is a poor thing and can not possibly harm me but i mean to extricate you from her toils and i don't care how she attempts to prevent our marriage surely mrs dallas will not let herself be guided in so important a business by the will and feelings of that black wench my mother is weak where dido is concerned said isabella shaking her head and so are you my dear responded maurice kissing her both of you are weak and have yielded up your wills to that woman but the announcement of our engagement will give me some influence in the house and do away with all that it will be a fight between white and black magic and i as a civilized wizard intend to win why do you particularly wish to announce our engagement to day maurice grew serious and paused at the top of the drive just out of sight of the house to reply to this question my dear child he said slowly i kept our engagement secret on account of david i have seen for a long time that he loves you and knowing his fiery temper i did not wish to provoke a quarrel by telling him that you had promised to be my wife but last night the truth was forced from me at dinner and david declared that he intended to ask you to marry him but i don't love him i love you i knew that but he didn't he knows now that we love one another but he is ignorant that we are engaged when the fact is publicly announced he may give up his idea of marrying you and so a quarrel may be averted are you afraid of quarreling with him yes not on my account but it distresses our good major to see us at variance we nearly quarreled over you last night though upon my word added the young man half to himself i believe etwald promoted the row etwald repeated isabella dr etwald yes he is in love with you i know he is replied the girl quietly but of course i could never be his wife the more so as i fear him but dido wishes me to marry him oh hang dido cried maurice vigorously i wish she would mind her own business at this moment as if summoned by his remark dido appeared round the bend of the path she looked straight before her turning neither to right nor left and passed the pair like one in a sleeping fit the negress seemed to be under the influence of some strange excitement and ran stumbling down to the gate voodoo voodoo she cried hoarsely oh said isabella nervously dr etwald must be at hand when dido says 'voodoo' he comes chapter v dr etwald's warning when dido says 'voodoo' he comes repeated maurice greatly puzzled are you talking of dr etwald yes he seems to possess some strange power over dido for she always knows when he is approaching see maurice dido is waiting at the gate in a few moments you will see dr etwald enter it the two young people looked steadfastly at the brilliantly colored figure of the negress standing in a statuesque attitude near the great iron gate on either side of her waved the summer foliage of the trees overhead the sun like a burning eye looked down from a cloudless sky and beyond the dusty white road showed distinctly through the slender bars of the gate all was bright and cheerful and english but in that sinister red figure with its black face and hands there was a suggestion of evil which seemed to dominate and poison the whole beautiful scene maurice felt isabella shudder with nervous dread as she pressed closely to his side dearest you must not be afraid said he glancing down anxiously at her face you must throw off the terror you have of this woman if the law at this moment he broke off his speech with an ejaculation of surprise for true to the prognostication of isabella in answer to the expectant attitude of the negress dr etwald turned in at the gate ho ho murmured maurice rather taken back so the art of devil raising is not a lost one after all dido can still call spirits from the vasty deep she has called flesh and blood said isabella with a shiver but there is nothing strange about dr etwald's appearance just now dido did not call him she simply felt that he was at hand and went to meet him at the gate they continued to watch the pair and saw dido throw herself at the feet of etwald who raised his hand over her in a threatening manner he pointed into the wood with an imperious gesture and in a slinking attitude the usually stately dido passed out of sight into the little path down which isabella had come to meet maurice when the gleam of her red dress disappeared etwald wiped his face and walked briskly up the avenue toward the young couple shall we go on or wait for him here asked isabella in a whisper wait replied maurice in the same tone i shall not let him think that either of us is afraid of his charlatan tricks dr etwald approached with what was meant for a smile on his usually sombre face and took off his hat to miss dallas but he did not speak as he made his salutation so the girl was forced by reason of this uncomfortable silence to make the first observation good morning doctor she said as he replaced his hat i suppose you have come to see my mother partly miss dallas and partly to see you also this gentleman to see me said maurice looking at his rival then why did you not go to 'ashantee' etwald shrugged his shoulders i never give myself unnecessary trouble he answered calmly and of course i knew that i should find you here by what right do you say that demanded maurice sharply by the right of our conversation last night mr alymer you have forestalled me i see no matter added etwald with a sneer to day to you to morrow to me all this was quite unintelligible to isabella who looked from one to the other of her companions in bewilderment not guessing for the moment that she was the bone of contention between them she saw the suppressed mockery on etwald's face and noted also that maurice roused by the quiet insistence of the doctor had much difficulty in keeping his temper knowing how her lover disliked etwald and fearing lest there should be a quarrel between the two men she cut the gordian knot by hastily proposing that they should go up to the house at the same time she was afraid lest further trouble should occur therein for it seemed to her that etwald had paid this visit for the express purpose of making himself disagreeable however he did not say anything further at the moment but walked beside isabella toward the wigwam behind them maurice strolled slowly fuming and fretting at the attitude assumed by etwald by the side of isabella she cast a backward glance at his frowning face and to avert possible trouble she began hastily to question the doctor about the strange conduct of dido what was the matter with my nurse doctor she asked what have you been doing to her she was agitated my dear young lady and i have calmed that agitation after having previously caused it said maurice in a significant tone the doctor looked at the young man calmly what possible reason have you to make such an accusation he demanded i think it is my fault said isabella hastily i remarked that dido was always agitated when you came to this house i can explain that in a measure miss dallas if you remember i cured dido of a bad nervous headache by hypnotic suggestion her mind therefore became habituated in responding to mine and doubtless she feels a kind of impression which tells her that i am near in other words said maurice pointedly you have obtained an influence over her it is not improbable rejoined etwald in measured tones i am one of those people mr alymer who can by strength of will and power of character obtain power over anyone i wish as he spoke etwald cast a sudden glance at isabella the girl was looking toward the house out of which her mother had just emerged and did not see the menace in his regard but maurice noted the gaze and felt enraged at all it implied in plain words etwald intimated in a veiled manner that isabella was a nervous subject over whom he could obtain influence if he so chose by the unlawful means of hypnotism this power maurice was determined he should not gain and by asking a direct question he tried to force etwald into a confession of illegitimate practices by this he hoped to warn isabella and make her afraid of trusting herself too much in the doctor's company you have been in the west indies doctor asked maurice bluntly i have been all over the world mr alymer parried etwald dexterously do you know anything of voodoo worship i know something of most things assented the doctor but i confess i take but little interest in african barbarities oh what about dido and her meeting you i have explained that to the best of my ability responded etwald coldly and now mr alymer as our hostess is approaching you must excuse my replying to any further questions if you want further insight into my character call upon me at deanminster that i shall certainly do said maurice for he was resolved to learn all he could about this strange man so that he could protect isabella from his arts ah said the doctor with irony we shall see if you will venture so far before maurice could take up the implied challenge which threw doubts upon his moral courage mrs dallas advanced heavily to meet her visitors isabella had already flitted like a white butterfly into the drawing room and her mother received the two young men alone her reception was as usual ponderous and vague so pleased to see you mr alymer dr etwald i am charmed it is a delightful day is it not reminds one of barbadoes i have never been in barbadoes said maurice toward whom her languid gaze was directed but dr etwald may be able to answer your question mrs dallas i know the west indian islands observed etwald as they walked into the house and this day does remind me a little of the climate there but it is scarcely hot enough no murmured mrs dallas sinking into a large chair you are right i have been in the sun all the morning and only now am i beginning to feel warm i shall certainly go back to barbadoes mrs dallas had made this threat so many times that nobody paid any attention to it and not expecting an answer she began to fan herself slowly through her half closed eyes she looked anxiously at the subtle face of etwald with the instinct of a woman she guessed that something important had brought the doctor to see her he was not a man to waste his time on visits of ceremony now mrs dallas was secretly afraid of etwald as she had received hints from dido in whose truth she implicitly believed that the doctor knew more about secret things than most people she dreaded lest his visit should portend harm and so in some trepidation she waited for him to speak but etwald guessing her frame of mind took his time and it was only when isabella approached with some tea for her mother that he broke the silence don't go away miss dallas he said entreatingly i have something to say to your mother which concerns you isabella turned pale for she guessed what was coming as etwald had raised his voice purposely maurice who was standing by the tea table also pricked up his ears mrs dallas with some curiosity raised herself to look closer at etwald and he seeing that his auditory was attentive prepared to launch his thunderbolt my dear mrs dallas he said in a soft voice you must have seen for a long time that my visits here have not been made without an object to day i come to ask you and your sweet daughter a question what is it asked the mother devoured by curiosity pray don't ask it said isabella better informed by etwald's glance as to his purpose it will only give you pain i must risk that said the doctor slowly mrs dallas i love your daughter and i wish to marry her miss isabella will you be my wife here maurice set down his cup with a crash and strode across the room where he faced etwald in no very pleasant frame of mind i shall answer that question dr etwald he said loudly miss dallas shall not and can not marry you she has promised to be my wife isabella said mrs dallas in an aggrieved tone is this true perfectly true assented isabella i love maurice i wish to marry him and slipping her arm within that of her lover she prepared to face the storm you are a disobedient girl cried mrs dallas making no attempt to control her temper you shall not marry without my permission mr alymer i am astonished at you i am disappointed in you it is not the act of a gentleman to steal away the affections of my daughter without informing me of your intentions i had my reasons for not doing so mrs dallas replied maurice quickly but i was about to tell you of our engagement when dr etwald forestalled me by making his unexpected offer unexpected mr alymer smiled etwald after my statement last night unexpected so far as time and place are concerned said maurice firmly but as you have asked miss dallas to marry you take her refusal from her own lips miss dallas said etwald in no wise moved by this speech isabella cried her mother in an angry tone isabella looked calmly at them both i love maurice i intend to marry him she repeated and an obstinate expression came over her face in that case said etwald rising i must take my leave and shall be content with that answer until such time as you are free then he added coolly i shall ask you again i shall never be free said isabella proudly oh yes you will when mr alymer is dead dead shrieked mrs dallas all her superstition roused by the word come away from that man isabella maurice dead repeated the girl with a pale cheek the young man shrugged his shoulders pooh pooh some nonsense that dr etwald was talking about last night he added contemptuously he says if i marry it will be a case of life in death whatever that means etwald rose to his feet and stretched out a menacing hand i have warned you alymer he said sternly your marriage after or before it means life in death take care ladies he added with a bow i take my departure outside etwald found dido waiting for him he looked at her significantly i have failed he said there is nothing left but the devil stick chapter vi a strange occurrence maurice returned home after a somewhat stormy interview with mrs dallas for once the mother of isabella was roused out of her habitual indifference and she refused absolutely to accept alymer as her son in law in vain the lovers implored her to give some reason for her strange refusal but beyond expressing a personal dislike for maurice she declined to explain her conduct the young man saw in this uncalled for behavior the hostile influence of dido it is because that black woman distrusts me that you object he said when mrs dallas had talked herself hoarse i wonder that an english lady a christian and an educated person should be dominated by that uncivilized creature dido has nothing to do with my refusal said the widow coldly and although i take her advice in some things i do not in this i do not wish isabella to marry you and i request you to leave my house mother cried isabella with a pale face and never come back to it again finished mrs dallas sharply maurice went to the window of the room which opened on to the veranda and put on his hat as a gentleman i must accept your dismissal he said quietly but i decline to give up isabella and i cried the girl swear to remain true to maurice you'll do nothing of the sort said her mother violently i forbid you even to think of that young man you shall marry whom i choose dr etwald i suppose no mr sarby david ejaculated maurice in an astonished tone you wish isabella to marry him yes he loves isabella much more than you do and he asked permission which you didn't to pay his addresses to her i consented and so mrs dallas raised her voice he shall marry her i refuse to marry mr sarby said isabella vehemently i hate him that is no matter replied her mother coldly you must marry him must repeated maurice with great indignation yes mr alymer must must must if you want an explanation of that you can ask here mrs dallas paused with a strange smile and added slowly major jen the major my guardian cried alymer quite thunderstruck is he against me ask him i don't believe it ask him repeated mrs dallas nor i said isabella the major is a kind man and he wants to see me happy he is that is enough interrupted mrs dallas rising in a cold fury i want no further speeches from you go to your room isabella mr alymer your way lies yonder and with a swift gesture she pointed to the window resigning himself to the inevitable maurice gave one glance at isabella and went outside with a heavy heart dido was standing upon the veranda with her eyes glowing like two coals yet there was an ill concealed expression of triumph in her gaze which maurice in his then disturbed and angered state of mind could ill brook he paused abruptly as he passed by her and asked a direct question why do you hate me dido the negress glared savagely at him voodoo said she in a harsh voice what do you mean by that jargon he demanded in angry tones voodoo said dido again and showed her teeth in anything but a pleasant fashion bah you black parrot muttered maurice scornfully and turned upon his heel as he vanished down the walk dido clapped her hands together with great satisfaction and began to sing in low tones her song was barbaric in words and strange beyond all telling in the music it rose and fell and moaned and drawled in a curiously painful manner in the drawing room mrs dallas had risen to her feet at the first deep contralto note and now stood rocking herself to and fro with an expression of alarm on her face isabella was terrified in her turn by dido's song and her mother's strange conduct though by this time she should have been used to these eccentricities mother what is it what does dido sing mrs dallas closing her eyes continued rocking herself to and fro saying but one word in answer voodoo she said and that was all but it was enough for isabella she shrieked and ran out of the room then dido still singing appeared at the window and looked at mrs dallas with an expression of triumph why do you sing the death song asked mrs dallas opening her eyes because de master hab doomed dat yaller ha'r said dido and continued her song in the meantime maurice walked slowly homeward puzzling out in his own mind as to what could be the meaning of these strange things he could not understand why mrs dallas objected to him as a son in law nor could he surmise the meaning of the mysterious word voodoo pronounced so significantly by dido however he saw plainly that the negress was the disturbing element in the dallas household and by a half hypnotic control over the weak will of her mistress she could act as she pleased the widow had been born and brought up in the barbadoes she was a half educated woman of feeble intellect and having been left during the time her mind and character were being formed solely to the society of black servants she had imbibed not unnaturally many of the debased superstitions of africa dido knew this and by means of her claims to a knowledge of obi she was enabled to rule mrs dallas and also as has been stated to exercise a powerful influence over the plastic mind of isabella but i'll spoil her designs in that quarter muttered maurice as his thoughts led him to this conclusion isabella shall not be dragged down to the level of her mother i shall marry her and so destroy the influence of that vile negress this was easier said than done as maurice simple and upright in conduct and character was no match for the unscrupulous machinations of dido she hated the young man and was determined that he should not marry her nursling but whether she had like mrs dallas a preference for david over etwald maurice could not determine the more he thought over affairs the more incoherent and complicated did they become so alymer gave up the task in despair then it occurred to him that mrs dallas had referred him to major jen so to his guardian maurice went the moment he arrived at the big house but to his surprise the major was not to be found major gone out sir explained jaggard to whom maurice applied for information he got a message from dr etwald and went to see him be back to dinner sir i b'lieve where is mr sarby gone over to brance hall sir ho ho thought maurice as he turned away so david has gone to see lady meg and the countess now if he is in love with isabella and mrs dallas favors his suit i wonder why he acts in that way the question he could not answer so dismissing it from his memory he retired to the smoking room with a pipe and a novel when jen and david returned he intended to question both and if possible get to the bottom of these thickening mysteries hang it soliloquized maurice over his book since yesterday everything seems to have gone wrong that negress and dr etwald are at the bottom of affairs but i can't see their reasons for mixing things up so then he laid aside his book to think and through the smoke curling from his pipe he stared idly at the opposite wall it chanced to be that upon which the barbaric weapons before alluded to were arranged and conspicuous among them glittered the golden handle of the devil stick recalling the mention of voodoo and etwald's reference to african witchcraft maurice connected in his own mind the devil stick with those barbarisms and on the impulse of the moment he rose to examine the magic wand handling it carefully for he dreaded the poison although it was said to be dried up he wondered if dido could make use of it were it in her possession i heard mrs dallas say that dido's people came from ashantee soliloquized maurice so i have no doubt she can work the infernal thing perhaps she knows enough to fill the bag with fresh poison if she did so i wouldn't trust myself near her she would be sure to experiment on me at this moment major jen looking slightly worried entered the room and seeing the devil stick in the hand of maurice he stopped short with an ejaculation of surprise you are looking at that thing maurice said he wonderingly now that is strange why should it be strange because i have just been talking about it with dr etwald oh said maurice his thoughts flying back to the mysterious influence which he had seen etwald exercise over dido and what was the doctor saying major jen threw himself into a chair and frowned a great deal he saw the devil stick the other night last night yes last night and to day he sent a note asking if i would ride over and see him this afternoon i did so and he then explained that he wished to buy that thing the devil stick why i can't say he explained that he had been in the barbadoes and that he took a great interest in the subject of african fetish worship he had heard of these 'wands of sleep' as they are called and greatly wished to obtain one but he was unable to do so since seeing mine he has been seized with a desire to possess it why said maurice again as a curiosity i suppose i've told you all he told me but i refused to sell it to him and he seemed greatly vexed a display of irritation which in its turn vexed me i was quite annoyed when i left him why don't you wish to sell it uncle jen because it is a dangerous thing to handle although the poison is dried up yet there may be enough in it to kill a man if i parted with it and anyone was injured by it i should never forgive myself pray put it up maurice i dislike to see you touch it to night after dinner i shall lock it up in a safe place david is right it should not be on the wall there david has gone over to see lady meg yes i don't think he will be back until after dinner said jen rising so you and i had better sit down as soon as we are dressed i am very hungry uncle jen i want to ask you something what is it asked the major pausing at the door do you wish david to marry isabella dallas jen hesitated i really can't say he said that is a matter which lies in the hands of the girl herself if she likes you better than david she does what have you spoken to her i have and to mrs dallas who declines to sanction our engagement she wants isabella to marry david and said i can guess what she said interrupted jen hastily no more of this till after dinner my dear lad then i'll explain all explain what why mrs dallas wants isabella to marry david not another word would the major say on the subject at that moment so maurice was forced to seek his room in a very unsatisfied frame of mind however as he thought here was one mystery about to be explained and that was a comfort as jen prophesied david did not return to dinner and maurice had a tte tte with his guardian but they talked of indifferent things and it was not until they were once more in the smoking room with cigars and coffee that the major consented to speak on the subject of mrs dallas' strange conduct now my boy i'm ready to tell here jen stopped and looked blankly at the wall what is the matter asked maurice in surprise the devil stick gasped jen pointing a shaking finger at the wall the devil stick maurice looked the devil stick was gone chapter vii the rivals for some moments the two men looked at one another and then major jen seeing the necessity for prompt action rang the bell jaggard entered with military swiftness and stared blankly at his master who was pointing at the wall an action inexplicable to the servant at that moment where is the devil stick demanded jen wrathfully the what sir asked jaggard doubtfully the green stick with the gold handle which was placed among the weapons here it is gone what has become of it jaggard advanced to the trophy of weapons and examined them with some deliberation after which he turned to face the irate major it's gone sure enough sir but i don't know where find out if any of the servants have taken it jaggard saluted and vanished while his master walked up and down the room fuming at the loss of the curiosity he had all the talk to himself for maurice whose mind was busy with conjectures as to dido or dr etwald being the thief did not think it necessary to speak in a few minutes jaggard returned with the news that none of the servants had been in the smoking room that evening who lighted the lamp demanded jen sharply i did sir we found the window open when we came in said maurice did you open it yes sir the major told me to always air the room during dinner do you think that someone has stolen the stick maurice said the major someone from outside i mean i am sure of it replied alymer with decision jaggard did you notice that negress of mrs dallas' about the grounds since five o'clock why no mr maurice i can't say as i did the tramp then battersea no sir haven't set eyes on him for a week when you lighted the lamp it was eight o'clock about that sir i lighted it just after dinner while you and the major were over your wine so to speak sir and the room was in darkness that is comparative darkness before then mused maurice i don't think anyone could have seen the devil stick unless the lamp was lighted was it gone when you lighted up i didn't observe sir very good jaggard broke in the major you can go maurice he turned to the young man when jaggard left the room what do you mean by all these questions and examinations do you suspect anyone yes replied maurice deliberately i suspect dido the negress why asked jen with military brevity it's a long story returned maurice lighting a fresh cigar look here uncle jen i went to dress at half past six you did also when we left the devil stick was in the room on the wall now we are here again at half past eight the devil stick is gone in these two hours dido has had time to cross the lawn yonder and steal it but why do you suspect dido because the room was in darkness as you heard jaggard say to steal that stick the thief must have known its position on the wall well dido didn't know that she was never in this room no but dr etwald was dr etwald do you think he has anything to do with it queried jen perplexed and a trifled startled i am certain of it replied maurice he employed dido to steal it from you as you refused to sell it listen uncle and i'll give you my reasons for this belief and then maurice told succinctly all that had taken place at the wigwam during the afternoon major jen listened quietly and waited until maurice ended his story before he spoke the information about mrs dallas and her reference to himself did not surprise him so much as alymer expected it would do in fact he only made one brief remark upon this point i am sorry mrs dallas said that he remarked when maurice paused in his narrative but what does she mean by it uncle jen didn't you wish me to marry isabella i am neither for nor against replied jen enigmatically as i said before let the girl marry who she loves best she loves me best in that case i am sorry for david retorted the major so am i rejoined maurice promptly all the same you can hardly expect me to give up to david the girl i love and who loves me but why does mrs dallas support david's suit ask her to explain that my dear lad i did so and she referred me to you major jen wriggled uneasily in his seat and carefully knocked the ash off his cigar he disliked telling what appeared to him to be a silly story but as such story bore strongly upon the present position of things and as maurice was impatiently waiting to be enlightened jen was forced to put his scruples on one side and speak out if what i relate appears impossible don't blame me he said abruptly and i feel certain that you will laugh when i tell you about voodoo that word again cried maurice in a puzzled voice dido used it when we met etwald she repeated it to me before i left voodoo voodoo what does it mean uncle jen african witchcraft obi fetish worship the adoration of the bad spirit who catches mortals by the hair any one of these things explains the meaning of the term h'm said maurice it is devil worship pure and simple yes and mrs dallas knows more about it than is good for her but you don't mean to say that she believes in it my boy jen laid his hand upon the arm of the young man when you reach my age you will find that there is no limit to the credulity and folly of human beings when i was stationed in the barbadoes many years ago i met mrs dallas oh so she is an old friend of yours yes i knew her in the west indies shortly before isabella was born it was through knowing me explained the major that she came to this neighborhood and rented the wigwam you see maurice i was one of the few people she knew in england and she remained near me for company's sake and here the major hesitated and because she was afraid of herself he finished significantly i don't quite understand i shall explain and it is lucky for you that mrs dallas gave you permission to ask me for an explanation otherwise i should have been forced from a sense of honor to hold my tongue as it is i can tell you mrs dallas fears that if isabella marries anyone but david her death will take place whose death isabella's or mrs dallas' the latter you must know maurice continued the major that mrs dallas though well born and well married is an extremely ignorant woman she was brought up mostly by dido's grandmother who was the most accursed old witch in barbadoes or out of it for the matter of that this old hag instilled into the mind of mrs dallas all kinds of superstitions in which she really believes when the grandmother died dido became nurse to isabella and private witch of the dallas household she is clever wonderfully clever and she has continued her grandmother's system of terrorizing both mrs dallas and isabella yes i can see that uncle jen and it is for that reason i want to marry isabella and take her away before her mind is degraded further by that old fury well the old fury sees what you want my dear lad and so she is determined that isabella shall marry david and not you to accomplish her aims she went through some hocus pocus of devilry or fortune telling or incantation and discovered that if isabella marries you mrs dallas will die and does mrs dallas believe that rubbish asked maurice incredulously implicitly i tell you she is ignorant and superstitious come what may she is convinced that your marriage with isabella means her own death so you may rest assured maurice that she will never never accept you as her son in law i understand said maurice with a shrug it seems hopeless to contest this decision of a diseased and feeble mind i can understand dido stopping my marriage as she wants to retain her sinful influence over isabella i can understand mrs dallas weak and silly being dominated by this negro jezebel but i can't understand why david is chosen as the future son in law if he marries isabella he will no more put up with dido than i should have done of course not i can't explain the reason repeated jen shaking his head but you know all that i know maurice and you can see that it is hopeless for you to attempt to marry the girl i'm not so sure of that retorted maurice i love isabella and come what may i intend to make her my wife but what about me said a voice outside the open window what about me and a moment later david in dusty riding dress stepped into the room he looked disturbed and angry and his strongly marked face bore traces of agitation and haunting thoughts disturbed by the unexpected appearance of david and seeing from his expression that he was bent upon making himself disagreeable jen hastily interposed to prevent a quarrel between the two young men what david back again he said ignoring the question asked by sarby so you did not stay to dinner no replied david shortly i didn't he flung himself into a chair and resumed in a significant tone lady seamere didn't ask me and if she had i couldn't have accepted in this dress besides i am not the man whom she delights to honor now if maurice had been there lady meg for heaven's sake don't couple my name with lady meg's interrupted maurice sharply you know quite well yes i do rejoined david interrupting in his turn and so does she what do you mean what i say it's no use your assuming that innocent air maurice you have not treated lady meg well i have how dare you say such a thing lady meg knew that i was in love with isabella oh said david with a sneer i overheard you arrange to marry her but you'll never do that while i am alive or mrs dallas either i know that mrs dallas is on your side and i know the reason then you know more than i do retorted sarby i told mrs dallas that i loved isabella and she said that nothing would give her greater pleasure than to see us married you shan't marry her cried maurice angrily rising i shall said david and rose also boys boys said jen annoyed at this quarrel do not be so positive if you are both in love with the same woman let the woman decide she has decided said alymer sharply she loves me i don't care two straws about that said david coldly i have not spoken to her yet but all the same i intend her to become my wife i give you fair warning maurice that you are not to poach upon my preserves your preserves confound your insolence upon my word david said jen seeing that maurice could hardly speak for rage you go too far the girl loves maurice and not you and it would be much more honorable for you not to press your suit i don't care two pins for honor major i love isabella and i intend to marry her but become the wife of maurice she never shall i'd rather see her married to etwald the third richmond who is in the field scoffed maurice well he has as good a chance as you dido supports his pretensions mrs dallas is your champion as for me i have the love of isabella so i'm afraid of nothing are you not said sarby with a peculiar smile remember what etwald said about your life in death i don't believe in that rubbish david and i should be very sorry to think you did as to that i don't care about discussing the point was the reply our own beliefs are our own business but i must say that etwald is a dangerous man both to you and to me i daresay replied maurice coolly the more so as i believe he has stolen the devil stick what david made a step forward and stared at the wall his face was quite pale and his hands trembled in spite of his efforts to control himself the devil stick gone he said turning on his heel both you and i must be careful maurice chapter viii a cry in the night so far the reader may wonder at the constituent elements of this story african witchcraft mysterious strangers and barbaric women seem to be out of place when set in the sober framework of an english provincial town but romance is not dependent upon landscape or on surroundings for its occurrence it is to be found everywhere and very often in the most unlikely places here for instance by some trick of fate certain people had come together certain passions had been aroused and now that the drama had been set in motion it seemed likely that it would play itself out to a tragical conclusion tragical certainly for herein the elements of comedy seem to be wanting but then fate is so pessimistic for a whole week after the events already related nothing new took place likely to alter the situation maurice and david remained coldly polite and very watchful of one another neither mentioned the name of isabella nor did the one or the other see the girl mrs dallas took care of that acting no doubt under the advice of dido for she had no will of her own she kept isabella within doors and refused to allow her to communicate with maurice but on the other hand she did not force her to see david and isabella was thankful for the consideration but there was one visitor to the wigwam whom isabella would gladly have avoided no less an individual than dr etwald after the violent scene with maurice the widow so overtaxed her strength that she became ill and the doctor was sent for his mere presence appeared to soothe mrs dallas and he came frequently when she could isabella absented herself but this she was not able to do on all occasions and so she had to endure his complimentary speeches and the mesmeric quality of his gaze this last especially was a trial to one of her sensitive organization and one day she felt so uncomfortable that she remonstrated with etwald you make me afraid doctor she said impetuously your gaze is disagreeable to me my dear young lady replied the man blandly i must look at you when i address you then don't address me isabella do not be rude cried mrs dallas who had overheard this passage at arms whereupon the girl with a defiant glance at her tormentor left the room i'm sure i don't know what i'll do with isabella sighed mrs dallas she is getting so disobedient perhaps i can assist you mrs dallas looked uneasily at her medical attendant no she said quietly i may persuade her into doing what i want which is to marry mr david sarby said etwald coolly in that case i can only hope that the young lady will continue obstinate as i wish to marry her myself i know i know but i don't want her to marry you doctor mr sarby is the man for my daughter he is good looking and clever and and poor finished etwald well yes assented mrs dallas there is that objection but it is not much of an obstacle as isabella has money the young couple can live on three thousand a year dr etwald went home with this sum running in his head and more than ever he resolved to marry isabella he was in love with her and would have taken her without a penny but all the same if she was an heiress in a small way it was all the better the doctor was clever but poor and with an income like that he could move to london and do great things there were many schemes in etwald's head and certain of these he determined to put into execution at once in order to secure isabella to wife some time previously major jen had asked etwald about the devil stick but only to be informed that the doctor knew nothing of the missing article i have not set eyes on it since that night you showed it to me declared etwald coolly you refused to sell it to me so of course i gave up all idea of possessing it all the same finished he politely i am sorry that it is lost lost stolen you mean growled jen tartly that negress dido well i admit that such a barbaric treasure would tempt her the more particularly as she knows about such wizard instruments ask her if she took it i have done so and i have asked mrs dallas also replied jen but it seems that dido wasn't out of the house on that night she was ill and oddly enough i hear etwald that it was you who made her ill really said etwald quite self possessed i suppose mr alymer told you so i thought as much he continued as jen nodded he saw me calming dido's agitation when i arrived to ask mrs dallas for her daughter's hand this negress is hysterical and on that day she happened to be so i quieted her yet mr alymer accuses me of having caused her illness i don't know anything about it etwald but truth to tell maurice does not like you because i prophesied ill concerning him oh that was rubbish said jen contemptuously you didn't mean it didn't i wait and see after which etwald bowed his visitor politely to the door of the gloomy old house which he occupied in deanminster and jen returned home quite baffled as to what could have become of the devil stick all his inquiries proved futile and he was unable even to conjecture how it had disappeared yet knowing its fatal qualities he was in constant dread lest it should reappear in connection with a tragedy maurice still held to his idea that dido had taken the wand but jen's inquiries proved that the negress had not been out of the house the night in question then it must have been battersea said maurice decidedly he is a friend of dido's and a pensioner of isabella's i'll find out if he stole the stick for the negress or for dr etwald this was easier said than done as mrs dallas would not allow maurice to set foot in the house still maurice hoped to learn the truth from the tramp himself a hope that proved futile also battersea had gone on one of his begging excursions and for quite a week was not seen in the neighborhood of ashantee then he suddenly made his appearance at the house and asked to see maurice on being led into the hall alymer came out to speak with him and after a few words he took the old man into the library jen who was rather curious to know what maurice might learn from the disreputable old scamp waited patiently for the termination of the interview as alymer did not reappear he sought the library and found the young man alone where is battersea asked jen glancing round oh he has gone away what did he wish to see you about he had heard that i accused him of taking the devil stick explained maurice and came here to exculpate himself well and did he do so yes he is quite innocent he did not take the devil stick then who did maurice paused reflected and looked anxiously at jen i'll tell you that to morrow he said after a pause why not to night asked jen sharply because i have a suspicion which i can not prove at present battersea gave me a hint upon which i am determined to work to night i may learn the truth from whom don't ask me uncle jen i can't answer you yet jen frowned then laughed well just as you please he said raising his eyebrows but you are as mysterious as david why what about david only this that he has gone up to town without bidding me good by save in this short note i can't understand such conduct nor i said maurice stretching out his hand please let me read the note uncle jen i wish to see precisely how it is worded the note which the major handed over was curt to the verge of rudeness it merely stated that the writer had gone to london for a couple of days on business and would be back as soon as possible no explanation of what the business might be was given maurice did not wonder than jen was annoyed at receiving such a missive from one whom he regarded in the light of a son but in handing it back to the major he excused the writer the fact is david has not been quite himself since this trouble about isabella he said gravely and he thinks it best to go away for a time you know how he tortures himself over trifles egad this love business of you two young men is getting to be anything but a trifle said jen testily what between the lot of you and etwald there seems to be nothing but trouble i wish you'd marry the girl maurice and have done with it perhaps i may settle affairs sooner than you think said alymer rising uncle jen i won't be back to dinner to night as i have to go into deanminster what about business connected with the devil stick and isabella h'm you are pleased to be mysterious why not tell me your business because i may fail said maurice here uncle jen don't be cross i'll tell you all about it to morrow and then you will see and approve of my silence to night well said jen with a shrug you are old enough to guide your own actions but i must say that i don't like to be shut out of the confidence of my two boys in this way you'll know everything to morrow' about david also perhaps i can even promise you that said maurice with a smile what cried jen do you know why david has gone to town not for certain but i can guess now uncle jen i shan't answer another question just now as i must go into deanminster will you take the dogcart no i'll walk walk in evening dress i'm not going to put on evening dress said maurice impatiently i'll get some dinner in deanminster and then go about my business it was useless to ask further questions as jen saw that the young man was getting irritated so in no very pleasant temper himself the major went up to his dressing room he was of a peace loving and easy going nature fond of quietness so it annoyed him not a little that all this disturbance should take place on account of a woman the sex is at the bottom of everything said the major uttering the old truth with conviction david and maurice both being absent the one in london and the other at deanminster major jen was compelled to dine alone this he disliked doing so hurrying over his dinner with all speed he betook himself to the smoking room with a book here he lighted a cigar chose a comfortable chair near the open window and attempted to read but the somnolent influence of the evening was upon him and before his cigar was half done the good major was sound asleep outside a warm wind was blowing and the air was filled with the perfume of flowers in the dark blue sky hardly a cloud could be seen and the moon just showing her orb above the tree tops flooded the still loveliness of the night with wave after wave of cold light all was full of charm spellbound as it were by the magic of moonlight when suddenly a long wild cry struck shuddering through the silence accustomed as an old campaigner to sleep lightly major jen was on his feet in an instant and again heard that terrible shriek it seemed to come from the direction of the high road and thinking that some evil was being done jen without loss of time raced across the lawn and into the avenue in a few minutes he arrived at the gate and stepped out into the white and dusty road a black mass was lying some distance down and toward this ran jen with an indefinable sense of evil clutching at his heartstrings the black mass proved to be the body of a man cold and still jen turned the corpse over and recoiled the dead man was maurice alymer chapter ix after the deed while the major hardly able to credit his own eyes was staring at the dead body of his dear lad jaggard attracted also by the strange cry came running up what is it sir he asked saluting jen even in that moment of anxiety i heard an awful cry sir and came arter you jen pointed to the corpse but said nothing jaggard ignorant of the truth bent down to place a hand upon the dead man's heart then he saw and recognized the face mr maurice god sir what does this mean he cried aghast with sudden horror it means murder jaggard replied jen in a hollow voice which he hardly recognized as his own mr maurice went to deanminster before dinner and now the major pointed again to the remains murder echoed jaggard his ruddy face growing pale and who sir i don't know i can't say interrupted his master impatiently go and get the men to bring down a stretcher for the body and send the groom for dr etwald ain't it too late sir do as i tell you said jen so fiercely that jaggard did not dare to disobey but ran off leaving the major alone with his dead the road which ran past ashantee toward the wigwam was lonely even in the daytime and at this hour of the night for it was close upon nine o'clock it was quite deserted not a person was in sight although the major could see up and down the road for a considerable distance owing to the bright moonlight he raised maurice or rather all that remained of maurice in his arms and placed the body on the soft grass by the wayside then he sat down and began to think out the reason for the committal of this cowardly crime that it was a crime he was certain for there was no reasonable idea to suppose that maurice had committed suicide he had left for deanminster hardly three hours before full of health and spirits and now he was dead a dead body a lonely road all the evidence of an atrocious assassination having been committed and not one trace of the assassin undoubtedly the twice uttered cry had come from maurice and as jen had raced out of the house after the first time he heard it he must have reached his boy almost immediately after he died before so to speak the body had time to grow cold yet the strange part of the affair was that the body was cold and that there did not seem to be any wound whereby the murder could have been achieved i am taking too much for granted muttered major jen passing his hand across his brow maurice may not have been killed after all it is etwald and his horrible prophecies which have put the idea into my head let me have a look at the poor lad's body in the bright moonlight he carefully examined the body but could find no trace of any wound until he came to the right hand here in the palm he saw a ragged rent clotted with blood but it was a mere scratch not likely to have caused death unless poison were here major jen uttered an oath and rose to his feet with a new and terrible idea in his brain the devil stick by heaven he said aloud again he bent down and examined the face and hands both were swollen and discolored he tore open the shirt at the neck and saw that the young man's breast was all distended and bloated undoubtedly the cause of death was blood poisoning and the devil stick had been the instrument used to effect the deed but here the problem proposed itself who had killed maurice the person who had stolen the devil stick who had stolen the devil stick the person who major jen came to an abrupt pause he could think for the moment of no answer to that question but it is only fair to say that dazed by the terrible occurrence of his dear lad's death jen had not his wits about him while he was still considering the affair in a confused manner jaggard reappeared with the men from ashantee carrying a stretcher while they placed the body of maurice thereon the groom bound for deanminster passed them driving the dogcart and major jen stopped the man to tell him that at all risk he was to bring back dr etwald with him jaggard wondered at this for maurice poor lad was beyond all earthly aid but jen was thinking of a certain person who might have committed the crime and he wished for the aid of dr etwald to capture that person in the meantime the necessities of the case called for the immediate removal of the body to ashantee it was a melancholy procession which bore the body up to the house four men carried the bier for it was nothing else since it bore the dead body of a young man and behind came major jen bowed to the ground with sorrow he could hardly believe that maurice was dead that he had perished upon a lonely country road by an unknown hand but that was the question jen began to think the assassin was not unknown that he had a clew to find the guilty one and he waited the coming of dr etwald with great impatience to see what his opinion was regarding the course to be pursued in due time etwald arrived for the groom had been fortunate enough to find him at home on hearing of the affair he expressed the deepest concern and putting all other business on one side he came back to ashantee in the dogcart before seeing jen he went up to alymer's room and examined the body of the unfortunate young man having satisfied himself so far as he was able without making a post mortem examination he came down to the library where jen awaited him well etwald cried the major when he saw the tall form of the doctor at the door have you seen him i have seen it corrected etwald with professional calmness the poor fellow is dead major dead from blood poisoning i knew it i guessed it the devil stick that may be rejoined etwald taking a seat but i can not be sure you see neither you nor i know anything of the poison which was in the handle of that african instrument it but what are you talking of broke in jen impetuously you say that my poor boy died from blood poisoning how else could he have come by that save through being touched or struck with the devil stick no one in the neighborhood was likely to possess any weapon likely to corrupt the blood if maurice had been stabbed or shot or if his head had been smashed in i could understand the crime or rather the motive for the crime better but as it is the person who stole the devil stick must have killed him and who stole the devil stick asked etwald coolly if i forget not major you asked me the other day if i did yes but i was wrong i made a mistake a mistake that under the present dispensation of things might prove awkward for me said etwald i was no friend to the dead man i did not like him nor he me we both loved the same woman we were rivals what then so easy as for you to say for a jury to believe that i had stolen the devil stick and killed mr alymer so as to get him out of my way i never thought of such a thing protested jen i do not suspect you then whom do you suspect asked etwald fixing his dark eyes on the major dido the negress of mrs dallas etwald shook his head and smiled but that is ridiculous said he the commission of a crime presupposes a motive now what motive had dido to kill your friend she hated maurice and she did not want him to marry miss dallas neither did i if i remember rightly said etwald dryly besides dido as you proved did not steal the devil stick however if you are suspicious of her go over to morrow and see mrs dallas it will be as well to be sure of your ground before making a public affair of it by the way i suppose you will have a detective down from london to sift the affair to the bottom i don't know i'm not sure i should if i were you mr sarby is in london why not wire up to him to bring down a clever man from scotland yard if i thought that but added jen breaking off how did you know that david was in london oh rejoined etwald quietly mr alymer told me so to night to night echoed jen starting up you saw maurice to night certainly about an hour and a half before he was murdered at deanminster at my house at deanminster replied the doctor with great deliberation so it was you whom he went to see on business to night etwald shrugged his shoulders i don't know if you call it business he said after a pause i asked mr alymer to call and see me and sent the message by that tramp named battersea i remember his coming go on please mr alymer called as i said continued etwald and then i told him that miss dallas was ill from being prevented by her mother from seeing him that i was sorry for the poor young lady and that i gave up my position as a rival in fact added the doctor i advised mr alymer to see miss dallas and marry her as soon as he could but why did you wish to act in this generous manner for the very simple reason that miss dallas is of a delicate and nervous constitution said etwald if she does not marry mr alymer with whom she is in love she may die i quite forget that i should speak in the past tense now major mr alymer is dead and miss dallas may pine away of grief it was to prevent such a catastrophe from occurring that i surrendered my claim to her hand very generous of you indeed said jen ironically but i do not see why you should behave in such a noble manner when you were so much in love with the girl it is for that reason that i changed my mind as you know i have been attending upon mrs dallas this week and i saw plainly enough that my case was hopeless that the girl was dying to marry alymer besides added etwald carelessly the mother was not on my side she wants isabella to marry david so i hear and he is in town as mr alymer told me to night but what are you going to do about the matter major give notice to the police there will be a post mortem of course said etwald carelessly no no i hope not cried jen horrified at the idea but there must be insisted etwald cruelly alymer died of poison and it must be proved that such was the case then we may learn if he perished from the poison of the devil stick afterward you must get a detective to search for the person who stole it from your smoking room once he or she is found and the assassin of your poor friend will be in custody 'he or she' repeated jen slowly dido i mentioned but 'he' who is 'he' ah that is what we wish to find out said the doctor gravely but how do i know battersea may be the thief the thief and the murderer well no major on second thought i do not think it is wise to couple those two words as yet the thief may not be the murderer and but what can i say broke off etwald suddenly as yet we know nothing it is late now major and i must get back shall i give information to the police if you will be so kind said the major listlessly and he let the doctor go away without another word all through that long night he knelt beside the bed upon which lay the corpse of the man whom he had loved as a son the bedroom of maurice was on the ground floor and the windows looked out onto a little lawn which was girdled by thick trees in which the nightingales were singing the sorrowful songs of the birds flitting in the moonlight and amid the cloistral dusk of the trees seemed to jen like a requiem over the young life which had passed away the major was broken hearted by the sorrow which had come upon him and when he issued from the chamber of death he looked years older than when he entered it it seemed to his big loving heart as though the woman he loved had died anew in the person of her son fortunately he was not forced to sorrow alone toward midday david arrived from town filled with grief and surprise at the untimely end of maurice he found the major in the library and grasped him by the hand with genuine sorrow my poor uncle he said in a low voice i cannot tell you what i feel etwald telegraphed to me the first thing in the morning and i came down by the earliest train there was poor maurice and we parted in anger more's the pity sighed jen leaning upon the shoulder of sarby but you cherish no anger in your heart now god forbid sir david spoke so fervidly that jen saw plainly he meant what he said the massive face of the young man looked worn and haggard in the searching light of the morning and whatever enmity the love of the same woman had sown between him and the dead it was not to be denied that he was suffering cruelly from remorse at their unhappy difference jen was sorry but even in his own grief he could not forbear a stab you can marry isabella now he said bitterly no said david faintly turning his face away at least not yet the major looked at him for a moment or two then with a new idea in his head he took david by the hand and led him into the chamber of death swear said he that you will not marry isabella dallas until you have discovered and punished the murderer of maurice david swore chapter x further mystery great was the dismay throughout the countryside when it became known that maurice alymer had been murdered the dead man was well known in drawing room and in hunting field so that there was hardly a person of consequence in the county who could not claim at least a bowing acquaintance with him moreover maurice was one of those men who are always popular and much sympathy was manifested for his untimely death also the mysterious way in which he had come to his end the absence of any known motive and the knowledge that the deceased had no enemies all these thing's combined to raise public curiosity to the highest pitch the inquest on the dead body was awaited with much anxiety crowds of people came from all parts of the country to view the scene of the crime and if possible to gain a glimpse of jen and david who as relatives as it might be said of the deceased were notorious for the time being but thanks to the presence of the police and the vigilance of jaggard the morbid crowd of sight seers were unable to gratify their curiosity the two men remained in seclusion and saw no one save dr etwald a sympathetic message arrived from mrs dallas which considering the way she had behaved toward maurice the major regarded as a gratuitous insult can't she let the poor man rest in his grave said jen wrathfully it is all through her opposition to the match that this has come about oh you can't say that uncle jen remonstrated david yes i can sir if maurice had not been prevented from seeing isabella there would have been no necessity for him to call on etwald at deanminster and if he had not done that he would not have been on the high road in the night to meet with his death mrs dallas and her infernal negress are at the bottom of the whole accursed business of course this was mere raving on the part of jen who had no reason to connect either woman with the crime but the poor man was beside himself with grief at the loss of maurice and hardly knew what he was saying being in this frame of mind he was by no means pleased when shortly after the delivery of mrs dallas' message dido made her appearance with a request for a personal interview i shan't see that black witch cried the poor major david etwald send her away i wouldn't if i were you major said etwald judiciously she might be the bearer of valuable information likely to lead to the detection of alymer's assassin then let her see the police sir although i don't agree with you she is not the woman to put a rope round her own neck black as it is but surely uncle jen you don't look upon her as the guilty person how do i know who is guilty snapped jen i wish i did i'd hang him or her but this black wretch and her confounded mistress have to do with the death of my poor boy i am certain i doubt it but will you see dido or shall i send her away yes no yes that is i don't wish to see her ask her what she wants david david left the room and remained absent for some time on his return he stated that dido had come with a message from isabella and that she refused to deliver it to anyone save the major seeing that the negress was thus insistent and wondering what miss dallas might want with him at so painful a time jen yielded and dido was admitted into the library she looked taller more massive and more sullen than ever and though she trembled at the sight of dr etwald who by the way kept his dark eyes studiously fixed on her she was fairly composed when she addressed the major my lil missy want you sar said dido going straight to the point what does she want to see me about asked jen coldly i no know massa she weep she ill she make terrible bobbery dat poo' girl massa come an' see my lil missy dis day i can't at present the police are in the house there is a lot to be attended to tell your mistress dido that i will see her to morrow she want you to day insisted dido obstinately i have given you the message said jen sharply tell her i'll see her to morrow and now dido i want to know what you have to do with this crime i massa ole dido she do nuffin massa maurice he die voodoo oh yes by that devil stick poison me don't know what debble stick is i no touch him it was clearly impossible to learn anything from so obstinate a creature so jen repeated that he would call upon isabella on the morrow and dismissed the negress as she left the room dr etwald followed her and on his return mentioned casually that he had been giving dido some instructions as to what was to be done with isabella the girl is nervously excited he explained and now that she has sustained this shock of mr alymer's death there is no knowing what complications may ensue you don't think her life is in danger asked david in a faltering tone no but i fancy her reason is here jen looked suddenly at etwald and recalled the dinner at which the doctor had read the dead man's hand then he had prophesied ill of maurice an ill which it would seem had been fulfilled now with equal curtness he was prognosticating evil for isabella vexed at such croakings jen spoke abruptly you are a prophet of evil etwald said he first my poor maurice now miss dallas as to that replied etwald with deliberation i foretell that miss dallas may get ill from perfectly natural signs she was in love with alymer she is of a highly excitable and nervous character so it is easy to know that unless great care is exercised her brain may be affected but with regard to maurice quite a different thing i read in his hand that he would be subject to a state of life in death which as we guessed meant paralysis or catalepsy said david but as you see poor maurice is dead your prophecy was false etwald shrugged his shoulders it would seem so he assented mr aylmer is dead as you say so the term life in death can not be applied to his present state of non existence but you will admit that i foretold that evil would happen to him if he decided to marry miss dallas it has turned out as i thought true doctor remarked jen keeping his eyes fixed upon the swart face of the other and is that all you have to say all what else do you expect me to say demanded etwald coldly say who you think killed maurice that is beyond my powers then who stole the devil stick i can't answer that question either said the doctor taking up his hat a detective may be able to assist you on those points engage one no said jen linking david by the arm we don't need aid from the law to learn who killed maurice and avenge his death david and myself will find the guilty person really i hope you will succeed but a case like this requires a trained intelligence such as you will find in a detective of course you may command my services major but i am afraid you will not succeed we shall see replied jen who was as obstinate as a mule on some points i am no fool certainly not rejoined etwald with something like a sneer but you are also no detective that we shall see retorted the major vexed by the sarcasm and thereupon gave etwald to understand by look and manner that he wished to be alone with david when the doctor had taken himself off and was walking past the library windows toward the curve of the avenue where it ran into the woods jen looked after him with a lowering face and laid an inquiring finger on david's arm do you trust that man my boy he asked gravely no returned sarby after a pause i think he is a bad lot i am sure of it and what's more added jen nodding it is my opinion that he knows who killed maurice if indeed he did not do it himself david shook his head i don't think so said he with conviction why should he kill maurice the lad was his rival mine also major yet you don't suspect me of the deed god forbid that my heart should harbor so ill a thought cried jen with natural horror but i tell you what david we must sift this affair to the bottom maurice is dead his assassin is at large so we must catch him him uncle jen or her added the major for all i know that black witch may have something to do with the crime likely enough if she knows how to manipulate the devil stick but she denied knowledge of the devil stick lies lies lies said jen scornfully if i could only but enough of this for the time being he added abruptly we will talk of these things on a more fitting occasion the hours dragged heavily along in that house of mourning the body of the dead man lay in the little chamber which looked out upon the laurel encircled lawn it was covered with a white sheet the hands were folded upon the breast and flowers had been laid thereon by the major over the face a handkerchief had been thrown as the once handsome features were so discolored as to be absolutely repulsive to the sight there was something terrible in the rigidity of the long form stretched out so stiffly under the sheet in the chamber candles were burning and jaggard was watching near the corpse he was to watch throughout the night on the morrow the post mortem examination was to take place and the inspector of police at deanminster had left a man in the house to look after the interests of justice as yet the inspector no very gifted man at the most was doubtful of the proper course to pursue a crime had been committed the victim was a well known gentleman so here if anywhere was a chance of his covering himself with glory by discovering the assassin but arkel the inspector in question had only experience in bucolic crimes of the rick burning order or at the worst the poker murders of laborers the subtlety with which this deed had been accomplished baffled him he could not grasp the idea of the devil stick or even take in the mode of the death if arkel were to be the avenger of alymer's death the assassin ran an excellent chance of getting off scot free david retired early to bed as he was quite worn out with the anxieties of the day but jen was too grieved to sleep he remained in the library thinking over his great loss and wondering what wretch could have taken that young life toward twelve o'clock he went to the kitchen and had a short conversation with the policeman who was a stupid bucolic youth with no more brains than a pumpkin afterward he sought the chamber of death to see that jaggard was not sleeping at his post finally like the good old soldier he was jen went round the house to satisfy himself that the windows and doors were bolted and barred all these things done he returned to the library at first he read and smoked then he paced up and down thinking of his dead lad and finally as the hands of the clock drew to midnight he threw himself into a chair and worn out in body and in mind the old man slept profoundly hour after hour passed in silence the moon set and the night grew darker as the wind rose and moaned through the woods round the house save the muttering of the breeze and the ticking of the clock not a sound was to be heard in that silent room wherein jen slept heavily suddenly he woke with a start somebody was rapping gently on the shutters of the middle window glancing at the clock jen saw that it was three in the morning and wondering who could be outside at so untimely an hour he rose to open the window with care begotten by old experience he picked up his revolver and held it ready while unbolting the window shutters when they were thrown open he saw a white figure with outstretched hands standing before the window good lord miss dallas you here at this hour yes yes whispered the girl stepping into the room i got out of my bedroom window and escaped from my mother and dido i want to see maurice but if you maurice maurice interrupted the girl wildly take me to the dead chamber seeing from her looks that she was too distraught to be argued with jen led her out of the library and into the dead man's room then he uttered a cry which was echoed by a wild shriek from the girl the bed was empty the corpse was gone chapter xi major jen detective astounded and horrified the major with isabella dallas clinging to his arm stood staring at the empty bed the candles were still burning but jaggard had fallen from his chair and was lying a huddled heap upon the floor the one window of the room was wide open and the wind now blowing freely was shaking a loose shutter to and fro the shock of the discovery was so terrific that jen for once in his life lost his presence of mind he was recalled to his senses by the wild voice of isabella maurice maurice where is he she cried leaving the major and rushing toward the empty bed you said he was here my poor dead love but i can't see him where is he where is he god knows stammered jen turning his horrified gaze on the poor girl he did not know what to do isabella was in a dangerous state of hysteria she had on but a loose white dressing gown and her presence in the house at three o'clock in the morning was enough to overpower jen's sense of the reasonable independent of the crowning horror of the missing corpse at this juncture the much needed aid came from without david sarby rushed into the room he was half clothed pale as the white dress of isabella dallas and evidently from the wild look in his eyes and the quivering of his nether lip badly scared stopping short a few paces from the door he held up the lamp which he carried to survey the astonishing scene before him the sight of jen tongue tied and immovable of isabella weeping on her knees by the bedside of the bed itself vacant of its dead occupant all these things were calculated to shock even stronger nerves than those of david sarby nevertheless after a pause of sheer astonishment he managed to stammer out a question did did she cry out he asked nodding toward the girl i heard a shriek his presence and question unlocked the major's tongue yes he replied in a hesitating manner as of one unused to speech she came to the library window ten minutes ago having escaped from the custody of her mother and dido quite hysterical as you see and bent upon seeing our poor dead lad to pacify her i brought her but as you see the body is gone cried david hurrying toward the bed gone gone moaned isabella rising oh my dear dead lover jaggard there said jen pointing to the inanimate form of his old servant he is asleep or dead dead wailed isabella catching at the word maurice dead we must alarm the house cried sarby in a horrified tone and thereupon walked swiftly toward the door but before he could reach it the major having recovered his presence of mind seized him by the arm no no said jen hastily do not bring any one here as yet david we must think of this poor girl take her home at once when you are both out of the house i shall give the alarm you understand no one must know that miss dallas has been in my house at this hour i quite agree with you said david simply and turning to isabella he took her gently by the hand come miss dallas this is no place for you maurice muttered isabella looking piteously at him maurice is not here come miss dallas let me take you back to your mother my mother is so cruel said isabella in a low tone and i feel so ill she continued raising her hand to her loose hair yes yes i must go home but maurice my dear maurice i shall tell you all about it to morrow answered jen soothingly and led her out of the room at the present moment you must go home with mr sarby david there is a loose cloak of mine in the hall wrap it round her and come into the library it is best that she should leave in the way she came david did as he was told and snatched up his own ulster after wrapping up isabella in the library they found the major reopening the shutters of the window which he had closed on the girl's entry when he flung them aside a gust of wind blew inward sprinkling him with moisture rain said jen drawing back all the better there will be no spies about and you can take miss dallas home without being observed taking the girl by the hand david led her toward the window she was in a half dazed condition the result of the strong excitement which had impelled her to make this midnight visit and her nerves being thus dulled she surrendered herself passively to the guidance of david only at the window did she pause and look steadfastly at the major you must find out what has become of my dear maurice's body she said quietly i promise you replied jen with a look of stern determination in his face and you will let me know i promise you said jen again please go miss dallas there is no time to be lost and you must not be found here thus entreated isabella stepped out into the night and in a moment or so she was swallowed up in the darkness with her companion left alone the major closed the window bolted and barred the shutters and then hastened back to the death chamber where he rang the bell in a few minutes the footman half dressed and half asleep made his appearance then came the policeman hastily from the kitchen finally as the bell still continued ringing all the other servants male and female poured into the room a single glance showed them what had occurred the insensible jaggard the empty bed the open window a babel of voices ensued silence all of you cried jen authoritatively we must act not talk two of you take jaggard to his room tell the groom to ride at once to deanminster for dr etwald and inspector arkel sampson he added turning to the policeman who was stolidly staring at the empty bed rouse yourself take lanterns and search for footmarks there must have been more than one person to carry off a dead body these directions were obeyed at once the house the grounds the whole wild night with its driving tempest became radiant with lights and alive with terrified men that a human being should be murdered was sufficiently ghastly without this crowning horror of a missing body coming after every man looked on his fellow with suspicion in the yellow light of the lanterns dimly through the steady downpour of rain could be seen pallid faces and scared expressions and while the men folk scoured the house the park and the adjacent lanes environing ashantee the female servants unnerved and hysterical crowded together in the kitchen whispering over hastily prepared tea it was a wild night and full of the vague horrors of death and mystery etwald came immediately from deanminster in company with arkel whom this last extraordinary event took entirely by surprise he questioned sampson the young policeman left in charge he searched the chamber of death stepped out of the window and across the lawn toward the belt of laurels which divided the lawn from a winding and tortuous lane this a tenebrous pathway even in the noonday slipped eel like through darkling trees to emerge into the high road a quarter of a mile away arkel was so long absent that jen could only surmise that he had gone into this outward darkness and on the inspector's return it appeared that the major was right in his conjecture furthermore arkel brought back certain news without doubt the body was taken out through the window he said to jen the flower bed beneath the lattice is trampled down it was carried across the lawn for i could see by the light of the lantern the footmarks of four feet and through the bushes into the lane the way can be traced easily enough to that point but it is too dark to note any further sign nothing more can be done to night said jen gloomily the men have returned dead tired but they have seen nothing and no one where were you when the body was stolen sleeping in the library i saw that all was safe about midnight and then sat down over a book and fell asleep i woke somewhere about three you are sure it was that hour certain i heard the hall clock strike on waking i went into the room where the dead body was laid out to assure myself that all was well i found the bed empty the window open and jaggard insensible did you hear any noise none at all but the wind and rain were wild outside so that they may have drowned the noise made by those who broke in we must question your servant said arkel having noted the major's answers in his pocket book he was stunned i believe i can't say i haven't examined him stunned or drugged i suppose and where is mr sarby asked the inspector as they turned to leave the room the major was prepared for this question and as he did not intend that the visit of isabella to the house should become known to the police he answered it in a guarded fashion mr sarby went out as soon as we discovered the loss and he has not yet returned was he with you when you made the discovery no he had retired to bed rejoined jen but as soon as i saw what had taken place i called him up and he jumped through the window to see if he could espy any traces of the robbers then the servants came and i sent for you inspector arkel who could not see one inch beyond his nose was quite satisfied with this explanation and nodded in reply he left the room with the major to seek out jaggard and if possible to learn from him what had occurred but this they were unable to do the man had been stunned by a blow on the head and was quite insensible and yet he was a strong man said etwald when he conveyed this intelligence he must have been taken by surprise undoubtedly asserted jen readily but he must also have been asleep else he would have called out as the men burst through the window how do you know there were more than one asked etwald in a jesting tone because maurice was an unusually heavy man replied the major and he could not have been carried off that is his body could not have been carried off he corrected with a sigh unless by two men there may have been three for all i know but what is the meaning of it all cried jen in bewildered dismay why was the poor lad's body stolen resurrectionists suggested arkel whereupon major jen shuddered for god's sake don't even hint at such a thing he cried vehemently it would be too terrible and as it happens quite unbelievable it is incredible that such a thing could occur nowadays it is incredible that such a thing as the theft of a body should occur said etwald dryly yet it has taken place but where is mr sarby i should think that he would be present to aid you jen was just about to repeat his feigned explanation regarding david's absence when the door opened and the young man wet and exhausted entered the room to give him his cue the major spoke to him at once you are just in time david as i was telling these gentlemen about your hunt after those wretches did you see anyone i saw nothing said david wearily god knows what has become of the body have you any theory mr sarby no doctor i am too weary to frame theories at this hour of the night but no doubt mr inspector yonder can certainly not interrupted arkel sharply i can prove nothing i am quite puzzled and no wonder said etwald counting off events on his fingers the devil stick the murder the theft of the body this is a catalogue of horrors a man might do worse than write a story on these things i agree with you remarked the major sharply a man might make a jest of these horrors as you are doing i assure you i never felt less like jesting in my life replied etwald coldly but it is no use discussing such a thing at five in the morning if you can do without me major i shall return to deanminster i am tired but jaggard asked david rising stiffly from his chair he is all right for the time being i have detailed a housemaid as nurse and she knows what to do i'll come back again in the morning and see if he has recovered his senses when etwald took his departure major jen sent david to bed in spite of the young man's remonstrances but remained up himself to talk to arkel for a long time jen discussed the matter with the inspector but the conversation proved extremely unsatisfactory arkel was not a clever detective or even a keen witted man and in a case like the present difficult and involved he was quite at a loss how to proceed finally major jen dismissed him in despair and while arkel went to see his men who were posted round the house a clear case of shutting the stable door after the steed was stolen jen remained alone to think of what he should do i must be my own detective he thought pacing the library this man is a fool he will find out nothing and i won't have even the satisfaction of burying the body of my poor lad i must do the work myself with the assistance of david to find out who stole the devil stick that is the first step to discover who killed maurice that is the second step to learn who carried away his body that is the third step three very difficult things to find out and i don't see where to begin i must learn all i can about maurice's past life for he may have enemies of whom i know nothing once i learn who his enemies are if he had any and i may discover the truth i shall go and sleep and when i awaken i shall set to work to solve these mysteries as he spoke the major unbarred the shutters of the window the rain had ceased the dawn was breaking and the terrible night was at an end it is an omen said the major an omen of good chapter xii the strange perfume the sensation caused by the news that the dead body of maurice alymer had been stolen was even greater than that occasioned by the discovery of the murder even the london papers took up the matter and sent down reporters to make investigations and build up theories as to the reason of this strange disappearance everywhere people were talking of the matter and giving their opinions as to the proper course to be pursued in recovering the corpse would be detectives haunted the roads and lanes around ashantee they would have penetrated into the park itself but for the vigilance of major jen his attitude at this moment was rather displeasing to his friends he refused to permit anyone to see the chamber whence the body had been stolen and even declined to discuss the matter or accept advice as to the best thing to be done to all who spoke to him and these were many he had but one reply i know what i am doing he would say a trifle tartly and i prefer to keep my own counsel if the murderer of my dear boy can be found he or she will be found by me if the wretch who stole his body can be discovered i am the man to make that discovery how i intend to set about it is my own affair of course busybodies who saw their well meant but meddlesome advice thus rejected were by no means pleased and some even went so far as to say that the shock of death and disappearance had unsettled jen's reason they spoke to david and counseled him to look well after his guardian and said also that the major if he had his senses about him which was doubtful should engage a smart london detective to investigate the case but as has been before stated jen had concluded to be his own detective it must be conceded that for an amateur the major set about his unaccustomed task in a very methodical manner he offered a reward of five hundred pounds for the detection of the murderer and a further sum of the like amount to anyone who should discover the thief who had desecrated the chamber of death these munificent rewards set everybody on the alert and jen without putting down actual money thus became possessed of some hundreds of spies who would bring him any information likely to assist him in his investigation also the major examined all the servants in the house he questioned sampson the young policeman who had been in the kitchen on the night when the body had been stolen and finally he paid a visit to the police office at deanminster where he saw mr inspector arkel well arkel said jen after the first greetings were over have you any clew no major replied arkel rather gruffly for disappointment was beginning to tell on his temper nor are we likely to find any until that servant of yours regains his senses how is he now in a state of high fever poor soul said jen with a depressed look he does nothing but rave yet in all his wild talk he never lets slip a single word likely to help us that's a pity major by the way i questioned dr etwald about the matter and he is of opinion that the man was stunned by a blow on the head i know that i can only suppose that jaggard fell asleep at his post and woke up in time to see the men getting in by the window a struggle would then ensue and he would be struck on the head as etwald supposes i don't agree with that theory there are flaws in it yes queried jen eagerly i am open to correction please go on we will proceed on the questions and answers system said arkel precisely and thrash out the matter in that way you were in the library on that night yes i saw all was right in the house at twelve o' clock and i slept on in my chair from that hour until three good then between twelve and three the body must have been stolen you are a light sleeper i heard you say major well yes returned jen with a thought upon the rapping of isabella upon the window it does not take much to waken me you would have heard jaggard call out i suppose certainly the bedroom is no great distance from the library and the door of the latter was open but then jaggard didn't cry out precisely said arkel laying his forefinger on jen's chest with an air of triumph he did not cry out had he been asleep and woke up in time to see the robbers get in by the window he would have called out at once for assistance true enough rejoined the major struck by this sensible deduction still he might not have heard them forcing the window i doubt that i doubt that jaggard like yourself is an old campaigner and no doubt an alert sleeper that is explained arkel he would wake up at the least sound yes i think he would but what does all this tend to simply to a theory i have in my head jaggard was drugged sir but the wound at the back of the head which stunned him there you have it cried arkel with a nod the wound at the back of the head was caused by his falling like a log when he was drugged h'm this is all building on sand said jen doubtfully even to drug him these men must have entered by the window no do you not remember when we examined the window that it was opened from the inside egad you are right then you think that someone must have been concealed in the room and sprung out from hiding to drug jaggard no said arkel again no one was concealed in the room confound it man you don't mean to say that jaggard opened the window cried jen starting from his seat with some show of temper ay but i do major jaggard helped to steal the body of mr alymer he opened the window to admit his accomplices when they fulfilled their task and got the body out of the room they turned on jaggard and betrayed him that is they drugged him and knocked him down i don't agree with you at all arkel jaggard is perfectly honest and was as devoted to maurice as he is to me besides even granting the possibility of such a thing which i do not in the least why should jaggard's accomplices betray him i can't say returned arkel shrugging his shoulders they may have been bribed to steal the body and on accomplishing their task did not want to share the bribe with jaggard rubbish said jen tartly they must have known that he would betray them when he recovered his senses no doubt but in the meantime they would make themselves scarce jaggard has been insensible or raving for over a week major the scoundrels counted on that i say again that i believe in jaggard's honesty and i do not agree with you said jen putting on his hat and after all i do not see how you deduce this drugging theory oh as to that i was once a bit of a chemist explained arkel and when you took me to see jaggard i smelt a curious perfume which seemed to be hanging about him as a servant is not likely to use perfumes i thought it curious what kind of a perfume i can't exactly describe it a rich heavy deadly sort of thing likely i should think to dull the sharpest senses did etwald notice it asked jen thoughtfully yes but he professes his inability to explain it he thinks the man was stunned and not drugged i think on the grounds i have explained that he was first drugged and then stunned h'm it's queer i'll have to think it over but when the body was taken out of the window arkel the thieves carried it across the lawn then down through the bushes to that winding lane i suppose said jen i know all that but afterward they put it into a cart and took it away how do you know that asked the major all on the alert why said arkel fingering his fat chin it was raining as you may remember on that night not until after the body had been stolen returned jen mindful that isabella had come into the library dry shod how do you know that asked the inspector sharply jen was rather taken aback by the quickness of this query and saw that if he wished to preserve the secret of isabella upon which depended her reputation it behooved him to be careful well said he cautiously i looked out at the night when the hour was twelve and it might have rained between that time and three said arkel with swift interruption and i believe it did rain for you see major we found the mark of wheels in the lane which would not have been left had not a considerable amount of rain fallen did you follow the trail asked the major waiving the question of rain or no rain arkel made a gesture of disappointment to the high road only said he and there the wheel marks became mixed up with those of other vehicles lord knows where they took the body to for once on the high road they had the wide wide world to choose from it's the devil's own mystery he said biting his finger i never met the like of it before and am fairly puzzled why should these wretches steal the mortal remains of a murdered man true said jen and why should these wretches have murdered that man arkel looked up sharply as to that he said we are by no means certain that they are the same i don't follow you no and yet it is easy enough if those who slew mr alymer wanted his body they could have stolen it on the high road where they struck him down it was mere foolishness to venture liberty and life in a raid upon the house it may have been an afterthought people don't have afterthoughts in grim matters of this kind said arkel rising well major good by good by should i learn anything else i shall let you know but depend upon it the truth of the matter is to come from jaggard he is honest honest cried jen i'll stake my existence upon that when riding homeward after this interesting conversation the major could not but admit to himself that arkel had brightened up wonderfully in his intellects since first taking charge of the case the man was not brilliant not even clever yet in the present instance he displayed more readiness of resource than jen would have given him credit for the theory of the drugging was worthy of investigation and the major determined to see if anything could be discovered likely to support this view of the matter he still held to his belief in jaggard's honesty for it was incredible that an old servant of thirty years' standing should turn traitor at once but he thought it probable that someone might have taken him by surprise and drugged him but as the window was closed the person in question must have been concealed in the room here jen's train of thought became confused i don't see how anybody can have been in the room he reflected as he entered his house i saw that all was safe myself at midnight the servants were abed sampson keeping vigil in the kitchen and jaggard sentry in the death room moreover i left the library door open and the sound of footsteps stealing to the door of my poor lad would have wakened me out of the deepest sleep isabella's raps were light enough yet i was up on the instant no i can't see myself that the devil who drugged the man could have been in the house and yet the window opened from the inside h'm it is strange very strange i wish jaggard were able to talk sensibly but jaggard was far from the condition of connected thought or coherent words he turned and tossed upon his poor bed with bright eyes burning skin and babbling tongue his head was swathed in bandages and the housemaid who watched beside him had frequently to replace the clothes he tossed off in his violent movements this nurse was a sickly dark eyed creature who was strongly attached to jaggard and it was her love for him that made her proffer her services to look after him and that chained her to his bedside she reported to her master that dr etwald had been in that morning and was coming again in the afternoon but that there was nothing to be done until the delirium had expended itself ay thought jen as he stood by the bed or until the man dies if he dies without regaining his senses we will never know the truth he bent down to replace the bedclothes which the sick man had thrown off and as he did so a faint perfume sickly and rich struck his nostrils it seemed to come from the bandages at the back of the head and on bending down for a closer inspection jen saw that one of these it was the merest corner which peeped out was of finer linen than the rest the fabric was cambric and with a start which made the blood turn to ice in his veins jen realized that it was a woman's handkerchief its delicacy and border embroideries assured him of this how came this here he asked the housemaid pointing to the scrap of linen oh that was on the first night sir she hastened to explain it was put on his head when in the room where he fell sir the doctor sir says as it ain't safe to take it away yet a curtain interposed between the head of the patient and the light of the window this jen drew aside and lightly removed the outside wrappings of the wound the housemaid looked on in horror for she did not dare to prevent her master from meddling yet she felt sure that he was doing wrong but jen was bent on making the discovery as to whom the handkerchief belonged and in a few minutes he had the outside bandages removed and saw the handkerchief discolored with dry blood lying over the wound with deft fingers he lightly touched the four corners in one of them were the initials m d m d said the major to himself margaret dallas the mother of isabella how did her handkerchief come into the room on that night and the perfume it struck his sense of smell with the belief that he had smelt it before nothing is so strong to awaken memory as odor and in less than half a minute the mind of the major leaped back to where he had smelt it before it was the perfume of the dried poison of the devil stick chapter xiii isabella this discovery at once irritated amazed and perplexed the major that the handkerchief of mrs dallas should be bound around the head of jaggard was strange but that it should be perfumed with the deadly scent which impregnated the devil stick was stranger still had mrs dallas found the wand of sleep had mrs dallas perfumed the handkerchief with its cruel poison had mrs dallas drugged or stupefied jaggard on that fatal night by means of that saturated handkerchief these were the vital questions which presented themselves to the puzzled major and which he found himself unable to answer and here at this point the personality of dr etwald intruded itself into the affair it was etwald who had bound up the wound with the handkerchief in question and who according to the housemaid had forbidden its removal the question was had he received it from mrs dallas or had he found it on that night by the side of the insensible man if the first mrs dallas must have perfumed it designedly with the poison and etwald knowing that it was so impregnated must have used it advisedly as a bandage if the second mrs dallas must have been in the room on the night in question and have used the handkerchief to render jaggard insensible and in either case as the major very sensibly concluded mrs dallas must be in possession of the devil stick otherwise how could she have obtained the deadly scent and the plain conclusion of the whole affair soliloquized jen is that mrs dallas must have stolen the devil stick must have murdered maurice and must have drugged jaggard for the purpose of completing her devilish work by stealing my poor boy's body but her reason that she did not desire maurice for a son in law was an insufficient motive for the commission of a triple crime she had declined to sanction the engagement she had forbidden maurice the house and assisted upon all points by social rules she had ample power to prevent the match which as she averred was distasteful to her why then with this power should she jeopardize liberty and life by thieving the devil stick and killing the man in his perplexity jen sought out david and asked his opinion the young lawyer gave a very decided verdict in favor of mrs dallas i don't believe mrs dallas has anything to do with the matter he said in a decisive voice she had no motive to commit these three crimes each one of which is more terrible than the other nor major do i think that she has nerve or brain enough to design or accomplish assassination or theft but i assure you david the handkerchief is hers granted but you forget that isabella was in the room on that night she might have dropped the handkerchief well said jen after a pause that is not improbable but the perfume oh replied david with a shrug we know that the scent is an ashantee preparation dido's grandmother came from ashantee so it is just probable that dido herself knowing the secret might have prepared a dose of the poison even so why should she have perfumed the handkerchief i can't say major you had better ask her egad i shall cried jen starting from his chair and also i'll find out why she needed to prepare the poison at all in my opinion david that black jezebel is at the bottom of the whole affair she thieved the devil stick she prepared the poison murdered maurice and stole his body you accused mrs dallas of all these things five minutes ago said david ironically and now you think i don't know what to think cried jen in desperation dido or mrs dallas i don't know which but one of them must be guilty i'll go over to the wigwam at once to accuse them upon insufficient evidence no i'll see isabella and hear what she has to say she loved maurice and will aid me to avenge his death that is improbable if to do so she has to betray her mother or her nurse i don't think you'll learn much in that quarter major i'll learn what i can at all events retorted jen and in this unsatisfactory manner the conversation concluded david retired to his room and jen went off to interview isabella at the wigwam he walked meditatively down to the gates and here on the high road his thoughts led him to a sudden conclusion respecting the coming conversation with miss dallas without much consideration he retraced his steps rapidly and sought out david in his room then and there he asked him a question which was of vital importance david said he abruptly owing to the coming of etwald and arkel on that night the night upon which the body was stolen i mean i forgot to ask you what reception miss dallas met with on her return home who received her mrs dallas she had missed her daughter and had been seeking for her in a state of terror surely natural under the circumstances i found her pacing the veranda wondering what had become of isabella pacing the veranda echoed jen thoughtfully was she fully dressed well yes so far as my memory serves me i think she was and dido i saw nothing or heard nothing of dido when i found mrs dallas i simply performed my mission and delivered isabella into her hands the poor girl was quite distraught with the horror of the night and was led unresistingly to bed by her mother mrs dallas dressed dido missing said the major thank you david you have told me all i want to know and with a nod major jen set off for the second time to the wigwam the major was rather inclined to agree with david that it would be difficult to learn anything of material value from isabella on the night she had visited the house at three o'clock in the morning her brain had been unsettled for the time being by the terrible death which had overtaken her lover and she had been thrown into a frenzy by the mysterious theft of his body the question which the major wished answered was whether she had been sufficiently herself to remember the events of that night and especially those which had taken place prior to her escape from the wigwam but the only way to decide this doubt was to see the girl personally and major jen feared lest he should find mrs dallas and dido obstacles to his accomplishment of this object however fortune favored him and to state the truth fortune rather astonished him for upon arriving within the grounds of mrs dallas the major met with isabella herself in a light colored dress with sunshade and straw hat she was strolling down the walk which led to the gate on coming up with jen he was surprised to see that her manner was calm and collected in all respects different from that displayed during the frenzy of the midnight visit he could hardly believe that she was the same girl i am glad to see you major said she holding out her hand you have saved me the trouble of a journey as i was on my way to your house to see me miss dallas yes to see you she replied with a serious face in order to talk with you about my last visit on that terrible night my dear young lady he remonstrated why distress yourself with recollections of these things because it is necessary that i should do so major it is my intention to aid you in your search for the assassin of maurice oh yes you may look doubtful as to my ability to help you but i can and will i am not the mad woman who burst into your library at three in the morning i am cool and calm and bent upon revenge maurice is dead i loved him and i intend to devote myself to avenging his death come major sit upon this seat beside me and relate all you have heard all you have discovered with my woman's wit i may be able to help you in the way the mouse aided the lion begin jen was astonished both at her peremptory tone and her quiet manner whatever influence had been at work it was certainly wonderful how she had calmed down from the nervous hysterical girl into the reasonable and cool headed woman isabella noted the amazement of the major and guessing its cause she explained the reason of the change in her looks manner and nervous system dr etwald cured me major she said quietly he has preserved my sanity and i owe him a debt of gratitude you certainly do said jen dryly will you repay it by marrying him no i shall marry no one not even mr sarby much as my mother wishes me to do so i live only to avenge the death of maurice to recover his body from those who have stolen it come major tell me what you know thus adjured and feeling that he could not do without her assistance jen related all that he had heard from arkel and also his own personal experience with regard to the finding of the handkerchief marked m d isabella heard him to the end in silence her large and shining eyes fixed upon his face when he paused she pondered and finally spoke out it would seem that you suspect dido or my mother of having something to do with the matter she remarked coldly major jen equivocated no he replied i don't say that exactly but you must admit that the finding of the handkerchief bound round jaggard's head is strange not at all dr etwald used it as a bandage so i understand but did dr etwald bring it to the house with him no he picked it up in the bedroom precisely assented jen eagerly therefore your mother had nothing to do with it interrupted isabella i dropped the handkerchief in the room is there anything so very extraordinary in that she added impatiently the matter is very simple i brought with me one of my mother's handkerchiefs instead of my own in the agitation of finding the body gone i dropped it and dr etwald found it to use as a bandage that is quite plain i think quite plain agreed the major saving the presence of the perfume similar to that of the devil stick i don't know anything about the devil stick i never saw it but with regard to the perfume i can explain i was ill on that night as you know and dido applied some of her negro remedies among them the perfume with which that handkerchief of my mother's was saturated it was bound across my forehead to soothe the nerves during my journey to your house i snatched it off and i can understand all that interrupted jen but the similarity of the perfumes i must have that point cleared up i daresay it can be said isabella quietly come up to the house major and speak to dido i feel sure she can explain very good said jen as they turned their steps toward the house if her explanation is only as clear as your own i shall have nothing to say by the way miss dallas how did you escape from your room that night so far as i can remember i left by my bedroom window i had only to step out through it like a door as it is a french window and opens onto the lawn h'm said jen but seeing that you were so ill was no one watching beside you yes my mother was so you see major she could not have dropped the handkerchief in the bedroom of poor dear maurice no i understand you have explained the affair of the handkerchief clearly all the points have been elucidated save that dealing with the perfume you will now be satisfied on that point said miss dallas rather dryly for here is dido she prepared the drug and perfumed the handkerchief and for all i know added the girl ironically she may have taken the hint from your wand of sleep chapter xiv lady meg one moment said jen as they approached the veranda whereon dido was waiting them how do you know etwald picked up the handkerchief in the room because i overheard his apology to my mother for having put her handkerchief to such use replied isabella with suspicious promptitude humph didn't the doctor think it strange that he should find it there i don't know major he made no remark rather peculiar don't you think seeing that he must necessarily have been ignorant of your visit on that night the color of isabella rose in her cheeks he was not ignorant of that she said in a low voice to account for the fever which seized me my mother explained all that took place to dr etwald he quite understood that i had dropped the handkerchief did he apologize for his use of it before or after the explanation was jen's final question after replied isabella with some hesitation then abruptly left the major's side to exchange a few words with dido jen as was natural looked after her with a glance full of doubt and suspicion notwithstanding her love for maurice and her expressed desire to avenge his death by hunting down the assassin she appeared to be anything but frank in the matter in plain words her conduct suggested to jen's mind an idea that she knew more than she cared to talk about and that such half hinted knowledge implicated her mother in which case but here dido interrupted jen's meditations my missy tell me you wish to hear my obi she said abruptly fixing her eyes on the face of the visitor why you wish you laugh at obi i don't particularly wish to learn your voodoo secrets answered jen carelessly all i desire to know is why you manufactured that scent with which you saturated a certain handkerchief of your mistress mother's handkerchief dido explained isabella interrupting the one you bound round my head oh dat a voodoo smell to drib away de evil spirit said dido solemnly addressing herself more particularly to the major my witch mudder she learn to make dat in her own land in ashantee ho yis it berry strong dat smell too much of it kill kill kill by means of its odor no dat only drib away bad debbils but you scratch de skin with one leetle bit of it and you die die die and the scratch is made by means of the wand of sleep yis dat so said dido with pretended surprise turning on him sharply but you no b'lieve in obi massa what you know of de wand of sleep de debble stick because i had one dido the negress laughed with scornful doubt ho dat one big lie der ain't de debble stick but in de king's palace at kumassi you are wrong i had one and it was stolen by why of course interrupted isabella again don't you remember dido you were asked if you had taken it ho yis now i do tink said dido ah massa you say i took de debble stick and made de new smell to fill him den dat i kill wid him massa who lubbed lil missy and dat i made spells in your house to steal de body heh dat not so it certainly is so assented jen astonished to hear her put his suspicions into such plain words mr alymer was killed by means of this poison it was used again to render my servant insensible while the body was stolen so i thought i know i know broke in dido impatiently but dat not to do wid me de poison in your debble stick there was but it was all dried up no dat nossin if you pour wather in dat stick de poison come alive well dat stick taken but i no take it dat poo' young massa killed wid it i no kill him but de udder ting sah dat smell i mek it for missy dat all and having made this explanation dido folded her arms and waited in scornful silence to hear what her accuser had to say he considered the absolute absurdity of her story which on the face of it was a manifest invention and one which it would seem was supported by the testimony of isabella you are satisfied now i think said this latter seeing that the major did not speak well yes miss dallas returned he with much deliberation i am' satisfied for the time being does dido's explanation give you any clew she asked quickly major jen considered again and looked her straightly in the eyes yes he replied with point and some dryness it gives me a clew in a direction for which i should not have looked for it thank you miss dallas and you dido i shall now say good day when will you return when i have followed to its end the clew of which we have been speaking replied jen and taking off his hat he walked swiftly away from the house swiftly as he was afraid lest isabella would ask him indoors and for certain reasons not unconnected with the late conversation he did not wish to face mrs dallas at the present moment there were large issues at stake when he vanished round the curve of the drive isabella with a very pale face turned toward dido i have told all the lies you wished me to tell she said hurriedly i have hidden from the sharp eyes of major jen those things which you wished hidden and all at the cost of my honor and honesty der noting wrong missy said dido eagerly i swear don't cried isabella with a shudder you have done enough evil do not add perjury to your other sins she ran hastily into the house as though to escape further conversation on a distasteful subject while dido with her eyes on the ground remained in deep thought the old negress knew that she was placed in a perilous position which might be rendered even more so should isabella speak freely but of this she had little fear as by her conversation with major jen the girl had gone forward on a path of concealment whence there was now no retreat yet dido was not satisfied she did not trust those around her and she was uneasy as to what might be the result of jen's pertinacity in investigating both the death of maurice and the disappearance of the body thus perplexed it occurred to her to seek out and consult with dr etwald i shall tell the master all she muttered in her own barbaric dialect and he will tell me what to do the spirit in the voodoo stone will tell him having come to this resolution she went into the house to ask or rather to demand permission to visit deanminster that she was about to call upon etwald the negress did not think it necessary to tell mrs dallas there were matters between her and the doctor of which mrs dallas knew nothing which she would not have understood if she had known when she inquired dido merely hinted that such secrets had to do with obi when the superstitious nature of mrs dallas immediately shrank from pursuing an inquiry into what were even to this civilized so called christian woman secret mysteries but while dido goes on her dark path and takes her way toward etwald in his gloomy house at deanminster it is necessary to return to the doings of major jen on leaving the wigwam he returned forthwith to his own house with the intention of repeating to david the conversation which had taken place between himself dido and isabella on his arrival however he learned that david had gone out for a walk and that lady meg brance was waiting for him in the library at once the ever courteous major hastened to apologize to his visitor my dear lady meg i am so sorry to have been absent when you called i hope you have not been waiting long only half an hour replied lady meg in a low grave voice i should have waited in any case until your return as i have something important to say to you the major looked inquiringly at his visitor she was a tall and stately woman with a fair complexion steady blue eyes and hair of a deep red shade although close on twenty five years of age she was still a spinster as much to the annoyance of her mother a match making matron she had hitherto declined the most eligible offers for her hand her reasons for such refusals she would not state but jen from certain observations had long since guessed the truth lady meg was deeply in love with maurice alymer and it was for his sake that she remained single whether she knew that the young man loved isabella dallas it is impossible to say but at all events she showed him very plainly the drift of her desires the very indifference of alymer had rendered her passion more violent and persistent what would have been the conclusion of this one sided love it is difficult to conjecture but the death of maurice had brought this and all other things to an abrupt conclusion lady meg was dressed in black out of regard for the dead man and she looked worn red eyed and very dejected but in coming forward to greet the major her fine blue eyes lighted up with the fire of hope and it was with something of her old impetuosity quenched since the death of maurice that she gave him her hand and repeated her last remark i have something to say to you she said quickly something likely to help you in your investigations concerning the theft of the body asked jen eagerly no with regard to the murder what is it i will inform you in a few minutes replied lady meg but first tell me if you have found out anything likely to reveal the truth no jen shook his head mournfully i am completely in the dark and so is inspector arkel the whole case is a profound mystery well mysteries even the most profound have been cleared up before now major come tell me precisely how the matter stands and i may be able to help you you know something yes i do and it is to tell that something that i have driven over to day well now major let me know all about the matter from the beginning i have heard nothing but the most garbled accounts and it is necessary for the sake of the information which i am about to impart that i should know the exact truth i shall tell it to you replied jen with some hesitation but i am afraid i shall give you pain i guess what you mean miss dallas jen bent his head gravely maurice wanted to marry her i know i know replied lady meg while a wave of color passed over her fair face you do cried jen in surprise and who told you mr sarby oh the major considered a moment and his thoughts were anything but benevolent toward david i can guess why he told you what do you mean major never mind at present said jen evasively i'll tell you that later on in the meantime let me state the case maurice was killed on the high road by means as i verily believe of the devil stick you know about that of course yes i read the report of the inquest and i have heard rumors i agree with you major that mr alymer was killed by the poison of the devil stick go on on the night that the body was stolen continued jen deliberately jaggard was drugged by whom i can't say if i knew that i'd know who stole the body but he was drugged by means of a perfume which is the same as that impregnating the devil stick how do you know jen was about to explain when he remembered the necessity of keeping silent concerning the visit of isabella to the house i can't tell you that just now he said in a hesitating manner but i know it for certain well said lady meg it would seem that the devil stick is the center of this mystery i fancy it is if you found the devil stick you would know the truth i don't go so far as that protested jen if we found the person who stole the devil stick from my smoking room i might guess the truth in that case major look at this said lady meg and produced an article from her pocket an article which she held up triumphantly before the astonished eyes of the old man the devil stick he cried by all that is wonderful the devil stick yes the devil stick i got it from the assassin of mr alymer the assassin you know the assassin who is he or she it is not a woman but a man battersea chapter xv cross examination major jen sprang to his feet with a loud cry this information that battersea was the criminal took him so utterly by surprise that for the moment he was tongue tied then when he recalled the feeble and emaciated form of the old tramp when he recollected his weak intelligence he altogether declined to believe that such a creature one so wanting in activity could have conceived and executed a triple crime the theft of the devil stick the murder of maurice the stealing of the body battersea had not sufficient craft or strength to do such things with a shrug of his shoulders the major resumed his seat you must be mistaken lady meg he said in a quiet voice whosoever may be guilty battersea for physical and mental reasons must be innocent that you must prove replied lady meg dryly and in accusing battersea i go only on your own premises you said that the man who stole the devil stick who had it in his possession must be the guilty person you see the devil stick there she pointed to the table well i obtained that from battersea how did you obtain it knowing that i collected curiosities he came to sell it to me a proof of his innocence cried jen promptly if the man had been guilty he certainly would not offer the evidence of his guilt for sale where did he obtain this devil stick out of your smoking room i presume said lady meg but i have not questioned him as i thought it best that you should examine him yourself certainly when i can find him where is he now round at your stables with my groom i brought him over with me thank you lady meg said jen cordially i congratulate you on your presence of mind and on your courage there is no necessity to congratulate me at all replied the other coloring i knew that it would not be wise to let him out of sight after i saw the devil stick in his possession and as to my courage she added carelessly the poor old creature is so feeble that even i a woman could overpower him but ring the bell major and have him in i may be wrong he may be innocent but if you force him to confess how he obtained possession of the devil stick you may get at the truth and perhaps at the name of the murderer it won't be the name of battersea said jen touching the button of the bell he had no motive to steal my devil stick or to kill maurice nor could he have any reason to take possession of a dead body besides added jen returning to his seat if this tramp were guilty he would scarcely put his neck in danger by offering you the devil stick for sale at this moment the footman appeared in answer to the bell and in obedience to his master's peremptory order left the room again for the purpose of bringing in old battersea for examination while waiting neither lady meg nor the major spoke as they both considered and truly that nothing further could be said until the truth was forced from the tramp then the present aspect of the case might change and an important step might be taken toward the solution of the mystery as dirty and disreputable as ever battersea rolling his cap in his dirty hands made his appearance on the threshold of the library conducted by the disgusted footman when the door was closed behind him and he stood alone before those who were about to examine him he shifted uneasily from one foot to the other blinked his bleared eyes and blushed as with the shame of guilt through the sallow darkness of his skin jen with the military instinct of command fully awakened within him looked sternly at the feeble old creature and questioned him sharply as though he were talking to a soldier who had done wrong on her part lady meg left the most part of the examination to the major but she listened with anxious looks and parted lips to every word which fell from the tramp's lips the death of the man whom she had loved so deeply had inflicted terrible anguish upon her loving heart and as a tribute to his memory she was anxious to punish his assassin but at present influenced by the views of the major she began to waver in her opinion regarding the guilt of the weak brained creature who stood trembling nervously at the doorway what is your name man demanded jen commencing in the orthodox manner battersea sir what else nothin' else retorted the tramp sullenly my father was black an' my mother she was white an' they weren't married i was brought up in battersea parish so i took that name i did not havin' any right to another name how do you get your living i begs said battersea candidly and when i can't get nuffin i steals i am sure of that remarked jen taking the devil stick off the table and you stole this i'll be bound i didn't i found it oh said the major in a satirical tone you found it where at missus dallas' place jen started and looked sharply at the old man who to all appearances was answering his questions with all possible candor be more explicit man he said sternly what do you mean by mrs dallas' place the house or the grounds the groun's near the gate when did you find it the day arter th' young gen'man was killed and why didn't you give it up to the police battersea scowled i wanted money for it i did he said huskily an' they wouldn't give no tin to me fur findin' it she pointing to lady meg is fond of pretty things so i guv it her for five shillin' but she didn't pay me for it no said lady meg speaking for the first time because i did not know if you had come by it honestly i tell 'ee i found it i did growled battersea becoming restive under the constant questioning found it near the gate of missus dallas' place inside the gate asked jen or outside on the road inside jus' among the grass i was comin' up to get some food from missy and i sowr that 'andle shinin' in the sun i goes an' i looks an' i fin's it i knowed as the perlice wanted it 'cause i 'eard talk of it doin' murder but as perlice wouldn't give me tin i wouldn't guv it to they added battersea cunningly so i keeps it for 'er but she ain't paid me yit he concluded with the whine of a mendicant for the moment major jen did not ask any more questions for the very simple reason that he did not exactly know what course to take undoubtedly the tramp was telling the truth he had no reason to conceal it for in his own mind jen quite acquitted him of any complicity in the crime that so feeble and elderly a creature debauched by intemperance weak from insufficient food should attack a vigorous young athlete like maurice was out of the question even though he had the advantage of possessing the devil stick but here the question of the dried up poison occurred to jen if the poison had evaporated by the lapse of time the devil stick must have been innocuous and incapable of inflicting death therefore upon the evidence of the saturated handkerchief the bag concealed in the turquoise studded handle must have been refilled by dido dido for the significant reason that she inheriting the traditions of her ashantee grandmother alone must have been capable of manufacturing the deadly drug to prove this assumption a feasible one the devil stick was close at hand jen picked it up and slightly pressed the handle at once the turquoise gems indented the concealed bag at once the iron fang protruded from the end of the stick and on looking closely the major at the end of the spike observed an oblong drop of greenish hue the evidence of his own eyes was enough and jen replaced the devil stick upon the table with the full conviction that the bag had been filled with a fresh preparation of its original venom this discovery to the major's mind confirmed the guilt of the negress what is the matter asked lady meg as she saw the major's face grow dark with his thought is anything wrong yes dido is wrong he said i always thought that black witch was at the bottom of everything i am sure of it now dido repeated lady meg thoughtfully i have heard mr alymer and mr sarby talking about her a negress is she not yes and a murderess major do you think certainly i do i believe she killed maurice but the evidence is as yet too slight upon which to accuse her if i thought that she here the major checked himself and resumed in an altered tone but i must think of these things later on in the meantime i must conclude my examination of this man do you think he knows anything no i believe he found the devil stick as he says within the grounds of mrs dallas mind you well and what does that prove prove retorted jen sharply simply that it was dropped there by that black fiend after she had killed maurice do you really think she killed him asked lady meg her face growing pale with the intensity of her excitement i do replied jen decisively but the evidence ah the evidence well he added after a pause i have something to go on in this refilled devil stick and the saturated handkerchief but i don't understand never mind my dear lady you will later on retorted jen with a nod then turning to battersea he resumed his examination you know the negress dido who is in the employment of mrs dallas he asked mildly yes sir an' hawful female she is how so well sir battersea scratched his shock head she knows things as ain't good for 'er 'bout that devil stick es you talks of oh cried jen recalling dido's denial she knows of that does she yes sir she do arsked me 'bout it but i knowed nuffin i didn't what did she say to you concerning it well sir when i brought a message from dr etwald 'bout that devil stick what cried jen interrupting sharply did dr etwald know about it also he did sir leastways he arsked me to arsk dido 'bout it i thought as much said jen in an excited tone then after a pause he added battersea would you like free quarters and plenty of food and drink for a week i ain't a fool sir said the tramp with a sheepish grin i should you bet in that case go down to the kitchen and tell my servants from me that you are to stay there later on i'll see you thankee sir i'll get free quarters and grub for a week cried battersea rubbing his grimy hands my eye 'ere's oppolance can i go now sir at once replied jen and pointed to the door battersea bowed awkwardly to lady meg and his benefactor then he went out of the room and left the major alone with his visitor what does all this mean asked meg quite surprised at jen's excitement mean cried jen in a tone of conviction why that etwald is mixed up in this business also chapter xvi the evidence of jaggard etwald repeated lady meg thoughtfully is he not the doctor of whom you have made so great a friend yes i took a viper to my bosom and it stung me replied jen who in his excitement was pacing backward and forward with hasty steps but i shall be even with him in some way or another i believe it is possible to bring home to him this triple crime do you think he is guilty i am certain of it etwald prophesied to my poor lad in his charlatan way that if he wed miss dallas or even announced his engagement with her his fate would be of life in death what did that mean mean death without the addition of life that word was brought in solely to render the prophecy if it may be called so confusing etwald was in love with miss dallas he found in maurice a formidable rival he warned him by his pretended prophecy that he should slay him if he persisted standing in his path maurice announced his engagement upon the very day when etwald the designing scoundrel went to pay his addresses to the girl from that moment he doomed maurice to death yes i truly believe that such was his design and that he offered to buy the devil stick in order to carry out his criminal intention did he ask to buy the devil stick demanded lady meg in surprise twice and both times i refused to part with it failing to get it honestly he stole it you have no proof of that i don't know so much about that retorted jen sharply you heard what battersea confessed that he had taken a message from etwald to dido about the devil stick well this doctor has some mysterious influence over this negress what sort of influence i do not know but she appears to be afraid of him i believe he incited her to steal the devil stick and that by his directions she filled it with a fresh poison but could she prepare the special kind of poison required assuredly she confessed as much her grandmother came from ashantee where this devil stick is used for the purpose of destroying people dido inherits a knowledge of the family secrets and knows how to make this poison it cures nervous headaches that is the perfume of it does and dido made some with which she saturated a handkerchief to bind round the head of her young mistress how do you know that the poisons are the same from the peculiar sickly heavy odor explained jen promptly and continued well you can see the rest for yourself dido filled that devil stick with the poison he pointed to the article on the table some of it remains in the wand yet etwald used the devil stick to kill maurice and on going back to tell dido of his success i have no doubt he dropped it inside the gates of mrs dallas' grounds where as you have heard it was found by battersea oh it is as plain as day to me cried jen vehemently etwald killed maurice and stole the devil stick to accomplish the murder you have certainly made out a strong case against this man said meg after a pause but it is all theory your proofs i shall find them that will be difficult doubtless i hardly anticipated an easy task when i undertook to learn who killed my dear lad besides david will help me lady meg sighed and rising to her feet she drew her cloak round her tall form i shall help you also she said sadly that is if you will accept of my help assuredly you loved maurice to my cost major but he did not love me this girl this miss dallas she added in a faltering voice she must be very lovely for mr sarby loves her also a woman who has three men at her feet must be wonderful jen shrugged his shoulders she is certainly beautiful said he indifferently but she is not clever and her weak nature is enslaved by the gross superstitions of dido i should not think from your description that she was likely to attract maurice said lady meg in a low voice but undoubtedly he loved her dearly and i she made a gesture of despair and moved toward the door on the threshold she paused and held out her hand good by major should i hear anything further i shall let you know but the tramp i shall keep him here be careful lest he goes away oh there is no fear of that said jen in a confident tone free quarters and plenty of food will keep battersea in my kitchen if he were guilty of the crime he would not stay but as it is he will remain under my eye i intend to question him further about the connection between dido and etwald i wonder what power the doctor holds over the negress you can learn that only from the woman herself or from etwald rejoined jen if i can only succeed in having him arrested he may confess all let us hope he will replied lady meg and after shaking hands again with jen she took her departure when the major had seen her carriage drive away he returned to look after the devil stick and examined it long and carefully undoubtedly it had been filled with fresh poison and undoubtedly the poison from the evidence heretofore set forth had been prepared by dido jen was more certain than ever that etwald and the negress had stolen the devil stick and had slain maurice with it but the theft of the body it was that which puzzled him he could understand why etwald wanted maurice removed from his path he could explain on those grounds why the devil stick had been stolen but what reason could the pair have for the removal of the body the poor boy had died and his corpse could be of no use to those who had murdered him yet it had disappeared and the only person who could give any evidence as to who had entered the room on that fatal night was jaggard but up to the present moment jaggard had remained incapable of giving any clear evidence absolutely certain that etwald was guilty that dido was an accomplice jen could not see his way to proving his case without the assistance of jaggard at first he thought of going into deanminster for the purpose of speaking with inspector arkel about the discovery of the devil stick but upon reflection he deemed it wiser not to do so at all events for the present arkel could come only to the same conclusion as himself namely that battersea innocent of the crime had picked up the devil stick on the grounds of mrs dallas regarding his suspicions of etwald the major determined to keep these to himself until he was in a position to prove them for if etwald were guilty the slightest hint that the police were on his track would be sufficient to put him on his guard against so clever a man as the doctor arkel with his clumsy methods could do nothing for the present therefore jen decided to hold his tongue while the major was thus considering what step he should take david returning from a long and solitary walk entered the room of late the young man had indulged in these lonely excursions whence he always returned more melancholy than ever his fine face was lean and worn there were dark circles under his eyes and his manner formerly noted for its composure was now nervous and hesitating on approaching his guardian he saw the devil stick on the table and at once his pale face grew yet paler where did you find it he asked pointing a trembling finger at the terrible piece of evidence i did not find it at all rejoined the major gloomily lady meg brought it to me and she she she has nothing to do with the matter replied jen surprised at the agitation of the young man it was battersea who found it he offered it for sale to lady meg and she brought it and the tramp to me battersea said david repeating the name in a puzzled tone how did he become possessed of it has he anything to do with the crime no he found the devil stick within the grounds of mrs dallas near the gates who lost it there asked sarby abruptly ah replied jen in a meaning tone tell me that and i'll have the assassin of our dear maurice within the walls of deanminster jail before the year is twenty four hours older david looked at jen in astonishment have you any idea as to the guilty person he asked in a hurried tone i think so it is my belief david that dr etwald killed maurice impossible for what reason because he wants to marry isabella dallas in that case he should rather have killed me than poor maurice for as my suit to isabella was supported by mrs dallas i was the more formidable rival of the two i don't think so my boy isabella loved maurice and to marry him she would have rebelled against her mother but i daresay if you become engaged to her etwald will remove you also from his path there will be no need for him to do that replied david coldly i shall never marry isabella what do you say i thought you loved the girl i do love her cried david vehemently i have always loved her and shall continue to do so until the day of my death all the same i shall never become her husband why for certain reasons said sarby evasively what are those reasons i can't tell you have they anything to do with the death of maurice don't ask me major i would tell you if i could but it is impossible jen rose to leave the room more wounded than he chose to confess of course my boy he said rather bitterly if you choose to withhold your confidence from me i have no right to force you to speak all the same as i have been a second father to you i think you should be more open with me i would tell you if i could said david again but in rather a sullen manner but i have reasons strong reasons for not doing so later on he paused nervously well demanded jen coldly seeing the hesitation of the man later on i may tell you all i know all you know repeated jen in a startled tone about this crime yes i know something but what it is i dare not tell you now uncle jen he added gravely looking at the elder if you are wise you will not pursue your inquiry and why not may i ask david ah said sarby walking toward the door you will know the reason when you learn the truth after this enigmatical remark he hurriedly left the room for the purpose without doubt of escaping further questioning his demeanor completely puzzled jen who could not make out the meaning of his conversation evidently david knew something which he was unwilling to reveal something which might lead to the solution of the profound mystery which enwrapped the death of maurice and the extraordinary disappearance of his body the more jen thought about the matter the more perplexed did he become the recovered devil stick found in the grounds of mrs dallas the saturated handkerchief found in the bedroom of the dead man and now the unaccountable hints of david that he knew something likely to throw a light upon these mysteries joined with an equally unaccountable refusal to afford such revelation all these things puzzled him but as it was impossible in the absence of actual knowledge to come to any reasonable decision jen determined to see jaggard and see how he was if jaggard could only recover his senses argued the major he would be able to say who had stolen the body moreover in jen's opinion the person who committed the second crime would most probably by the force of analogous reasoning have committed the first to the major's surprise he found that jaggard had recovered his senses and although still weak from his accident and long insensibility he was able to talk fairly well jen was puzzled by this sudden that is this comparatively sudden recovery and he expressed himself somewhat forcibly to the housemaid anne who had been watching for so long by the bedside of the sick man the woman with the shrewdness of her class gave her opinion as to its reason ever since that handkerchief has been removed sir said she earnestly jaggard has got well i do believe sir that the scent on it kept the poor dear stupid another light was let in on jen's mind here was the handkerchief again perfumed with the devil stick decoction of poison by dido applied by the hand of etwald and its design was evidently to keep jaggard in a state of stupor and prevent him from making dangerous disclosures dido and etwald once more in partnership jen was more convinced than ever that the pair were at the bottom of the whole terrible affair i am glad to see that you are better jaggard he said while standing by the bed yes sir thank you sir replied the man in a weak voice i'm sorry sir but i couldn't help myself i was drugged sir i guessed as much said jen grimly and who drugged you that black devil dido sir replied jaggard faintly i guessed as much said the major once more chapter xvii the story of the night exhausted by the few words which he had spoken jaggard fell back on his pillows in a dead faint seeing that further conversation was impossible at the present moment jen left the patient to the tender attention of anne and withdrew to seek david he found him in a melancholy mood pacing up and down the lawn before the window of the smoking room on perceiving his guardian sarby turned pale for he thought that jen had come to continue their previous conversation and so force his confidence but the first words of the major at once undeceived him well david said the newcomer with significance i have made one discovery without your help a discovery what is it i know who drugged jaggard i have learned who stole the body of maurice then you know more than i do replied david with all the appearance of truth my knowledge extends only to the death not to the seizure of the body and you refuse to aid me said the major reproachfully well keep your secret i may be able to do without your help but added jen fixing a piercing glance on the young man i notice that you do not ask me the name of the person who drugged jaggard because i guess the name ah mrs dallas said david faintly it was mrs dallas jen drew back a step and looked at his ward with marked surprise no he said at length mrs dallas has had nothing to do with it but i thought from what you said of the handkerchief dropped in the room that being the property of mrs dallas she had lost it there interrupted jen smartly no i told you also that isabella had confessed to having dropped it at the time of her midnight visit but now i know that she told me a lie isabella a lie impossible not at all rejoined jen coldly i can understand her reason for telling the lie she wanted to shield her mother cried david quickly interrupting in his turn your mind seems to run on the mother david said jen looking again at sarby with keen inquisitiveness can you prove by any chance that she committed the crime sarby flushed and drew back with cold reserve no uncle jen i can't i have my suspicions against mrs dallas well yes but i can prove nothing against her it pleases you to be mysterious david shortly i shall insist upon an explanation insist repeated the young man annoyed by the peremptory tone of his guardian yes you owe it to me your second father to tell the truth you owe it to your dead brother's memory for assuredly maurice was your brother david stared sullenly at the ground but in a moment or two he lifted his head in a defiant manner i owe you much more than i can ever repay said he in harsh tones all the same uncle jen i cannot reveal even to you what i know if i did so you would be the first to blame me i don't understand you i don't understand myself said the young man despondently save that i am the most miserable man alive you must be if you know who killed maurice yet refuse to confess retorted jen with some heat will you tell me the truth i ask you for the last time and i answer for the last time that the truth is not mine to tell replied david coldly if you doubt me question etwald what that criminal david looked up quickly how do you know he is a criminal i can't give you my reasons they would take too long to explain but i believe that out of jealousy he killed maurice oh said sarby ironically and out of jealousy he stole the body no dido did that dido an expression of surprise appeared on the pale face of the younger man yes dido repeated jen firmly jaggard has just informed me that it was dido who drugged him why did she drug him to steal the body of my poor lad why did she steal the body to conceal the crime committed by etwald i don't quite understand listen then and i shall explain resumed the major with growing excitement i firmly believe that etwald stole the devil stick and with it killed maurice from a motive of jealousy precisely as you know the body was stolen before the post mortem examination could be made why was this does not your own reason find an answer to that question no replied david still obstinately unconvinced why said jen with a nod if a post mortem examination had been made traces of poison would have been discovered the poison would have been proved as identical with that of the devil stick thus beyond all doubt we should have learned that maurice had been killed by the devil stick well well repeated jen in an irritated tone can you not rouse that dull brain of yours to some understanding to avert the discovery and to prevent the analysis of the poison in the body dido under the direction of dr etwald committed the third crime but why should dido act so under etwald because the man has some power over her what that power may be i know no more than you do although added jen with an afterthought you may be able to explain no i have no idea why dido should serve etwald evidently it was impossible to extract information from so impenetrable a man jen was thoroughly enraged by this display of obstinacy in a quarter where he least expected to find it usually sweet tempered especially toward his boys the major quite lost control of his passion at the moment take care david he said in an angry manner you are forcing me to believe that you are acting in this way from an unworthy motive it is your duty to aid me in discovering and punishing the murderer of maurice yet you leave me to do all the work and refuse your assistance in any way unless you alter your manner and take me into your confidence regarding the reason of this strange behavior a breach not easily mended may occur between us he paused waiting for his ward to make some reply in defense of his conduct the young man neither moved nor spoke but paler than usual he stood before the major with his eyes on the ground more in sorrow than in anger jen looked at him then turned on his heel with a shrug and walked into the house david looked after him with quivering lips if he only knew the truth said he wiping the perspiration from his face what would he say what would he do he blames me now would he blame me then in the meantime while sarby was indulging in this enigmatical soliloquy major jen was pursuing his way toward the room of jaggard despairing of obtaining information from david he thought it possible to learn the truth at all events of that fatal night from jaggard honestly speaking the major was puzzled by the conduct of his ward hitherto he had always considered david to be an honest man but at the present time his conduct savored of duplicity did he know of anything relative to the triple crime which had been committed if so why did he not speak finally was david also under the fatal influence of dr etwald the man who jen verily believed was the source of all these woes to none of these questions could the major find feasible answers therefore for the time being ie pending the narration of jaggard he dismissed them from his mind it was possible that the story of the invalid might throw light on the darkness which overshadowed the case as jen anticipated he found that jaggard had recovered from his faint and having had a sleep during the long absence of his master was much better as usual anne the ill favored housemaid was watching by his bedside but on a sign from jen she left the room finding himself alone with his servant jen addressed himself immediately to the business in hand do you feel stronger jaggard he asked much stronger sir are you able to talk i think so major for half an hour at least half an hour will be sufficient said the major in a serious voice i wish you to tell me what took place on the night you were drugged about dido sir yes jaggard about dido the invalid remained silent for a time then began to speak slowly and with some little difficulty after you left me sir he said in a weak voice i remained seated in my chair beside the bedside of my poor young master if you remember there was only one candle in the room which was placed on the table some little distance away i examined the window and found it closed you are sure of that demanded jen anxiously quite sure sir it was bolted and barred the door was simply closed for i never thought of locking it as i fancied sir that you might return after midnight to see if all was right i did not however jaggard i fell asleep in the library after mr sarby had gone to bed and of course i had every confidence in you please don't say that major said jaggard imploringly as i did my best it was not my fault that dido drugged me i'm sure i don't know why she did so continued jaggard half to himself i never did her any harm the major looked fixedly at the man do you not know what occurred during the time you were insensible he asked gravely no sir i've only got my wits about me now has not anne told you she hasn't told me anything sir well said jen seeing that the man spoke in all good faith the body of mr maurice was stolen on that night the body stolen repeated jaggard in amazement for why sir i can't tell nor can anybody else all we know is that at three o'clock in the morning we entered mr maurice's room and found the window open the body gone and you insensible the window open said jaggard thoughtfully then it must have been opened from the inside sir by dido no doubt i'm certain of it major and it was that black witch who stole the body how did she get into the room she was hidden under the bed sir under the bed are you sure said jen greatly startled by this information yes major it was this way i was seated by the bed at the foot of it with my face to the door the window as i said was locked she could not have got in at the window and had she entered by the door i should have seen her besides added jaggard in a faint voice she grabbed me from behind from behind yes sir i was not quite asleep but a kind of dozing in my chair i don't know what it was made me sleepy as i was wideawake when you left sir but there was a kind of heavy sleepy smell about i know i know the devil stick perfume well sir the smell made me sleepy and though i heard a noise behind me i could not turn my head i was just as if in a nightmare sir then the black arm of that witch came from behind me and grabbed at my throat and she held a handkerchief with that stuff on it to my nose ah said jen to himself i knew that isabella was speaking falsely go on jaggard he added aloud why did you not call out i couldn't sir i felt as in a dream but i turned and tried to fight her she pushed me over and i fell like a log i think i must have hit my head on a corner of the bed for i felt a cruel pain at the back of it you did wound your head jaggard and after that fall you remembered no more no sir not till to day i don't know what it all means sir but i'm sure i know how dido got into the room ah that is what i wish to learn well if you remember sir dido called to see you that day yes to ask if i would see her mistress a most unnecessary question it was a blind sir and when she left the room i don't believe she left the house what makes you think so sir i took dido out to the door and while i was telling her to go away dr etwald came out he told me he would see after her and i left them alone now sir said jaggard with emphasis i do believe as dr etwald took that black jade to the room of mr maurice and hid her under the bed chapter xviii the devil stick thief this long conversation had somewhat exhausted jaggard who was yet weak so telling him to cease from talking jen recalled the housemaid and left the room to think over all that he had learned the story of jaggard convinced him more than ever that dr etwald was the cause of all the terrible events which had occurred within the last few weeks without doubt it was he who had treacherously hidden dido in the chamber of death after drugging jaggard the negress no doubt had opened the window to admit etwald and between them this precious pair had carried off the dead body but for what reason this jen could not determine to learn the truth he thought it advisable to call at the wigwam and interrogate dido with the evidence of jaggard to go on the major felt satisfied that he could by threatening her with arrest force her into confessing the whole nefarious plot who had thieved the devil stick who had slain maurice who had stolen the body undoubtedly etwald was the villain who was guilty of all three crimes and the evidence of dido would be sufficient to convict him of the deeds yes said jen to himself that night as he retired to bed to day i have learned sufficient to implicate etwald to morrow i shall be able to convict him dido must confess or go to prison angered by the selfish way in which david had acted jen did not communicate his discoveries to the young man during the night he took counsel with himself and the next morning he acted upon the plans which he had formed these were to see dido and force the truth from her to send battersea to deanminster to fetch both arkel and dr etwald to ashantee and finally to communicate his discoveries to the inspector and get him to arrest etwald once in prison and the doctor intimidated by a fear of death at the hands of justice might confess his crimes and his reasons for committing them this straightforward course was the only one to pursue after breakfast therefore the major wrote two notes one for arkel asking him to be at ashantee by noon as the writer had important matters to discuss the other for etwald requesting him to call and see jaggard who added jen significantly in the letter had recovered his senses having thus prepared his trap for the doctor to walk into jen delivered the letters to battersea with instructions to set off at once for deanminster the tramp anxious to keep in favor with jen for cupboard reasons lost no time in departing and when the major had seen him safely out of the gates he took his way toward the wigwam for the all important interview with dido before his departure he had left a message for david who had not made his appearance at breakfast requesting the young man to be in the library at noon if i can force the truth out of dido thought jen strolling slowly along in the hot sunshine i may get the better of etwald then when david sees that the doctor is in the trap and in danger of arrest for murder he may relate what he knows though upon my word considered the major frowning i don't see what information he can possibly add to what i have obtained from jaggard or what i am likely to wring from the unwilling lips of dido etwald is the guilty person david can tell me no more than that on arriving at the wigwam jen presented his card and was shown into the drawing room there to wait the arrival of mrs dallas although it was nearly eleven o'clock the indolent creole was not yet out of bed but on hearing that the major had called to see her she sent dido to inform him that she would shortly accord him an interview the negress as gloomy and sullen as ever delivered this message with folded arms and bent head then without even a look at him she turned to leave the room when jen placed himself between her and the door not yet dido he said in a cold voice it is true that i called to see your mistress but i wish to speak to you also dido started and cast an inquiring look at the impassive face of the white man what you wish sah she said in a grave voice as emotionless as that of jen's to ask you a few questions about the devil stick massa i say all i know ob de debble stick indeed you did not dido you did not inform me that by dr etwald's directions you filled the devil stick with poison or that you steeped the handkerchief found in the room of mr alymer in the same poison for the purpose of drugging my servant or again that you concealed yourself under the bed and afterward drugged him a kind of terror showed itself in the dilated eyes of the negress she could not understand how jen had become possessed of a knowledge of her crimes and at first was struck with stupor by the recital speedily however she recovered herself and with a dark smile of contempt and pity she was about to deny all when jen brought out his last accusation nor said he fixing his eyes on the woman did you confess that you opened the window of mr alymer's room and aided dr etwald to carry away the dead body de de dead dead she stammered shrinking back yes the dead body of mr alymer which you and dr etwald took to his house at deanminster no denial woman said jen raising his voice as she was about to speak i see by your face that you are guilty dido trembled all over whether from rage or fear jen could not determine and opened her mouth to give the lie to her accuser then she shut it again as a heavy step was heard outside the door a moment later and mrs dallas with a face expressive of astonishment was standing on the threshold of the room and dido at her feet was making the room resound like a jungle with howlings like those of a wild beast all the savage nature of the woman was now on the surface and had broken through the sullen restraint of her impassive demeanor what is the meaning of this demanded mrs dallas with an uneasy glance at the frantic negress i shall explain when dido stops her howling said jen quite undisturbed dido dido remonstrated mrs dallas shaking the woman rise stop oh missy missy wept the negress getting onto her feet it all am a lie what dat massa say poo' ole dido know nuffin' do nuffin' lordy lordy de big lie major jen took dido by the shoulder and giving her a good shake commanded her to be silent at once the negress who was evidently acting a part ceased her outcries and after casting her eyes significantly at her mistress stared sullenly at the floor mrs dallas turned pale at this rapid glance and was obliged to take a seat to prevent herself from falling not a detail of this by play was lost upon jen who saw in the conduct of mistress and servant a confirmation of his suspicions however he added nothing to his previous speech but merely recapitulated for the benefit of mrs dallas the points of his accusation against the negress dido heard him in silence but this time she made neither outcry nor denial mrs dallas appeared to be horrified by the recital every now and then she cast a look of terror at dido while passing her handkerchief over her white lips when the major concluded she could only shake her head and stammer a few words it can not be true she murmured it is impossible it is a fact insisted jen i have the evidence of jaggard to prove that dido was in the room on that night dido cried mrs dallas in a trembling voice is this true the negress raised her wild eyes slowly to the face of her mistress what she saw therein evidently determined her reply without a word she bent her head ah cried jen you admit your guilt no said dido bluntly i say dat i in de room but i no kill dat man but you filled the devil stick with fresh poison no said dido again i saw no debble stick it was found in these grounds dat so but i not see dat debble stick woman cried jen with energy no one but you could manufacture the poison with which the devil stick was filled dat i know but i no fill de debble stick then who did dido hesitated looked at mrs dallas and came out with a lie i don't know she said in a stolid tone her mistress rose to her feet and approached the major do you mean to say that dido killed mr alymer she asked nervously no but she supplied the means to the man who did the man who did yes dr etwald dr etwald repeated mrs dallas in what seemed to jen to be a tone of relief why do you think he killed mr alymer because maurice was engaged to your daughter whom he wished to marry etwald killed my poor lad so as to remove a dangerous rival from his path impossible by no means and dido manufactured the poison which was used mrs dallas considered i know to what you allude she said after a pause dido does manufacture the drug but only for the cure of nervous headaches or to kill men with rejoined jen ironically or to drug the watchers of the dead the watchers of the dead echoed mrs dallas with a start well let us say my servant jaggard he was drugged by dido and she stole the body or rather she aided etwald to do so dido is this true yis said the negress coldly de great massa told me to do dat the great master repeated jen you mean dr etwald yis dat so he took away the body of mr alymer and you helped him yis why did you steal the body dido shrugged her shoulders ask de great massa where did you take it to demanded jen baffled in one direction and trying another ask de great massa said dido once more the law will do that the law major jen said mrs dallas alarmed yes i intend to have dr etwald arrested you dare not why on three charges first that he thieved the devil stick second that he killed maurice and third that he stole the lad's body mrs dallas fell back on the sofa with a white face dido laughed in a guttural fashion and shrugged her shoulders contemptuously voodoo she said and laughed again the major guessed that she meant that african witchcraft would avert disaster from etwald and at once flung the word back in her face voodoo will not help the doctor said he quietly this is a civilized country and we who inhabit it are above being influenced by such degrading superstitions you believe in voodoo in obi let us see if such things will protect you do you mean that dido is in danger of arrest cried mrs dallas in a terrified tone certainly as the accomplice of etwald but she did not kill mr alymer she filled the devil stick with the poison which was used to kill him retorted the major coldly and she confesses to having aided him in stealing the body ah murmured mrs dallas casting a haggard look around all is lost are you alluding to dido demanded jen rather surprised at her tone mrs dallas was about to speak when the negress silenced her with a look and raised her head proudly yis it ole dido she said but ole dido not lost dat great massa he look after ole dido if you mean dr etwald he will have enough to do to look after himself well mrs dallas as i have learned what i wished to know i shall now take my leave you go to ruin us wept mrs dallas no said jen in an inflexible voice i go to punish the man who killed my boy without another word he left the room his last glance showed that dido had gathered her sobbing mistress in her arms and was staring after him in a defiant manner at the front door jen heard his name called softly and isabella with a rich color in her usually pale cheeks came flying after him major major i have heard all i have been listening at the window then you know that i am aware of your deception about the handkerchief yes i did not speak truly stammered isabella but i could not act otherwise it was to save a certain person dr etwald no not dr etwald but the person who stole the devil stick ah you know who committed the first of the crimes cried jen seizing the young girl's arm confess it was dr etwald who stole the wand of sleep no no it was it was dido not dido oh cried isabella in a tone of anguish it was my mother chapter xix further evidence major jen recoiled from the young girl in amazement your mother he muttered hardly believing the evidence of his own senses your mother stole the devil stick yes but she did not know what she was doing jen frowned that is impossible he said positively quite impossible no no wait listen said isabella much agitated i told you falsehoods before to shield my mother now that i know that you have discovered so much that you are bent on punishing dr etwald i must tell you the truth so that she may not be dragged down to ruin but not here not here my mother may see us and dido the girl shuddered dido of whom i am afraid come with me major quickly without glancing toward the house isabella ran down a secluded path which led through a kind of shrubbery to the flower garden and then disappeared into a light cane summer house constructed in the chinese fashion and which was overgrown with greenery major jen followed her as rapidly as his more mature age would permit him and as he hastened he felt a wild thrill of delight that at last he was about to hear the truth that it should be told to him by so unexpected a person as isabella dallas was not the least strange part of this strange affair major she said when somewhat out of breath he had taken his seat beside her in the summer house although i relate what inculpates my mother it is to save her that i do so both she and i are in a net woven by dido ah poor maurice always mistrusted that negress he was right to do so oh you do not know what a terrible woman she is for years both i and my mother have been under her influence and have submitted to her will now i see her in her true colors and i am determined to speak the truth save myself and my mother major for we are innocent dr etwald and dido are the guilty persons they killed maurice yes i am sure of it they stole the body i can swear they did said isabella with emotion why did you not tell me of this before asked the major i have only been certain of these things since our last interview i lied to you then because dido said if i told the truth she would accuse my mother of the murder i see said jen thoughtfully and i can understand their motives dido wished you to marry etwald yes and it was to force my mother into compliance with that desire that the whole of these crimes were committed dido one moment miss dallas what influence has etwald over the negress isabella shuddered he is the possessor of the voodoo stone she said in a low voice the voodoo stone echoed jen much puzzled and what may that be it is a small black pebble of a peculiar shape explained the girl and it was brought from africa to barbadoes over a hundred years ago the negroes believe that a spirit dwells in this stone and that when it is worshiped the indwelling devil can work woe to those against whom the possessor of the stone bears malice you can have no idea how this talisman is venerated by all the blacks they will go miles to look on it to adore it they would burn down a city to possess it to gain it they would murder a hundred human beings well dr etwald was in barbadoes some years ago and he gained possession of this voodoo stone he has used it while here to intimidate dido while he holds it she will not dare to disobey him and all this plotting and assassination designed to bring about my marriage with dr etwald has been designed by him and carried out by dido solely on account of his ownership of the voodoo stone you know that she calls him the 'great master' well now you can guess the reason for her service worship of this man yes assented jen turning his sharp eyes on isabella and you do you believe in this voodoo stone also no when i was a child i did and i fancy that my mother also had some belief in it brought up among the negroes of barbadoes both she and i imbibed the superstitions of the black race but now we have no faith in such follies for my part added the girl anxiously i should be glad to get rid of dido seeing that with dr etwald and his malignant influence of the voodoo stone she is dragging us toward disgrace but my mother still clings to her as an old servant and will not let her go i see and about the theft of this devil stick oh on the night it was stolen i was seated on the veranda after dinner and i saw my mother come out with dido they did not know i was there as i sat in the shade i saw dido speak to my mother and point toward your house then she waved her hands before my mother's face whereupon my mother turned and walked swiftly past where i was seated i saw her face it was quite white and her eyes were open and glassy she in a word interrupted jen this black witch had hypnotized mrs dallas yes but i did not know that until later on when my mother disappeared dido re entered the house at once terrified by my mother's action i ran down the little path which leads to the gate and followed her out onto the road she went into your grounds by the postern in the wall i saw her cross the lawn and enter the smoking room wherein a lamp was burning when she came out it was with the devil stick in her hand i recognized it by the golden handle i reached home before she did and again hid on the veranda dido reappeared as my mother came up the walk and took the devil stick from her then she led her indoors and what did you do asked jen much interested in this strange history i went in later on and found that my mother had gone to bed i said nothing at the time as i was afraid of dido afterward when maurice was killed and you said that the devil stick had killed him i went to dido and accused her of the crime she was fearfully angry and warned me that if i said a word about the theft of the devil stick i would be in danger of hanging my own mother what cried jen jumping up did dido accuse your mother of the crime to me yes to my mother no afraid lest such an accusation should kill my mother who is not strong as you know i said nothing to her or indeed to anyone i told a lie to you to save my mother what else could i do but now i tell you the truth and i wish you to protect us both against the evil of dido and dr etwald you believe that dr etwald killed maurice i am sure of it when i became ill through the terror of the secret which i possessed dido prepared that poison under the pretense of curing me but i now know that she did so to refill the devil stick she then sent it to etwald and he killed maurice also he stole the body with the assistance of dido why should this pair of wretches steal the body i know no more than you do said isabella with great despondency but now major jen you can understand my not speaking the truth at our last interview yes and i honor you for it said jen kissing her hand but tell me one thing why did you make that midnight visit well i was not quite myself major in the first place and in the second i missed dido on that night asked jen eagerly yes i was ill as i have said and my mother was watching by my bedside usually it is dido who does so i asked my mother about dido and she said that dido had asked permission to go out for the evening to see dr etwald i suppose no i thought so at first but one of the servants who brought me a cup of tea late at night told me that dido had gone to your house to offer her services in laying out the body of my dear maurice oh said the major suddenly recollecting what had taken place i remember her visit but she gave as her excuse that you wanted to see me one of her lies said isabella vehemently i did not know she had gone to your house until the servant told me then when i remembered how the devil stick had been stolen i was afraid lest dido should be contriving further mischief although it was late i could not rest in my bed i tossed and turned with my brain burning with the fever i felt that i must learn what was taking place at your house my mother left me about two o'clock in the morning quite worn out with her watching then i rose put on a dressing gown and escaped by the window i reached your library at three o'clock you know the rest yes assented the major with a nod and i know that as you imagined dido was up to some mischief she stole the body with etwald but why why muttered jen in perplexed tones i cannot guess said isabella for the second time but now that i have told you all major what do you intend to do return to my house and see etwald is he there i expect him at noon along with inspector arkel then i may force the truth out of him certainly i shall have him arrested on suspicion of murder and dido i shall take no steps concerning her at present said jen glancing at his watch especially as there is no fear of her leaving the neighborhood no replied isabella interpreting the major's thought while the voodoo stone is with dr etwald she will not leave the place where he is staying in that case she will have to live in deanminster jail for there as sure as i am a living man etwald shall find himself before another twelve hours are over his head and now my dear young lady added jen rising i must leave you to keep my appointment with the scoundrel do not speak of our conversation to anyone you can depend upon my silence said isabella who held out her hand major jen shook it in his usual kindly manner and moved a step toward the door of the summer house all at once he paused and looked back one moment miss dallas he said quickly does david know about the theft of the devil stick that is he added more precisely does he know that your mother stole it isabella considered i cannot be quite certain if he does she said after a pause but i fancy he has some idea of it when he has seen me of late he has always been so nervous and silent at our last meeting also he told me that we were to fear nothing h'm said jen reflectively undoubtedly you are right miss dallas david must have learned the truth in some way but i cannot imagine how well good by good by i shall see you later on when we have this scoundrel under lock and key the major hurried off leaving isabella alone in the summer house he walked on slowly notwithstanding that it was past the hour he had appointed to meet arkel and etwald his thoughts were busy with what isabella had said concerning david's knowledge of the trick undoubtedly he believes that mrs dallas killed maurice thought jen and that is why he refuses to confess to me he said that i would be the first to blame him for telling all he knew and as he is under the delusion that mrs dallas is guilty i understand now the reason of his silence also he said that he would never marry isabella which shows that he is afraid of becoming the husband of a woman whose mother has committed a crime poor boy how he must suffer and after all i must say that i approve of his honorable silence but added the major to himself when he knows that mrs dallas is innocent and that etwald is guilty he will then be able to marry isabella on consideration jen thought it would be best to say nothing definite to david about his discovery if the young man from a feeling of honor toward an unhappy woman kept silent the major was the last person in the world to tempt him to break it jen decided to merely hint to david that he knew the truth and let the arrest of etwald tell its own tale and unseal the lad's lips by showing that mrs dallas was innocent as jen came to this conclusion he entered his own gates and rather to his surprise he saw david considerably agitated advancing to meet him inspector arkel and dr etwald are waiting for you in the library said sarby rapidly i know it i sent for them you sent for them well why not i wish the first to arrest the second arrest dr etwald on what grounds on the grounds of having murdered maurice said jen coldly yes you may look astonished david but it is the truth without your assistance i have discovered that etwald is guilty also added the major in a kindly tone i know the reason of your silence of ray silence echoed david you know the reason yes and i honor you for it who who told you stammered the young man as pale as death miss dallas isabella my god david looked terrified chapter xx a strange request before jen had time to inquire the meaning of david's strange exclamation the young man had turned on his heel and was walking rapidly back to the house surprised by this behavior and suspicious of its reason the major called out to him to stop but without taking any notice the young man increased his pace and was soon lost to sight still marveling jen went after him and on entering the library found that only arkel was present where is dr etwald demanded the major anxiously he went upstairs a few minutes ago to see your servant replied the inspector rising alone mr arkel why no major mr sarby was with him jen started evidently david had returned before him in order to see etwald and to gain private speech with the doctor had conducted him to jaggard's sick room for the moment jen still suspicious of sarby's behavior had it in his mind to follow but a few minutes of reflection convinced him that this was unnecessary david did not know all the conversation which had taken place between himself and isabella therefore he could inform etwald of nothing new but indeed the major wondered why david wished to speak privately with the doctor it looked to his mind as though the two men were in league i'll find out what it all means after i have had speech with arkel said jen to himself the doctor cannot escape me and if david has an understanding with him i'll force them both to confess there can be no harm in leaving them together for a few minutes in this jen was wrong but as he was only an amateur detective he cannot be blamed very severely for his negligence at this particular moment he acted as he thought for the best and therefore hastened to explain to arkel the position of affairs before the return of dr etwald afterward when the matter of the accusation and arrest were settled he intended to have speech with david and insist upon an explanation of the young man's mysterious behavior thus did the situation present itself to his inexperienced eyes well never mind dr etwald just now he said aloud pointing to a chair he has his duties to perform and i have mine sit down mr arkel i suppose you wonder why i have sent for you well no major i presume it is in connection with the case you are right i wish to know if you have discovered anything new yes your messenger battersea was wandering about your grounds on that night battersea cried jen thunderstruck did he see the body carried off he did not see it taken out of the house explained arkel referring to some notes which he held in his hand but he saw it put into the carriage a carriage yes which was waiting in the winding lane at the foot of your grounds two people carried the body between them a man and a woman but battersea cannot give me their names i can however said jen grimly oh it is just as i thought what are the names major asked arkel anxiously i'll give you the names later on mr inspector in the meantime be good enough to conclude your report of battersea's confession it interests me deeply i thought it would replied arkel with a look of satisfaction well battersea wondered at the body being put into the carriage did he know that it was alymer's corpse interrupted jen sharply he guessed as much from the circumstance that the body was carried through your grounds to the lane where the carriage was waiting you know major that this tramp is rather stupid and it is not an easy thing for him to put two and two together on this occasion however he discovered that they made four replied the major dryly well the man and the woman put the body into the carriage a closed carriage i suppose yes assented arkel with a nod a brougham a doctor's brougham what cried the inspector with a look of surprise has the scamp told you he has told me nothing please go on well said arkel making his invariable beginning when the body was placed in the carriage and the door closed the woman went away in what direction she returned through your grounds but where she went battersea does not know i do however muttered jen divining that dido had taken the usual route back to the wigwam and the man he mounted the carriage box and drove off it appears that there was no coachman i don't wonder at that rejoined the major this precious pair were afraid to trust their infernal secret to a third party no doubt the horse being quiet was left to stand in the deep shadow of the lane while the robbers stole the corpse however i understand the woman went away the man mounted the box and i suppose drove off with the corpse also with battersea added arkel with a significant smile it seems that the tramp wished to see the end of this singular adventure or no doubt he wished to make money out of it by blackmailing i see i suppose he hung on behind yes like a street arab he was one once you know major and has not forgotten his early habits well he was driven with the carriage to deanminster quite so and into that gloomy courtyard which surrounds the house of dr etwald added major jen with a satisfied smile battersea saw the doctor take the body out of the carriage and carry it into the house then on his return etwald's i mean he unharnessed the horse and put it into the stable also the carriage into the coach house is that not so mr arkel battersea told you stammered arkel amazed at his insight i assure you he told me nothing but i am as clever as battersea and can put two and two together next day battersea went to etwald did he not and tried to blackmail him but this clever doctor compelled him to keep silent it's all quite true assented the inspector thunderstruck though how you guessed it all i cannot say but as you know so much perhaps you can tell me one thing more which bothers me not a little how did dr etwald compel battersea to keep silence very easily said jen with a shrug battersea is half negro the black race adore the voodoo stone of which dr etwald is the possessor etwald simply threatened battersea with the vengeance of the voodoo stone if he spoke therefore he held his tongue and was forced to confess all this only by your threatening to have him arrested as the murderer of mr alymer i did threaten him but how you know i know a great many things mr inspector for instance i know that the woman who assisted dr etwald to steal the body is dido the negress of mrs dallas also that dr etwald is a murderer as well as a thief heavens if i had only known that i would have had the warrant altered what cried jen with an expression of ferocious joy lighting up his face you have a warrant for the arrest of etwald yes but on the charge of stealing the body only i took it out after hearing the evidence of the tramp battersea very good then you can take out a warrant for his arrest as a murderer after hearing my evidence can you prove him guilty jen rose to his feet and stretched out one hand toward arkel i swear on my sacred honor that maurice alymer was killed by max etwald at this moment the door of the library opened slowly and dr etwald calm and composed appeared on the threshold behind him over his shoulder peered the pale countenance of david from the ironical look on the doctor's face it would appear that he had overheard the accusation of the major and was prepared to treat it with contempt that such was the case appeared by the first words which issued from his mouth as he faced his accuser i hear the name of max etwald coupled with the crime of murder is this the way you treat your guests major you are not my guest retorted jen furiously no rather your victim seeing that you have lured me into a trap it was not to see jaggard that you asked me here but rather to force me if you can into confessing that i am guilty of a triple crime you make one slight mistake sir said jen coldly i accuse you of two crimes not of three ah you are lenient replied etwald a shade of surprise passing over his features a surprise which was reflected in the agitated face of david sarby well sir let me hear of what i am accused with the utmost coolness he entered the room and sat down in a chair near arkel the inspector with his hand in his breast pocket fingered the warrant but did not deem it wise to execute it until he had heard what proof the major possessed against etwald for the murder of maurice alymer david sat down near the door and followed every movement of the scene which ensued with keen eyes thus three of the occupants of the room were seated sarby arkel and etwald only one man stood up major jen and he stood as the accuser dr etwald said the major with great calmness and deliberation you are a clever and ambitious man who wishes to make his way in the world but has hitherto failed to do so for lack of money to procure money for your experiments in chemistry you would do anything even marry a rich woman or murder the man formerly engaged to her retorted etwald with a pale smile go on major jen i see the mark you are aiming at you found this rich match here resumed jen without noticing the interruption in the person of miss dallas already engaged to the late mr alymer and also loved by mr sarby said the doctor coolly we will come to that later on if you please said the major making a gesture to david to be silent you loved her and wanted your rival mr alymer out of the way to do so you had my devil stick stolen ho ho and by whom by mrs dallas mrs dallas cried david starting from his seat did she steal the devil stick it would seem so from this veracious history the major is telling us said etwald with irony mrs dallas stole the devil stick resumed jen imperturbably and gave it to dido who by your directions filled it with fresh poison dido gave the newly prepared weapon of death to you and with it you killed my poor boy at the very gates of the girl he loved really said etwald with pointed satire was i as cruel as that afterward you stole the body of the man you murdered dido helped you to do so and drugged my servant jaggard with the perfume of the devil stick poison in order that the theft might be carried out with safety it would seem that dido has a great deal to do with these matters said etwald looking up to the roof she has everything to do with them she will be brought up against you as a witness indeed then it appears that i am to be arrested i can answer that broke in arkel amazed at the self possession of the man i have here a warrant to arrest you for stealing the body of maurice alymer etwald glanced over the warrant and smiled how can you prove that i did so he demanded by the evidence of the tramp battersea battersea repeated the doctor and for the first time he frowned yes he saw you place the body in your brougham with the assistance of dido he followed you to deanminster and saw you take the body into your house really but all this evidence is circumstantial have you searched my house we intend doing so i am afraid you will have your trouble for nothing rejoined etwald coolly moreover you can't arrest me without actual proof i can arrest you on suspicion said arkel rising with his warrant and i arrest you now in the queen's name on what charge on the charge of stealing the body of maurice alymer oh then said etwald turning toward jen i am not to be accused of the murder later on my friend cain said the major grimly you will have quite enough to do to save your neck from the halter i am afraid so indeed major therefore i must have assistance there is nothing like being provided in time with counsel for the defense therefore i must ask mr david sarby to defend me from these absurd charges i cried david starting up with pale cheeks i defend you assuredly replied etwald fixing a piercing glance on the young man do you refuse of course he does cried jen wrathfully david raised his head and looked at the major at the doctor at the inspector no he said in a firm voice to all three i accept i shall defend max etwald chapter xxi a nine days' wonder great was the astonishment throughout the neighborhood when it became known that dr etwald the clever physician of deanminster had been arrested on a double charge of murder and theft of a dead body those who did not like him and they were the majority rejoiced openly that the assassin of maurice alymer had been found in etwald's person but there were some that regretted that so brilliant a man should be consigned to a felon's cell and possibly in the hereafter to a felon's doom but whatever opinions for or against the prisoner were held by the good people of deanminster and the surrounding neighborhood there was no doubt of one thing the trial of max etwald at the assizes would be the great sensation of the year major jen worked hard to procure evidence against the prisoner and david sarby worked just as hard to obtain materials for the defense the attitude taken up by the young barrister astonished everybody and was universally condemned that he who might almost be called the brother of the dead man should defend the assassin of such brother was almost incredible of belief people were astonished and angered by the very idea and when that idea became known to be an actual fact the conduct of david was disapproved of on every side only one man said nothing and that man was the very person who had the best right to speak while all talked major jen remained silent his reticence on the subject caused almost as much scandal as david's inexplicable conduct yet jen knew what he was about and he was acting merely in accordance with an agreement he had made with sarby after that memorable interview in the library when etwald was accused and arrested arkel took away his prisoner in custody by virtue of the warrant and left major jen alone with the counsel for the defense the assassin so called and inspector arkel left the room they left the house when the sound of etwald's carriage for he went to deanminster jail in his own brougham had died away in the distance jen who had hitherto kept silence raised his head and looked at david well sir he said in an icy tone to his adopted son i am waiting for you to explain this very extraordinary conduct david replied in equally as cold a manner major jen i have no explanation to give you what cried his guardian rising do you dare to sit there and tell me that you are a traitor a coward and an ungrateful man a traitor echoed david with a flush rising in his pale cheeks yes sir a traitor to your foster brother who was your rival it is because maurice loved the woman who hates you that you act the unworthy part of defending his murderer very good major i understand why i am a traitor but a coward you are a coward in submitting yourself to the influence of this base assassin cried jen enraged by the calmness of the young man and as an ungrateful man do you want an explanation of that term you whom i have loved and brought up as my own son no i can understand your anger from your point of view my point of view my point of view raged jen stamping from the point of view of the world sir what will everyone say when they learn that you intend to defend etwald they will say almost as cruel things as you have said returned david still composed but i do not care for the opinion of the public i act according to the dictates of my own conscience jen drew back and stared at the young man in angry surprise your own conscience he repeated in disdain how can you talk in that manner what excuse can you i have an excellent excuse interrupted david rising what is it if i may be so bold as to ask i refuse to tell you at present indeed and am i ever to learn the reason of your extraordinary behavior david considered yes major said he at length you shall learn my reason at the trial at the trial i shall explain it when i make my speech for the defense what do you mean cried jen his curiosity getting the better of his anger is it possible that you believe in the innocence of this man as counsel for the defense you can hardly expect me to answer that as your adopted father i demand an answer you shall have it sir at the trial the obstinacy and marvelous composure of the young man were not without their due effect on major jen he drew back and after a few moments' consideration he spoke in all seriousness david said he quietly there is something very extraordinary in your behavior and you refuse to give me your reasons therefor if i wait until the trial will you explain yes i have already told you so in my speech for the defense you will be fully satisfied that i have good cause to act as i am doing very good said jen calmly then i shall say nothing to any one about your very curious behavior i shall work hard to secure the condemnation of this scoundrel you can do your best to save him but against you or for you i shall not open my mouth at the trial i shall expect an explanation you shall have it but added jen raising his head as until that explanation we are enemies although not openly so i shall require you to leave my house i expected that you would do so rejoined david bowing his head indeed you can act in no other way to day i shall take lodgings in deanminster and wait for the trial i shall defend etwald to the best of my ability and then you can decide whether i am fit to re enter this house i can't understand you sir said jen with a sigh whatever your reasons may be i feel sure that i shall not approve of them you approved of my reasons before major you shall approve of them again in the meantime until the trial let us remain strangers he bowed and without offering his hand which it is very probable major jen would have refused to take he left the room when the door closed the older man sank into a chair and passed his hand across a brow moist with perspiration there can be only one explanation he muttered david is mad the result of this conversation was that david took up his residence in deanminster near the jail and saw etwald frequently about his defense the doctor assured him that he possessed sufficient power over dido by reason of owning the voodoo stone to prevent her from becoming a witness against him sarby was satisfied that if dido did not appear to give evidence the case for the prosecution would fall through she was the only witness of whom the barrister and the prisoner had any fear on his part major jen together with arkel built up a strong case against the man whom they fully believed to be the culprit search had been made in etwald's house but no traces of the dead body could be found its disappearance was almost as profound a mystery as the reason which had induced etwald to steal it the reasons for the theft of the devil stick for the murder of maurice were plain enough but what had induced the doctor to make away with the corpse no one could discover etwald himself even to his counsel was silent on the subject arkel had sought out as witnesses against etwald seven persons first mrs dallas who was to prove that she was hypnotized frequently by dido second isabella who was to depose that before the murder her mother had been sent by dido to ashantee to steal the devil stick while under the influence of hypnotism third battersea who was to give evidence that he had found the devil stick within the grounds of mrs dallas fourth lady meg who was to prove the offer of battersea to sell her the stick fifth major jen who could explain the engagement of the dead man to miss dallas and the rivalry of his assassin sixth jaggard whose evidence would tend to show that dido had drugged him for the purpose of stealing the body and seventh the most important witness of all dido who was to depose to the manufacture of the poison the refilling of the devil stick and the giving of it to dr etwald so that he might perpetrate the crime with these seven witnesses jen did not see how etwald could escape the gallows are you certain that all these people will speak out asked the major of arkel when the list was submitted to him i am certain of all save one replied arkel in a dissatisfied tone and the worst of it is that dido is the one does she refuse to give evidence against etwald i should think so simply because he is the holder of the voodoo stone can we force her by threats to give evidence said jen angrily i don't think so it wouldn't be legal answered arkel the only chance of getting the negress to confess to the whole truth is for either you or i to gain possession of that stone where is it etwald carries it on his watch chain i saw him the other day in prison and he showed it to me a common little black stone it is but dido would kill him with pleasure to get it kill etwald ejaculated jen then after a pause he added i believe you are right arkel for it is not the man himself she cares about but the stone however i'll see isabella and make her persuade dido to speak against etwald the major went at once to the wigwam but notwithstanding all his eloquence in spite of the tears and implorings of isabella the negress positively declined to say a word against the great master while dat big man hab de voodoo stone i do notin' notin' she said and from this obstinate position they all failed to move her when major jen departed both isabella and her mother were in despair failing the proving of the crime against etwald accusations might be made against mrs dallas and this result could be brought about by dido did she choose but the spell of the voodoo stone was on her and she refused to say anything likely to inculpate its master why don't you get the voodoo stone yourself if you adore it so much cried mrs dallas exasperated by this obstinacy dido opened and shut her hand convulsively ah if i hab dat voodoo stone i be great great de queen ob de debbles but he no let it go go and see dr etwald and tell him you will give evidence against him unless he gives you the stone this suggestion came from isabella but of it dido took no notice without a word to mother or daughter who were both in tears she left the room in the afternoon she was nowhere to be found and both mrs dallas and isabella came to the conclusion that she had fled to avoid being forced into giving incriminating evidence they fell into one another's arms and were beside themselves with terror all the evil done by dido and etwald seemed likely to fall upon their innocent heads still there is hope said isabella recognizing the occasion for prompt action we shall speak to major jen and ask him to send the police after this wretched woman this opinion was at once acted upon and a messenger was sent to ashantee but major jen was from home and it was not until six o'clock that he presented himself at the wigwam and heard the story of dido's flight but she can't be very far away said jen hopefully i saw her in deanminster and thought she had gone there with a message from you no no cried mrs dallas wringing her hands she will catch the train there and go to london oh why didn't you stop her i wish i had known said jen rather dismayed to find his fine case against etwald breaking down but even if we had forced her into court she would not have given evidence against the holder of the voodoo stone dat so said a hoarse voice at the door the three people turned and saw dido with an expression of triumph on her dark face enter the room dido cried isabella you did not run away no missy i tell de truth against dat man but the voodoo stone said jen wondering what she meant dido opened her clenched fist the voodoo stone lay in the palm of her hand chapter xxii for the defense how she became possessed of the voodoo stone dido refused to say jen had learned from inspector arkel that etwald wore the talisman on his watch chain and he wondered in what fashion dido had contrived to penetrate into the prison and to obtain it from the doctor the whole result of the trial depended upon the transfer of the stone if etwald kept it dido would not dare to give evidence against him and so in the absence of the incriminating details he would go free as it was the stone was now in the possession of dido and for some reason which jen was unable to fathom she was quite content to betray her share in the plot by changing hands the voodoo stone had transformed dido into a traitress however as the advantage derived from the transfer was all on the side of the prosecution jen did not think it wise to inquire too closely into the means which dido had employed to regain the talisman he saw nothing of david who pointedly kept out of his way he made no inquiries of dido and simply informed the inspector that the negress was ready to explain etwald's secrets without telling him why she was willing to do so her majesty's judges on circuit came to deanminster the court was formally opened and after some trivial cases had been disposed of the trial of regina v etwald was announced the hall in which the court sat was crowded with people from far and near there were even reporters from london sent down by the great dailies for the case had obtained more than a local celebrity inspector arkel with his seven witnesses on behalf of the crown was at the table before the judges and with major jen had held several conversations with the public prosecutor david calm and composed but paler than a corpse was in his place glancing over his brief and exchanging curt sentences with etwald's solicitor lastly etwald himself the terrible criminal who in the eyes of the public was a hardened and bloodthirsty monster stepped into the dock suave and smiling he pleaded not guilty to the indictment and the trial commenced the public prosecutor stated the case in all its fullness the prisoner said he was a medical man practicing in deanminster he had seen miss isabella dallas and had fallen in love with the lady and also which was more important with the fortune of the lady evidently he had made up his mind that no obstacle should stand in the way of his marriage with miss dallas but it so happened that there was one obstacle the young lady was in love with mr maurice alymer a young gentleman of position who held a commission in her majesty's army her love was returned and the young people were engaged interruption by the prisoner's counsel but without the consent of the mother the public prosecutor thought that the interruption of his learned friend was out of place as the refusal of mrs dallas mother gentlemen of the jury to the young lady engaged to the deceased gentleman mr maurice alymer had nothing to do with the actual facts of the case the prisoner seeing that while mr alymer lived he could never marry miss dallas determined to rid himself of a rival the prisoner had been in barbadoes and while there he had learned many things concerning african witchcraft and had become possessor of the voodoo stone a talisman which the black race held in peculiar reverence on his return to england the prisoner had become acquainted with mrs dallas with the daughter whom he designed to marry and with a negress called dido the servant of the aforesaid mrs dallas by means of the voodoo stone the prisoner made an absolute slave of the negress and could command her services at any time even to the extent of crime the counsel for the defense objected to the use of the word crime nothing he submitted had yet been proved counsel for the prosecution accepted the correction of his learned friend and withdrew the obnoxious word crime if not altogether at all events for the time being he would resume his explanation of the case major jen the adopted father of the deceased possessed a barbaric curiosity called by civilized people the devil stick by barbarians the wand of sleep this he had obtained from ashantee where it was used to kill people inimical to the king by the injection of poison there was no need to describe the devil stick as it was on the table and would be shown to the jury this devil stick with some impatience prisoner's counsel admitted that the devil stick had been used to kill the deceased and requested the prosecutor to pass on to more important details the counsel for the crown thanked his learned friend for the admission and would continue the devil stick was stolen by mrs dallas who committed the theft under the hypnotic influence of the negress dido by the direction of dr etwald dido refilled the stick with fresh poison being enabled to manufacture the same from a recipe of her grandmother's said grandmother having come from ashantee where the stick the devil stick be it understood had been constructed and used she had given this terrible weapon to the prisoner who with it had killed mr alymer his rival counsel for the defense submitted that the crime had yet to be proved his learned friend was assuming too much the public prosecutor said that he asserted no more than he could prove to their lordships and the gentlemen of the jury the prisoner had killed mr alymer and it was for this offense that he stood in yonder dock as regards the theft of the body the lesser offense said prisoner's counsel was swallowed up and merged in the greater therefore he protested against the introduction of the theft of the body the judge thought that the two crimes were judicially speaking one and the same it was right that the crown prosecutor should place before him the whole facts of the case one part might neutralize or enhance or explain the other the crown prosecutor was quite in order counsel for the prosecution accepted his lordship's ruling and would proceed the body of mr alymer was taken to the residence of his adopted father major jen there it was placed in the bedroom which had formerly belonged to the living man thence it was stolen by the prisoner counsel for the prisoner all this has yet to be proved counsel for the crown i shall prove it and at once the jury are now in possession of all the facts of this very interesting case and every detail will be confirmed by the most responsible witnesses call major jen evidence in brief of major jen i was the guardian of the deceased maurice alymer i adopted him as my son he was in love with and engaged to miss dallas but the mother did not approve of the engagement dr etwald the prisoner also loved miss dallas but she refused to marry him i showed the prisoner the devil stick and explained its use whereupon he wished to purchase it i declined to part with it and afterward it was stolen after its disappearance mr alymer was killed by means of the devil stick poison his hand was but slightly scratched and he could not have died from so trivial a cause had not the weapon used been poisoned moreover i recognized the perfume which emanated from the body as that of the devil stick poison dr etwald had threatened the deceased once or twice afterward the body of deceased disappeared and the drug used to stupefy the watcher of the dead was the poison of the devil stick miss dallas deposed that she had been engaged to deceased prisoner wished to marry her and was jealous of the late mr alymer once or twice he had threatened him the negress dido was accustomed to hypnotize mrs dallas for nervous headaches while under the influence of hypnotism mrs dallas would act according to the dictates of dido on the night that the devil stick was stolen from the house of major jen mrs dallas had been hypnotized by dido witness had followed her and had seen the theft of the stick afterward mrs dallas had delivered it into the hands of dido witness never saw the devil stick again she had seen mr alymer on the night he was murdered as he had called to see her witness had parted with him at the gates and had seen him go down the road toward ashantee it was the last time witness saw him it was well known to witness that dido was under the influence of dr etwald on account of the latter possessing the voodoo stone charm dido had manufactured the fresh poison of the devil stick as a panacea for nervous headache from which witness suffered so far as witness knew deceased was in the best of spirits at the time of his death and had no intention of putting an end to his life witness could swear that prisoner was a bitter and jealous enemy of deceased mrs dallas declared that she suffered like her daughter from nervous headaches to cure these she submitted frequently to hypnotic treatment at the hands of dido who was gifted with a strong will on the night the devil stick was stolen she had been hypnotized but she did not know what she did while under the influence while in the trance as it may be called she never knew what she did and she had hitherto had every confidence in dido as an old and faithful servant that she dido would not induce her to do wrong things while hypnotized she had never seen the devil stick either at the house of major jen or in her own the negress had prepared a drug for the cure of headaches which witness believed was similar as was judged from the perfume to the poison contained in the devil stick she knew that her daughter wished to marry the deceased but for certain reasons not pertinent to the case she had declined to sanction the engagement she would not have permitted her daughter to marry dr etwald as she did not like him or approve of the influence which he exercised over dido she knew that prisoner possessed the voodoo stone and by means of it could make any member of the black race do his will prisoner was a declared enemy of the deceased as a jealousy existed between them on account of her daughter in presence of witnesses prisoner had threatened deceased she knew nothing of the theft of the body lady meg brance was called by the prosecution to prove that a certain mendicant by name battersea had offered her the devil stick for sale as a curiosity knowing that it was the weapon with which mr alymer had been killed according to the reports which were current at the time she had brought it to major jen along with the tramp battersea entered the witness box and deposed that he was of mixed negro blood and by reason of his superstition under the influence of dido at times she hypnotized him but he did not know when she did it he thought it was obi african witchcraft sometimes he carried messages between her and the prisoner dr etwald had told him to say one single word to dido that was devil stick he did not know what it meant afterward the devil stick as he was told had disappeared and mr alymer was murdered he found the devil stick on the grass near the bushes within the gates of the wigwam not knowing what it was he took it to lady meg brance who sometimes gave him money she took witness and the devil stick to major jen who now possessed it with regard to the stealing of the body witness said that he saw it placed in a carriage and by clinging on behind he had traced the carriage to the house of dr etwald in deanminster prisoner drove the carriage himself witness tried to get money out of prisoner by telling what he had seen but dr etwald had forced him to hold his tongue by threatening him with the vengeance of the voodoo stone being half an african witness was very much afraid of the charm in his turn jaggard but lately recovered from his illness related how he had been drugged by dido and how she had been concealed under the bed after his evidence which did not take long had been given the principal witness for the prosecution was called and the negress dido whose name had been so often mentioned entered the witness box in brief her evidence was as follows i am a full blooded negress born in barbadoes my grandmother came from 'ashantee' and knew all about the wand of sleep she taught me how to manufacture the poison i came to england with my mistress and met with prisoner who called at the house he knew a great deal about obi and showed me the voodoo stone a spirit dances in the stone and i was bound to do what the spirit told me it said i was to obey prisoner dr etwald wanted to marry my young mistress but she was engaged to mr alymer prisoner told me that mr alymer must be got out of the way and suggested the use of the devil stick which he had seen in the smoking room of major jen i agreed to help him and by hypnotizing my mistress i made her steal the devil stick she brought it to me all unconscious of having done so and i filled it with fresh poison on the night of the murder mr alymer called to see my mistress also dr etwald when mr alymer left i gave the stick to prisoner and he followed deceased to kill him next day i heard that mr alymer was dead after a time prisoner told me that we must steal the body so that traces of poison should not be found when a post mortem examination was made i agreed to help him and gaining admission into the chamber of death i hid under the bed when jaggard fell asleep i drugged him with the poison of the devil stick and opened the window outside of which prisoner was waiting i assisted him to carry the body to his carriage and then left him that is all i know this evidence closed the case for the prosecution and as may be guessed it caused a profound sensation in court everyone without exception looked upon the prisoner as guilty and they considered it futile when david sarby rose to deliver his speech for the defense the young man was even paler than usual and when he rose laid down the devil stick at which he had been looking when on his feet he glanced round the court and caught the gaze of isabella who was staring eagerly at him then he turned to his client dr etwald still composed even after the frightful evidence which had been given smiled coldly on his counsel david shuddered and picking up the devil stick spoke sharply and to the point my lord and gentlemen of the jury you have heard the evidence of the crown which makes out that my client is guilty that evidence is wrong as can be proved by one witness i am the witness in my rooms there is lying a confession signed and witnessed which sets forth that i am the guilty person it was i not dr etwald who murdered maurice alymer sensation in the court yes i was in love with miss dallas and therefore was jealous of maurice i knew that dido possessed the devil stick how it does not matter and i bribed her to give it to me i pretended to go to london on the night of the murder but instead of doing so i remained in the grounds of mrs dallas where i obtained the devil stick from dido i saw maurice meet with miss dallas i saw them kiss and part inflamed by jealousy i rushed after him and met him on the road he turned in surprise and flung out his arms to keep me off the devil stick with its poison fang protruding was in my grasp and in throwing out his arm i wounded him in the palm of the hand thus david took the devil stick firmly in his grasp and compressed the handle at once the iron tongue with its drop of venom appeared with the sharp point he made an irregular wound on the palm of his hand and cast the devil stick on the table before him a moment afterward amid the silent horror of the crowded court he fell down dead chapter xxiii the result of the trial naturally the tragic end of the counsel for the defense created a great sensation the trial was brought to an abrupt conclusion the court was cleared and the body of the dead man taken to the residence of major jen in his rooms at deanminster was found the confession signed by him and which was substantially the same as that which he had made in court at once after the formalities of the law had been observed dr etwald was set at liberty on the charge of murder whereupon he returned to his house as though nothing had happened mrs dallas and isabella came back to the wigwam but without dido on the day when the trial terminated in so tragic a manner the negress disappeared and with her the famous voodoo stone i wish i could have caught her said arkel to major jen she committed perjury in order to get dr etwald hanged and she ought to have been punished for her wickedness it has been a terrible affair major jen who was now looking old and broken down agreed with a sad shake of his gray head my poor lads said he in a voice full of pathos first one and then the other to lose them both in this awful fashion what cried arkel in surprise do you pity mr sarby why not answered the major quietly to my mind he needs more pity than poor maurice the lad was driven mad by jealousy and he was worked on by dido to commit the crime the cause of all these troubles mr inspector is not dr etwald but that black witch i wish she could be caught she may be major there is a warrant out against her for perjury arkel spoke too hopefully for dido was never caught she was too clever to give the police a chance of laying hands on her like a stone cast into a wide ocean she disappeared from deanminster from england no doubt and possessed of the voodoo stone possibly took her way back to her native ashantee there to become the high priestess in the horrible fetish worship of africa for the next two days major jen stayed in his house and watched over the corpse of david it was laid out in what had been the young man's bedchamber surrounded by burning candles and with pale flowers of virginal whiteness scattered on the bed the whole scene was but a repetition of that which had taken place when maurice had died both young men had perished from the effects of the infernal african poison both had perished in the bloom of youth and on the right hand of each was the fatal wound which had corrupted the blood but the corpse of david was here the corpse of maurice where only dr etwald could answer the question and he released on the charge of murder was now out on bail for the theft of the corpse while the major was wondering what would be the outcome of all the terrible events which had filled the past few weeks jaggard who with his recovered health had resumed his duties entered the library and announced that mrs dallas and her daughter wished to see him although he was unwilling to speak to those who had caused these troubles jen had no reasonable grounds for refusing an interview therefore he gave orders that the ladies should be shown into the drawing room when he repaired thither however he found to his surprise that mrs dallas only was waiting for him i could not get isabella further than the door of your house exclaimed mrs dallas who was in deep mourning whether for maurice or david or for the loss of dido it was impossible to say why did she not come in asked jen coldly for he did not feel very amiably disposed toward the widow i don't know she is a strange girl major and the events of the last few weeks have shaken her nerves they have shaken mine retorted jen grimly but we need not discuss these things mrs dallas may i ask why you have paid me this visit to tell you that we are going away going away and where may i ask back to barbadoes replied mrs dallas with a sigh yes major after what has taken place here i can stay no longer in england i shall sell my house and leave for the west indies with my daughter within the month i think it is the best thing you can do said jen brusquely by the way what has become of dido she has left me in the most ungrateful manner since she obtained the voodoo stone and gave evidence at the trial she has not been seen i believe added mrs dallas in a confidential manner that dido has gone to barbadoes also to be queen of the black witches of obi no doubt faugh i am disgusted with her too said mrs dallas indorsing the major's exclamation so you ought to be mrs dallas for dido has been your evil genius if you had not submitted to her will she would not have dared to hypnotize you if you had not been hypnotized on that night you would not have taken the devil stick consequently both david and maurice would still be alive your negress has been a perfect at mrs dallas major major do not be too hard on me i suffer oh how i suffer and i also both my boys are dead one by the hand of the other and that other by his own hand it is you and your daughter and dido who have brought about these things go to barbadoes mrs dallas by all means you and yours have done quite sufficient mischief in england just as jen ended his speech and mrs dallas was about to reply the door opened to admit dr etwald both the major and the creole stared at him in surprise as neither for the moment could grasp the idea that he had been bold enough to present himself before those whom he had so deeply wronged ah said etwald as complacently as ever i thought i should find you here major but i hardly expected to see mrs dallas you villain cried that lady starting from her seat do you think i want to see you after all the misery you have caused why i refuse even to remain in the same room with you and with a furious gesture the creole swept past etwald and out of the door which she banged loudly etwald looked at the door shrugged his shoulders and turned politely to the major it is just as well she is gone said he quietly it is better that our conversation should be private i wish to hold no conversation with a scoundrel sir cried jen purple with rage follow the example of mrs dallas if you please etwald looked round for a chair selected the most comfortable and sat down with great deliberation i never follow any one's example major he said dryly it is always my custom to act independently i'll have you turned out of the house in that case you'll never hear what i have come to tell you what is that sir demanded jen in a calmer tone the truth bah i heard that in court indeed you did no such thing retorted etwald coolly my story is quite different to that of dido david's was different also i know it but my story the true story mind you differs even from david's will you hear it major or shall i leave your house before i suffer the disgrace of being kicked out the major considered for a few moments before replying there was a hinted mystery in the manner of etwald which puzzled him not a little and what this demeanor might mean he was anxious to learn moreover he wished to know the actual facts of the case and now that dido had fled etwald was the only one who could tell them acting upon these considerations jen sat down again in his chair and sulkily gave etwald permission to remain and explain this the doctor proceeded to do at once as you are aware said he calmly i escaped the charge of murder and very right too seeing that i was innocent of the crime but as to the stealing of the body i am guilty and i do not where is the body you wretch pardon me said etwald raising his hand in protest if you interrupt or call me names i shall tell you nothing to proceed he added seeing the major held his peace i am out on bail and must come up for trial soon on the charge i spoke of however i am not afraid as i can defend myself in a manner you little dream of but being out on bail i came to see you to tell me more lies to tell you the truth my dear major and i assure you that the truth will surprise you not a little what is it demanded jen in a fever of excitement patience patience i shall tell you when the time comes but by the way major dido she has fled i know it she was afraid of me hardly replied jen a trifle spitefully you have lost the voodoo stone remember yes i was taken advantage of for once in my life a cunning woman that dido she got permission to see me in prison and to talk to me alone under the pretense of telling me about her evidence knowing that i could compel her to do what i wished by means of the voodoo stone i saw her with pleasure as it was my intention to put the words likely to get me off to prove my innocence into her mouth however while i was talking to her she suddenly produced a phial of the devil stick poison and threw it in my face of course i instantly became unconscious and it was then that she wrenched the talisman off my watch chain is the poison so quick in its effects then i should think so said etwald coldly you saw how david fell in court after wounding his hand i fell in prison quite as quickly but as my skin was not scratched and the drug took effect only through the nostrils i recovered and when you recovered the jailer told me that dido had called him in saying that i had fainted while they were getting me round which took an hour dido went off with the voodoo stone those about the prison had no reason to detain her so she left when i found the voodoo stone gone added etwald impressively i knew that the black wretch would give evidence against me and that the game was at an end you expected to be hanged suggested jen well no replied the doctor with wonderful coolness i did not expect that if the worst came to the worst i knew that i could protect myself but i must admit that the confession of my counsel mr sarby took me somewhat by surprise poor david sighed jen thinking of the young man cut off in the bloom of his youth poor david echoed etwald with a sneer foolish david you might say to die for the sake of a woman yet you risked death for the same woman i risked danger for the woman's fortune retorted etwald with revolting candor it was the money i wanted but death no i did not risk that i am not so sure of that etwald how did you know that david would confess in so dramatic a fashion i did not know it major as i said before his confession took me by surprise still as i was innocent i knew that i could not be hanged well said jen growing weary of this long continued conversation which seemed to lead to nothing at all events you'll not escape a long term of imprisonment why said etwald with an agreeable smile there are two opinions about that mine is that i shall go free then he added coolly i intend to seek barbadoes and search for that black witch in order to recover the voodoo stone i hope you'll get the chance of going but i doubt it however if you do get as far as the west indies you'll find friends there really any particular friends i don't know if you'll consider them so but mrs dallas and her daughter go back to their estates in barbadoes within the month really said etwald again then i may marry her after all she won't have you oh i think so i have a means of compelling her to marry me jen jumped up with a scowl i'm tired of your enigmas he cried angrily what is it you wish to tell me the name of the person who committed the murder i know it david sarby not at all he accused himself to shield the real person to shield the assassin gasped jen thunderstruck and who is the assassin can't you guess from his self accusation why the woman he loved isabella exactly isabella dallas and none other killed your boy maurice chapter xxiv a final surprise isabella killed maurice said jen pushing back his chair impossible doctor you must be mistaken i don't think so replied etwald dryly i saw her do it so did david you must be mistaken insisted the major once more david was in london on the night when the crime was committed by his own confession in court david was in the grounds of mrs dallas on that night yes yes you are right said jen in a bewildered tone still i cannot believe that isabella killed maurice she loved him dearly and had no reason to murder him none in the world yet she certainly took his life why not said etwald coolly mrs dallas had no reason to steal the devil stick yet without a reason i don't believe it ah but she was hypnotized she did not act of her own free will precisely the case with isabella said the doctor nodding come major i won't worry you any longer with inquiries dido hypnotized the daughter to commit the crime as she had willed the mother to steal the devil stick isabella is absolutely ignorant of what she did and firmly believed that i was the guilty person now of course she thinks david by his own confession is the assassin but david confessed himself guilty to save her of course but isabella does not know that she thinks and on the face of it with reason that david killed maurice out of jealousy how was it david saw the crime committed i shall explain said etwald david found out that maurice was going to meet isabella that night secretly in the grounds of mrs dallas near the gates determined to see the meeting and to learn if there was any hope for him he feigned a journey to london in order to lull any suspicions which maurice might have that he was being watched instead of going however he concealed himself at a spot where he could see the gates which opened onto the highway now added etwald with a side glance at the major it so happened that i also wished to see that meeting how did you know it was about to take place i learned the fact from dido who advised me of all which went on in the dallas household as you may guess well i saw david in his place of concealment and guessed his reason for coming maurice appeared at the rendezvous and shortly afterward isabella under the hypnotic influence came down the avenue in her hand she held the devil stick and came swiftly toward maurice he not understanding the deadly weapon with which she was armed came to meet her with outstretched arms she thrust the devil stick before her and wounded him in the palm of the hand with a cry he fell dead within the gates asked the major much agitated yes within the gates responded etwald when isabella had struck the blow she dropped the devil stick in the grass where if you remember it was afterward found by battersea then she returned to the house by the little path which leads thereto through the surrounding trees the body lay in the bright moonlight full in the center of the path not a stonethrow from the high road david and i rushed simultaneously from our hiding places and i explained hurriedly that the body must not be found in the grounds he understood and we carried the body onto the road before we had time to deliberate what was to be done we heard the noise of approaching footsteps and afraid both of us of being accused of the crime we fled then you came down the road and discovered the corpse yes i heard the poor lad's cry said jen simply and i ran down at once you must have been very quick in your movements there was ample necessity for prompt action replied etwald with some dryness as neither david nor i wished to be arrested but now you can understand how it was that david refused to reply to your questions and agreed to defend me i understand he said poor lad that i would approve of his reasons when i knew them and now that you have explained his motives i quite agree with his saying to protect that poor girl to save you from suffering for a crime which you did not commit he could have acted in no other fashion still i wish both of you had been more open with me i am afraid that would have been impossible major said etwald rising you were so distracted over the death of maurice and so unjust in your hatred of me that it would have been dangerous to trust you am i unjust in my hatred of you demanded jen getting on his feet i think not dr etwald your desire to marry isabella or rather her fortune has been the cause of all these ills dido was only your instrument whom you compelled to work by means of the voodoo stone that she betrayed you in the end was your punishment i do not blame her so much as i do you you alone are responsible for the death of those two poor lads of mine well have it your own way said etwald carelessly i am a scoundrel in your eyes i dare say but if you will permit me to see you to morrow at eleven o'clock i shall be able to prove that this particular devil meaning myself major is not quite so black as you have painted him i never want to set eyes on you again said jen bluntly nor will you after midday to morrow but you will regret if you do not grant me this interview what do you wish to say i'll tell you to morrow can't you say it now no major jen i can't and i shan't retorted etwald tartly if you are wise you will arrange to let me come here to morrow at eleven and meet mrs dallas and her daughter both of them will refuse to meet you you saw mrs dallas to day how she behaved like the fool she is said the doctor putting on his hat well i am going will you see me to morrow morning yes i don't know what possible things you can find to say to me after this interview but as you make such a point of it i'll see you and ask mrs dallas and her daughter to be present yes i'll try and get them to come very good etwald walked toward the door but there struck by a sudden thought he looked back of course you will not tell isabella that she killed mr alymer he said hurriedly not at present said jen after a moment's thought but later on i shall in order to clear the memory of david and condemn the poor girl to eternal misery said etwald well i do not agree with you but at least keep silent until after our interview to morrow yes i promise you i'll say nothing thank you major good by for the present good by said jen and as the door closed behind the doctor he muttered and may the devil go with you for a greater scoundrel does not exist later on in the day jen sent a letter to the wigwam asking mrs dallas to come with her daughter the next morning at eleven o'clock he did not explain that dr etwald would be present as he knew the temper of mrs dallas whatever might be at stake even if it was to her own interest she would refuse to meet the man toward whom she bore so strong a hatred therefore jen decided to be diplomatic and keep silent as to the visit of etwald during the afternoon a note was brought to jen in which mrs dallas promised to come and to bring isabella very good said jen to himself that matter is settled and etwald confound him will obtain his desire i wonder what he wants to see us all about in spite of all his conjecturing the major found himself unable to answer this question therefore like a wise man he possessed himself in patience until the next morning most of the night he passed in the room where poor david was laid out for he was determined that this time the body should not be stolen as he pondered during the long and silent hours he reflected that he had lost the opportunity of forcing dr etwald to say what he had done with the body of maurice it had not been found in his house and notwithstanding all questioning etwald with his changeless smile had refused to state where it was i should have wrung the truth from the villain to day thought jen as he paced the room but to morrow to morrow he shan't leave this house until he confesses what he has done with the remains of my poor boy ghoul that he is wretch and scoundrel toward the morning jen slept for an hour or so and when he rose and had taken his bath he felt much refreshed and ready to face etwald at this final interview at eleven o'clock mrs dallas arrived with isabella the latter looking wan and ill even had the major not promised to be silent he could not have brought himself to tell the poor girl the truth at that moment after all she was perfectly innocent and had committed the crime unwittingly dido was the culprit not isabella and the major felt a profound pity for the miserable girl who had been made a tool of by the unscrupulous negress and the evil minded etwald well major said mrs dallas after the first greetings were over what did that wicked man say to you yesterday he explained how my poor maurice was killed ah said isabella clasping her hands i am sure that it was that terrible man who made david kill maurice oh if i had only met maurice on that night i might have prevented the quarrel did you not meet maurice my dear of course not replied isabella in the most truthful manner i did not leave the house and dido was with me all the time i expect maurice was waiting for me and that david saw him no doubt they quarreled and then the death took place from this speech it was quite evident that the girl was absolutely ignorant of the part which she had played in the affair still to make certain jen asked why she had not kept the appointment i had a nervous headache she said quickly and dido hypnotized me when i woke up it was too late to see maurice this remark put the matter beyond all doubt the girl by her own admission had been hypnotized by the negress and while in the trance state with her will at the mercy of the other woman she had killed her lover morally speaking it was dido in the person of isabella who was the assassin however the major had learned all that he wished to know and not wishing to pursue the subject turned the conversation by explaining that etwald was coming in a few minutes mrs dallas rose up in a cold fury did you ask me here to insult me major i asked you here at the particular request of dr etwald why what can he have to say to my mother cried isabella in surprise miss dallas i know no more than you do but he evidently desires to make a clean breast of this whole miserable business i have heard quite enough about it said mrs dallas marching toward the door and i refuse to meet that monster of iniquity but she was too late for before she could escape from the room dr etwald as smiling and composed as ever entered the door he placed himself quietly before the enraged mrs dallas do not go madam said he quietly i have something to show you what is it asked mrs dallas her curiosity like that of the major getting the better of her rage you will see in a few minutes miss dallas you look pale i hope soon to bring back the roses to your cheeks major don't speak to me you scoundrel until you tell me what you have done with the body of my boy you shall know in a few minutes major indeed i think it is about time that this comedy should end comedy echoed mrs dallas in scorn you mean tragedy i mean no such thing retorted etwald opening the door all true comedies end in the meeting of lovers good heavens cried jen recoiling what do you mean etwald pointed to the open door there is my explanation said he coolly the three people gave a simultaneous cry of amazement and delight for there on the threshold of the room alive and well stood maurice alymer chapter xxv three letters the first letter of dr etwald deanminster my dear major jen in the joy with which you and miss dallas hailed the appearance of the man whom you thought dead i was for the time being quite forgotten and very naturally too profiting by the occasion i left the room and went to the bedroom where mr sarby lay in a trance similar to that into which mr alymer had fallen both trances being caused by the poison of the devil stick as you have learned from his own lips i revived him as i revived his friend so now my good jen you have your two boys with you again alive and well the comedy is finished and was i not right in denying to these past events the misleading name of tragedy naturally you wish to know how the dead came to be alive and for what reason i behaved as i did well here you shall find the whole explanation so fully given that there will be no necessity for you to seek me at deanminster indeed if you do so you will not find me as by the time you receive this letter i shall be well on my way to london thence it is my intention to go abroad and as i told you at our last meeting you will never see me again when you finish this letter you will no doubt be glad of this and it is just as well that i should remain beyond your reach you are a virtuous man i am not but our natures would prevent our ever assimilating the one with the other as to my promised explanation here it is and much good may it do you i am as you know a physician but i am also what you may not know a man of genius i have brains but no money and for experiments in chemistry money i regret to say is extremely necessary this being the case i have needed money and that in large quantities all my life as i could not make it for myself not having the mercantile instinct i resolved to gain it by making a rich marriage for many years i have traveled the world like ulysses i have known men and cities and some years ago chance a deity at whose shrine i always pay my devotions led me to barbadoes while there i was attracted as i always am by the weird and mysterious by the superstitions of the african race i studied the cult of obi the belief of the voodoo stone and by a strange train of circumstances which i need not relate i gained possession of that powerful talisman which is known to all negroid america with this stone in my possession i was king so to speak of all the black race this power i determined to use to my own advantage and through it to make a rich marriage i discovered that mrs dallas was the richest woman in the west indies that she had one fair and marriageable daughter and that mother and daughter were under the influence of a negress called dido who was a profound believer in the cult of obi i determined therefore to bend the negress to my will by means of the voodoo stone and to marry the daughter unfortunately mrs dallas and her child were in england so thither i went in order to prosecute my suit and obtain a rich wife in the person of miss isabella dallas from information obtained in barbadoes i found that they were living near deanminster so to that town i repaired and established myself as a physician i made the acquaintance of yourself of mr alymer and mr sarby and also of mrs dallas and her daughter the young and charming girl whom i intended to make my wife but here as you may guess i found an unexpected obstacle the young lady was in love with mr alymer and would have nothing to do with an elderly bachelor like myself i determined to remove that obstacle not by death but by gentler means which would do away with all risk and place miss dallas in my power need i say that i allude to the devil stick i knew that you possessed it my dear major as i had been informed of its existence and of its owner by dido over this negress by means of the voodoo stone i possessed complete power she was ready to do whatever i wanted and i employed her in forwarding my schemes her grandmother had come from 'ashantee' the native country of the wand of sleep and knew all about it also she knew how to prepare the poison these secrets she transmitted to dido and i resolved to obtain the devil stick to make dido prepare fresh poison and to use the devil stick against my rival mr alymer and now a word about this poison it does not kill but merely places its victim in a trance state which so closely resembles death that not even the most expert doctor can tell the difference if the trance continues the victim dies but there is an antidote which by the way i obtained from dido and this antidote if used in time can restore the victim from a state of catalepsy to his pristine vigor i had made up my mind to use the devil stick and so as i was anxious to give mr alymer a chance to escape i prophesied to him a state of life in death this phrase describes exactly the trance state of those wounded by the devil stick impregnated with its poison however mr alymer did not take my warning and leave off courting miss dallas on the contrary he announced his engagement and carried off the young lady in triumph as you may guess from what i have said before i doomed him from that hour i made dido hypnotize mrs dallas in order to have the devil stick stolen if you remember major i offered to buy it but as you refused i had to have it stolen in order to compromise the mother i arranged that she should steal it she did and without having the slightest notion that she was committing the crime when dido obtained the devil stick she filled it with the poison then she by my directions hypnotized miss dallas put the devil stick into her hand and sent her forth to kill mr alymer but i should not say kill as you know the devil stick cannot kill let us say to cast mr alymer into a trance by this ingenious plot you must admit major that it is ingenious i got rid of the lover and obtained a hold over mother and daughter but to make a long story short i had the body of mr alymer stolen with the aid of dido in order to revive my rival i did not wish him to die so i took away his body and kept him in the trance for some weeks feeding him in the meantime so as to preserve life while i was in prison dido attended him by my orders mr alymer was not concealed in my house so that is why the police had a useless search for the body where was he concealed ah that is my secret after the trial seeing that mr sarby had behaved so foolishly i decided to abandon the game evidently there was no chance of my winning the hand of miss dallas and also i did not wish sarby to die but if i revived him i would have to revive maurice also the more so as i did not want to stand my trial for stealing his body the rest of my story you know i revived maurice and brought him to you so i suppose he will now marry miss dallas i also revived david to have the satisfaction of seeing the woman he loved in the arms of another in both cases the antidote was efficacious so now my dear major as i said before you have your two dear boys once more in the flesh and i hope you are satisfied did i not tell you that the devil is not so black as he is painted well my plot has failed and now i am departing to look anew for a rich wife also to find dido and get back the voodoo stone of which she robbed me you will never meet me again and i dare say you won't be sorry to see the back of me and now my dear major i fancy i have told you all and you know the meaning of the many mysteries which have puzzled you for so long there remains only to say adieu and remain your evil genius now resigned max etwald the second letter of dr etwald barbadoes my dear major jen it is over a year since i wrote you my explanatory letter from deanminster and i little thought that it would be necessary for me to write to you again least of all from this place but here i came in search of dido and here i found mrs dallas and to my profound astonishment her daughter still miss dallas i sought an explanation they would not give me one in despair having received the most uncivil reception i left them then to my surprise i ran across mr david sarby he was glad to see me and thanked me for bringing him back from the grave i on my side complimented him for saving my neck from the hangman's noose the first greetings thus being over he told me the news which concerned those who where implicated in our little deanminster comedy i confess that the news surprised me and i write to you for an explanation in the first place i learned from mr sarby that isabella dallas refused to marry mr alymer and that far from being offended he appeared to be glad of the release from his engagement i also learned that he has since married lady meg brance who has always been so deeply in love with him will you be so kind my dear major as to explain this sudden misplacing of mr alymer's affections i learned also from mr sarby that he has prevailed upon miss dallas the deserted ariadne of mr alymer to reward his long devotion by giving him her hand i hear that they are to be married within the month and that the match is one which meets with the full approbation of mrs dallas under these circumstances i am afraid that there is no chance of my marrying miss dallas so i must content myself with searching for another wife i found in my brief interview with miss dallas that she had learned how she had tried to kill mr alymer while under the hypnotic influence of dido perhaps this knowledge broke off the match and the young couple took a dislike to one another from the peculiar circumstances of that night certainly hypnotism or not one would not care to marry a woman who had attempted one's life so that i conjecture is the reason of mr alymer's withdrawal also miss dallas must have had a horror of seeing constantly before her the man whom innocently enough she tried to kill hence her refusal to marry your dear maurice am i wrong in these ideas i think not still i should like an explanation from you as i shall be here for some months searching for the voodoo stone and dido please send your letter to barbadoes directed to your anxious inquirer max etwald the third letter of dr etwald barbadoes my dear major jen it is now some months since i wrote you making certain inquiries yet you have not been courteous enough to gratify my curiosity that is cruel of you miss dallas is now mrs sarby the other lady is now lady meg alymer yet you will not tell me how this strange transfer of wives came about never mind i am sure the explanation i fancied in my last letter is the correct one but you are a rude correspondent fie major fie fie fie i shall return good for evil and tell you that i have regained possession of the voodoo stone dido is dead killed by her own excitement at an obi orgie i am now the king of the black race throughout the world by possession of the stone but to you i shall remain for the last time my dear major max etwald the end
