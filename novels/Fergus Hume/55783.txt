tattoo chapter i the crime on the twentyfirst of june in the year one thousand eight hundred and ninetyfour mr fanks of new scotland yard detective was walking down the strand between the hours of seven and eight in the evening in the character of octavius rixton of the west end idler it may be as well to repeat here what is no doubt already knownthat this individual led a dual existence he earned his money as a detective and spent it as a man about town east of trafalgar square he was called fanks westward he was known by his real name of rixton but few people were aware that the idler and the worker were one and the same nevertheless of necessity four or five persons possessed this knowledge and of these one was crate a brother officer of fanks who had worked with him in many cases and who had a profound respect for his capabilities fanks had obtained this ascendancy over crates mind by his skilful unravelling of the chinese jar mystery this especial evening rixton had cast off the name clothes and personality of fanks and in propri person he was about to treat himself to a melodrama at the adelphi theatre as he was passing through the vestibule at a quarter to eight a man came forward and touched him on the arm to the surprise of rixton he recognised crate you mentioned that you were coming here this evening mr rixton said this latter who had been instructed to so address his chief on particular occasions and i have been waiting for the last half hour to see you what is the matter crate the subordinate beckoned rixton to a quiet corner and in a low tone said one word which made him dismiss from his mind the idea of attending the theatre on that evening the whispered word was murder where asked fanks assuming the detective on the instant down tooleys alley man or woman or child man i think a gentleman when was the crime committed between six and seven this evening in a house or on the street in a house the red star publichouse i know it said fanks with a sharp nod a cutthroat place at the bottom of tooleys alley the assassin chose an excellent locality poison steel or bludgeon the first i fancy there are no marks of violence on the body but you had better come and see for yourself i agree with you return to the red star crate while i go to my rooms to change my clothes i am rixton at present and i dont want to mix up my two personalities expect me in half an hour crate departed with prompt obedience and rixton drove off in a swift hansom to his chambers in duke street st james in ten minutes he had assumed his detective clothes and fanks personality in twenty he was returning eastward and at the expiration of half an hour he was standing at the door of the house wherein the crime had been committed such promptitude was characteristic of the man tooleys alley is a narrow zigzag street which beginning at a point in drury lane twists its way through a mass of malodorous houses until blocked finally by the red star hotel it is a famous rialto of rogues and vagabonds for here they most do congregate and here come the police when any especial criminal is wanted by the law an evil district with an evil name a plague spot which cannot be eradicated either by law or by religion there are many such in london and of all tooleys alley is the worst it was plausible enough that a gentleman should be trapped robbed and murdered in this quarter but it was more difficult to surmise what errand had brought a gentleman into so dangerous a neighbourhood a gentleman done to death in tooleys alley fanks scented a mystery the red star was a gorgeous ginpalace all gas and glare and glitter it was licensed to mrs boazoph a widow whose character was more than suspected by the police but who contrived by a circumspect demeanour to keep on the right side of the law by virtue of her position her supposed wealth and above all by reason of her talents she was quite the queen of tooleys alley why she should have been permitted to hold her disreputable court in this hotbed of crime was best known to the authorities but hold it she did and made money out of her ragged subjects in the neighbourhood she was popularly known as queen beelzeebub attracted by the news of the murder a mob of raffish men and slatternly women had collected round the red star but the presence of four policemen prevented them from entering the bar and drinking as they desired to do fanks had no need to push through the crowd for on recognising him they fell to right and left to leave him a free passage under his keen gaze a quiver of fear passed over many of the brutalised faces and here and there some especial rogue scared by the memory of lately committed crimes shrank back into the shadows lest this man who personified the law should discover and punish fanks was the nemesis of tooleys alley the god they desired to propitiate and he was at once hated and feared by his debased worshippers after exchanging a few words with the guardian policemen fanks entered the house and was met in the passage by crate and by mrs boazoph this latter who appeared to be between forty and fifty years of age was a slender and pallidfaced woman with almost white hair smoothed back from her high forehead she spoke habitually with folded hands and downcast eyes and her voice was low and soft with a refined accent one would have taken this demure figure clad in a plain dress of lustreless black for an hospital nurse or for a housekeeper yet she wasas the police assertedthe most dangerous woman in london hand and glove with thieves and rogues not for nothing had she gained her reputation and queenly title well mrs boazoph said fanks abruptly this last scandal will add largely to the excellent reputation already gained by your house no doubt of it sir replied the landlady without raising her eyes it is most unfortunate and most unexpected certainly most unexpected sir the detective looked at her sharply and noticed that her fingers played nervously with the stuff of her gown also he heard a tremor in her voice as she answered now mrs boazoph was not easily upset yet as fanks well saw only her unusual selfcontrol prevented her from having an attack of hysteria to many men the circumstance of the crime having been committed in the house would have accounted for this fanks was too well acquainted with queen beelzeebub to give her the benefit of the doubt she was disturbed by something more than the mere fact of the murder do you know the man he asked keeping his eyes fixed on her face no retorted mrs boazoph with suspicious promptitude i never set eyes on him until this evening and with this hinted defiance she stared fanks boldly in the face when she saw that he was watching her twitching fingers they became motionless on the instant only one conclusion could the detective draw from this behaviour she knew more than she would own to and she was afraid lest he should find it out after another look which discovered nothingfor she was now on her guardfanks turned sharply to crate where is the body upstairs in one of the bedrooms was the murder committed in one of the bedrooms no mr fanks it was committed in the room at the end of this passage and why was the body removed out of that room i removed the body said mrs boazoph in a low voice you had no right to do so rebuked fanks sharply it was your duty to leave things as they were when you discovered that a crime had been committed and to give immediate information to the police i did do so sir the police were in this house ten minutes after i saw the dead body nevertheless you found time to remove it in that ten minutes i thought it best to do so said mrs boazoph obstinately no doubt i shall not forget your zeal was fanks rejoinder the woman could not repress a shudder at the ironical tone of the detective and her pale face turned yet paler however she passed discreetly over the remark and turned the conversation briskly shall i take you upstairs to see the body sir no i shall first examine the room afterwards i shall hear your story and inspect the corpse come with me crate still preserving an impenetrable countenance mrs boazoph preceded the two men into the little room at the end of the passage it was an apartment of no great size furnished in a scanty almost in a penurious fashion a window draped with faded curtains of red rep faced the entrance there was no fireplace and the furniture consisted of a mahogany horsehair sofa placed against the righthand wall looking from the door a round table covered with a stained red cloth which stood in the centre of the room and on either side of this two chairs a crimson felting carpeted the floor and a few racing pictures crudely coloured adorned the salmontinted walls beyond this the room contained nothing save an iron gaspipe suspended from the roof by which two jets flaring in pink globes lighted the apartment fanks glanced slowly round taking in every detail and walked across to the window it was locked the curtains were drawn the blind was down as it was too dark to see the outlook fanks turned to mrs boazoph for information what does this window look out on to a yard sir is there any outlet from the yard no sir excepting through the kitchen where the servants have been all the evening when you entered the room and discovered the fact of the murder where was the body huddled up on yonder sofa sir was the room in the same state as it is now in precisely the same state mr fanks wait a moment interposed crate you told me that you took some glasses out of the room mrs boazoph darted a tigerish glance at the detective which revealed the hidden possibilities of her nature however she replied with all possible meekness i quite forgot that sir i did take two glasses off that table recalling crates remark that the deceased had probably been poisoned fanks was rendered angry and suspicious by this action but as it was mere folly to quarrel with so clever a woman as mrs boazoph he made light of the circumstance and observed casually that no doubt the glasses had been washed and put away yes sir assented the landlady they were washed and put away by my own hands i have always known you to be an extremely tidy woman said fanks ironically two glasses you say then there were two gentlemen in this room between six and seven there were two men in this room between six and seven replied mrs boazoph making the correction with emphasis two men you say and they came to have a chatby appointment i think so sir the white man came at six and the black man arrived an hour later ho ho said fanks rather taken by surprise so one of the men was a negro i see and who lies dead upstairs the white man sir and the negro assassin what of him we have no proof that the negro committed the crime mr fanks protested mrs boazoph forgetting her caution for the moment there are no marks of violence on the body of course not said fanks with grim humour no doubt the white man died a convenient and natural death while the negro for no reason fled in alarm i am obliged to you for the suggestion mrs boazoph probably it is as you say not sufficiently clever to see the irony of this remark crate looked surprised but the woman was clearer sighted and seeing that she had overreached herself by saying too much she relapsed into silence the detective feeling that he had scored smiled grimly and went on with his examination of the room the body was on the sofa you say he said after a pause yes it was tumbled in a heap against the wall and the glasses were on the table on the table and on the tray were there any signs of a struggle not that i saw mr fanks can you describe the appearance of the white man no stop ill see his body when i go upstairs what of the black man he was a tall burly fat creature sir just like any other negro how was he dressed in a black opera hat dark trousers brown boots and a long green overcoat with brass buttons said mrs boazoph concisely rather a noticeable dress said fanks carelessly had you ever seen the negro before no sir nor the white man i never saw white or black man in my life till this evening by this time the patience of mrs boazoph was nearly worn out and her selfcontrol was gradually giving way she evidently felt that she could hold out no longer for after replying to the last question she left the room suddenly but that fanks interfered crate would have stopped her let her go said the former we can see her later on in the meantime he continued pointing to the table what is all this crate bent forward and on the dingy red tablecloth he saw a number of tiny black grains scattered about it is a powder of some sort he said i told you that i thought the man had been poisoned even as crate spoke the gaslight went out leaving them in complete darkness ah said fanks rather startled by the unexpected incident mrs boazoph is fiddling with the meter what the deuce did she do that for asked crate as his superior struck a match cant you guess she saw these black grains on the tablecloth and wants to get rid of them that was why she left the room and turned off the gas she hopes that the darkness will drive us out then she will explain the incident by a lie and enter before us to relight the gas well said crate stolidly well repeated fanks crossly i shall never make you understand anything crate before lighting the gas she will pull off the tablecloth and scatter the grains do you think shes in this mr fanks i cant sayyet but she knows something you get a candle andhang this match cried fanks it has burnt my fingers as he uttered the exclamation the match still alight dropped on the table among the black grains to which allusion has been made there was a flicker a sparkle of light and when fanks struck another match the grains had disappeared gunpowder said the detective in a puzzled tone now what possible connection can gunpowder have with this matter to this there was no answer and by the glimmer of the single match the two men looked blankly at one another chapter ii a recognition topping this discovery came the return of mrs boazoph with a candle and an apology her procedure was so exactly the same as that suggested by fanks that crate could not forbear from paying the tribute of an admiring chuckle to the perspicuity of his chief only in her action with the tablecloth did mrs boazoph vary from the prescribed ritual my regrets and apologies sir she said addressing fanks with a side glance at the table but one of the servantsan idle slut whom i have now dischargedturned off the gas at the meter by accident i hope that you were not alarmed by the sudden darkness permit me to relight the burners and with this neat speech she mounted a chair with the activity of a girl having remedied the accident she stumbledor seemed to stumblein descending and caught at the table to save herself thereby dragging the cloth on to the floor then it was that crate chuckled whereupon mrs boazoph was on her feet at once with a look of startled suspicion however as she had accomplished her object she recovered her equanimity speedily and made another apology with a lie tacked on to it my regrets for the second accident she remarked glibly but it is due to overstrung nerves put it down to that gentleman if you please and you will put it down to the right cause pray do not mention it mrs boazoph said fanks significantly i have already examined the cloth and now if you please we will go upstairs the woman drew back and bit her lip she guessed that fanks had seen through her stratagem and for the moment she was minded to excuse herself fortunately her habitual caution saved her from a second blunder and she strove to conciliate fanks by a piece of news i trust that you will not think me presuming sir she said but in the hope that there might be some chance of life remaining in it i sent for a doctor he is now upstairs with it your kindness does you great credit said fanks seeing his way clear to a thrust you could not have behaved better if you had known this man holding the candle before her face mrs boazoph drew back a step with one hand clutching the bosom of her dress her composure gave way in one word you suspect me she cried with a glitter in her eyes in one word i suspect nobody retorted fanks i have not yet heard all your story remember you know all that i know said mrs boazoph the man who came here at six this eveningthe man who lies dead upstairs is a complete stranger to me i caught only a glimpse of him as he entered i did not speak to him he asked for a private room in which to wait for a friend he was shown into this room and waited the negro arrived ten minutes later i saw himi showed him into this room but indeed mr fanks i never set eyes on him before the pairwhite and blackwere together till close on seven they had something to drink for which the dead man paid i did not enter the room it was the barmaid who served them with drink i did not know when the negro went but wanting the room for some other gentlemen i knocked at the door at seven oclock to ask if they had finished their conversation i received no reply i opened the door i entered i found the white man dead the negro absent after removing the body upstairs and covering it with a sheet as any decent woman would i sent for the police that is all i swear that it is the truth say what you please do what you please you cannot fasten this crime on to me fanks listened to this speech with great imperturbability and made but one comment thereon i took you for a clever woman mrs boazoph he said evidently i have been wrong will you be so kind as to light us upstairs mrs boazoph thrust the candle into his hands i have seen it once i refuse to look upon it again she passed out of the room shaking as with the ague fanks nodded in a satisfied way and beckoning to crate he went upstairs a frightened housemaid on the landing indicated the room of which they were in search and they entered it to come face to face with the doctor summoned by the zealous landlady he introduced himself as dr renshaw and made this announcement with a bland smile and a condescending bow fanks eyed his tall and burly figure his napoleonic countenance his smooth brown beard and his perfect dress there was a look about the man which he did not like and he mistrusted the uneasy glance of the hard grey eyes the detective relied largely on his instinct in this case it warned him against the false geniality of dr renshaw the representatives of the law i believe said the medical man in a deep and rolling voice i was about to take my departure but if i can be of service in the interests of justice pray command me i suppose there is no doubt that our friend there is dead said fanks dead as caesar sir said the magnificent doctor waving his arm caesar died by steel remarked fanks significantly it appears that this man died in an easier manner there is another parallel said the doctor condescending to add to the historical knowledge of the detective if we may believe brutus the great julius was slain as a traitor to the republic this unknown man added renshaw pointing to the body also died the death of a traitor if as you say the dead man is unknown said fanks quickly how can you tell that he was a traitor by inference and deduction was the reply you can judge for yourself far be it from me that i should set my opinion against that of the law but i have a theory would you care to hear it if i may venture on a jest said renshaw with ponderous playfulness the medical mouse may help the legal lion let us hear your theory by all means said fanks easily but first permit me to speak with my assistant the doctor bowed and passed over to the other side of the bed while fanks went with crate to the door here he hesitated glanced at the doctor and finally led his subordinate into the passage crate he said in a rapid whisper i mistrust that man he will shortly leave this place follow him and find out where he lives then set someone to watch the place and return to me do you think that he has anything to do with it asked crate i cant say at present i may be wrong about him and about mrs boazoph all the same i mistrust the pair of them now off with you when crate departed to watch for the outcoming of the doctor fanks reentered the chamber of death renshaw still stood beside the bed and seemingly had not moved from that position nevertheless a mat placed midway between bed and door was rucked up by the merest accident fanks had previously noticed that it was lying flat thence he deduced that renshaw had crossed to the door in plain words renshaw had been listening fanks was confirmed in this opinion by the complacent smile which played round the lips of the doctor now for your theory doctor said fanks noting all but saying nothing certainly sir as a detective you know of course of the existence of secret societies i do and i know also that those who reveal the doings of such societies are punished go on doctor first you must inspect the body replied renshaw he drew down the sheet which concealed the face of the dead in the cruel glare of the gaslight fanks beheld a countenance discoloured and distorted the head was that of a young man with brown and curly hair wellmarked eyebrows and a moustache of the same hue as the hair the body was clothed in moleskin trousers and a flannel shirt from the bedpost hung a rough grey coat and a cloth cap a glance assured fanks that these clothes of a working man were perfectly new another glance confirmed his first belief that the dead man was a gentleman on looking intently into the face he started back in surprise but recovering himself said nothing if the doctor had observed his action he made no pointed remark thereon but set it down merely to a natural feeling of repulsion i do not wonder that the state of the body revolts you sir he said the corpse is swollen and discoloured in a terrible manner of course i can say nothing authoritatively until the post mortem has been made but from all appearances i am inclined to ascribe the death to poison ah then it is a case of murder so you say sir the secret society to which this man belongs would call it a punishment how do you know that this man belongs to a secret society do you recognise the body no sir the man is nameless so far as i am concerned there are no marks on his linen or clothes and there are no papers in his pockets likely to identify him oh believe me sir the society has done its work well you seem to be very confident about your secret society the doctor bent over the body and rolled up the shirt sleeve of the left arm between elbow and shoulder there appeared a swollen mark in the shape of a rude cross surrounded by a wheel violet in colour and slashed across with a knife to this he pointed in silence i see what you mean said fanks twisting his signet ring always a sign of perplexity with him the secret mark of the society has been obliterated precisely now you can understand sir why i infer that this man was a traitor evidently the negroof whose presence mrs boazoph informed mewas the emissary of the society and killed this traitor by poison afterwards as was natural he obliterated the secret mark by drawing his knife across it he did not do his work thoroughly then doctor the secret mark is a cross the secret mark is more than a cross sir replied the doctor else you may be sure that the negro would have obliterated it more perfectly the detective replaced the sheet over the face of the dead and prepared as did the doctor to leave the room they turned down the gas and departed but while descending the stairs renshaw asked fanks a question are you satisfied that my explanation is a correct one he demanded i am perfectly satisfied said fanks looking directly at the man strange to say this unhesitating acceptance appeared to render renshaw uneasy and the flow of his magnificent speech broke up in confusion i may be wrong he muttered we are all liable to error but such as it is that is my opinion you would be willing to repeat that opinion at the inquest doctor renshaw drew back with a shudder is it necessary that i should go to the inquest he asked faintly i think so replied fanks significantly you were the first to see the corpse you will have to describe the state in which you found it your address if you please twentyfour great auk street said renshaw after some hesitation i am staying there at present staying there yes iinot practise in london i do not practise at all in fact i traveli travel a great deal in two weeks i go to india you must go first to the inquest responded fanks dryly but if you do not practise in london how comes it that mrs boazoph sent for you she did not send for me explained the doctor but for my friend dr turnor he is absent on a holiday and i am acting as his locum tenens for a short period thank you doctor that is a thoroughly satisfactory explanation quite as satisfactory as your theory of the death good evening i should recommend a glass of brandy you look as though you needed it weak heart muttered renshaw in explanation and took his departure with evident relief but before he left the hotel he acted on the detectives suggestion mrs boazoph gave him the brandy with her own hands the action afforded her an opportunity of exchanging a few words with him fanks thwarted her intent by also entering the bar and asking for refreshment whereupon the doctor finished his liquor and departed left alone with fanks the landlady drew a breath of relief and addressed herself to the detective do you wish to know anything else sir she said coldly if not with your permission i shall retire to bed i have learned all i wish to know at present thank you mrs boazoph go to bed by all means i am sure that you need rest after your anxiety the landlady looking worn out and haggard retired and fanks went to the door to wait for crates return in the meantime he made notes and formed theories these will be revealed hereafter but in the meantime the case was in too crude a state for him to come to the smallest conclusion however he had already decided on the next step in the chamber of death he had made an important discovery which enabled him to move in the matter in half an hour crate returned with the information that dr renshaw had entered no great auk street and that he had set a detective to watch the house fanks smiled on receiving this report he is cleverer than i thought he murmured and left tooleys alley with crate well mr fanks whom do you suspect no one at present crate oh and what do you do next make certain of the dead mans identity crate stopped in surprise do you know who he is mr fanks yes he is a friend of my own sir gregory fellenger baronet chapter iii the result of the crime a week after his discovery of the identity of the dead man fanks having slipped his detective skin for the time being was seated in the writing room of the athenian club with the morning planet newspaper on his knee he was not reading it however but was looking absently at a long and lean young man who was writing letters at a near table francis garth of the middle temple barrister and journalist was one of the few west end men who knew the real profession of rixton alias fanks in fact there was very little he did not know and fanksas it will be convenient to call the detectivewas debating as to whether he should question him about the tooley alley crime he was urged to this course by the remembrance that he had seen garth at the inquest this had been held on the previous day the jury had brought in a verdict of wilful murder against some person or persons unknown and the conduct of the case had been placed officially in the hands of fanks so far all was shipshape and now the detective found himself at a standstill no evidence had been brought forward implicating either mrs boazoph or dr renshaw and doubtful as was fanks as to their honesty he could gain no clue from the one or the other of them likely to elucidate the mystery failing this he had determined to learn if possible all about the previous life of the deceased and in this way discover if anyone was likely to be a gainer by his death garth who had known the late sir gregory intimatelywho had been present at the inquestwas the most likely person to furnish these details and fanks was waiting for an opportunity of addressing him on the result of the projected conversation would depend his future movements i say garth said fanks how much longer will your correspondence take i shall be at your service in ten minutes replied garth without desisting from his occupation what do you wish to talk about about the death of your friend sir gregory fellenger garth looked up and turned round with alacrity is the case in your hands fanks yes and i want some information from you i shall be happy to give it but wait for a few minutes i am just writing about it to a friend of mineand yours humph and the name ted hersham the journalist they looked at one another the same thought occupying both their minds has your reason for writing anything to do with the left arm of our friend asked fanks after a pause garth nodded and returned to his work when he had sealed directed and stamped the letter fanks spoke again garth he said i say garth yes whats the matter dont send that letter till after our conversation ah you guess why i am writing to him my remark of a few moments ago ought to have shown you that said fanks dryly yes i guess your object and i want you to leave the case in my hands it is too difficult a one for you to manage alone i know that it is difficult fanks but i wish to solve this mystery because fellenger was your friend asked fanks because fellenger was my cousin replied garth the announcement took fanks by surprise as he had not known of the relationship he was aware that fellenger and garth had been close friends but he knew little of the former save as a club acquaintance and the latter was very reticent about his private affairs although he was curious concerning the affairs of others so you wish to revenge the death of your cousin he remarked after a thoughtful moment garth shrugged his shoulders hardly that he replied between you and me i did not care overmuch for fellenger he was a bad lot and we only held together because of our relationship but i should like to find out what took him to tooleys alley and who killed him a laudable curiosity do you suspect anybody not a soul i am as much in the dark asyou are i may not be so much in the dark as you think said the other then why did you ask me to assist you retorted garth sharply see here fanks i will tell you all that i know if you will promise to keep me posted up concerning the progress of the case fanks twisted his ring and reflected i agree he said briefly but you must not meddleunless i tell you to do so agreed and the pair shook hands on the bargain and now said fanks grimly that letter if you please after a moments hesitation garth handed it over he had a great respect for the mental capacity of his friend and on the whole he judged it advisable to carry out the agreement which had been concluded though i would send that letter if i were you he expostulated hersham has i know what hersham has interrupted fanks but i want him to see me not you wait till we know how we stand at the present moment come into the smokingroom and answer my questions what a peremptory chap you are grumbled garth as they left the room evidently you dont confide in my discretion i am about to do so said fanks who understood the art of conciliation we will work together and all that i know you shall know but you must let me manage things in my own way in his heart garth was flattered that fanks should have chosen him as his coadjutor and dominated by the stronger will of the detective he quietly took up the position of an underling garth was selfwilled and not usually amenable to reason but fanks had the law at his back without which garth could not hope to do anything hence his acquiescence come now old fellow said fanks amiably we have a hard task before us so you must make it easier by answering my questions go on said garth lighting a cigar i always give in to a man who has had more experience than myself fanks laughed at this delicate way of adjusting the situation but as he wished to keep on good terms with the touchy lawyer he let the remark pass in silence when they were fairly settled and he saw that they had the smokingroom to themselves he took out his pocketbook and began his examination as to the past of the dead man the fellengers are a hampshire family i believe yes replied garth with a nod sir gregory was the fourth baronet and only son the family seat is mere hall near bournemouth you are sir gregorys cousin i am on the mothers side who is the present baronet yourself or somebody else somebody else said garth with a sigh i should have told you if i had been his heir i wonder at so clever a man as you asking so very frivolous a question i have my reasons said fanks calmly well and who is the heir my cousin louis fellenger he is twentyfive years of age and as great a prig as ever lived where does he reside now i believe that he has gone to mere hall to take possession of the property but he did live at taxtononthames a village near weybridge do you know sir louis intimately no i have only seen him once or twice he is a bookish scientific man and an invalidat least corrected garth he has always a doctor living with him a tall fat brute called binjoy who twists him round his finger he has been with him for years a tall fat brute repeated fanks smiling at this amiable description has the gentleman in question a long brown beard no he is clean shaven a pompous creature fond of using long words and proud of his voice and oratorial powers something like conversation kenge in bleak house humph said fanks rather struck by the description which was not unlike that of renshaw we will discuss dr binjoy later on in the meantime just enlighten me as to your precise relationship with the present baronet its easily understood gregorys father sir francisafter whom i was namedhad a brother and sister she married my respected father richard garth and i am the sole offspring and the brother was the father of the present sir louis exactly there is a great deal of similarity between all three cases gregory was an only child and his parents are dead louis is an only child and his parents have also gone the way of all flesh i am an only child and i am likewise an orphan fanks made a note of the family tree in his book so far so good he said with a nod sir gregory is dead and sir louis has succeeded him if louis dies without issue you are the heir and failing you the property goes to the crown replied garth louis and i are the sole representatives of the fellengers the race has dwindled considerably now what about your dead cousin he was a trifle rapid i believe a regular bad lot but i kept in with him becausewell because he was useful to me understand perfectly replied fanks who knew of garths financial difficulties we will pass that have you any idea what took him to tooleys alley not the slightest i saw him two days before his deathon the nineteenthand he said nothing about going there then did he behave as usual towards you no he was out of sorts he had lost a lot of money at cards i believe and he was crabbed in consequence there was no other trouble no financial difficulty not that i know of fast as he was he could not get through ten thousand a year before the age of twentyeight i have known men who have done so said fanks dryly however if it was not a question of money what about the inevitable woman i dont think it was that either demurred garth it was a man he meta negronot a woman true well you were at the inquest how do you know asked garth starting i saw you there in the crowd you see everything fanks it is my business to see everything garth it is because you were at the inquest that i sought you out today now that you have explained to me your relationship to sir gregory i understand why you were present but to return to the main point you heard the theory of dr renshaw yes replied garth reflectively there might be something in that secret society business not mind you that gregory was the man to meddle with rubbish of that kind he was too much of a fool but one never knows a man does not have a cross tattooed on his arm for nothing do you think that it is the mark of a revolutionary society i cant say i should like to know that is why i was writing to hersham of course you know that he i know that he has a cross tattooed on his arm also and it is for that reason that i reject your secret society business it isnt mine i am merely following the lead of renshaw then you are following a willothewisp retorted fanks see here garth i have known hersham for a long time he is the son of a clergyman in the isle of wight he was brought up to the law like yourself and also like yourself he left it for journalism as you know he is a merry openminded creature who could not conceal a secret if his life depended upon it do you think that if he had been mixed up with secret societies that he would have been able to conceal the fact from me then why is there a cross tattooed on his left arm asked garth i intend to see him and find out i noticed it long ago but made no remark on it thinking that it was the result of some schoolboy freak now it has assumed a new importance in my eyes therefore you must let me interview hersham and choose my own time and place for doing so i suppose you are right tear up that letter please fanks held out the letter tear it up yourself he said this garth did without further remark and looked at his friend what do you intend to do now he asked continue this conversation for a few minutes longer you were intimate with the dead man garth did you ever notice this cross i did not said garth promptly or i should have asked what it meant by jove he added with a start then all that obliteration business must be nonsense of course assented fanks smoothly i came to that conclusion long ago fellenger had no cross on his arm when he entered tooleys alley it was tattooed that night by the negro what makes you think that i found a few grains of gunpowder on the tablecloth of the room in which they were together gunpowder is used in tattooing again the arm when renshaw showed it to me was raw as though the operation had been done lately but why should gregory go to tooleys alley to be tattooed tell me that and the mystery of his death is at an end said fanks significantly but i am certain that fellenger voluntarily let this negro tattoo his arm and so came by his death came by his death echoed garth in astonishment what do you mean why answered fanks seriously i mean that the needle used for the tattooing was poisoned and so he shrugged his shoulders the man died chapter iv another discovery informed of this astounding fact garth stared at his friend in blank astonishment the detective resumed his cigar and waited you cannot be in earnest said the barrister after a pause why not the theory is feasible enough it was proved at the inquest that the man died from bloodpoisoning yes but it might have been administered in the liquor the pair had drinks remember i have not forgotten said fanks quietly but on your part remember that no trace of poison was found in the stomach while the blood was so corrupted as to show that the deceased had been inoculated with some powerful vegetable poison there was no mark on the body save the cross on the left arm and by your own showing it was not there when fellenger went to tooleys alley the assumption is that it was done there as is more than confirmed by the presence of gunpowder again according to mrs boazoph there was no struggle therefore the deceased must have passed away quietly my inference is that this negro desired to kill sir gregoryor else he was instructed to do so by some one else who wished for the death of your cousin what then so easy as for the negro to have a poisoned needle prepared to execute the tattooing quite unaware of the danger fellengerfor some unknown reasonwould permit the insertion of the fatal needle as the work went on he would gradually be inoculated with the poison when the gunpowder and acids were applied the job would be finished and he would pull down his sleeve quite ignorant that to all intents and purposes he was a dead man then he sat and chatted with the negro till the end came when he sank into a state of coma and died when certain that the death was an assured fact the negro took his departure oh it is all as plain as day to meall excepting one fact and that fact why did fellenger get a negro in tooleys alley to tattoo him garth reflected i can only conclude that a secret rubbish said fanks contemptuously you and your secret societies i tell you that is all nonsense even assuming that the cross is an emblem of some associationwhich i do not grant for a momentwe have proved that it was not tattooed on your cousins arm when he went to keep his appointment therefore he could not at that time have been a member of your mythical society if on the other hand he was being made a membera ceremony which would not have taken place in a low pothousewhy should he be killed these societies admit living men to work their ends they have no use for dead bodies that is all true enough fanks we must reject the idea of a secret society but in an affair of robbery and murder in such an affair the method of procedure would be different a bludgeona sandbaga knifeany of these weapons if you please but if this negro had designed to rob fellenger he need not have ingratiated himself into his confidence to permit the performance of so delicate an operation as that of the poisoned needle no we must reject that theory also then what do you think was the motive of the murder i am not a detective out of a novel mr garth ask me an easier question he rose from his seat and began to walk to and fro the whole mystery lies in the tattooing he muttered to himself if i can only find out why sir gregory permitted that cross to be tattooed and why he went to tooleys alley to have it done i shall discover the assassin hersham has a tattooed cross on his left arm said garth perhaps he can explain the riddle perhaps he can perhaps he cant returned fanks sharply the coincidence is certainly curious i shall see and question hersham but there is much to be done before then you must help me garth i am willing to do whatever you wish my friend ah said fanks with a smile you have a touch of detective fever i suffer from it myself notwithstanding my experience the unravelling of these criminal problems is like gambling a neverfailing source of excitement and like gambling chance enters largely into their solution i dont see much chance in this case dont you think again why the very fact that you and i should know that hersham has a tattooed cross on his left arm is a chance such knowledgewhich is mere chance knowledgemight lead to nothing on the other hand it may help to find the man who killed your cousin surely you do not suspect hersham certainly not why should i suspect him on the evidence of the tattooed cross for all i or you know it may be a simple coincidence such as crops up constantly in real life no i dont suspect hersham do you suspect anyone i dont suspect any special person of committing the murder but i suspect some people and particularly one individual of knowing more than they chose to say but this is beside the point i wish you to help me by all means what is it you want me to do you know the chambers of your cousin by my desire they have been in the hands of the police since his death fellengers valet is also theredetained by my desire now i wish to search the chambers for possible evidence and to examine him you must take me there at once is it necessary when by your own showing you are allsupreme already my friend said fanks solemnly it is my experience that when the lower ordersto which this valet belongscome into contact with a detective they are quite useless as witnesses for the very simple reason that the presence of the law paralyses them to avoid this danger you must introduce me into the chambers as a sympathising friend only you can question the servant in my presence and having got rid of him in the meantime we can search the chambers together but the police may recognise you the police have their instructions they will recognise me as mr rixton of the west end garth fell in readily with this scheme and together the two men left the club as they proceeded along piccadillythe dead mans chambers were in halfmoon streetfanks resumed the conversation from the point where it had been broken off you have answered my questions capitally garth now as we are working together i shall reply to anything you like to ask me the barrister restored to a sense of importance by the thought of the part he was about to play in the forthcoming interview with the valet availed himself readily of the opportunity of learning the plans of the detective fanks had no hesitation in confiding them to him as foreseeing that garth would be necessary to the elucidation of the mystery he wished to interest him in the case as much as possible he was well aware that garth was not the man to give up an idea when once it had fixed itself in his head and his present idea was to investigate the mystery of his cousins death with characteristic wisdom fanks who never wasted a person or an opportunity made use of this new factor in the case to further his own ends such economies aided his frequent successes in no small degree what are your plans asked garth taking advantage of the permission as yet i cannot be certain of them but so far as i can see at present they include the search and examination of chambers and valet a conversation with the landlady of the red star a visit to taxtononthames and an interview with dr renshaw why with the latter gentleman because renshaw is too confidential with mrs boazoph because he was too conveniently on the spot at the time of the murder for my liking and finally because renshaw had a cutanddried theory of the motive of the crime prepared on the instant you dont trust the man i think that his conduct is suspicious but i do not accuse him of anythingas yet he does not look a man to be feared said garth disbelievingly he was very timid in giving his evidence at the inquest that is one reason why i mistrust him dr renshaw is acting a part but i am unable to say whether he is mixed up in this especial affair i have my suspicions but as you know i never like to speak unless certain garth looked curiously at the detective you hint at the guilt of mrs boazoph he said doubtfully do i then i should hold my tongue there is no doubt that the negro committed the crime in the way that i told you of but i believe that he acted as the agent of a third partynot mrs boazoph i wish to find out that party to hang him or her as an accessory before the fact you cant hang him or her perhaps not but i can imprison him or her do you think that mrs boazoph knows the motive of the crime fanks reflected yes i think she does he said quietly it is my belief that the motive for which you and i are searching is to be found in the past life of mrs boazoph her past is known to the police is it not it is known for the last twenty years only she appeared in london twentyone years ago but who she is and where she came from the police know no more than you do then how can the motive be found in garth said fanks pausing and touching the other with his finger i have presentiments and premonitions these rarely deceive me in this instance they point to mrs boazoph do not ask me why for i can tell you no more but i am sure that we are going forward on a dark path at the end of that path we will findmrs boazoph i never thought that you were so superstitious fanks i do not regard myself as so i assure you but and here fanks became emphatic i believe in my instinct in my presentiment garth walked along in silence rather inclined to ridicule the apparent weakness of fanks however he judged it wiser to keep these thoughts to himself and merely asked another question relative to the negro i am at a loss about the negro said fanks as i do not know where to search for him under these circumstances i think it necessary to follow the clue i hold in my hand the going of your dead cousin to tooleys alley to keep his appointment how do you know that it was an appointment i learnt that much from mrs boazoph she said that the white man came first and was asked for by the black man that is an appointment and i wish to find out who made it how can you discover that well i hope to do so by searching the chambers of your cousin there must be a letter or some sign whereby fellenger knew where to meet the negro the letter may have been destroyed possibly from your knowledge of your cousins character would you think it probable that he would destroy the letter making the appointment no said garth after a moments thought if the appointment was made within the last month i should think that the letter was still in existence on what ground asked fanks eagerly well gregory used to read all his letters and then drop them into the drawer of his desk at the end of the month he went through the pile and the letters that were worth nothing were destroyed so if that letter making the appointment is in existence it will be in the drawer of the desk good this is a chance i hardly hoped to have chance again yes chance again replied fanks goodhumouredly how many men burn their letters but for the fortunate circumstance that your cousin saved his for a month it would be almost hopeless to think of gaining a clue but now there is more than a hope provided that the appointment was made by letter of course assented fanks gravely we must always take that into consideration but a question on my side did it strike you at the inquest that there was a resemblance between doctors renshaw and binjoy i cant say that it did renshaw is much older than binjoy and he wears a full beard whereas binjoy is shaven clean still they are both burly both have fine voices and indulge in long words and stately johnsonian dialogue you surely do not think the two men are one and the same i have such an idea said fanks dryly strange as it may appear but as my opinion is mainly founded on your description i may be wrong at all events renshaw goes to india next week if i find binjoy in the company of sir louis fellenger after renshaws departure i shall admit my error otherwisewell i must get to the bottom of the matter i have only seen each of them once said garth so do not depend altogether on my powers of description i wont i depend on nothing but my own eyesight for instance if i see a black man wearing a green overcoat with brass buttons i shall have a reasonable suspicion that i see the assassin of your cousin hullo what is the matter for garth was leaning against the iron railings of green park with a look of dread on his face by heaven fanks you may be right about what about renshaw and binjoy being one and the same man indeed what makes you think so asked fanks dryly because binjoy has a negro servant who wears a green coat with brass buttons chapter v the red star advertisement greatly to the surprise of garth the detective appeared to be decidedly disappointed at this announcement you dont seem to be overpleased at what i have told you he said in a tone of pique yet it makes the case easier to you i confess that i do not think so was fanks reply i shall give you my reasons after i have examined your cousins rooms at present i must say that you have puzzled me fanks refusal to discuss the subject of the negro did not at all please garth especially as he considered that his discovery had placed the solution of the case in their hands but to his protestations the detective only reiterated his determination to keep silent until the rooms had been searched with this garth was forced to be content although he could not conceive the reason of such extraordinary conduct and he ascended the stairs with an illgrace were i in your place i should follow out the clue of the negro without delay he said as they rang the bell were you in my place you would do as i am doing and take time to consider your movements retorted fanks as the door was opened venturing on no further remonstrance garth walked into the chambers followed by his friend the servant who admitted them was a lightcomplexioned lighthaired young fellow who appeared to be thoroughly frightened his first remark exposed the reason of his terror i am afraid you cant come in sir he said to the cousin of his late master with a backward glance the police are here as he spoke a policeman made his appearance overflowing with official importance prompted by fanks the barrister at once addressed himself to this jackinoffice i am the cousin of the late sir gregory fellenger he said and i wish to go into the sittingroom for a few minutes you cant enter sir said the policeman stolidly why not my friend here mr rixton the officer started and looked at fanks evidently he saw his orders in the face of the detective for he at once moved aside and granted the desired permission the valet robert was astonished at this sudden yielding but he entertained no suspicion that there was any understanding between the policeman and the fashionablydressed young man who had been introduced as mr rixton at a glance the detective saw that he had to deal with a timid simple creature who might be trusted to tell the truth out of sheer nervous apprehension the discovery afforded him satisfaction i am much obliged to you officer said garth slipping a shilling into the policemans hand we shall not stay long robert show us into the sittingroom if you please i wish to ask a few questions a terrified expression flitted across the face of the mild valet but like a welltrained servant he merely bowed and preceded garth along the passage fanks lingered behind maxwell he said to the policeman has anyone been here this morning yes sir replied the man in a low tone a young lady sir very pretty with dark air and blue eyes she asked to see robert sir oh indeed and how did you act i wouldnt let her see him sir he dont know she called quite right what did she say when you refused she was upset mr fanks and insisted on seeing him i said as he was out so she said as she would call this afternoon at three oclock fanks glanced at his watch it was a quarter past two so this unknown woman might be expected in a short space of time fanks was curious to see her and to learn the reason of her coming as it might be that she was indirectly connected with the case as yet there was no woman mixed up in the matter with the doubtful exception of mrs boazoph but from long experience fanks was sure that the necessary element would yet appear it seemed as though his expectations were about to be realised was she a lady maxwell or an imitation of one a real lady sir she gave me half a sov sir you had no business to take the money he said half smiling at maxwells definition of what was a real lady i couldnt help it sir said maxwell piteously she would give it to me sir i am ready to return it sir if she should come back well we shall see show her into the sittingroom if she calls again has that valet been out today no sir he seems too frightened to go out he does nothing but go about the ouse owling a poor miserable thing mr fanks has he said much to you never a word sir he olds his tongue and owls thats all this behaviour of the servant struck fanks as strange but he did not make any comment thereon to the policeman again desiring maxwell to show the young lady into the room when she called he went in search of garth to his surprise he found the barrister alone where is robert asked fanks sharply i sent him out thinking that we would search the room first that wont do we shall want his assistance call him in at once garth nodded and rang the bell in a few minutes robert looking more terrified than ever made his appearance with a glance at fanks to bespeak his attentionfor the detective was lounging idly in a chairgarth began his interrogation at once robert he said with great deliberation how long have you been in the service of my cousin four years sir was he a kind master a very kind master sir i would not wish for a better place do you remember the twentyfirst of june asked the barrister in true policecourt style yes sir replied the man with a shiver it was the night that my master was murdered at what time did sir gregory leave the house i dont know sir you dont know repeated garth while fanks pricked up his ears were you not in attendance on him no sir my master received a letter by the five oclock post which seemed to upset him very much after a time he recovered and sent me out to get seats for the theatre when i got back at six he was gone i never saw him again declared the man in a shaking voice never again till i was called on to identify his dead body you had no idea where your master was going no sir he did not tell me when you left sir gregory to get seats for the theatre how was he dressed in a frock coat and light trousers sir but when i saw the body it was clothed in moleskin trousers and a flannel shirt did you ever see that disguise in his possession i cant say that i ever did sir replied the valet hesitatingly but the week before a parcel came for sir gregory which he would not let me open i was about to do so when he stopped me i think the parcel contained the clothesthe disguise why do you think so because the parcel was soft and felt like clothes besides it came from weeks and co of edgewareroad and they sell more workmens clothes than anything else on what day did the clothes arrive asked fanks idly on the fourteenth sir i am certain of the date because sir gregory was taken ill in the morning taken ill repeated garth at what time was he taken ill at breakfast mr garth when he was reading the paper he gave a cry and i came in to find him in a faint like i got him a glass of brandy and he dressed and went out the parcel arrived in the afternoon what paper did your master take in the morning post sir replied the man turning to fanks who had asked the question the morning post of the fourteenth and where is the paper my master put it away sir oh do you happen to know where he put it no sir i was out of the room at the time fanks sank back in his chair and nodded to garth to continue the conversation which the barrister did at once how long had your master been in town before the murder he asked about a month sir before that we were at mere hall in i know where it is said garth impatiently but about that letter which came by the five oclock post on the day of the crime did you see it i saw the envelope when i brought it in sir was the handwriting a mans or a womans it was in female handwriting i am certain sir your master was agitated when he opened it very agitated sir he had an attack like that of the previous week when he was reading the paper the letter was from a woman i supposed it was sir judging from the handwriting had sir gregory anything to do at that time with any particular woman robert grew even paler than usual and placed his hand on his throat with a nervous gesture he replied with difficulty his eyes on the ground not that i know of sir he said hoarsely fanks was satisfied that the servant was lying but he made no attempt to intervene on the contrary he signed to garth to conclude his examination and to let the man go this the lawyer did forthwith that is all robert you can go i shall remain here with mr rixton for a few minutes longer when the servant had taken his departure garth turned eagerly to his friend well fanks and what do you think of all this i think that there is a woman at the bottom of it as usual mrs boazoph no a younger and a prettier woman than mrs boazoph we will talk of that later in the meantime i wish to see that letter and the advertisement what advertisement the one in the morning post which upset your cousin on the fourteenth in which drawer does he stow his letters garth went to the desk he tried the middle drawer but it was locked as were the other drawers he used to place his papers in the middle drawer said garth but you see that it is closed i thought it might be said fanks producing a bunch of keys so i brought these with me no good no skeleton keys will open these locks they are of special construction and gregory was very proud of them these are the keys of the desk garth they were found in the dead mans pockets and i brought them with me in case the drawers should be locked i was right it seems and now let us make our search he opened the middle drawer and revealed a mass of letters all in the envelopes in which they had come the two men went carefully through the pile and in ten minutes they were rewarded by finding the object of the search the envelope the address of which as had been stated by robert was in female handwriting contained three documents two printed slips cut from a newspaper a piece of cardboard in the shape of a fiverayed star painted red and inscribed with some writing slips and star read as follows the first printed slip dated th june tattooed cross left arm i alone know all i alone can save you if you wish to feel secure meet me when and where you please the second printed slip dated th june tattooed cross left arm i wish to feel secure name time and place and i shall be there the cardboard star painted red illustration five pointed star with handwriting in arm viz tooleys alley june hotel chapter vi a startling incident good said fanks surveying this documentary evidence with much satisfaction we have more than hearsay to go on now the case is shaping better than i expected you were right about an appointment having been made said garth these slips and that star prove it yes he who runs may readnow but you were not so confident of my foresight a few minutes ago well we have made a step forward here is the slip asking for the appointment here is your cousins reply leaving the question of the appointment to the first advertiser and finally here is the ingenious pictorial information indicating the red star in tooleys alley as the meetingplace sir gregory disguised himself in the workmans clothes bought from weeks and co on the day that the first notice appeared kept the appointment between six and seven and so walked blindfolded into the trap of the red star where he met with his fate the assassin laid his plans uncommonly well but she made one mistake she you dont mean to say that the murderer is a murderess no the negro killed sir gregory that is beyond all doubt but as i said before it is my opinion that the negro was inspired by a third party cant you see that the address on that envelope is in female handwriting certainly i can but that does not prove that a woman inspired the crime you go too fast fanks perhaps i do and after all i may be mistaken but that address is in no feigned hand it was written by a woman if a woman had nothing to do with this death why should she bait the trap to lure the man to his doom and again the directions on the cardboard star are in an angular female hand both address and directions are in the handwriting of an elderly woman come now cried garth disbelievingly you cant tell the womans age from her handwriting i can tell that she is elderly these angular spiky letters were formed by a woman who learned to write in early victorian days female handwriting has altered of late my friend the new woman goes in for masculine handwriting as well as for masculine dress if a girl of the present day had written this address it would have been in a bold and manly hand as it is i bet you five pounds that it was scribbled by a woman over fifty it may be so but this is all deduction most of the evidence in criminal cases is circumstantial and deductive another thing makes me think that it is a woman there is a great deal of useless mystery here a man would not have troubled about that he would have inserted a third advertisement appointing time and place but this woman cant resist a touch of the mysterious therefore she devises this silly cardboard star sends it through the post and so betrays herself how can she betray herself when there is no address there is no address but there is a postmark look at the envelope garth picked up the paper and saw that the postmark was taxtononthames why he cried in astonishment that is where my cousin louis lives yes and it is where dr binjoy lives which is more to the purpose said fanks dryly did i not tell you that i was right to doubt that gentleman garth looked again at the envelope you say that this handwriting is that of an elderly woman i suppose you are thinking of mrs boazoph indeed i am not i give mrs boazoph more credit than to murder a man in her own hotel and advertise the fact so openly she is not a fool but patience garth we are not yet at the end of our discoveries he again searched the drawers in many of them there was nothing likely to attract his attention but in the lowest drawer on the right hand side garth made a discovery it was that of a pretty girls photograph and this he showed to fanks with a laugh gregory always had a weakness for pretty faces he remarked do you not think that his taste was good fanks looked reflectively at the picture it was that of a girl just budding into womanhood with a delicate face and rather sad eyes the name of the artist was not printed at the foot as is usual nor was the address of the studio inscribed thereon nevertheless on the back of the photograph the detective found writing which startled him garth he cried eagerly give me that envelope ah i thought so what is the matter asked garth astonished at the excitement of the usually calm fanks look at the envelope look at the back of the photograph compare the handwritings fanks placed them side by side on the desk on the envelope was the address of sir gregory in halfmoon street on the photograph an inscription which ran as follows emma born died the handwriting on both was one and the same garth drew a long breath by george that is strange he said after a pause the woman who wrote the one wrote the other there isnt a shadow of difference between the writings you are right fanks the penmanship is that of an elderly woman no doubt the mother of the girl that is my opinion also but the girl garth who is she the lawyer reflected and frowned i did hear that my cousin was entangled with some woman he said with reluctance but that was many months ago in fact there was a rumour of a marriage i asked gregory if this was so and received a prompt denial but for all that added garth looking at the portrait there might have been some truth in the rumours i never saw this lady but my cousin could be very secretive when he liked seventyfour to ninetythree just nineteen poor creature whosoever she was i am certain that he treated her badly you may judge him too harshly garth shook his head with a gloomy air i knew my cousin well he said he would have killed any woman with unkindness they looked at one another and back at the photograph there was something sinister in the fact that the two articles were inscribed in the same handwriting the writing on the photograph recorded the decease of a pretty woman that on the envelope had lured the baronet to his death was it possible that the follies of sir gregory had come home to him in so fearful a fashion the two men could not but incline to this opinion well said fanks after a long pause i should like to ask robert what he knows about this woman very probably he knows nothing i am not so certain about that replied fanks when you asked him about a womanabout a possible entanglement he could hardly speak for fear and he told a lie about it he is a servile hound that fellow and i daresay he did all fellengers dirty work for him we must have him in and force the truth from his unwilling lips will you go away after you have seen him said garth who was beginning to weary of the matter no i wish to wait and seea girl a girl what girl a young lady who called this morning to see robert maxwell told her the necessary lie that robert was out so she said she would call again this afternoon at three it is past three now said garth glancing at the clock all the better she may appear at any moment maxwell has my orders to show her in here and then and then i shall find out why a lady should call upon that miserable dog of a valet in the meantime touch the bell and have him in shall i question him if you please i wish to remain incognito robert answered the bell so promptly as to suggest the probability that he had been stationed at the keyhole his face however was as vacant and miserable as ever so even if he had overheard fanks did not think that he had sufficient brains to be dangerous the valet waited mutely for orders with a cowed look on his face and rubbed one lean hand over the other he was an uncomfortable creature in every respect robert said garth in as mild a tone as was possible i was authorised by the police to look over my cousins papers i have done so with the assistance of mr rixton and we have made several discoveries yes sir said the man moistening his dry lips do you know taxtononthames no sir i never heard of it startled by this calm denial fanks bent forward to observe the mans face he was satisfied by a glance that robert had spoken the truth he had never heard of taxtononthames this discovery puzzled the detective did your masteryour late masterknow of it he interpolated not that i am aware of sir he never mentioned the name to me robert said garth solemnly you denied some time ago that sir gregory was entangled with a woman think again and answer truly robert shifted from one foot to the other and looked uneasily at his questioner then he made an evasive reply sir gregory was connected with no woman at the time of his death he said doggedly that may be but was he connected with a woman in the valet started back with a gasp how did you hear of that he asked shaking in every limb i heard it from no one but i guessed it from this picture with a sudden movement he thrust the photograph under the eyes of the pale and trembling creature after one glance robert recoiled with an ejaculation of horror and covered his face with his hands expecting revelations fanks waited and watched come said garth quietly i see that you recognise the woman her name if you please iipromised never to speak of her you mustfor your own sake i dare not let me go mr garth he broke away from the lawyer but before he could reach the door he was in the grip of fanks come robert said the latter soothingly you must make the best of a bad job i know that you were devoted to your master at the same time he is dead and it is necessary that the mystery of his death should be cleared up on the whole added fanks looking into the eyes of the servant i think it advisable that you should confess the woman you speak of had nothing to do with the death of my master i am not asking you that i am inquiring her name answer the sudden imperiousness in the detectives tone made roberts heart sink within him he was incapable of a prolonged struggle and forthwith answered with all submissiveness iidont know her real name what did she call herself emma calvert ah and what did you call her robert the valet looked at garth with a look of malicious triumph i called her lady fellenger he said slowly garth sprang up with a sudden exclamation but he was stopped by fanks who rapidly questioned the valet was emma calvert really and truly the wife of your master yes sir they were married quietly in a hampstead church she was in a dressmakers shop and my master was very much in love with her i heard that she was engaged to another gentleman but she threw him over and married sir gregory before they went to paris so rumour was right for once said garth shrugging his shoulders well whether gregory was married or single matters little to me i am not the heir it may matter a great deal to the case remarked fanks dryly perhaps robert you can tell me where emma calvert came from i do not know my master knew but he never told me lady fellenger did not speak of her past in my presence and where is she now dead she died in paris i see that you are telling the truth she died in how did she die i cant answer you burst out robert in a frenzy you will drive me mad night and day i have her dead face before me look at me he continued holding out his trembling hands i am a wreck of what i was once all through the death of emma calvert of lady fellenger the two listeners arose to their feet what dark mystery was connected with the death of this woman that could so move the man in searching for one murder had they stumbled upon another did she meet her death by foul play asked garth sternly no no i swear it was not that but she did not get on well with my master he wearied of her he neglected her she was very proud and impulsive and one night after a great scenesheshe well manwell sheshe destroyed herself great heavens cried garth confirmed in his worst fears suicide she drowned herself in the seine said robert in a low voice as he spoke a woman appeared on the threshold of the open door robert gave one look at her and raised his hands with a cry the dead he moaned retreating from the woman the dead returned to life i saw her laid out i saw her buried yet she is therethere and with a cry he fell on the floor in a fit the others made no attempt to assist him they were staring spellbound at the woman she was the original of the photograph which garth held in his hand chapter vii difficulties the woman who had caused this commotion stood in the doorway looking on in some surprise she was dressed in the semimasculine fashion now affected by the sexa serge gown short and smart in appearance a natty jacket of the same material worn over a black striped shirt and a tyrolean hat of brown felt her face was oval and waxen in its pallor her eyes of a dark blue and her hair black and luxuriant a look of determination was impressed on lip and eye but this gave place to an expression of surprise when she saw robert fall on the floor finally when her eyes met those of fanks she started and shrank back maxwell peered over her shoulder in gaping astonishment and for quite half a minute there was a dramatic pause it was broken by the woman who stepped forward and addressed herself to fanks you see how the sight of me terrifies this wretch she said pointing to the man on the floor you shall hear from other lips than mine how he treated his masters wife wait gentlemen till i bring up my friend to confront this man and with these extraordinary words she pushed back maxwell and disappeared quite believing that she spoke in all good faith fanks made no sign that she should be stopped indeed he was too dumbfounded by the strangeness of the situation to speak and he looked helplessly at garth that gentleman was if possible even more surprised than his friend the sudden appearance of the presumably dead woman at once alarmed and astonished them both and they knew not what to make of the matter do you believe that it is emma calvert asked garth who was the first to recover the use of his tongue emma calvert my friend well then lady fellenger if you prefer it it doesnt matter what we call her rejoined fanks with a shrug seeing that she is dead but she is not dead fanks again shrugged his shoulders and pointed to the photograph the card says that emma calvert is dead he remarked the valet says that emma calvert is dead how then can this living woman be emma calvert lady fellenger i cant explain said garth obstinately but i am sure of one thing that she is the original of this picture it would appear so said fanks looking puzzled and yetupon my word it is the most extraordinary thing i ever saw in life garth for once you see me at my wits end and thoroughly mystified wait fanks wait the explanation of this woman hear the story of her friend in the meantime let us revive this wretched creature he is in a kind of fit said fanks kneeling down and loosening the collar of the insensible man get some water garth and you maxwell go down and see if that woman and her friend are coming up we may as well see this business out these directions were obeyed and garth soon returned with a glass of water while fanksalways provided against emergenciesproduced a smelling bottle and a flask of brandy while thus employed they were interrupted by maxwell with a look of alarm on his face well said fanks sharply where is this woman and her friend i dont know about her friend sir but shes gone off fanks sprang to his feet gone off he repeated what do you mean what i say sir said the policeman doggedly i went down and could not see her i asked the constable at the door and he said as she had drove off in a hansom a look of mingled surprise and distrust settled on the face of fanks in a moment he guessed without much difficulty that the woman had tricked him and he felt small in his own estimation at having been so neatly baffled it was the most humiliating moment of his life attend to this man with mr garth he said roughly i shall see for myself and blaming himself for his simplicity he caught up his hat and took himself out of the chambers at the street door he looked up and down but ho could see no trace of the missing woman a constable loitered on the pavement some distance away and although he was a stranger to fanks the detective accosted him without the least hesitation this was less the time for considering than for acting every moment was precious every moment lessened the chance of tracking and discovering the woman fanks as a rule was one of the most selfcontained of men rarely losing his selfcontrol or cool temper but at this moment he could have sworn freely at his want of caution which had let a possible witness in the case slip through his fingers but he hoped that there was yet time to retrieve his fault officer he said walking quickly up to the constable did you see a lady come out of yonder door yes sir the policeman upstairs just asked me about her she went away in a hansom five minutes ago i see it drive off like mad were you near at hand just at her elber so to speak sir did you hear what address she gave the cabman what do you want to know for sir asked the policeman in a gruff way that is my business and not yours retorted fanks unused to being thwarted by members of the force i am fanks the detective and i am here on business quick man the address as maxwell had hinted that a detective was upstairs the policeman at once believed this statement and saluted respectfully she didnt give no perticler address but she jest said piccadilly promiscus what part of piccadilly demanded fanks hailing a hansom jest piccadilly and no more sir repeated the officer do you know the number of the cab no sir there werent no occasion of me to take it of course of course muttered fanks testily can you describe the hansom was there any particular mark by which i can recognise it well sir i did note as it had a red white and blue suncloth over the roof with a cabby as wore a white beaver so to speak that will do cried fanks jumping into the vehicle which had driven up which way did the cab turn to the right sir down piccadilly cabby cried the detective as the driver looked through the trap go down piccadilly and look for a hansom with a red white and blue suncloth its a sovereign if you catch it thats joe berners cab that is said jehu and drove off briskly with his fare in a fever of excitement fanks had enough to think about during that drive the material being amply supplied by the woman who had so cleverly tricked him what motive had brought this woman to fellengers chambers for what reason had she taken her departure so suddenly was emma calvert dead if so who was the woman who bore so extraordinary a resemblance to her if emma calvert were not dead and this was she why had she come to halfmoon street and why had robert fainted at the mere sight of her all these questions presented themselves to the mind of the detective and he found himself unable to answer any of them if he discovered the mysterious woman there might be a chance of explanation failing the woman there remained the valet but if the one was missing and the other was ignorant fanks knew not what he should do in so difficult a matter as it was the height of the season piccadilly was crowded with vehicles of all descriptions and the rate of progress was slow far very far ahead fanks thought that he could descry the noticeable suncloth described by the constable but of this he was not quite sure therefore he remained in his cab instead of alighting to make certain during a block caused by the congested state of the roadway it flashed into his mind that he had seen the womans face before he was doubtful if this was so and yet he had an uneasy feeling that it was the features of this unknown woman were familiar to him but as the americans say he could not fix her nohow it only remained for him to refresh his memory with a second glimpse but at present he saw no chance of getting one he despaired of finding the woman of whom he was in search the hansom showed no signs of moving on and finding that he could walk quicker than he could drive fanks paid his cabman jumped out and raced along the crowded pavement he saw a number of people whom he knew but paying no attention to these he rushed along intent on getting to his goal at length his exertions were rewarded for by the isthmian club he saw the wishedfor cab ahead it was turning into berkeley square and as the throng was thinner in the side street fanks secured another hansom with a likelylooking horse and followed in its wake it struck him that he might as well find out where the woman lived therefore he did not attempt to catch up but directed his driver to keep persistently on the trail it was his only chance of gaining his ends with so crafty an opponent then commenced a long long chase which cost fanks the best part of a sovereign he followed to oxford street thence emerged into regent street passed through piccadilly circus down to trafalgar square after proceeding along the strand the cabs dropped down arundel street to the embankment went up through northumberland avenue cockspur street waterloo place and again doubled the trail in piccadilly fanks began to weary of this interminable chase he wondered where this woman intended to stop still he held on in a dogged fashion determined to weary out his adversary whom he began to consider a foemanor rather a foewomannot unworthy of his steel he therefore kept up the chase on the doubled trail and to his surprise he found that the cab which he had so persistently followed turned up halfmoon street and stopped before the chambers of fellenger good lord said fanks to himself surely she has not been so great a fool as to come to earth again where she knows she will find me he was perfectly right in making this remark for when he jumped out and ran up to the first cab he found itempty fanks swore whereat joe berners grinned and it do serve y right said joe who was a surly person i never did old as young gents should persecute innocents g on wi y fanks recovered his temper on hearing this speech it was most humiliating to have followed an empty cab for so many miles but it was rather amusing to be accused of being a profligate when he was ardently bent on doing his duty the detective laughed although the joke was against himself the question of persecution will bear argument my friend he said in a laughing tone in the meantime perhaps you will tell me what you did with the young lady you picked up here why said mr berners she told me as you was after her for kisses an such like so she gives me a sov to mislead you she got out of my keb at the end of this street she did and told me to drive on an on for an hour or so while she got away i done that added joe with a grin an youve bin follerin a hempty keb ever since i went up to berkeley square you have acted according to your lights my friend said fanks when he realised how he had been tricked and i do not blame you all the same i am not a profligate but a detective lor said joe has she done anything sir what she has done is nothing to you can you tell me in which direction she went no i cant sir and i dont belve you i dont and so saying joe berners drove off in high dudgeon fanks made no attempt to stop him for he saw that the woman had defeated him and the only thing left for him to do was to retire with the best possible grace to this end he paid his cab shrugged his shoulders and went upstairs again since the woman had succeeded in escaping him the solution of the problem lay entirely with robert then a miracle on the way up to the chambers the memory of that face flashed across the mind of fanks ah he said with a start i remember now i saw that face in the crowd round the red star on the night of the murder chapter viii a mysterious parcel before fanks finally dismissed the matter of that futile chase he asked a question of his friend the constable did you notice said he if that young lady had a friend with her no mr fanks said the other promptly she was all alone humph i thought so meditated fanks as he ascended the stairs the accusing friend was a myth well i guess theres a vacancy for a fool and im elected ive lost her once but she wont escape me a second time taxtononthames isnt london the links of the chain which brought forth this remark were as followsthe postal mark on the envelope was taxtononthames the handwriting thereon was the same as that on the back of the photographto all appearance that of the missing womantherefore fanks thought that he might gain some information about her in the village the link of the writings connected her with the riverside town and by following such a clue he hoped to arrive at some knowledge of her identity with this resolution he entered the chambers and found robert restored to sensibility sitting on the sofa with garth and maxwell in attendance the latter looked up eagerly as the detective entered but fanks had no idea of letting an inferior into his methods of working and he dismissed him forthwith maxwell you can leave the room he said sharply and when the policeman had taken his departure he turned to garth and continued i lost her after all my friend she gave me the slip with singular dexterity that going down to bring up a witness was all bosh she told that story as a blind to get out of the room without suspicion but who is she asked garth at this tale of failure fanks smiled grimly and looked at the valet no doubt robert can tell us that he said significantly i think she is lady fellengeremma calvert said robert faintly that is all nonsense you told us distinctly that emma calvert was dead the inscription on the portrait affirms your statement how then can this living woman be the lady in question it might have been her ghost rubbish ghosts dont appear in the daytime and drive off in cabs moreover there are no such things as ghosts your explanation is weak robert try another story it is the best that i can give sir if she isnt emma calvert who is she that is what we wish to find out said garth you say that lady fellengerwhom you will persist in calling emma calvertis dead i saw her lying at the morgue sir declared robert passionately i saw her placed in her coffin i saw her buried and the earth heaped over her she is dead i swear that she is dead where is she buried in pere la chaise in paris fanks began twisting his ring you say that she destroyed herself he said had you anything to do with her death the man broke down and burst out weeping exculpating himself between his sobs i had nothing to do with her death he declared she was always a good mistress to me but my master treated her shamefully when he married her and first came to paris they were quite happy but sir gregory grew tired of her he grew tired of everyone and he began to neglect her for others she was very proud and she put up with it for a time at last she got angry at him and insisted that he should take her back to london and introduce her to his friends this he refused to do and he taunted her with having been in a shop he called her emma calvert even before me you are sure that she was his wife interrupted fanks i was present at the marriage myself sir it took place in a registry office she was his wife and lady fellenger sure enough but after some months he would not call her by that name he knew that she was proud added robert in a lower tone and i think he wished to drive her to her death i always said that he was a bad lot interposed garth in disgust he was not a good man sir but he was a good master to me but the end of it all was that one evening they had a terrible quarrel and in a fit of rage she ran out of the house i would have followed her but my master would not let me go when next i saw her she was lying dead in the morgue you think that she flung herself into the river i am sure of it sir her body was taken out of the seine my master seemed to feel her death terribly but all the same i think he was relieved that his marriage was at an end he got it put about in some way that the death was an accident and the body was buried in pere la chaise after that he made me promise not to tell anyone that he had been married and we returned to england that is all i know except that she has come back to haunt me fanks stood biting his fingers the servant was evidently in earnest and according to his story the illfated wife of the late sir gregory was dead and buried yet going by the likeness of the portrait to the woman who had vanished she was alive fanks had been engaged in several very difficult cases but they were all childs play compared to the intricacy of this problem he was at his wits end startled mystified while the valet wept and fanks thought garth broke the silence we are off the track he said roughly we are seeking to solve the mystery of my cousins death not to trouble about that of his unhappy wife it is all of a piece replied fanks the one death is connected with the other how i am unable to say at present in the face of it i can hardly bring myself to believe that emma calvert is dead robert swears that she is said garth with a shrug i do i do i swear it wailed the man i saw her buried the tones of the wretched creature were so heartrending that both his listeners believed that he spoke the truth the detective placed the portrait the pasteboard star and the envelope containing the slips of print in his pocket and beckoned to garth we can do no more good here he said in a low tone i must think out the matter by myself let us go away but robert i shall stay here sir said the servant rising mr vaud said that i was to stay here until sir louis fellenger came to town who is mr vaud demanded fanks oh he is fellengers lawyer explained garth quickly of the firm of vaud and vaud of lincolns inn fields i was wondering why my cousin had not come up to take possession of the property but it appears that he is ill was he not at the funeral yes and mighty bad he looked he must have taken to his bed since i suppose that not finding himself able to come he sent for mr vaud yes sir said the valet and mr vaud came here to find the police in possession so he told me to stay here quite right said fanks i shall see mr vaud myself before leaving the chambers fanks told maxwell to keep a sharp lookout on robert of whom he had some suspicion then with garth he went down slowly talking and thinking garth had asked him what was to be done next and he did not know what to say ultimately he declared that he would interview vaud why asked garth after a pause because if i do not see him he will see me i must explain why i wish the police to continue in possession of the dead mans chambers and also i want a letter of introduction to the new baronet i can give you that but i do not understand why you should wish to see him he can do no good i am not so sure of that responded fanks dryly and in any case i must tell him what i am doing as the heir he must be anxious to clear up the mystery of his cousins death i dont think hell trouble much replied garth doubtfully gregory and louis hated one another like poison they had not met for ten years why did they hate one another i dont know louis is a better man than gregory he was a scoundrel as you have heard an outandout scamp and something worse than a scamp said fanks but about this introduction are you on good terms with your cousin louis i dont like him answered garth after a pause he is a scientific prig all the same there is no illwill between us very good you can give me that introduction as soon as you like ill write it today and if you wish to see vaud the elder youll find him at lincolns inn fields a pleasant old gentleman of the outofdate school you emphasise the elder vaud is there a son yes a fellow of thirty or thereabouts he is the partner but he has been ill of late and has only returned from a tour of the world but i say hersham you know i shall call on him tomorrow said fanks and question him about the tattooed cross when shall i see you again call tomorrow night at my duke street chambers i may have some news for you about emma calvert about dr renshaw do you still connect him with the crime i connect him with dr binjoy and i connect dr binjoy with his negro servant and further i connect a black man wearing a green coat with brass buttons with the murder then you suspect that the servant of dr binjoy killed fellenger and that binjoy in the disguise of renshaw was at the red star to assure himself that his instructions had been carried out that is exactly what i dont mean then what are you driving at ask me the same question in five weeks and ill tell you will it take you all that time to find out the truth fanks laughed at the implied sneer i am no miraclemonger my dear sir he said i am groping in the dark and a mighty hard task it is i do not know in which direction to move at the present moment if only some thing would turn up likely to point out a path renshaw mrs boazoph and robert are all signposts but which to go by i really cannot say five weeks garth and then perhaps failure all this time they were still standing at the door at the foot of the stairs now fanks made a movement but before he could step on to the pavement he was aware that maxwell was coming down the stairs quickly in another moment he was at the elbow of his superior officer holding out a small packet wrapped up in brown paper fanks took it gingerly and examined it with a thoughtful look on his face well maxwell he said what is this i dont know sir said the breathless maxwell i guessed that you mightnt be far away so i took the liberty to come after you to give me this packet yes sir i found it a few minutes ago in the letterbox on the door ah said garth in a startled tone was it there last time you looked no sir not an hour ago it aint got no postmark or stamp and it is addressed to sir gregory fellenger said fanks ill open it and without further remark fanks did so therein was a morocco case when this was opened they saw lying on a bed of purple velvet a long and slender needle of silver garth would have picked it out but fanks stopped him with a shudder dont touch it he said there is death here what do you mean i mean said fanks that i hold in my hand the poisoned needle with which your cousin was murdered chapter ix vaud and vaud here indeed was food for reflection that the instrument with which the crime had been committed should come into the detectives possession was extraordinary but that it should have been left anonymously at the rooms of the murdered man was inconceivably audacious fanks at once returned to the chambers and closely questioned maxwell and robert it struck him that the latter might have had a hand in placing the mysterious parcel in the letter box i examined the box an hour ago sir said maxwell as you told me to look after all letters there was nothing in it then it must have been placed in it since while we were in the sittingroom no doubt said garth do you know anything of this robert i sir lord no sir i never set eyes on it before we left ten minutes ago remarked fanks what have you been doing since that time i have been with mr maxwell sir was he with you all the time maxwell yes sir replied the policeman in great alarm he came out into the kitchen and we was together for a chat then i thought it was near post time and i goes to the box i found that parcel and as i knowed you couldnt be far off i ran down stairs this explanation was perfectly satisfactory yet for the life of him the detective could not help looking at robert with suspicion however as he had not been out of maxwells company he could not possibly have put the parcel in the box therefore fanks was reluctantly compelled to believe in his innocence that will do he said at length and drew garth away when they again descended the stairs garth began to ask him questions but fanks cut these short i must be alone to think it out he said in apologetic explanation go away garth and let me puzzle over the matter by myself the young lawyer was unwilling to do this as he was filled with genuine curiosity concerning the needle however he could suggest nothing and he saw that his mere presence worried his friend he therefore obeyed the request and went off to meditate on his own account as for fanks he repaired to his rooms and with the needle before him he sat for considerably over an hour thinking what it all meant the mystery was deeper than ever there was no doubt that someone had left the parcel in the letter box within the hour according to maxwell it had not been there when he last looked in according to robert he had not been out of the policemans company since he left the sittingroom who then placed this damning evidence of the crime in the box the assassin himself but the assassin as had been proved clearly was a negro a few questions to the constable stationed near the door had elicited the fact that no negro had gone up in fact the man had sworn that he had seen nobody ascend the stairs since the time fanks returned from his unsuccessful pursuit so scanty were the facts which he had to go on that fanks could not even build up a theory he was completely in the dark and he seemed likely to remain so the instrument was of silver the length of a darning needle and while the point was as sharp as a lancet it broadened gradually till when it passed into a slim ebony handle it wasfor a needle quite bulky in this broad part the poison was doubtless contained and thence it oozed drop by drop to the deadly point fanks shuddered at the sight of the piece of devilish ingenuity the infernal dexterity of the thing gave him an idea must have been manufactured by a scientific man he mused touching the slender silver line gingerly its too clever for an amateur louis the new baronet is a man of science he has succeeded to the title can it be thatbut no he added breaking off abruptly he would not commit a crime in so obvious a fashion much less leave the means he used at the address of his victim nevertheless the idea lured him so far afield into so many speculations that finding they led to nothing he locked up the poisoned needle put it out of his thoughts and paid a visit to new scotland yard here he explained to the person in authority that while he had every hope of capturing the assassin of the late sir gregory fellenger yet he was bound to point out that the expenses of the case would be considerable to this the person in authority replied by placing before fanks a letter from messrs vaud and vaud of lincolns inn fields it stated that they had been directed by sir louis fellengerwho was at present confined to bed through illhealthto assure the authorities that he wished every effort to be made to discover the murderer of his cousin and that he would willingly bear the costs of the investigation this communication concluded by requesting that the detective in charge of the case should call at the offices of the lawyers at his earliest convenience very meritorious of sir louis to save the government expense said the person in authority use what money you require mr fanks but be reasonablebe reasonable i shall be as reasonable as i possibly can be sir replied fanks but in my opinion the case will be both long and expensive it is the most complicated matter that i ever took in hand the more difficulty the more glory said the person in authority go on with the case mr fanks act as you please make use of all our resources i have every confidence in you mr fanks if anyone can lay his hand on the assassin of sir gregory fellenger you are the man i wish you good day mr fanks dismissed in this gracious manner fanks left the room with the intention of obeying forthwith the injunction of vaud and vaud before he could depart he was intercepted by crate a communication from dr renshaw said crate with an air of great importance he called here this afternoon with the intention of seeing you in your absence he saw me and stated that he was leaving for india tonight by the p and o steamer oceana before leaving he wished to see and speak with you before leaving he has to see and speak with me retorted fanks coolly i would have him arrested on suspicion if he attempted to leave london without according me an interview you have no evidence on which you can arrest him mr fanks i have more evidence than you are aware of crate if dr renshaw could have defied me he would have done so but he dare not where is he now he is still at great auk street where he has been watched ever since the night of the murder when does the oceana leave the docks tonight at ten oclock dr renshaw goes down from fenchurch street by the eight train it is now a quarter past five good i shall call at great auk street in the meantime i have to keep another appointment have you found out anything since i saw you last mr fanks i have found out that there is a woman in the case said fanks and that reminds me crate you must go to paris by tonights mail are you busy with anything else no mr fanks i shall be ready to start when you please what am i to do in paris fanks sat down at crates table and wrote a name and a date get me a certificate of the death and burial of emma calvert who died in paris last year she committed suicide which was passed off as an accident and was buried in pere la chaise i do not know the month of the death but you can do without that wire me all particulars you can get the french police to help you ask in the office here for necessary credentials and authorisation dont spare expense i have full power to draw all moneys i want after delivering these necessary instructions fanks drove off to lincolns inn fields and presented his card at the office of vaud and vaud he was at once shown up to the room of the senior partner and found him as garth said a dignified gentleman of the old school he was redfaced and whitehaired emphasised his remarks by waving a pincenez and spoke with some of the magnificence of dr renshaw this is a most lamentable business mr fanks he said when the detective was seated i usually go home before five oclock but in the interests of our client sir louis fellenger i remained on the chance of seeing you i am glad to see you i came as soon as i was able mr vaud but you only sent for me today i wonder you did not wish to see me before there was no necessity my dear sir we only heard from sir louis yesterday that he was prepared to bear all expenses connected with the investigation of the case sir louis is ill i believe mr vaud sir louis is never well sir said the lawyer impressively he is a delicate man and he is given over to the arduous science of experimental chemistry the earnestness with which he prosecutes his researches keeps him in a constant state of anxiety and his health suffers accordingly he is now at mere hall attended by dr binjoy is dr binjoy with sir louis at mere hall at this present moment certainly dr binjoy never leaves the side of sir louis he has the greatest influence over him though i must say added vaud that even the influence of the doctor could not prevent his patient rising from his sickbed to attend the funeral of the late baronet he must have been fond of his cousin said fanks pointedly on the contrary the cousins had not seen one another for ten years and more said mr vaud solemnly i do not wish to speak evil of the dead but the late sir gregory was certainly a butterfly of fashion while the present sir louis is a man of science they never got on well together and therefore kept out of each others way and very sensible too said fanks dryly do you happen to know if dr binjoy has been in london lately i happen to know on the best authoritythat of sir louisthat binjoy has not been in london for the last six weeks sir louis has been ill for that period the doctor has not left his bedside fanks made a mental note of this answer and turned the conversation in the direction of the crime you know that fellenger died from poison from bloodpoisoning corrected vaud so i saw in the papers a most remarkable case my dear sir what took our late client to that locality and why did he submit himself to the tattooing needle i cant say are you aware of any motive which might have induced the dead man to have a cross tattooed no sir as a matter of fact continued mr vaud the late sir gregory and myself were not on the best of terms he was extravagant and he resented my wellmeant advice i saw as little of him as of sir louis then you are not intimate with sir louis i cannot say that i am sir louis has led a secluded life at taxtononthames i have only seen him once or twice and dr binjoy i have never seen him at all was sir louis rich on the contrary he was very poor five hundred a year only well mr vaud said fanks rising i have to thank sir louis for his offer to bear the expenses of this case and i shall do my best to bring the criminal to justice have you any clue mr fanks i have a variety of clues but they all seem to lead to nothing do you think that you will be successful i cant sayyet i hope so i hope so too but i am doubtful very doubtful well good evening mr fanks do you want any money not at present i shall write to you when i do thats all right i trust you will succeed mr fanks but in my opinion you are wasting time and money the crime is a mystery and for all that i can see it will remain a mystery chapter x exit dr renshaw fanks had gained some useful information from the lawyer and it would appear that the conversation had settled at least two important points in the case of these the first was that sir louis could not have had anything to do with the commission of the crime or the leaving of the parcel at the chambers in half moon street yet the needle had been prepared by a man learned in experimental chemistry and as that was the special study of the new baronet it might be that he was responsible for the preparation of that deadly instrument by the death of his cousin he had gained a fortune therefore that might stand as a motive for the committal of the crime but sir louis had been ill for some months he had been confined to bed therefore he could not have been in london on the night of the murder nor later onbeing still in bedcould he have deposited the needle in the letter box clearly the case against louis broke down entirely as for binjoy he also had not been in town for six weeks if this were so he could not be identical with renshaw in which case the suspicions entertained by the detective could not fail to prove groundless then again the fact that binjoy had a negro servant habited like the assassinalso a black manwas highly suspicious binjoy might have instructed the negro to slay and himself have remained at taxtononthames in attendance on sir louis but then what could be his motive for the perpetration of so terrible a crime fanks sought for this motive in the first place he noted that the absence of louis from town on that night was deposed to by binjoy in the same way louis said that binjoy had not left taxtononthames for six weeks both these statements had been made to fanks by vaud it would then appear that louis and the doctor were in collusion to obtain the property of gregory by procuring his death at the hands of the negro but even this theory failed to discover or point out who was the man who had called to leave the parcel at half moon street the constable had asserted positively that no negro had gone up the stairs if then the messenger was not the negro it was either binjoy or sir louis mr vaud said that the one was ill the other in attendance thus the case stood when fanks left the office of vaud and vaud and he felt utterly unable to cope with the intricacies which met him on every hand there seemed no way in or out yet in the face of the presumption that renshaw was not the double of binjoy the detective determined to follow up that clue he did not like the way in which the doctor had behaved either in the chamber of death or at the inquest he was suspicious of his apparent intimacy with mrs boazoph therefore for his own gratification he went to great auk street to interview the man and to see whether his suspicions had any foundation in fact on arriving at the house he was unable to decide on his next action but before he left it again he had determined what to do a stupidlooking manservant received fanks and took him into a dull waiting room while he went to inform dr renshaw of the name of his visitor in a few moments he returned and conducted the detective to the back of the house where he found renshaw waiting for him in the company of another man this latter was dr turnor for whom renshaw had been acting as locum tenens a lean little man with a ferret of a face and a sharp jerky way of speaking which must have been exceedingly irritating in a sickroom renshaw was more imposing in looks than ever and with habitual restlessness combed his long brown beard with his fingers but in the badlylighted room fanks could not find out if the beard was false so closely did renshaw resemble garths description of binjoy that notwithstanding vauds evidence fanks was on the alert to discover ifas he truly believedthe two were one and the same the ensuing conversation was likely to prove interesting in more ways than one after being introduced to fanks and acknowledging the introduction with a sour smile turnor arose to leave the room he was stopped by renshaw who evidently did not relish the idea of facing a difficult interview by himself another proof as fanks considered of his uneasy conscience pray do not depart turnor he said in his usual pompous manner i have no secrets from you i trust mr fanks that you see no objection in my adopting this course certainly i see no objection replied fanks quietly let dr turnor stay by all means i have nothing particular to say turnor who had resumed his chair looked up at this and renshaw stared at his visitor with pompous indignation then why are you here sir he demanded in a more confident tone fanks shrugged his shoulders really i cannot tell you unless it is because you left a message at my office that you wished to see me i did so in fulfilment of my promise to communicate with you before leaving london indeed so you think of starting again on your travels you will like that much better than staying in london there is no reason why i should not like to stay in london said renshaw with an angry glance no reason in the world that i can see i am going out to indiato bombay i proceed to aden by the oceana and there i exchange into the cylde it is really very good of you to tell me all this doctor said fanks ironically i trust that you will have a pleasant voyage renshaw looked nonplussed and a trifle disappointed at the coolness of the detective it was fanks intention to bring about this feeling for if renshaw had nothing to do with the crime if he was not masquerading under a false name the detective did not see that it was necessary to make these elaborate explanations it seemed to fanks that renshaws anxiety to bestow gratuitous information as to his movements had its root in a design to mislead the police notwithstanding the assurances of vaud his suspicions of renshaw revived in full force under this clumsy diplomacy and he bent his energies to get to the bottom of the matter to this end he affected indifference and gave renshaw plenty of rope with which to hang himself am i to understand that i am free to go demanded the stout doctor in a highly dramatic manner i suppose so this is a free country you do not thinkmy friendany knowledgemurder jerked turnor as he looked eagerly at fanks the detective saw the eagerness and wondered hallo my friend he thought are you in this also however he answered the question in the calmest manner i was not aware that i had made any accusation against dr renshaw was his suave reply but i have been watched cried renshaw watched like a criminal you dont say so said fanks imperturbably and who is watching you and why have you been watched the two doctors looked at one another and from a covert sign made by turnor to renshaw the detective became convinced that there was an understanding between them he guessed that the sign hinted at the conclusion of the interview and this interpretation proved correct turnor rose and jerked out an apology mistake said the little man told renshawmoonshineno watching hope youll catchmurderer i have little hope of that said fanks dolefully he has concealed his trail too cleverly and he chuckled inwardly as he saw the two faces brighten well well well we will say no more mr fanks said renshaw in a patronising tone i deemed it my duty to let you know that i go to india tonight i shall not return to england for many years as i propose exploring thibet good evening i am delighted that my fears that i was being watched have proved to be groundless but fanks was not to be got rid of so easily he wished to ask turnor a few questions for he believed that the little man knew all about this mysterious renshaw however he made his examination carefully as he did not wish to startle the pair but rather to lull their suspicions so that he might the more easily carry out his plans he had already decided upon his next step you were not in london at the time of the murder dr turnor he asked no replied the doctor promptly if i had been i should have been summoned by mrs boazoph as it was renshaw went yes i saw renshaw said fanks and i believe that he was right in his theory that the crime was due to a secret society what makes you agree with my theory said renshaw quickly well drawled fanks keeping an eye on both men you see i cant find out the meaning of that tattooed cross it must be the work of a society else it would not have been obliterated if i could only find out what that cross means i would hang someone renshaw wiped the perspiration off his bald forehead and laughed in an uneasy manner i wish i could help you he said but i know nothing about the cross or the society and what do you say dr turnor nothingwas away on that night read about crosspapers queer fanks saw plainly enough that the pair were on their guard and that there was nothing more to be got out of them the only thing to be done was to watch and wait the progress of events with this idea he said goodbye and took his departure once outside and he made up his mind that renshaw should be tracked his anxiety to show that he was leaving england appeared to be suspicious and fanks concluded that he did not intend to go as he had so emphatically declared i shouldnt be surprised to find that he was binjoy after all thought the detective he professes a deal too much and his friend turnor is a deal too eager i shouldnt wonder if the pair were in league however i have thrown them both off their guard now ill play my own game ill find out the owner of that silver needle yet and then ill punish its owner i wonder added fanks with a silent laugh i wonder whether the criminal will prove to be black or white with this peculiar remark he went in search of the detective whose duty it was to guard the house and rated himself severely you have let yourself be seen said fanks have you not more sense than to play the fool keep yourself out of sight remain here until i send another watcher and report yourself at the yard the detective much abashed tried to exculpate himself but fanks would not listen to his excuses he hurried to new scotland yard picked out a smart man and instructed him to relieve the disgraced watcher and to follow renshaw to the docks and then sir asked the man then if renshaw goes on board the steamer you will report the fact to me without loss of time am i to come back here mr fanks no i shall be at the docks in disguise if you see a clergyman holding a white handkerchief in his right hand you will see me if you are doubtful ask the clergyman what the time is and you will be safe as to my identity off with you and send that fool back to mr crate what are you about to do mr fanks asked crate when the man had gone learn if renshaw is lying or not ill see if he boards the steamer at the docks and find out if he has taken a passage to bombaya fact which at present i am much inclined to doubt and if he goes on board the steamer in that case ill follow him as far as plymouth to make sure that he does not get off there if he doesnt i shall know that he has nothing to do with this murder and if he does get off at plymouth why said fanks rubbing his hands i shall track him to mere hall in hampshire crate looked astonished for he could by no means follow the thoughts of his superior how do you know that he will go there he demanded in a disbelieving manner because if dr renshaw leaves the steamer at plymouth under that name i shall find him at mere hall as dr binjoy chapter xi another link in the chain true to his appointment garth called the next evening at the chambers in duke street only to find that fanks was absent and that a note was awaiting him dear garth wrote the detective i have been called unexpectedly out of town and shall not return for at least three days visit me at the expiration of that time and prepare yourself for a surprise a surprise said garth to himself as he departed i wonder if he has found out about emma calvert and if his discovery has anything to do with the death in tooleys alley think as he might he could find no answer to this question and he was forced to restrain his curiosity until such time as fanks should return in the meantime out of curiosity he called upon mr vaud to learn what that gentleman thought about the position of affairs mr vaud thought nothing about them a detective had charge of the case and in mr vauds opinion it would be better to wait the solution by him of this criminal problem all this as well as much more was expressed to garth by the pompous lawyer and i should advise you mr garth he concluded not to let this unhappy episode divert your energies from your business as to that i have precious little to do retorted garth with some heat you do not put much in my way mr vaud i am always hard up i am aware of that replied vaud ignoring the beginning of the speech and i am aware also that our late client assisted you several times because i was necessary to him said garth bitterly and ill tell you what mr vaud had i known then what i know now about my cousin i should never have accepted his help oh dear me said mr vaud quite so sir gregory had many faults but are you a saint yourself mr garth i dont pretend to be one still i never drove a woman to her death do you know what you are saying mr garth do you know the name of emma calvert mr vaud the lawyer paled and pushed his chair from the table ii haveheard thename he stuttered then you have heard the name of a very injured woman mr vaud before the other could reply a knock came to the door and immediately afterwards it opened to admit a tall and handsome young man he bowed to garth and placed some papers before mr vaud will you please excuse this intrusion father and look over these he said quietly my son herbert mr garth said the elder vaud and again the young man bowed he rather resembled his father in appearance but there was a sternness about his manner which was wanting in that of the elder gentleman he was darkhaired and clean shaven with thin lips and a compressed mouth there was a look of resolution and hard work about him which did not recommend his personality to pleasureloving garth however the latter bowed and smiled when introduced and scribbled on a sheet of blottingpaper while herbert spoke to his father still thinking on the subject of his discourse with mr vaud he absently wrote the name of emma calvert young vaud moved near him while looking for a special paper and in doing so his eye fell on the name with an ejaculation he drew back and turned as pale as his father had done what do you know of emma calvert he demanded abruptly why do you write down her name herbert said the father warninglyalmost imploringly i shall speak said herbert his composure replaced by intense excitement what do you knew of emma calvert sir garth looked up surprised i know as much as robert the valet of fellenger could tell me a scamp who served a scamp muttered the young man sir gregory was my cousin mr herbert then your cousin was a scoundrel mr garth herbert leave the room said his father sternly the son looked defiantly at his father and turned away without a word at the door he paused and addressed garth i know that your cousin was murdered mr garth he said savagely i am glad that he met with such a death he escaped me but he could not escape punishment i hated sir gregory and i bless the man who killed him he left the room and in dumb astonishment garth turned to the elder vaud for an explanation the old man had buried his face in his hands but he looked up when garth touched him and groaned aloud i am sorry you wrote down that name mr garth he said at length its effect on my unfortunate son is always terrible but for what reason i did not intend to tell you but as you know so much you may as well know all herbert was in love with this girl he wished to marry her and it was he who introduced her to sir gregory you can guess the rest i can guess that my cousin married the girl and took her to paris where he neglected her and drove her to suicide i know about the marriage said mr vaud i am glad that sir gregory did her that justice i also know of the death sad very sad she must have been a pretty girl to have so strongly attracted two men i never saw her said vaud i did not even know that herbert was in love with her until she eloped with sir gregory then my son came with his broken heart and told me all he would have followed sir gregory to paris but that he fell ill of brain fever afterwards he was ordered on a sea voyage and returned only six weeks ago he heard of the death of lady fellenger in paris and did he know that fellenger had married her afterwards not at first he discovered all about the marriage and death in paris how i do not know but he came back broken in health and heart he will never be the same man again and whenever the name of emma calvert is mentioned the consequences are as you see garth rose to go it is a cruel story he said sadly but fellengers sins have come home to him in a terrible fashion goodbye mr vaud then garth took his leave and withdrew to meditate on the villainy of his cousin which had ruined two lives halfway along the strand he was struck by a sudden thought if young vaud had known and loved emma calvert he would be the man to identify the woman who had presented herself at fellengers chambers he believed emma calvert to be dead brought face to face with the missing woman and he would see that she was alive though it will be difficult to find that woman he said resuming his walk she has given us the slip still she may call to see robert again and he is being watched by maxwell so the chances are that we may find out whether she is my cousins wife or her ghost if she is confronted with herbert vaud we may arrive at the truth but will the truth lead to the detection of gregorys assassin i doubt it he thought of calling upon herbert and telling him about the appearance and flight of the presumedly dead woman but the same reason which had prevented him from seeing hersham prevented this visit no he said resolutely i must interview fanks and ask his advice the matter is too difficult for me to handle alone having come to this sensible conclusion he went about his daily business and postponed moving in the matter until the return of fanks from his mysterious journey his appointment had been for the previous night and fanks had asked him to wait three days as he had employed one day in seeing mr vaud he thought that he would utilise the second by interviewing mrs boazoph for this purpose he called at the red star but he was disappointed mrs boazoph the barmaid informed him was out of townon business garth left tooleys alley in a meditative mood fanks has gone to the country on business mrs boazoph has gone to the country on business i wonder if the same errand takes them there nothing further transpired and on the evening of the third day garth presented himself at dukestreet fanks was within and received him in the most amiable manner garth noted that his friend looked weary and ventured an opinion that fanks had made a long journey that day you are about right said fanks indicating a seat i only got back three hours ago from hampshire you have been to mere hall i have been in the neighbourhood of mere hall and i have also been to plymouth he added after a pause what have you been doing there following our friend renshaw alias binjoy you dont mean to say that the two are one cried garth jumping up i do and i can prove it by the clearest evidence you ever heard in your life sit down and listen garth resumed his seat and leaned forward with much curiosity to hear the promised recital it was well worthy of an attentive hearing i told him that i suspected renshaw to be binjoy in disguise said fanks your description of the one fitted the other in many respects and the eagerness with which renshaw tried to impress me with the fact that he was going to india roused my suspicions i determined to see for myself if he was really leaving england so i disguised myself as a parson and went to the docks renshaw had been followed there by my emissary and he duly went on board the p and o steamer oceana assured of this i dismissed the watcher and took up the running to plymouth but how about your passage oh i fixed that up all right how i need not stop to explain you may be sure that i kept a watch on our friend and confident in my disguise i tried to get speech with him this was impossible as he remained in his berth the whole time i discovered however that his passage was booked to bombay exchanging at aden into the clyde at plymouth he feigned to be so ill as to be unable to proceed further on his journey and rather than do so he forfeited his passage money and got off then he did not go to india after all my dear sir he had no intention of going to india i followed him ashore and then i am sorry to say that i lost him it is not creditable to my intelligence said fanks shrugging his shoulders what did you do the best i could i saw the local police and had the railway stations and boats watched he could not leave plymouth either by land or water without my knowing it to make a long story short i was informed that a stout gentleman somewhat like my man was awaiting a train at a certain station i went there and you saw renshaw interrupted garth indeed no i saw a cleanshaven man much younger in appearance than dr renshaw and dressed differently from your description i recognised him as binjoy and to clinch the matter i followed him to mere hall then you are certain that renshaw is binjoy positive i made inquiries in the village and i was informed that sir louis was ill and that binjoy was attending him of course i said nothing for to tell you the truth i did not know what to say but you will observe garth that i have proved that these two men are one and the same and the negro did you see binjoys negro servant i inquired about him and i was informed that binjoy had brought no negro servant with him no doubt he left him behind at taxtononthames then my idea is correct said garth the negro committed the crime at the instigation of binjoy and binjoy in the disguise of renshaw went to the red star to see that it was accomplished now he has got rid of the negro and of his disguise so cutting off every trace of his connection with the crime a very plausible theory said fank shaking his head but the motive motive why binjoy wanted louis to inherit the property he has a great influence over louis what would benefit the one would benefit the other oh depend upon it fanks it is as i say no said fanks there is a third person in it a woman emma calvert mrs boazoph oh come now she is out of town on business i know that and her business was at mere hall in hants i saw her there chapter xii the intervention of chance it was a moment or so before garth could quite grasp the fact of this new intrusion of mrs boazoph into the case when he did so he remarked that she had no doubt gone to mere hall to see louis fellenger fanks dissented in my opinion she went to see binjoy for what reason i cant tell you it must be a powerful reason which would make this woman seek out binjoy when he had so carefully destroyed his connection with renshaw but i have long had my suspicions of mrs boazoph she removed the dead body she answered my questions in a hesitating manner and attempted to exculpate herself without being requested so to do also she got rid of the grains of gunpowder all these things show that mrs boazoph knows more about the matter than she chooses to tell do you think that she knows who committed the crime i wouldnt swear to that said fanks with some hesitation but she must have identified renshaw with binjoy else she would never have sought out the latter at mere hall do you believe that mrs boazoph inveigled fellenger to her hotel by means of that advertisement and then had him killed how can i tell retorted fanks you know as much about the matter as i do but i will do mrs boazoph the justice to say that i hardly believe she would adopt a course so dangerous to herself i do not think that she had anything to do with the advertisement the envelope was addressed in a womans handwriting no doubt but the handwriting may not be that of mrs boazoph still she is in some way connected with binjoy and he is mixed up in the crime you mean that he employed the negro to commit it it looks like it and yet continued fanks with a frown the evidence is too clear for me to take that view why the clearer the evidence the more certain you must be of the truth fanks shook his head from my experience i am inclined to doubt easilyobtained evidence everything points to the committal of the crime by the negro servant of binjoy and for that reason i do not care to accept it it would seem that in case of trouble mrs boazoph and binjoy had provided for their own safety by throwing suspicion on the negro but one thing is clear enough said garth impatiently the negro killed my cousin a negro killed your cousin but not necessarily the negro of binjoy garth looked puzzled i am more in the dark than ever he said same here garth depend upon it this murder is no bungling affair it is a cleverlyplanned and cleverlyexecuted scheme carried out by people who know what they are doing as the case now stands i cannot see my way the evidencein my opinionleads to nothing if crate had this matter in hand he would arrest binjoy on suspicion and hunt for the negro servant as the supposed murderer and by doing so he would make a mess of the whole business i shall arrest nobodyat present save to yourself and perhaps crate i shall give my opinions to nobody i shall watch and wait put two and two together and when they make four i shall pounce on the assassin it will take time and patience and money but as i said before the case is a delicate one we are dealing with people who are as clever and cleverer than we are i confess that the outlook is anything but promising concluded fanks with a sigh you cannot guess who committed the crime no i cannot to all appearances it was the negro butand this is the main pointwas it the negro of binjoy and would the negro be clever enough to conceive so subtle a method of committing a crime as the mode of the poisoned needle again would a negro be in possessiondied of such information as would induce fellenger to permit the use of the needle the whole mystery lies in that cross tattooed on the arm when i discover its meaning i shall be able to name the assassin then why not see hersham suggested garth he has a similar tattoo mark on his left arm he may be able to tell you what you wish to know i have an appointment with hersham at his rooms tomorrow i may learn something from him on the other hand i may learn nothing and what about emma calvert oh i shall find out about her at taxtononthames i may discover dead lady fellenger of paris alive at the surrey village under another name and yet added fanks producing a paper crates report proves that the woman died in paris in and was buried in pere la chaise if that is so who was the woman who appeared so strangely the evidence of the photograph and the valet both prove that she is emma calvert i can only surmise that she did not die but that either knowingly or unknowingly some woman was buried in her place it is the only explanation that i can give yet for all i know emma calvert may have employed that negro to kill her wicked husband it is a wild theory said garth why should this woman the lawful wife of my cousin pretend to be dead and submit to have her identity destroyed by the false burial if she is alive i can quite conceive that she should have my cousin killed out of revenge but why the pretended death whichto all appearanceswas acquiesced in by fellenger i cant answer that question until i wring the truth from robert there is no necessity for robert i have found another person who can tell you the truth oh said fanks looking up sharply and this person herbert vaud the son of the lawyer you saw the other day you dont say so exclaimed fanks eagerly you laugh at chance garth well here is another chance which may put us on the right track if we solve the mystery of emma calvert we may unravel the tooley alley enigma tell me all you know omit no detail begin begin flattered by the interest taken in his discovery garth related at great length the extraordinary conduct of young vaud the cause of such conduct as explained by the elder vaud and drew attention to the fact that if confronted with the missing woman herbert might be able to recognise her either as an imposter or as the dead emma calvert fanks listened with the closest attention nor did he venture a remark until garth had concluded his story then he drew a breath and reflected it is most extraordinary he said at length dare you disbelieve in chance chance led you to the office of the vauds chance made you scribble that name on the paper chance drew the attention of herbert vaud to the name i have always found that chance is my best friend all this is beside the point said garth impatiently what do you say your discovery may lead to something replied fanks cautiously i shall see herbert vaud after i have interviewed hersham between the two of them i may learn something likely to throw light on the darkness of this case but we are only on the threshold of our difficulties as yet garth rose to take his leave i agree with you he said the future looks anything but hopeful but i shall leave you now as you are tired after your long journey fanks stretched himself i am rather weary he remarked yawning and i shant be sorry to go to bed come and see me tomorrow and ill tell you how i get on with hersham and garth added fanks going to the door with his guest dont do any more detective business on your own account it will take me some time to exhaust the information you have brought me when i have arrived at some conclusion regarding this new evidence i shall tell you what to do garth was quite willing to be guided by fanks advice the more so as he was entirely at a loss how to proceed and was waiting for the more experienced head of the detective to guide him with quite sufficient to think about for the next twentyfour hours he took his departure and left fanks to enjoy a wellearned rest the appointment with hersham was for twelve oclock the next day and punctually at that time fanks took his way up to acacia road st johns wood where the journalist had his lodgings certainly not a very central position for a man engaged in the press but hersham had been brought up in the isle of wight beside the sea and amid green trees from the effect of early association he could not bear to be cooped up amid bricks and mortar where he could scarcely breathe therefore he had taken up his abode in a suburb where he was certain of fresh air he went to and fro between fleet street and st johns wood on his bicycle and thus by a little dexterity he managed to attend to his duties on the morning planet and yet to live a comparatively rural life when fanks arrived at noon hersham for healths sake was digging in the garden but on seeing the detective he came forward to greet his visitor he was a slender handsome young man of eight and twenty or thereabouts with curly brown hair and blue eyes he wore a moustache but otherwise he was cleanshaven usually his face was pleasant and smiling with a high colour and a genial expression on this occasion he was rather pale and there was an anxious look in his eyes which did not escape the detective he had seen the same expression in the eyes of binjoy how are you fanks said hersham with an obvious effort at lightness i see that you are punctual to the minute i am glad of that as i cant give you much time i have an engagement with my editor at onethirty oh i can explain my business in half an hour replied fanks lightly i wont take up more of your valuable time than i can help you were astonished to get my note frankly speaking i was said hersham with an uneasy look i cant conceive what you want to see me about i hope he added with a faint smile that it is nothing in your line of business that is just the point it is in my line of business to the surprise of fanks the young man gave a kind of gasp and without a word he turned and led the way into the house this behaviour was so different to his usual manner that fanks suspected trouble and with nothing but his incurable suspicion to go on he wondered if this agitation was in any way connected with the business he had come about in plain words with the tattooed cross and with the crime of tooleys alley the room into which hersham ushered the detective was a simplyfurnished apartment of a bright and cheerful character furniture carpet wallpaper and curtains were all of a light and pleasant complexion two dwarf bookshelves on either side of the fireplace were filled with wellchosen volumes while boxing gloves and foils on the walls showed that the tastes of the journalist were not exclusively literary excellent pictures adorned the walls and photographsmostly those of pretty womenwere ranged on the mantlepiece as a whole the room was remarkably bright and attractive in both of which respects it thoroughly reflected the character of its occupant with commendable hospitality hersham produced a bottle of whisky two glasses and a jug of water signing to fanks to help himself he sat in a chair near the window and waited for his apparently unwelcome visitor to speak fanks did not open his mouth and hersham looked up to see the cause of his silence the detective was staring at the photographs on the mantleshelfor rather he was gazing with astonished eyes at one portrait it was little wonder that he did so for the picture was that of the young woman who had appeared and disappeared so unexpectedly at the chambers of sir gregory fellenger in halfmoon street for once in his life fanks was rendered dumb with astonishment what are you staring at asked hersham sharply the detective pointed to the picture who is that young lady he asked in a tone of intense curiosity i dont see what business that is of yours replied hersham but to gratify your curiosity i may tell you she is the girl i am engaged to the girl you are engaged to is she alive of course she is said hersham half angry half amused why should she be dead do you know her have you seen her why do you ask i shall tell you that later on answered fanks but tell me is the name of that girl emma calvert i never heard of emma calvert retorted hersham crossly the name of that young lady is anne colmer of taxtononthames yes of taxtononthames chapter xiii the tattooed cross fanks was prepared for most surprises and from experience he was capable of controlling his emotions thoroughly in this instance however he was so overwhelmed by the unexpectedness of the discovery that it was some time before he could arrange his thoughts and plan of action the coincidence of the tattooed cross was extraordinary but the resemblance of the portraits was still more so before he could comment on the fact hersham asked an abrupt question why do you speak of these things he said anxiously and what do you know about miss colmer i know nothing about miss colmer replied fanks quickly hold on a minute my good fellow i have had what people call a turn hersham accepted this explanation with a doubtful air and pushed the spirits towards the detective accepting this attention fanks poured himself out a stiff glass a sip or two braced his nerves and set his brain to work so that shortly he was able to face the unexpected situation for obvious reasons he did not wish to reveal too much to hersham yet under the peculiar circumstances of the case he was forced to tell him a certain amount to gain his ends with the least possible risk to his plans he was reduced to manufacturing a plausible theory from the facts within his knowledge the task was one of some little difficulty but he succeeded fairly well in suppressing so much of the truth as he did not wish known that photograph took me by surprise hersham he said after a pause why should it take you by surprise said the other jealously have you ever met with miss colmer i have not met the lady replied fanks slowly but i have seen some one who greatly resembles her so greatly indeed that i thought the person i saw was the original of that photograph where did you see this person at parisin the morgue it seemed to fanks that hersham changed colour on hearing this but he kept his feelings under control and merely remarked in the morgue a case of murder no doubt no suicide by drowning afterwards i heard that the body was that of an english girl called emma calvert he purposely suppressed the fact of the marriage she is buried in pere la chaise under the namewhether true or not i cannot sayof calvert you cannot wonder that the sight of that picture which i took for that of the dead woman should startle me the more especially as you assure me that the original of that photograph is still alive and is engaged to you was it for this purpose that you came to see me demanded hersham no i came to see you about something else nevertheless before telling you the object of my visit i should like to have the mystery of the photograph explained how do you know that i can explain it perhaps you can perhaps you cant on the other hand perhaps you can and perhaps youwont hersham bit his lip and took a turn up and down the room he appeared to be on the verge of revealing something but checked himself when about to speak at this stage fanks wisely held his tongue and resolved to let hersham make the first remark evidently the young man had something on his mind and what the something was fanks was determined to find out but he left the mode of revelation entirely to his host hersham was aware of this and hesitated and faltered and frowned ultimately he resumed his seat and accepted the situation i have always looked upon you as a friend fanks he said in a hesitating manner and i have every reason to believe that you wish me well my dear fellow said fanks wondering what could be the reason of this appeal you are perfectly right i would do anything to prove my friendship for you then answer me candidly did you come here to ask me about that cross which you know is tattooed on my left arm yes said fanks unhesitatingly i did how did you guess my errand i read the report of the inquest on the body of fellenger and i remarked the fact of the poisoned needle and the tattooed cross i was informed that you had the case in hand i knew that you had seen the mark on my arm so when you wrote asking me to see you it was not hard for me to guess what you wanted you see i was right i congratulate you on your penetration my dear hersham replied fanks coolly at the same time i do not see what this speech has to do with your former one about friendship i can explain you asked me a question about that photograph and to answer it in a satisfactory manner i shall be forced to tell you something about the family of the girl to whom i am engaged does your explanation concern the late sir gregory fellenger yes it has a great deal to do with the late sir gregory and with emma calvert with the woman you call emma calvert ought i to say lady fellenger said fanks quickly hersham shrugged his shoulders that makes no difference to my explanation he said and rose to get the photograph off the mantelshelf you think that this is the picture of emma calvert for answer fanks produced the portrait he had found in fellengers rooms and showed it to hersham is this the picture of anne colmer he asked no that is emma calvert then these photographs are those of two different women certainly the one is emma calvert who committed suicide in paris the other is anne colmer who is alive and engaged to me fanks considered for a minute i now begin to see light he said in a sober tone am i right in assuming that emma is the sister of anne you are perfectly right she is the twinsister ah that accounts for the resemblance it does replied hersham with a nod the two sisters were so exactly alike that apart you could not tell one from the otherat least so i have been told oh then you never saw the two sisters together i did not i never saw emma in my life of course you know her sad story said fanks after a pause annes mother told it to me i know that emma married fellenger secretly and was driven to her death by his brutality now you can see why i reminded you of our friendship before telling you the truth no said fanks sharply i cant see why i am engaged to the sister of the dead girl so i thought that i might accuse you of killing sir gregory out of revenge well i did have that thought in my head and then the coincidence of the cross you know fanks laughed and took the hand of hersham my dear lad he said i have no idea of accusing you of the crime your engagement to miss colmer is no proof that you killed the man who acted so badly towards her sister do not therefore hesitate to tell me all you know how emma calvert came to london how she met with sir gregory and how she was loved by herbert vaud what cried hersham you know that also i know more than you think hersham therefore if you attempt to deceive me i shall find you out now go on with your story i do not want to deceive you replied the journalist but you must understand that i only speak from hearsay if you want the tale firsthand you must see old mrs colmer at taxtononthames hum said fanks remembering his theory regarding the directing of the envelope which contained the cardboard star what kind of a person is the lady in question an invalid said hersham promptly a paralytic she has not moved hand or foot for years confound it what is the matter nothing only your information has upset a theory never mind go on there isnt much to tell said hersham mrs colmer is a decayed gentlewoman whose husband died and left her with two little girls to support these she set up a dressmakers establishment at taxtononthames when the children grew up mrs colmer was smitten with paralysis and laid on the shelf anne and emma carried on the business and thus supported their mother emma came to london to gain experience in a fashionable dressmakers establishment and anne remained behind to look after the shop at taxtononthames while in london emma met with young vaud at the house of a friend of her mothers he fell in love with emma and wished to marry her she liked him but she did not love him nevertheless for her mothers sake she accepted his offer then in an unlucky hour herbert introduced fellenger to emma she loved him or was attracted by his title at all events she ran away with him to paris and became his wife she was married in a london office registrars i did not know that said hersham emma told her mother that she was married but she did not write where well young vaud had an attack of brain fever and afterwards he went on a sea voyage on his return he crossed to paris to learn what had become of emma he ascertained that she was dead and buried in some way he learned the whole miserable history vaud returned to england to see fellenger but before he could meet with him the baronet was killed in tooleys alley and the fate of emma was avenged by an unknown hand that is the story fanks you can make what use you like of it it is a wretched story replied fanks i can now understand the hatred which young vaud bears towards the memory of his false friend and i can understand also how i mistook anne for emma but added fanks with emphasis i cannot understand why anne came to the chambers of fellenger and why she ran away when she saw me hersham looked jealous and frowned i cannot understand that myself he said she hated fellenger as much as did herbert vaud and i do not know why she should go to the rooms of the scoundrel she asked for the valet robert the whimpering pitiful dog anne might have gone to see him to ask for particulars of her sisters death well yes replied fanks thoughtfully but that does not explain why she went away when she saw me i can only surmise that she did not wish to explain what brought her there and so tell the tale of her sisters death to a stranger no there is more in it than that said the detective remembering that anne had been among the crowd on the night of the murder but we will talk of this hereafter in the meantime let us return to the main object of my visit and show me this famous cross hersham made no objection to this request and removed his coat rolling up his sleeve he exposed the cross tattooed on the flesh of the left forearm it was a st catherine cross the size of a florin and fanks examined it long and carefully did you get that tattooed at school he asked when hersham had resumed his coat i did not get it done at all i have had it ever since i can remember and i have asked my father often about it but he cannot or will not give me any information he will not most probably are you sure that there is no story attached to the tattooing none that i know of but my father might be better informed would your mother know i have no mother she died when i was a baby strange muttered fanks pensively it is strange that you should have this mark on you and yet be ignorant of its significance i wish you would speak to your father about it he wont tell me anything i have asked him before you have no idea why a cross similar to this should have been tattooed on sir gregorys arm by a negro certainly not i did not even know sir gregory i wonder if your father could tell me i dont know he might or he might not do you think that this cross has anything to do with the murder you are investigating that is just what i do think retorted fanks the man was killed by means of a poisoned needle used to prick in a cross similar to that on your arm but that insinuates that i am mixed up in the matter it does nothing of the sort dont be an ass but hersham was not content with this friendly assurance you think that i have something to do with the crime he said obstinately fanks looked at his agitated face at his trembling hands and a strange suspicion entered his mind ill tell you what i do think he said in an abrupt tone i think that you have not told me all the truth hersham trembled still more and clasped his hands together i cannot he muttered shrinking away from fanks i dare not chapter xiv fanks makes up his mind naturally fanks was astonished at this confession but he was so conversant with the character of the young man that he could not believe the journalist was guilty despite the coincidence of the tattooed cross and the relationship of fellengers wife with anne colmer he did not think for a moment that his friend had anything to do with the crime nevertheless it would appear from the hesitation of hersham to speak openly that he had some knowledgeif not of the crime itselfat all events of the circumstances leading to its accomplishment this was the only construction he could place on this last outburst after what i have said hersham i think you ought to confide in me he remarked after a pause i do not suspect you in any way yet you refuse to aid me you ought to be the first to help me i do not see how you make that out replied hersham with a pale face i never met with sir gregory i heard nothing but evil of his life and he drove to suicide the sister of the girl to whom i am engaged why should i help you ah cried fanks sharply then you can help me if you choose i certainly cannot returned hersham doggedly i have not the slightest idea who killed fellenger i can tell you nothing yes you can only you refuse to why i cannot say you had better be careful hersham you will not find me easy to deal with if you rouse my suspicions do you threaten me i warn you retorted fanks smartly i am not accustomed to have my offers of help repelled your remark of a few moments ago shows me that you know something what is it i know nothing you do speak if not for your own sake at least for that of miss colmer hersham stepped up to fanks with an angry face how dare you introduce the name of miss colmer he cried i forbid you to speak of her all the worse for you and forher she called at the chambers of the dead man why did she call there she was at tooleys alley on the night of the murder what was she doing in such a place you refuse to tell me i shall ask her hersham sprang forward and grasped the arm of fanks to prevent his leaving the room think of what you are about he gasped ask her nothing you hear me nothing that rests with yourself tell me what you know and i know nothing said hersham and turned away with an obstinate look good said fanks putting on his hat we now understand one another i shall find out all without troubling you goodbye and you may thank your stars that i do not arrest you on suspicion i swear that i am innocent i know that else i would have had you in custody by this time but you are screening another person anne colmer for instance she knows nothing i shall judge of that for myself retorted fanks and left the room in acacia road the detective hailed a cab and drove to the nearest telegraph office it had occurred to him that hersham might attempt to communicate with anne and he was resolved to checkmate such a move to this end he sent a wire to the head of the rural police at taxtononthames instructing him to delay if possible all letters and telegrams which might come to miss colmer thereby he hoped to prevent hersham warning the girl arriving at new scotland yard he detailed a man to watch hersham and sent him up to acacia road a glance at bradshaw assured him that to reach taxtononthames hersham would have to start from waterloo thither he sent another detective to keep an eye on the trains therefore by letter by telegram and by railway he had stopped hersham from communicating with anne colmer after taking these precautions he saw crate i am going to taxtononthames at three oclock he said are you going to look for the woman who directed the envelope mr fanks fanks stretched out his legs and began fiddling with his ring that is just what is puzzling me crate observed he i have told you of my conversation with mr hersham well unless he is deceiving me mrs conner is a paralytic she could not have directed that envelope yet going by the writing ill swear that an elderly woman penned the address if not mrs colmeran obvious impossibilitywho wrote it anne colmer said crate promptly no for disguise she would rather have adopted a masculine hand mrs boazoph if mrs boazoph had been traced to taxtononthames i should say yes if the letter had been sent from mere hall i should have said yes but added fanks with emphasis as it did not come from mere hall and mrs boazoph has nothing to do with taxtononthames i am not inclined to suspect the lady then there is nobody else there must be somebody else and the somebody else committed the crime crate thought do you think that the negro sent that star he asked i feel perfectly certain that the negro had nothing to do with the star but we have proved conclusively that a negro killed fellenger fanks smiled complacently i should not be at all surprised if we found out that a negro had nothing to do with the murder he said slowly but that is impossible mr fanks nothing is impossible in a criminal case said fanks look here crate as you know it is not my habit to give an opinion before i have thoroughly threshed out the subject matter of a case but in this instance i shall depart from my rule i should not be surprised if i had already spotted the assassin of sir gregory fellenger no cried crate in admiration and who is it mr fanks man or woman walls have ears crate i shall whisper the name and when the case comes to an endif it ever doesyou can laugh at me or congratulate me at your will now then fanks approached his mouth to the ear of crate and whispered a single name that is my opinion he said slowly crate shook his head no mr fanks i am loth to put my opinion against yours but i think you are making a mistake perhaps i am assented fanks carelessly the case is a difficult one and i am quite prepared to find out that i am wrong all the same i am confident that the person i named is guilty ill bet you five pounds to five shillings that i am correct crate grinned and took up the bet the behaviour of his chief flattered him and he would not have minded losing but he could not bring himself to agree with fanks as to the name of the guilty person for he had a theory of his own in which he believed this theory was diametrically opposed to that of his superior how long shall you be at taxtononthames he asked fanks when this little piece of amusement was concluded i may be a few days a few hours or a month it all depends on what i find out i must interview anne colmer see her mother and make inquiries about binjoy and his negro servant but the doctor is at mere hall you must go there to ask about the negro rubbish as i told you before the negro has never been seen at mere hall binjoy lived at taxtononthames and it is there that i must ask after this mysterious black man afterwards i can go to mere hall have you any reason for going one i wish to find out why mrs boazoph visited the hall and what about the tattooed cross mr fanks oh i shall see that later on but in the meantime i must pay these visits firstly taxtononthames secondly mere hall thirdly the isle of wight and the rev mr hersham humph said crate doubtfully from what you say i should think mr hersham junior would thwart your plans if he could i have not the least doubt of it replied fanks dryly but he is being watched if he tries to thwart me i shall at least have the satisfaction of knowing it by the way do you know anything about bombay thats in india isnt it said crate rather taken aback by the apparent irrelevancy of this question i dont know anything about bombay mr fanks except what ive seen in books you must extend your knowledge then for i may want you to go there in a week or so has my going there anything to do with this case demanded crate still very much astonished at the turn the conversation had taken it has everything to do with this case replied fanks enjoying his perplexity and the confusion of his somewhat slowmoving mind dr renshaw did not go to india was crates next remark quite so renshaw having resumed his real name of binjoy is now at mere hallin safety as he thinks i can lay hands on him any time but i cant lay hands on that negro you must do that crate but the negro isnt in india mr fanks in my humble opinioni may be wronghe is replied the other see here crate dr binjoy must know that as i am employed by sir louis to hunt down the assassin i must see him sooner or later if i see the new baronet i can hardly help seeing his fidus achates now although binjoy hasas he thinksdestroyed all trace of his connection with renshaw yet he cannot quite alter his personal appearance which is rather noticeable he may shave off his beard so as to make himself look younger he may even get rid of his stoutness but he cannot alter his voice or entirely change his pompous manner he must therefore guess that i may be struck with his resemblance to renshaw in some wayfor i give him the credit of being cleverhe will endeavour to account for the resemblance i do not know the particular lie he will stick to but of one thing i am certainhe will keep up the deception that renshaw is in india by means of prepared letters written to dr turnor it is my opinion crate continued fanks solemnly that binjoy has got rid of his negro servant by sending him to bombay and from bombay the negro will forward lettersalready writtento turnor of great auk street i may be wrong of course and i do not wish to act in a hurry but the first letter i see from india purporting to be from binjoyrenshaw that very day you start for bombay to look for the negro who is at present missing i am content to stake my professional reputation that you will find him there well you are a cute one mr fanks said crate in an admiring tone i should never have thought of that this tribute of respect from crate put an end to the conversation for the time being fanks went to his chambers packed a few clothes and repaired to waterloo station the detective who was watching there assured him that hersham had not been seen on the platform and fanks went down to taxtononthames quite satisfied that he had what the americans call the inside running he amused himself while in the train by making notes in his pocket book and with figuring out the questions which he intended to ask miss colmer notwithstanding his assurance to crate he was very doubtful if he would be able to discover the assassin of sir gregory for the further he went into the case the more intricate did it become so far as he could see at the present moment the person who had killed the tooley alley victim had every chance of escaping the gallows all that the detective could do was to go on in the darkness and trust to any stray gleam of light which might reveal the assassin but at present he could not see an inch ahead of him on arriving at taxtononthames he drove at once to the local post office and as he expected he there found a telegram which the police had succeeded in delaying it was addressed to anne colmer and ran as follows detective coming answer him nothing there was no name but from the context and the place whence it had been senthigh street st johns woodfanks had no difficulty in guessing that it had come from hersham very good he murmured what hersham knows the girl knows i failed to get the information from him i may from her chapter xv coming events the colmers mother and daughter dwelt at the further end of the village in a cottage adjoining the shop the former was small but the latter was quite an imposing structure for so sparselypopulated a neighbourhood indeed its owners made an excellent income out of the dressmaking business and they were fairly comfortable in the position of life into which they had been forced by circumstances they employed five or six girls in the workroom and three in the shop so that anne found her hands full in looking after these underlings and in supervising the general run of the business she was an admirable administratrix as may be guessed from the nature of her complaint mrs colmer was a mere cypher in the domestic economy of briar cottagefor so the house was named the old woman usually sat in a wheeled chair beside a bow window looking out on to the back garden this latter sloped down to the river banks and was prettily laid out with a summerhouse at the lower end from her window the paralytic could see the passing of boats and steamers and enjoy the brightness of the aquatic life she viewed this panorama from morn to eve read on occasions and meditated on her past life which had been none of the happiest a mild and placid woman she was of a singularly sweet disposition and although she was chained to her chair by her affliction she never complained the paralysis extended only to her limbs but her brain was still active and she could give and did give her daughter excellent advice in connection with the business the sorrowful expression on her face showed how keenly she had felt the loss of emma but that was not the only melancholy event in her life there were others which will be spoken of in due course mrs colmer was not without her troubles but she had her consolations also and of these the love of anne was the greatest on the day of fanks arrival the old lady was seated in her usual place between five and six waiting for anne tea was ready for the girl but mrs colmer had already been fed by her nurse and was looking forward to the usual conversation which took place at this time all day anne was busy in the shop and mrs colmer was left to her own devices but when the labours of the day were ended mother and daughter met to converse to mrs colmer this had been the happiest hour of the daybut that was before emma went to london she still talked to anne and took an interest in domestic and local affairs but she was haunted by a feeling of impending evil and she clung despairingly to her remaining child dreading lest she should meet with the fate of her sister an atmosphere of apprehension existed in briar cottage in due course anne entered and having kissed her mother sat down to tea she was as beautiful as ever but there was a haggard look on her face which accorded but ill with her youth it would seem as though she dreaded the future also and was expecting the happening of some terrible misfortune after a short discussion of domestic matters the conversation languished for wrapped in her own thoughts anne did not seem inclined to talk mrs colmer noticed this and commented thereon with affectionate solicitude bent on knowing what made anne so absentminded is there anything wrong my dear she asked nervously nothing mother i am a little tired that is all there is more than that anne for some days you have not been at all like yourself can you wonder at that mother replied anne bitterly think of all that has happened this last month an angry light came into the faded eyes of the old woman you should be glad of what has happened she said in a stern voice that wicked man has been punished for his evil courses he drove my emma to her death and himself has perished by violence an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth that is scripture all the same mother i wish that he had not been murdered gregory was a brute i know and the death of poor emma lies at his door but murder she shuddered it is so terrible to think that he should have been cut off in the midst of his wickedness he has gone down into the pit child let us talk no more of him it is said that we must forgive our enemies but it is hard for me to forgive him even though he is dead my beautiful emma she should have lived as lady fellenger instead of dying through his cruelty i hope anne that your marriage will turn out happier than that of your poor sister ted will be the best of husbands said anne in a tone of conviction he loves me as dearly as i love him i wonder when he is coming down to see me again i have so much to tell him about your visit to halfmoon street that and other things was annes answer then after a pause though indeed he may not be so ignorant of that visit as you think who could tell him but yourself that detective mother he saw me when i entered the room and he followed me also if i had not escaped him in the manner i told you i should have been in trouble you need not be anxious about that now anne the detective can never find you i am not so sure about that said anne in parenthesis and as to mr hersham knowing about your visit to halfmoon street mrs colmer continued i do not see how this detective you speak of can possibly tell him i can see mother mr hersham knows this detectivea mr fanks and he will probably see him about the case in the interests of the morning planet should they meetas they are almost sure to domy name will certainly be mentioned then the story of my visit will come out with the result that fanks will find me here mrs colmer turned slightly pale are you afraid to meet him she asked anne shrugged her shoulders i cant say that i am overpleased was her reply he is a clever man and i shall have considerable difficulty in keeping my own counsel you must tell him nothingnothing you can be sure of that mother should mr fanks come here he will go away as wise as he came i know when to hold my tongue as on this occasion matters are too serious to be spoken of openly oh dear dear said mrs colmer in an agitated tone into what difficulties have we not been led i wish i had never let emma go to london rather wish that she had never met with herbert vaud mother but anne she loved herbert i do not think so else she would never have married sir gregory but you know she always was ambitious and impulsive look where her ambitions have led her if she had not met with herbert she would not have become the wife of that wicked man if she had not been his wife she would not have been driven to her death and if she had not died we should not have been involved in all this trouble trouble trouble moaned mrs colmer what troubles we have had and more will come do not be afraid mother said anne kissing her you have always me to stand between you and danger i may never meet with this detective i may never be questioned by him and so all will be well but should he come whyi shall know how to answer him you will say nothing on the contrary i shall say a great deal replied anne but such things as will mislead mr fanks he shall never be set on the right path by my telling be sure of that i wish i could see you married to ted my dear said her mother comforted by these assurances it would be such a relief to my mind i am afraid we will not be able to marry for some considerable time my dear ted is very clever but he cannot earn enough for us both to live on and i do not wish to be a drag on him no no mother we must wait until things mend and the outlook is brighter you could have married dr binjoy i would not marry dr binjoy if there was not another man in the world said anne with supreme contempt he is a selfindulgent sensualist my ted is worth a dozen of him still he is welloff sighed mrs colmer i do not see how you make that out mother he was and is entirely dependent on sir louis fellenger for his money and i want to have nothing to do with the fellengers their family have cost us dear enough already this reference to the dead emma made mrs colmer weep and anne had considerable difficulty in quietening her however she succeeded in the end and left her mother to her own thoughts while she herself went out into the garden for a breath of fresh air moreover she wanted to be alone for the purpose of thinking over the position of things anne could not but recognise that if certain contingencies arose she and her mother would find themselves very awkwardly placed the evening was warm and the sky was filled with a mellow light which rendered languid the atmosphere against this the trees stood out in bold relief every twig and leaf being sharply outlined against the amber sky the sound of distant laughter and the musical splash of oars came to the ears of the girl as she walked slowly down the path towards the summerhouse a low redbrick wall ran along the bank of the river and as she leaned over this low parapet anne could see some considerable distance to right and left before a boating house on the opposite shore a number of people were collected and every now and then a boat would shoot out into the gleaming waters bearing two or three of them away someone musically inclined had brought a banjo and anne could hear the thrumming of the strings and the echo of the latest musichall ditty altogether the scene was not without its charm but she was too much taken up with her own troubles to pay much attention to the pleasant picture spread out before her the quiet of the evening brought no peace to her how foolishly i have acted she thought with a shiver if i had been wise i would have left these matters alone i feel certain that mr fanks recognised me as the woman he saw in tooleys alley if he finds me out he will ask me what i was doing there on the night of the murder what can i say i dare not tell him the truth and he may refuse to believe what i say to him i acted for the best it is true but my good intentions have led me into a position of danger but i may be wrongi may be quite safe that man may never find me if he doesshe shivered again and looked up the river under the glow of the sunset sky the waters rolled a broad sheet of gold flecked here and there with the dark forms of boats to the left anne saw a skiff containing one oarsman coming swiftly down the stream in a half dreamy moment she calculated that he would pass almost immediately under the wall then she returned to her selfcommunings if ted were only here she thought i should like to tell him all that i have done and ask him how to act for his own sake he must keep silent and for the sake of my mother i must hold my tongue oh it is terribleterrible to know what i know and yet remain dumb and i am afraid of that detective his eyes seemed to pierce me through on that day should he find me out he may compel me to speak and if i speakoh the disgrace and shame of it why why are such things permitted in this world oh ted ted i wish you were here to comfort me she leaned her head on the wall and burst into tears anne was not easily moved and it was an unusual thing for her to thus give way to her emotions but she was only a girl after all and her system was strung up and nervously excited by the knowledge of the secret she knew she would like to have confided in someone if only to relieve her overburdened mind but she shrank from the consequences of such a step a word from her and the murder in tooleys alleybut no she put the thought out of her mind and still leaning her head on her arms she wept bitterly meanwhile the single oarsman rowed steadily towards the red brick wall which was evidently the point for which he was making soon he came abreast of it shortly he came under it and anne raised her head at the sound of the splash of oars to behold the very man of whom she had been thinking it was ted hersham chapter xvi unhappy lovers hersham brought his boat under the wall with a sweep but before disembarking he looked up to anne with an anxious expression on his face did you get my telegram he demanded hastily telegram she repeated i have received no telegram from you i thought so said the journalist and laughed in a savage sort of manner what do you mean demanded anne noting how haggard he looked is anything wrong more than i like to say was his answer at that moment it seemed to anne that her presentiments were about to become true and she waited with vague terror for his next speech ted did not open his mouth for some minutes being fully occupied in making fast his boat prior to landing in spite of the importance of the interview and his desire to prepare anne for the immediate coming of fanks he did not hurry himself but executed his task with the utmost deliberation on her part the girl held her peace and not until her lover had taken her in his arms to kiss her passionately did she speak then she led him to the summerhouseout of sight of mrs colmer at the windowand broached the subject which was uppermost in her mind ted she asked in a low voice is there any danger there is a great deal of danger from what quarter from the worst of all quarters fanks has found you out ah she sat back suddenly and her face turned pale with apprehension is he here hersham nodded i sent a telegram to warn you not to answer his questions i did not receive it i guessed you would not replied her lover with a nod fanks visited me today and left me with the intention of coming down here to see you i sent the wire then i fancied that he might manage to get it delayed at the office here i did not dare to go by waterloo as i made sure he would have the station watched in this dilemma there was nothing left for me to do but to come down on my bicycle which i did i rode to warbys boathouse left my machine there and came on to warn you anne considered for a few minutes how was it that mr fanks found me out she asked anxiously he saw your portrait in my rooms what was he doing in your rooms he came to question me about the cross tattooed on my arm did you tell him anything nothing what could i tell him i am quite unaware how the cross came to be there but with regard to his recognition of you how was it that you went to the chambers of that dead scoundrel i went to get a photograph of emmas that was in the possession of her late husband why did you wish to get the photograph it had some writing on the back which may implicate another person in this trouble of the death i think she added pointedly that you can guess the name of that person i think i can replied hersham gloomily and the worst of it is that fanks will certainly find out that name impossible i may be able to thwart him on that point i hope so but you do not know the man as i do he is the most patient and pertinacious of men he will stick to this case until he has the assassin of sir gregory in jail god forbid ejaculated anne with a shudder amen to that answered hersham oh anne my dear anne he continued taking her hand how i wish we could end all this and fly to the ends of the earth my dear she said gently we have others to think of besides ourselves it would never do to desert them at the present moment besides there may not be so much chance of discovery as you think i dont know i am certain of nothing said hersham with a sigh i only dread one thinglest fanks should force you into betraying that which you would rather hide dont trouble about that ted returned anne dryly i think mr fanks will find me more than his match you need not have come to prepare me for i am quite ready for the gentleman as soon as he chooses to call that will be very soon he is in the village now i dont want him to see me for that reason i came here in a boat do not be foolish ted said anne quickly you must let him see you else he will suspect that you know something about this matter and you must be aware dear that you have your own safety to look to oh groaned hersham how are we to extricate ourselves from this mess i think we will leave that to time and you have me to comfort you dearest he drew her towards him without you i should not be able to move one step at present all is dark and dreary but let us hope that there are brighter days in store i am certain that there are said anne but we have a great deal to endure before peace comes we must go through the valley of humiliation to reach the promised land well said ted emphatically when we do reach it i think we must go to america there to commence a new life it is no use trying to construct a new one here out of the ruins of the old that we shall see replied anne with a sigh god knows we have had a great deal to endure since the death of my poor sister but let us for the moment banish this gloomy subject and talk of ourselves how are you getting on with your work hersham smiled and kissed her he saw that she was striving to lighten the burden which had been laid upon him and he was grateful for the kindness all the same he found it difficult to put his troubles out of sight and memory seeing that they were so insistent and that within the next half hour he might be called upon to defend himself from a dangerous charge alone as they were in the summerhouse they were afraid to speak openly lest the birds of the air should carry to fanks undesirable news which would please him but ruin them under these circumstances hersham agreed with anne that it was best to let affairs connected with the case of tooleys alley remain in abeyance until they were compelled to take action in the meantime the unhappy pair went hand in hand into a fools paradise of makebelieve and hollow joys there was something pitiful in this playing with happiness we will be very poor my love said hersham somewhat later in the conversation and i am afraid that you will miss all the luxuries to which you have been accustomed anne laughed and kissed him you silly boy she said kindly my luxuries are of the cheapest kind as you well know besides i can face poverty with a brave heart with you but your mother i am afraid she will not live long sighed anne she is growing so weak and she has long long fits of silence poor mother she has had a hard life i do not think she ever got over the death of emma does she know anything about these other matters very little i kept as much from her as i could indeed she would never have heard of the death at all had it not been for herbert vaud he might as well have held his tongue said ted angrily but the fact is that since emmas death and his illness he has not been quite right in his head he returned comparatively well as you know but that journey to paris to inquire after lady fellenger unsettled him again dont talk of lady fellenger said anne with a shudder why not your sister was lawfully the wife of sir gregory i know that all the same i hate to hear the name of the family and yet said hersham meaningly you were fond enough of louis again anne laughed you must not be jealous of my friendship for louis ted he is a good fellow in his way i was never in love with him as i am with you but i liked him and binjoy that pompous doctor did you like him i hated him i hate him still she flashed out he is the evil genius of louis if these matters only concerned dr binjoy i should not keep silent and bear the burden i am doing you have me to bear it with you said hersham softly i know that my dear but there are some things which men and women have to face singly such a thing is this coming interview with mr fanks i wanted you to see him so as to disarm any suspicions which he may entertain still i wish you to take no part in the conversation but why asked ted with a frown i cant leave you to fight my battle you must in this case replied anne you are a dear good fellow ted but you allow your heart to govern your head that is very true and it is the reverse with you anne not so far as you are concerned ted i am as weak as water with you if you see me hard to other people you must set it down to the severe training i have had in the school of adversity i am only a girl in years but i am a woman in experience you are the dearest and bravest woman in the whole world said hersham fondly kissing her hand and if happiness comes to us in the future it will be through you i shall do what you say and hold my tongue but my darling are you sure that you can cope with fanks i do not know as i have only seen him but once we cross swords and i shall soon learn my strength i have a large stake to fight for and the remembrance of that will make me desperate well said ted dolefully we cannot turn back now the enemy is within our gates and we must fight v victis you may well say that said anne bitterly woe to the vanquished indeed come let us go to the house and see my mother but you must say nothing to her about our conversation she knows as much as is good for her and her health will not stand any great shock in that case observed hersham as they strolled up the path you must not let her see fanks trust me ted forewarned is forearmed mrs colmer was delighted to see ted for he was a great favourite with the invalid she had no suspicion of what had brought him down in so unexpected a manner and chatted to the young man in the most cheerful of spirits meanwhile anne gave her lover a cup of tea and cut him some sandwiches all the time she was straining her ears to catch the fall of the knocker on the front door every moment she expected to bear the crash which would announce the arrival of the detective and as the minutes went by her nerves became strained to their utmost pitch ted saw what she suffered but in the presence of mrs colmer he could say nothing and the old lady went chattering on there was something cruelly ironical about the situation at last hersham could bear the suspense no longer and making some excuse to mrs colmer he drew anne out into the passage there he placed his hands on her shoulders are you afraid he said anxiously are you afraid of the coming interview with this man yes said anne and shivered the colour had left her cheeks and she suddenly appeared older and more haggard why are you afraid because of your visit to those chambers that and another thing does the other thing concern yourself yes it concerns a visit to london on that night heavens where did you go before anne could answer a sharp knock came to the door which drove all the blood into their hearts they looked at one another for they now felt that the danger was on them what would happen within the next hour where did you go on that night asked hersham hoarsely to tooleys alleyto the red star hotel anne anne and you saw anne nodded yes she said steadily i saw chapter xvii two against one on arriving at taxtononthames fanks had taken up his abode at the royal arms hotel it was his intention to make inquiries about sir louis fellenger dr binjoy and the negro servant of the latter ignorant that he had been thwarted by hersham he had also intended to interview anne colmer without loss of time before she could see or even hear from her lover the intercepted telegram proved conclusively that this girl knew something which hersham did not want her to reveal and in the absenceas fanks supposed of all warninghe hoped to take her at a disadvantage in this mood he took his way to her home so far as the detective could see his future plans depended almost entirely upon the information which he expected to obtain from this girl within the next few hours and in that supposition lay the irony of the situation being in this frame of mind his astonishment may be conceived when on the door of briar cottage being opened he saw before him the man whom he thought was at that moment in london for the minute he was unable to speak but recovered himself to ironically congratulate hersham on his dexterity in evading the machinery of the law in reality fanks was angered but he had too much good sense to give way to bad temper it was in his opinion useless to make bad worse so you have stolen a march on me hersham he said sardonically i was doubtful of your honesty in london i am still more so now how did you manage to dodge the traps i laid for you by knowing where they were laid said hersham sullenly i guessed you would have the railway stations watched so i came down here on my bicycle a very ingenious idea you have no doubt warned miss colmer not to answer my questions yes said hersham defiantly i have done so as i did not receive a reply to my telegram i guessed that you had intercepted my message in some way it has arrived now when it is too late to see miss colmer to warn her i came down here at the risk of my own safety oh remarked fanks taking note of this injudicious speech that is as much as to say that you risked being arrested by me i dont know that you are wrong my friend you deserve punishment for your trickery you have evidence against me i have sufficient to ensure your arrest on the whole hersham said the detective i should advise you to help me otherwise i shall arrest you within the hour take your choice before hersham could answer this question anne appeared at the door with a pale face and a determined manner at once she intervened in the conversation and placed herself between the two men there is no necessity to threaten mr fanks said she quickly come inside and let us discuss this matter calmly i am sure that mr hersham will agree that this is the best course the journalist nodded sullenly and the two men passed into the house conducted by anne she led them into a room the window of which looked on to the road and here when they were seated she addressed herself more particularly to hersham you were wrong to speak as you did to mr fanks she said meaningly there is no reason why you or i should conceal anything i am perfectly willing to tell all that i knowwhich is not muchand to afford this gentleman every information in my power you will regret it if you do anne said hersham warningly you will regret it if you dont interposed fanks i really do not understand why you should act in this childish manner i have always been your friend yet you treat me a though i were your bitterest enemy you are trying to trap me if your conscience is clear i do not think you need be afraid of being trapped retorted fanks but it seems useless to hope for any sense from you perhaps this young lady may be more amenable to reason you can depend upon me to help you mr fanks said anne calmly hersham rose to his feet with an agitated look on his face i shall leave you to reveal what you think fit he declared at the same time i wash my hands of the consequences which may result and with a significant look at anne he left the room fanks gave him a parting warning as he passed through the door you had better stay here hersham he said as i may want to see you again whether you stay or go i can lay my hands on you at any moment you are having me watched questioned hersham fiercely yes i am having you watched and you may thank yourself that you are placed in so unpleasant a position now then will you go to london or stay here hersham hesitated for a moment then biassed by a look from anne he compromised i shall stay in the village he said and passed through the open door leaving the detective with miss colmer strange to say fanks was by no means at his ease with this woman the more so as he mistrusted her promise to tell him all she knew she had deceived him by flying from the chambers in halfmoon street she might again mislead him with false reports if she had anything to conceal this ready acquiescence hinted that she would not tell her secret and the detective was far more distrustful of her craft than of the foolish behaviour of hersham he might combat obstinacy with more or less success but to deal with a diplomatic person like miss colmer required a dexterous use of all the intelligence he possessed fanks therefore prepared for a duel of words and weighed both expression and information during the ensuing conversation well mr fanks said miss colmer coolly i must congratulate you on your cleverness in determining my identity i thought when i left you in sir gregorys chambers that i should be able to elude you altogether i was wrong it seems you have found me out now that you have done so may i ask what you want to know i want to know a great many things said fanks emulating her coolness but the question is whether you will consent to answer all my questions you can judge for yourself ask me what question you will and i shall answer to the best of my ability but added she pointedly before you begin let me ask you one question do you suspect that i have anything to do with the murder of sir gregory i cant answer that until you have replied to my questions miss colmer but judging from your readiness to afford me information i fancy that you do know something of the matter you are right i do know something of the matter but i cannot promise to tell you who killed sir gregory i know that he was murderedno more and even that information i gained from the newspapers fanks made no reply to this remark whereupon miss colmer continued why do you think that i know anything about the crime i never met sir gregory why did you come to the rooms of sir gregory replied fanks i connect you with the murder because of that visit if you know the story of my poor sister you know why i came to halfmoon street said anne coldly it was to ask the servant robert for a portrait of emma that had been taken from her by sir gregory i have seen that photograph miss colmer did you want it back for the picture or because it had some writing on the back what writing do you mean asked the girl sharply fanks produced the celebrated envelope from his pocket that is the writing he said whosoever wrote that also wrote on the back of the photograph of your sister perhaps you can tell me who is the scribe miss colmer looked earnestly at the envelope and shook her head i never saw that writing before she said decisively yet you can see that the post mark is of this village so it appears nevertheless i cannot name the writer and i cannot understand why you show it to me well miss colmer said fanks disappointed with this answer when i find out who wrote this envelope i shall know who killed sir gregory i am sorry i cannot help you mr fanks i see that you think the envelope came from this house but i assure you that you are wrong both my mother and myself considered sir gregory a villain because of his treatment of poor emma but we did not wish his death if you came here to find the assassin you have wasted your time i know nothing about the matter then what is it that hersham did not wish you to reveal nothing he wished me to deny that i had been at the chambers of sir gregory on that day lest you should think i had something to do with the murder oh said fanks disbelievingly and did hersham wish you to deny also that you had been in tooleys alley on the night of the murder anne became pale at the directness of this attack and took refuge in a plain denial i was not there she said obstinately neither on that night nor at any time pardon me i saw you myself you must have been mistaken i think not yours is not a face i could easily forget thank you for the compliment said anne but in this case i am afraid it is unmerited i was not at tooleys alley on that night if you doubt me you can ask my mother no said fanks after a moments reflection i shall not ask your motheryet as a matter of fact the detective was well assured that mother and daughter had prepared an alibi in case of discovery not being ready to analyse the matter by reason of lack of information and certain that anne would persist in her denial he wisely postponed all discussion until a more fitting occasion he therefore on the face of it accepted annes assertion and merely remarked that hersham was foolish to induce her to conceal what had better have been told to this anne replied promptly you must forgive him mr fanks she said he knows that i hated sir gregory for his treatment of my sister and he fancies that my unlucky visit might implicate me in this matter but i have told you the reason i went there so you must blame or excuse me as you see fit i shall do neither at present said fanks significantly but i shall ask you why you ran away from me on that day i was afraid of you why you did not know me you never saw me before i saw your portrait said miss colmer frankly you gave one to tedmr hershamand he told me that you were a detective when i saw you in those chambers i guessed that you had the case in hand and i was seized with a panic fear lest you should suspect me to be mixed up in the crime for that reason i fled how did you trace me it was wrong of you to go miss colmer said fanks not replying directly and i was naturally suspicious of your flight but you dont suspect me now not since you have explained your visit you ask me how i traced you first from your marvellous resemblance to your dead sister and secondly from the post mark on this envelope as i told you the writing on envelope and portrait are the same you see the connection yes i see the connection and now mr fanks i have told you all i know is there any other question you wish to ask me yes where was this photograph taken you wanted in this village was it your sisters possession it was it was the only photograph we had of her the negative was broken and there was no picture of my sister in existence after the death my mother wanted this picture and as i guessed that it might be at sir gregorys chambers i went up for it did you see it in your sisters possession before she went away with sir gregory yes she took it from here when she went to london was there any writing on the back then anne reflected a moment no she said there was no writing on it then do you think your sister wrote on the back of the portrait before she committed suicide if the writing on the back of the photograph is the same as that on this letteror rather envelopei do not think she wrote it this is not my sisters handwriting you cannot think who wrote it no mr fanks i am entirely ignorant of that needless to say fanks took his departure from briar cottage in a very puzzled frame of mind before leaving he told miss colmer that he would call again the next day when he got back to his hotel he asked himself how much of her story he could believe and he came to the conclusion that not one word of it was true he was as far off discovery as ever chapter xviii on the twentyfirst of june up to the present time the visit of fanks to taxtononthames had been a complete failure he had been thwarted by hersham he more than suspected that he had been tricked by anne and he saw no means of obtaining any information likely to lead to the elucidation of the mystery which enveloped the death of sir gregory fellenger it was in very low spirits that the detective returned to the royal arms and after a good dinner which somewhat cheered him he sat down with a pipe to consider what he should do next he had no hope of obtaining any information from hersham or anne colmer as for some reason or another each of them declined to speak fanks thought they could put him on the right track if they pleased but he saw no means by which he could force them to speak openly in spite of his threats he could arrest neither of them as he had not sufficient evidence to do so unable therefore to force or to flatter them into plain speaking he was completely baffled in his efforts to solve the enigma in this direction for the time being he was at a standstill in this dilemma he left the decision regarding his future movements to chance and in the expectation of hearing something of value to his plans he strolled into the taproom of the hotel here he hoped to find the village gossips and to gather from their idle talk information concerning sir louis fellenger dr binjoy and the negro servant however there was no one in the room save a bent and crooked old man with a pair of keen eyes he was seated in a corner of the settle with a tankard of beer before him and with garrulous complacency he introduced himself as simeon wagg the parish clerk of taxtononthames he had a long tongue and a fund of gossip at his disposal and he was ready to afford fanks all the information in his power about the parish and its inhabitants i hev more edication than the most folk about here piped this ancient theer aint much as i dont know if i do so choose thirty year sir hey i bin official in this yer church an village and ive buried an married an christened wi five passons they come they go but old simeon he staay like t church itself he he he i suppose you know sir louis fellenger i knaw mr louis fellenger corrected the aged gossip he warnt no barrownit when i seed him now he hev gone inter th ouse of lors es i hev heard but he was in the third ouse es you go down by foxs farm aw yis i knaws him sold hisself to ould scratch he did what do you mean mr wagg whoy this ere mister fellenger he was apothicary an a chimist an he raised the nemy of mankin as the saaying goes an they do saay es the black maan wor a devil from all of which good loord delivr us es i ses i t church did you know dr binjoy aye he were laarge an beerbaarel like aw vis an the woords he sid passon culdnt spake like he he wint awaay wi mister fellenger t be a barrownit es i hey heaard tell did the negro servant go with them aw no t blaack devil he was turned out o doors on t twenty first he was i know t toime i do cause blaack maan he nearly run me over on his bikikle he did fanks pricked up his ears at this it was on the twentyfirst that the murder had been committed in london he addressed himself with renewed attention to the task of extracting information from this piece of antiquity how was it that the negro nearly ran over you on his bicycle naow ill jes tell ye i will said simeon settling himself for a long story this yere blaack maancaesar is his namehe worn a grean coat wi brass buttons he did i knawed him in t dark by that coat i did was it in the dark that he ran over you asked fanks aye it jes were mister i was on t lunon roaad i was about nine es i cud tell by t striking clock fro t church an this yere blaack maan he coom along he did on t divil machine an he laaid me flaat on my back he did an i beant so yooung es i was mister i shoated to he but he niver saaid nothing he didnt he run on an left me lying on my baack in t durt he did i were main aangry i were i dont wonder at it mr wagg said fanks amiably but how did you know it was the negro caesar i seed his groan coaat i tell ee his face were muffled ooplike but his coaat were plaain in t gaas lamp it were i hev seen t coaat heaps of times i hev an t nex day he were sent away he were this story made fanks wonder if caesar had been up to town on the twentyfirst a negro had committed the murder in tooleys alley between six and seven so if he returned to taxtononthames on a bicycle there was plenty of time for him to come down before nine oclock or as the old man said after nine oclock a good wheelman could easily cover the distance between london and taxtononthames in two hours again mrs boazoph had sworn that the murderer had been arrayed in a green coat with brass buttons and this description matched that of the negro who had so nearly run over wagg on the london road time and date corresponded and then the negro had been dismissed the next dayhe had been smuggled out of the way by his master on the whole fanks thought that matters looked rather black against the stout doctor he proceeded with his enquiries did dr binjoy discharge his servant or did sir louis weel theer naow said the aged one taking the pipe out of his mouth blamed if i knaw who did give him t kickout muster fellenger he were ill he were an hed bin fur weeks t doctor he was wi him he was an i niver saaw one of enan naw one else es i heerd of did fur daays an daays but missus jerusalem she es is t housekeeper t muster fellenger she said es haow caesar hed bin turned awaay he got off fro t village he did an i niver seed him since i didnt then t cousin of muster louis died he did an muster fellenger he went awaay wi doctor to be barrownit he did you dont think that dr binjoy was up in london on the night you met caesar on the bicycle noa sir i doant whoy muster fellenger he were ill he were an t doctor he kep in t sick room he did no one iver saaw him for daays they didnt from this information it seemed to fanks as though there were an understanding between sir louis and the doctor this old creature who represented the village opinion was quite sure that dr binjoy had been in attendance on fellenger on the night of the twentyfirst yet fanks knew by personal observation that binjoy under the name of renshaw had been in tooleys alley he would not have returned to taxtononthames on that night as the house in great auk street had been watched and yet fanks had proved beyond all doubt that renshaw and binjoy were one and the same person was it possible that sir louis was telling a lie to screen binjoy from the consequences of his being in town and was it possible that the two had employed the negro caesar to commit the crime and then had smuggled him out of the waysay to bombayso that he should not betray them in a word were fellenger and binjoy guilty of the murder of the cousin of the former it seemed impossible and yet as sir louis was employing fanks to hunt down the assassin it was hard to believe the conversation of simeon wagg only introduced a new perplexity into this perplexing case there was nothing more to be got out of the old clerk so fanks retired to bed in a very melancholy frame of mind he did not know which way to move in the midst of such contradictory information the night brought counsel and the next morning fanks arose with a definite object he would return to town and advertise for the negro caesar must have left his bicycle somewhere so if he advertised for a negro in a green coat with brass buttons he might find out something those with whom the bicycle had been left would be able to give a description of the negro who had arrived and departed with it and so fanks hoped to learn if the black murderer of tooleys alley was the same as the servant caesar of dr binjoy regarding the shielding of the doctor by louis fellenger the detective resolved to leave that question until he went to mere hall and saw the two men together i am afraid that crate will have to go to bombay after all said fanks to himself as he left the hotel he did not go at once to town as he wished to see both hersham and anne colmer also he was desirous of having an interview with the mother halfway down the street he met with the journalist who saluted him in rather a sullen fashion i was just about to call on you said hersham i wish to go to town by the midday train if you have no objection you can go as soon as you please retorted fanks you are not so much good to me that i care to keep you here you need not make yourself so infernally disagreeable fanks said the young man tartly i have told you all i know and so has miss colmer as to that i have my own opinion hersham i certainly think that you and she have a secret between you which you will not share with me it does not concern you ah you have a secret then yes i have but it is private business and has nothing to do with the death of that titled scoundrel i should like to judge of that for myself said fanks coldly however i daresay ill find out all i wish to know without your assistance hersham came forward and laid his hand on the arm of the detective i say fanks he observed earnestly i know im not treating you well but you must make allowances for the natural fear i feel at being brought into contact with the law i know something and i should like to tell it to you but i cant make up my mind to do soyet still i give you my word of honour that if you ask me again next week i shall tell you all i shall place my life and liberty in your hands good heavens man cried the startled fanks you dont mean to say that you are concerned in the murder no i am not but when i tell you all you will see why i did not speak before give me a week to make up my mind ill give you the week said the detective briefly and without further speech hersham took his leave in an abrupt manner evidently relieved to be so dismissed on presenting himself at briar cottage fanks was at once admitted and was shown by the servanta neathanded phyllisinto a different sittingroom from the one he had seen before in a large chair by the window which looked out on the garden an old lady was seated she was dressed completely in white and the lower part of her body was swathed in a shawl of chinese crape her face was pale and careworn and her eyes were redrimmed as from constant crying an open bible lay on her lap and from this she raised her eyes as fanks entered he had little hesitation in guessing that this was mrs colmer the paralytic mother of the living anne and the dead emma you must excuse my rising to receive you she said in a low and sweet voice but i am unable to move hand or foot doubtless my daughter has told you of my affliction my daughter will see you presently fanks bowed and there was a silence between them for a few moments he glanced round the neatly furnished room at the pictures and photographs but among them all he could not see one of the dead emma at the elbow of mrs colmer on a small table stood a pile of photographs at which she had evidently been looking prior to his entrance and fanks surmised that a portrait of emma might be there he was anxious to discover one if possible as anne had denied that there was a photograph of her sister in existence save the one which she had sought at sir gregorys chambers fanks thought that if he could find another in the pile at mrs colmers elbow he would be able to convict anne out of her own mouth and expose the falsity of the motive she gave for her visit he cast about for some means whereby to accomplish his purpose you will excuse me mrs colmer he said rising from his seat but that is an excellent picture of the bay of naples he had crossed over to the other side of the room to look at the picture and so found himself standing by the small table which held the sundry pictures in turning away he pretended to stumble and so knocked over the table and photographs thousand apologies said fanks in confusion stooping to pick them up he looked in vain for the face he sought but he made a discovery which startled him not a little the last photograph which he picked up off the carpet was one ofmrs boazoph chapter xix the defiance of anne colmer before fanks could remark on the strangeness of this discovery the door opened and anne entered the room with characteristic quickness she recognised the photograph in the hand of the detective at once she came forward and signed to him to be silent at the same time she spoke to her mother mr fanks has been shown into this room by mistake she said hurriedly so with your permission mother i shall conduct him into the next room as you please anne you know best accepting this permission anne drew fanks quickly into the passage and led him into the apartment he had seen on the occasion of his last visit he still held the photograph in his hand and at this she looked anxiously as she signed to him that he should take a seat fanks placed himself in a comfortable armchair miss colmer took up her position opposite to him and both prepared for a difficult conversation as was natural from her late action she made an observation on the picture of mrs boazoph i see that you recognise that face said anne coolly no doubt you wonder how that photograph came to be in this house i do wonder am i to hear the truth from you miss colmer certainly there is no reason why i should tell you a lie man and woman looked directly into one anothers eyes and a look of mutual distrust passed between them it was fanks who first took up the unspoken challenge i think you would tell me a lie if there was anything to be gained or concealed by it said the detective dryly you are not far out there returned anne coolly i am above petty moral doubts in such circumstances but in this instance mr fanks i have nothing to gain or to lose by telling a falsehood you saw mr hersham this morning she added abruptly and irrelevantly yes have i you to thank for the alteration in his demeanour you have i persuaded him to tell you all has he done so no he has postponed the confession for a week what foolish weakness muttered anne with a sigh i wish he had told you this morning do you why because you may find out that which he wished to hide before he can brace his mind to a confession i love edward hersham dearly mr fanks but i can see his faults and weakness of character as plainly as you can i entreated him to tell you all at once he consented yet you see when it comes to the point his feebleness makes him shrink from the ordeal you hint at danger to hersham may i ask if it is connected with the committal of this crime no you may not mr fanks edward can tell you the truth for himself in a week he is foolish but he is not guilty fanks was at once piqued and delighted with this woman she was so clever and so inscrutable that he could not help respecting her for the first time for many days he had met with a woman with the mind of a man and he felt that he would need all his intelligence to beat her on the other hand he was not unprepared to expect defeat in place of victory what would you say miss colmer if i told you that i had found the assassin of sir gregory he asked craftily i should at once congratulate you and doubt you was the quick response no mr fanks you are not yet successful else you would not come to see me nor would you be astonished at seeing the photograph of mrs boazoph you know her it seems i do but my mother does not know her under that name what do you mean miss colmer made no immediate reply she compressed her beautiful lips tightly together and looked out of the window i see that i shall have to make a confidant of you sir she said slowly although i do not recognise your claim to demand an explanation pardon me miss colmer said fanks with the utmost politeness the law gives me every right by your visit to halfmoon street where the murdered man lived you implicated yourself in the matter i can see by the hints of yourself and hersham that you both know more than you choose to tell and as i am deputed to search out the truth i can call on you to reveal all you know i made my confession yesterday was it the truth it was the truth so far as it went ah then there is more to tell yes said anne after a pause there is more to tell but not yet not yet fanks leaned forward and looked into her eyes miss colmer he said in a low tone tell me who killed sir gregory i do not know i swear i do not know see here mr fanks she cried suddenly i do not know the truth but i have an inkling of the truth i may be wrong i fervently trust that i am wrong still i am doubtful very very doubtful i cant tell you of my suspicions they might get an innocent person into trouble are you alluding to hersham i decline to say by my advice mr hersham is about to tell you all he knows i cannot take the words out of his mouth he would never forgive me and i do not wish to lose his love then you mean mrs boazoph i refuse to speak i shall leave you if you ask further questions she said almost fiercely you nearly discovered what i think is the truth in those chambers i did not know that you were there but i went up to halfmoon street to prevent the truth being discovered if i could i failed because you were present fanks sat up alertly she had given him a clue is the truth to be discovered in halfmoon street he asked eagerly anne moistened her dry lips and turned away her face yes i believe it is she murmured and i hope you will never discover it she was so moved that fanks thought she was about to faint with considerable dexterity he left the question alone for a time and turned the conversation toward the subject of mrs boazoph you have not yet told me about this portrait he said gently i will do so now said anne recovering her nerve mrs boazoph is my mothers sister she is my aunt oh said fanks considerably astonished then how is it that your mother does not know the name of boazoph because she only knows her sister as mrs bryant but i do not understand said fanks rather bewildered the matter is easy of explanation my mother is a gentlewoman although we keep a shop and she is very proud of her birth and blood the behaviour of my sister nearly killed her you can therefore guess what she would think of my aunt mrs boazoph did she know that she kept a notorious hotel in tooleys alley and was so well known to the police as she is fanks looked at this woman in astonishment it was so strange to hear her speak in this manner of her own flesh and blood anne noticed his astonishment and a faint blush crept over her cheek i see what you are thinking of mr fanks but i know my aunt she has told me all about her unhappy life believe me she is more to be pitied than blamed like hersham said links dryly yes like mr hersham she retorted defiantly my aunt made an unhappy marriage with a man far beneath her his name was bryant not boazoph so my mother only knows her sister by that name bryant lost all his money and was set up by some of his friends in the red star in tooleys alley there from some shame at his fall he called himself boazoph when he died my aunt carried on the business and i daresay you know all the rest of her life fanks nodded i suppose mrs boazoph visits you occasionally as mrs bryant he said inquisitively she comes once or twice in the year and for my mothers sake i see her but i do not approve of mrs boazophs misguided life and i am not what you would call friendly with her yours is indeed an unfortunate family said fanks bluntly and with less of his usual courtesy your sister driven to her death by that dead scoundrel your aunt one of the most notorious women in london your mother paralysed your lover mixed up in this murder anne lost her temper at this brutal speech which was just what fanks wished her to do and why he had made it inherently a gentleman he would never have thought of taunting the poor girl with the crime and follies of her family had he not desired to get the better of her but in this instance he desired to make her angry and took this wayan unworthy way it must be confessed with a burst of indignation anne rose to her feet i always understood that you were a gentleman mr fanks she said bitterly but i see i am mistaken if you think to trap me into helping you by insulting my family you are mistaken i shall tell you nothingnow perhaps i may force you to help me said fanks looking very wicked i am afraid not in what way do you hope to accomplish so impossible a task why said fanks keeping his eyes fixed on her face by arresting your lover you dare not i dare i dare anything look you here miss colmer i am growing tired of being in the dark and rather than remain in it any longer i shall resort to strong measures in some wayof which you knowhersham is mixed up in this crime if you wont be persuaded to tell you must be forced to speak out if only to save hersham from being tried for the crime i shall arrest him do so and you will only be the loser by so rash an action fanks walked to the door good day miss colmer i shall do as i say and the blame will lie at your door anne said nothing but very pale and very determined she stood looking at fanks he admired her for the way in which she was fighting and he privately considered that if the way to the truth lay through anne colmer there was small chance of it being discovered he made one more attempt to induce her to speak come he said pleadingly be advised save yourself and hersham by telling the truth i dont know the truth i only guess it your guess may be the correct one let me know what it is no no no you wont speak no not for worlds it was plain that whatever she knew she would not reveal so fanks shaking his head left the room when he was out of the door anne broke down and falling into a chair she burst into tears yet she had no idea of yielding for better or worse the die was cast and if hersham was arrested at her door would lie the ruin and disgrace of his life truly it was a powerful reason which made anne conceal the truth at the expense of her lovers liberty andit might beof his life as for fanks he went off to the station and caught the train to town he had gone to taxtononthames full of hope of success he left it beaten on every pointand by a woman his sole chance of learning anything further lay in advertising for the negro and in the chance that hersham would confess next week anne colmer was as silent as the sphinx all the same fanks had not done with that young lady chapter xx the green overcoat it may be here mentioned that fanks had no intention of arresting hersham at the present time he had threatened to do so in order to induce anne to speak out but this having failed he thought no more about the matter the journalist was being watched and he could be arrested at any moment so fanks was quite at his ease on that score the slightest false step and hersham would find himself within the walls of a jail but up to the present time fanks had not collected sufficient evidence against him to warrant any magistrate authorising his imprisonment the confession of the next week might bring about the intervention of the law but till then fanks left hersham under the eye of the watching detective and devoted himself to searching for the mysterious negro who had worn the green coat with brass buttons it may seem strange to the reader that so astute a man as mr fanks should advertise for a negro when he was confident that the only negro connected with the matter was in bombay but this apparent riddle will be explained when mr fanks receives the expected answer to his paragraph in the morning planet this appeared two days after he left taxtononthames and read as follows ten pounds reward will be given to any person who can inform advertiser of the whereabouts of a black man dressed in a green coat with brass buttons twenty pounds will be given to anyone who can give information as to the movements of the said black man on the night of the twentyfirst of june last between the hours of six and nine apply messrs vaud and vaud lincolns inn fields it cannot be said that this advertisement was a masterpiece of composition but the clumsy wording was due to crate and crate not being a scholar had written it in such a fashion fanks commented on its prolixity to the author himself on the morning of its appearance you could have shortened that advertisement considerably he said smiling i never saw so roundabout a request for information what does it matter replied crate growing rather red i aint no scholar mr fanks and i did the best i could if the fish bites sir that is all you want i hope the fish will bite crate said fanks fretfully if not i do not know what i shall do never have i been so unlucky as over this case everything seems to go wrong with me but if i can find anyone who saw this negro on the night of the murder we my hear strange things about mrs boazoph and dr binjoy about miss colmer and hersham though to be sure such information may run me into a blind alley by the way did mr garth call to see me in my absence twice sir the deuce muttered fanks with a frown i wonder why he is so anxious over this case i think i can tell you that sir and i think i can guess what you are about to say retorted fanks however let me hear your theory well i may be wrong said crate modestly but it seems to me that this mr garth is anxious to find out that sir louis fellenger is concerned in the murder of his cousin because because he wants to inherit the fellenger title and property as next heir finished fanks smartly exactly sir what do you think of my theory there may be something in it crate replied fanks thoughtfully of course mr garth comes into the fellenger estates on the death of the present baronet but he added emphatically we know that this negro actually killed sir gregory so louis could only be associated with the case as an accessory before the fact therefore he could not be hanged even if the case were proved against him where would mr garth be then in such an event the estates would probably be thrown into chancery while sir louis was undergoing imprisonment and would not come to garth for years your idea is a good one crate but i do not see how it would benefit our friend crate scratched his chin i suppose that mr garth is lawyer enough to know all that he said grudgingly and wouldnt risk his neck for the mere chance of such a thing he ah now you are on another track mr garth may be anxious to prove the case against sir louis but i do not think he killed sir gregory himself oh i know who you think is guilty mr fanks all the same i do not agree with you and i should not be surprised if this garth turned out to be the real criminal garth isnt a negro i guess you have your own ideas about that negro mr fanks the detective smiled and rose from his seat i guess i have mr crate you are improving my friend and you are beginning to see further than your nose i should not wonder if i made something of you yet so you suspect garth with becoming modesty but a good deal of emphasis crate asserted that he did and moreover said that if permitted by his superior officer he would have great pleasure in proving his case against the barrister to this fanks assented readily enough prove your case by all means crate he said dryly i do not agree with you in the least all the same i am always open to correction one thing only i ask you must tell me all you do all you discover as i do not wish you to cross my trail this crate assented to without demur and fanks departed to duke street where he changed his clothes for the more stylish ones of rixton thence he went to the athenian club and as he expected found garth in the smokingroom the lean lawyer looked so haggard and worn out that fanks wondered if there might not be more in crates theory than appeared at first sight but he rejected this idea almost as soon as it crossed his mind he was confident that the true assassin of sir gregory wasbut that revelation comes later in the meantime he greeted garth with his customary coolness and sat down beside him with a view to learning all that had transpired during his absence were you waiting for me here he asked lighting a cigarette not exactly replied garth with some hesitation i hoped that you would come in here sooner or later and i wished to see you but at present i am waiting for herbert vaud really do you expect him shortly garth looked at his watch he ought to be here now what do you wish to see him about asked fanks eyeing his companion keenly anything about this case garth nodded yes young vaud knew emma calvert and i wish to learn if she is really dead you can set your mind at rest on that point said fanks coolly emma calvert is six feet below the soil of pere la chaise but the woman who appeared at my cousins chambers the woman whom robert said was she that is anne colmer the twin sister of the dead woman anne colmer she is engaged to ted hersham she is i have been down to taxtononthames and i have found out all the family history have you found out who wrote on the back of the photograph who directed that envelope no said fanks gloomily i have not discovered anything yet about that do you think that anne colmer wrote it i am certain from personal observation that anne colmer did not did her mother impossible mrs colmer is a hopeless paralytic then who wrote it that is just what i have to learn i am no further in the case than i was when i saw you last have you discovered anything no but i had hoped to have learned about emma from herbert well said fanks with a sigh we know all about herbert vaud we are aware of the identity of emma calvert it is not in that direction we must search our only chance of finding out the truth lies in discovering this negro i saw your advertisement in the morning planet anybody who can give information is to call at the office of vaud and vaud i see i thought it best that they should receive the information said fanks seeing that they are the solicitors of sir louis i hope that something will turn up but i am doubtful i am very doubtful at this moment the waiter brought in a telegram to mr garth the barrister opened it and uttered an ejaculation of surprise after a pause he handed the telegram to fanks queer isnt it he said fanks looked at the message which ran as follows cannot see you today have to wait in to see fanks about advertisement h vaud humph said fanks rising briskly to his feet it is strange that i should be here with you and stranger still that the advertisement should be answered so promptly i told vaud to write to scotland yard should anything turn up but this will save me a journey can i come with you if you like i must call at my room first said fanks by the way my friend he added turning sharply on garth you dont know anything about this very apropos telegram good lord no how should i you dont think that i sent it no i dont but it isno matter let us get on there is no time to lose as a matter of fact fanks did not like the look of things at all he was naturally suspicious of this telegram fitted in so very neatly with the subject of their conversation that he thought garth might know more of it than he had chosen to say but a moments reflection convinced him that he suspected the lawyer wrongly garth did not know that he was coming to the athenian club therefore he could not have made such an arrangement fanks dismissed the matter from his mind and allowed garth to come with him to his room in duke street he picked up a photograph and placed it in his pocket garth saw the face of the picture and whistled you dont think that person has anything to do with it he asked anxiously this person has to do with the present matter said fanks smartly but i cant say if the person has anything to do with the death in tooleys alley i am only taking this portrait on chance i may be wrong however we shall see and not another word would fanks say until he arrived at lincolns inn fields here they found herbert in his fathers room with an apology i have to take the place of my father today mr fanks said the young lawyer who looked ill he is not well and deputed me to see after this matter touching the advertisement said fanks eagerly yes a man turned up this morning in answer to it he is waiting in the next room and he says that he knows all about the negro you are in search of good let us have him in you do not mind my friend mr garth being present i hope not at all replied herbert coldly that lies more in your hands than mine show in that man who came about the advertisement he added to a clerk who entered the gentleman in question entered a driedup little man brisk and keeneyed with a horsey look about him he glanced sharply at the three men pulled his forelock and proceeded to ask about the reward i want thirty puns he said calmly oh no you dont retorted fanks you want ten or twenty the two rewards are separate you must not add them together but i can tell of the whereabouts of this negro and i can tell his movements i know all about him so i ought to get both rewards youll get either the ten or the twenty said fanks now no more talk what is your name berry jawkins i am barman at the eight bells public on the richmond road ho ho muttered fanks i thought as much on the twentyfirst a nigger came riding a bicycle about eight oclock he came into the bar and had a drink he wore a green coat with brass buttons after he had his drink he asked if he might wash his face i sent him out to the pump in the back yard he washed and came in then gents said the little man with emphasis i got a surprise i can tell you what kind of surprise demanded garth with an astonished look why sir that nigger werent no nigger at all he were a white man as white as you make em a white man said fanks producing the portrait from his pocket a white man with a smile and a moustache a very goodlooking sort of feller added the barman he explained how it was he wait a moment said fanks is that the man you saw berry jawkins started back in surprise the moment he set eyes on the photograph which fanks had thrust under his nose my gum heres a start said mr berry jawkins thats the very identical person who washed himself at the eight bells how did you come to know of him sir i suspected it for some time said fanks do you recognise the face mr vaud herbert looked at the face and his countenance reflected the astonishment of berry jawkins and of garth why exclaimed the young solicitor starting back it is ted hersham chapter xxi the eight bells enigma although fanks quite expected this revelation he was nevertheless rather astonished at its unexpected confirmation from that bicycle ride of hershams to taxtononthames to thwart his designs on anne colmer fanks had deduced certain suspicions the hesitation of the journalist had confirmed those suspicions frankly speaking he had no reason to connect hersham with the negro but he had been satisfied from the evidence of simeon wagg that caesardr binjoys servanthad not been away from the surrey village on that fatal night failing the real negro someone must have personated the black man from the behaviour of hersham fanks thought he might be the person in question his random shot had hit the bullseye it was quite an accident that it had done so i expected as much said fanks again restoring the photograph to his pocketbook i told you garth that i was right to trust to my instincts this discovery explains the extraordinary conduct of hersham in what way i shall tell you later on in the meantime let us hear what this man has to say he turned towards berry jawkins as he spoke and waited for him to speak the barman looked rather downcast and when he did open his mouth it was to revert to the subject of the reward im a poor man gentlemen he said in a whining tone and i hope you mean fair about this thirty puns we mean fair about the twenty pounds man said vaud sternly you heard what mr fanks said oh yes i heard fast enough retorted berry jawkins and i dont hold with him the rewards added together make thirty puns no doubt they do but then the rewards are not to be added together said fanks you had better tell all you know mr berry jawkins or ill look into the matter myself and then youll get no reward ah youd go back on me well dy see i shant tell anything fanks shrugged his shoulders he had no desire to quarrel with the man or to waste time in arguing the only way to induce speech from this obstinate creature was to pay him the money which after all he had earned fairly enough the detective therefore advised herbert vaud to fulfil the terms of the advertisement which was accordingly done and mr jawkins found himself the richer by twenty pounds though it should have been thirty puns said the obstinate creature but there aint no chance of getting whats fair out of the aristocracy i am a radical i am and i goes we dont want to have your political opinions man said fanks sharply come to the point im coming to it grumbled berry jawkins on the night of the twentyfirst i was in the bar business was bad that evening gentlemen and there was not a blessed soul in the bar but myself just about eight oclock i thought as how i might shut up when the door opened and in came a black man he said ive left my bike outside i want a drink of scotch cold he ses and mind you i twigged that he wasnt a nigger when he spoke and i saw as he was a gent by the peculiar refinement of his jawing but as it wasnt my business i said nothing till he asked to wash his face then i told him to go round to the pump in the back yard tho ses i a gent like you will want hot water i aint a gent ses he im only a poor strolling christy minstrel he ses then i laughs seein as he was lying but he scowls and bolts out to the back when he comes back his face was whiteas white as you or meand he had a moustached like the feller in that photo in fact gents he is the feller in that photo as i can swear to in any court of law well he comes back clean and finishes his scotch cold and goes out i thinks his manner queerlike and goes to the door he gets on his bike and goes off down the road like a house on fire which way did he go to london or down the country oh down the country for sure gents well i didnt say anything about all this for i thought as he might be a gent doing a bolt in disguise but it wasnt any of my business to split perticular as he had given me two shilling just for fun like but all the same i keeps my eye on the papers to see if there was anyone wanted then i comes to this tooley alley murder and a description of the negro in a green coat and brass buttons thats my man i ses but hold hard berry jawkins and dont say nothing till you see as there is a reward so i waits and waits till in this mornings paper i sees a reward of thirty puns twenty pounds very well gents all well say twenty tho to my mind it ought to be another tenner but as i ses i sees this reward and comes up to get it i have got it said jawkins slapping his pocket tho not the amount i did expect now having told all i goes hoping youll catch that blackwhite nigger and hang him for i think he is a aristocrat and i hates them they being my natural enemies having heard this history fanks let berry jawkins go as there was no reason why he should be detained first however he found out that mr jawkins was always to be heard of at the eight bells in his capacity of barman the man having left the room fanks turned towards garth and herbert to see what they thought of the revelation which had been so unexpectedly made they returned his gaze and garth was the first to break the silence well he said in a low tone so hersham is the culprit after all pardon me garth but i do not think that we have proved that yet what do you say mr vaud i can say nothing replied herbert coldly i have no opinion in the matter as my father is absent i am attending to the case by his desire but personally speaking i would not lift one finger to discover the assassinor rather the punisher of gregory fellenger you hated him then said fanks quietly i hated him i still hate him even though he is dead you wonder at my speaking in this way mr fanks but no replied fanks with a certain pity in his tone i do not wonder your father told mr garth here the story of emma calvert and mr garth repeated it to me i know you hate the very memory of that dead scoundrel can you wonder at it said herbert again i loved her she did not love but she might have grown to do so in time but he came with his lies and money to drag her away from me he married her certainly but he drove her to suicide and if he had not met with his death by this unknown hand he would have had to reckon with me for his baseness you would have killed him yourself perhaps herbert vaud opened and shut his hand convulsively i dont know what i should have done he said in a thick voice but he is dead so what does it matter but if i had my way the assassin of gregory fellenger should go free he may go free after all said fanks quietly we have not yet solved the problem of his death we have proved that hersham was disguised as the negro said garth impetuously we have proved that hersham was disguised as a negro replied fanks making the correction with point but we have not proved that he wasthat he isthe negro who killed your cousin in tooleys alley if he did not why was he blacked up on the very night the murder was committed he must have had some reason for so masquerading i have no doubt he had a reason and i have no doubt that he will explain his reason to me when i see him but on the face of it i do not think that he is the negro of tooleys alley why not said garth impatiently look here fanks the skein runs out as clean as a whistle hersham has a cross tattooed on his arm the death of my cousin was caused by a similar cross being pricked on his arm hersham is engaged to anne colmer you tell me that she is the sister of the girl emma calvert who committed suicide in paris as the victim of sir gregory the envelope making the appointment comes from taxtononthames anne colmer comes from the same place she lives there hersham was disguised as a negro on the very night of the murderat the very time the murder was committed what is more reasonable than to suppose that hersham was inspired by anne colmer to kill the man who had deceived her sister there in a few words you have the motive of the crime and the way in which it was carried out oh there is no doubt in my mind that we have the real man at last were i you i should arrest hersham without delay if you were in my place you would do what i intend to do said fanks quietly and take time to consider the matter i admit that you have made a very strong case out against hersham but there is one important particular which you have overlooked what is that asked garth it seems to me that there is not a link missing that comes of being too confident can you see the missing link mr vaud the young lawyer reflected for a few moments in a composed and careless manner then looked up and professed his inability to amend the case as set out against hersham fanks shrugged his shoulders at their lack of penetration and explained his theory the negro who was in tooleys alley had no moustache he said slowly as was proved by the evidence of mrs boazoph hersham on the contrary both as negro and white man had a moustache as has been proved by the story of berry jawkins it might have been a false moustache said garth still sticking to his point it was not a false moustache retorted fanks shaking his head if hersham intended a disguise he would have worn a beard a moustache would disguise him little but for the sake of argument we will grant that the moustache was intended as a disguise if so why did he retain it when he washed the black off his face or if it was part of his disguise why did he wear it both as the black and the white man no no i am sure that hersham wore his own moustache and not a false one and again added fanks with an afterthought i saw hersham shortly after the murderwithin two or three days in facthe then wore a heavy moustache and you can trust me when i say it was not a false one if then hersham was the tooley alley negro who we have agreed committed the murder how did he manage to grow his moustache in so short a period the thing is impossible finished the detective that one point alone assures me that hersham is guiltless of the crime mrs boazoph may have made a mistake suggested garth remember she did not see the negro go out she saw him go in however mrs boazoph is too clever a woman to make a mistake of that sort the black man who committed the murder had no moustache our friend masquerading as a christy minstrel had one against the evidence of mrs boazoph we can place the evidence of berry jawkins the one contradicts the other and both evidences conclusively prove that hersham had no hand in the commission of the mysterious tragedy and another thing said herbert suddenly mr garth couples the fact of the murder with the name of miss colmer as a friend of the family i protest against that i know mrs colmer i know her daughter and i am certain that neither of these unfortunate people have anything to do with the death of that scoundrel nevertheless the envelope which contained the appointment of the red star in tooleys alley as the rendezvous bore the taxtononthames postmark mrs colmer and her daughter live at taxtononthames what of that sir louis fellenger and his medical friend lived at the same place you might as well say that the new baronet committed the crime so as to succeed to the title and estates the one theory is as feasible as the other very true said fanks in a desponding tone i am as much in the dark as ever at the present moment we can build up a theory on anything for instance i might say that our friend garth here killed his cousin the deuce cried garth aghast you are startled said fanks keenly watching the effect of his speech on the young man i dont wonder at it i merely say this to show how slow you should be in condemning hersham but i dont see how you could bring me in stammered garth it is easy enough you are the heir failing sir louis you know the purport of that tattooed cross you might have killed your cousin and have sent the appointment from taxtononthames to implicate sir louis in the matter and so have removed the two people between you and the title at one sweep but i dont want the title possibly not but you want money but do not look so afraid garth i dont think you committed the crime you are no doubt as innocent as mr herbert here if i had committed the crime i should not deny it said herbert gloomily i should glory in causing the death of such a scoundrel if fellenger had not been killed by the negro in tooleys alley mr fanks you might have had to arrest me as the cause of his death as it is my revenge has been taken out of my hands but the same end has been arrived at i am glad the blackguard is dead here the argument ended and fanks went out arm in arm with garth both of them were sorry for the unhappy herbert vaud and both of them were more puzzled than ever over the case as yet all evidence had failed to throw the least gleam of light on the subject chapter xxii mrs boazoph receives a shock shortly after the conversation at lincolns inn fields fanks took his leave of garth he was rather weary of the lawyers company and moreover he found such a third person a hindrance to the free speech he wished to induce from those with whom he conversed in his own heart he was perfectly satisfied that garth was connected in no way with the crime for the test which he applied in the office of vaud and vaud entirely satisfied him nevertheless he was not so certain that garth would not be pleased to learn that his cousinthe sole person who stood between him and the fellenger estatewas implicated in the affair on these grounds he therefore excused himself to the barrister and walked off by himself intent on his own business garth who was suffering from a bad attack of detective fever was not over pleased at being thus dismissed still he thought it best to obey his friend and so he departed to think over the aspect the case had now assumed in fact he intended to do a little detective business on his own account and if possible he wished to surprise fanks by an unexpected discovery there were now three different people following three different lines of action with respect to the case so it was to be hoped that one of them at least would run down the assassin of sir gregory fellenger unless indeed all failed on the principle that too many cooks spoil the broth on leaving the barrister fanks took his way towards tooleys alley it was his intention to see mrs boazoph and to try an experiment on that astute lady from her demeanour fanks believed that the landlady of the red star knew more about the case than she chose to confess and that she was anxious to screen the man or woman who had done the deed of this belief he wished to make certain mrs boazoph received the detective with her customary composure she was quite prepared for his visit as she knew that her connection with the case was too patent to escape his vigilant eye anticipating a trying conversation she directed fanks to be shown into her private sittingroom and she braced herself up to confuse and baffle him no one would have guessed the landladys thoughts from the amiable manner in which she received her almost declared enemy she was positively genial in her conversation and demeanour and fanks augured ill from this well mrs boazoph said he mildly i suppose you are wondering what brings me here indeed i am doing no such thing mr fanks you came to find out what i know about this crime i congratulate you on your perspicuity mrs boazoph and what do you know about it the woman raised her eyebrows and shrugged her shoulders i know nothing at all she replied i gave my evidence at the inquest you heard it well well there is nothing more to be said i beg to differ with you mrs boazoph there is a great deal more to be said not by me said mrs boazoph obstinately closing her mouth if you think that i am going to assist you to find out who killed this wretched man you are very much mistaken strange said fanks in a musing tone meant to reach her ear the same thing was said in almost the same words by anne colmer what do you know about anne colmer more than you can guess for instance i know that she is the niece ofmrs bryant with a start instantly repressed she looked to him in a hard and fixed manner a disbelieving smile on her lips mrs bryant she repeated and who is mrs bryant if you dont know i am sure i do not speak plainly i hate epigrams so do i they are such a bar to intelligent conversation well mrs bryant is a lady of birth who married beneath her mr bryant was a bully a sot a spendthrift and he lost all his money by fast living when he became poor his friendsfor strange to say this unpleasant person had some friendsset him up in an hotel he was ashamed to stick his own name over his door so he cast about for another perhaps you can tell me what that other name was no what a singularly obstinate person you are said fanks shaking his head believe me it is no use our wasting time in discussing facts be sensible mrs boazoph and admit that you are mrs bryant no mrs bryant the sister of mrs colmer of taxtononthames dressmaker and decayed gentlewoman i dont know her i never heard her name really said fanks with gentle pity then i must inquire of mrs colmer of taxtononthames how is it that her sister mrs bryant is the notorious mrs boazoph of london you are a fiend and what is mrs bryant alias boazoph she is a most unhappy woman a woman rather to be pitied than blamed ah said fanks drawing a long breath of satisfaction so you admit your identity at last i can do nothing else i do not wish my poor sister to know that i am mrs boazoph she thinks that i live on the money left to me by my late husband she does not know that i keep this hotel that i am the woman who has been mentioned so often in the papers in connection with thieves rogues and detectives yes i admit that i am mrs bryant the sister of mrs colmer who told you your niece anne she had no business to do so very probably but she could not help herself i forced her to speak how it does not matter but i extracted the truth out of her mrs bryant call me mrs boazoph flashed out the woman and relieve me of your presence as speedily as possible what do you wish to know i wish to know the agreement you made with dr binjoy regarding this crime who is dr binjoy come now mrs boazoph do not let us have another argument i have neither the time nor the patience to endure one i assure you i know more than you think and i can force you to speak if i so choose i would rather not choose if it is all the same to you let us conduct this conversation pleasantly if possible you know that dr binjoy is the same as dr renshaw indeed i do not how can you prove it very easily i followed dr renshaw on his presumed journey to bombay and tracked him to mere hall at bournemouth mrs boazoph quailed and shrank back this man knew so much that she did not know where she stood for the moment she did not know what to do but unable to deny the identity of renshaw with binjoy she admitted it good said fanks in a satisfied tone we are getting on and the agreement you made with this man i made no agreement with him then why was he here on the night of the murder it was an accident for some reason of his own dr binjoy whom i met at taxtononthames was in the habit of changing his name when in london he usually stayed with dr turnor who is an old friend of his and did his work when turnor was absent when i found out the murder i sent for dr turnor he was away and dr binjoy came under his name of renshaw i was astonished to see him i did not know that he was in town oh had you any reason to go to mere hall to see him mere hall stammered mrs boazoph you saw me at mere hall i saw you with my own eyes you cannot deny that i have no wish to deny it retorted mrs boazoph with asperity yes i was at mere hall i went there to warn binjoy against you indeed and no doubt binjoy assured you that he had baffled me by the pretended journey to bombay yes he said that and did he say that he had sent his negro caesar to bombay in his place mrs boazoph drew back and gasped holding tightly on to the arms of her chair you know that she said in alarm i know that and a great deal more said fanks grimly in fact i more than suspect that i know the assassin then you know that caesar killed sir gregory you jump to conclusions mrs boazoph said fanks noting the tone of relief in which she made this remark i do not know that caesar killed sir gregory fellenger but i know that both you and dr binjoy would like me to think so man man cried mrs boazoph with an hysterical laugh do you think that i had anything to do with this crime why not the man was killed in your house you called in a doctor who is the dearest friend of the present baronet it was to binjoys interest that sir gregory should be got out of the way again mrs boazoph seemed relieved then you suppose that binjoy instructed caesar to kill sir gregory no i do not caesar had nothing to do with the commission of the crime then who was the black man who killed the baronet it was no black man but it was said mrs boazoph angrily i saw him myself enter the room you saw a white man disguised as a negro enter the room mrs boazoph bounded to her feet what she cried do you mean to say that the black man was a disguised white man yes i do say so although i daresay it is no news to you mrs boazoph stamped her foot it is news to me i tell you i thought that caesar killed sir gregory at the behest of dr binjoy when you entered the room i hoped to keep the fact from you because i did not wish binjoy to get into trouble but you say that caesar did not commit the crime and so you have upset my ideas altogether now mr fanks i tell you truly that if this negro did not kill sir gregory i do not know the name of the assassin fanks looked puzzled she evidently spoke in all good faith and he could not but believe her he wondered if she was right and whether the negro of dr binjoy had killed the baronet after all did you recognise as caesar the black man who came here on that night he asked no how could i i never saw caesar in my life but i know that binjoy had a negro servant that he smuggled him off to bombay and that he was the friend of sir louis fellenger therefore i thought this negro was the instrument binjoy made use of to kill sir gregory do you know anything about a tattooed cross mrs boazoph asked fanks going on another tack the woman fell into her chair as pale as a sheet of paper the mention of the tattooed cross had a most powerful effect on her mind and she stared thunderstruck at the detective not a word could she utter for at least two minutes when she spoke her voice was thick and unsteady what do you know of the tattooed cross she muttered i know that sir gregory let this disguised man tattoo a cross on his left arm and that the needle used was poisoned now can you tell me why sir gregory let a cross be pricked on his arm no no iicant tell you that does that mean that you wont tell me itmeans that iicant tell you gasped mrs boazoph i did not know sir gregory fellenger do you know anyone else who has a cross tattooed on his left arm asked fanks preparing for his great stroke no why do you ask me she muttered in a terrified tone because the man who has that cross tattooed on his left arm was the disguised negro he was the man who killed sir gregory ah heavens oh edward hersham moaned mrs boazoph and fell upon the floor in a faint chapter xxiii the confession of hersham when fanks saw mrs boazoph lying at his feet his first intention was to wait until she recovered later on he changed his mind and when he had placed her in the hands of the servant he went home full of thought and dark surmises it seemed to him that the case was centring in ted hersham that the whole situation depended on the right reading of the tattooed cross riddle mrs boazoph knew something about the cross she knew something about hersham but what it was fanks could by no means make up his mind it seemed to him that in exploring the depths of mrs boazophs mind he had found a still lower deep and he was puzzled what to think confound the woman he thought meditating over a pipe i said that we should find her at the end of the path which leads to the discovery of the mystery and it seems that i was right she screened binjoy for some reason which i cannot discover she will now attempt to save hersham lest he should fall into my clutches why should she take all this trouble for those two men and what does she know about the tattooed cross does binjoy know about it also and was it he who made the obliterating mark i cant think hersham guilty and yet things look black against him but no said fanks rising the disguised man who slew in tooleys alley and hersham are two different people i proved that conclusively to garth whats to be done now it was difficult to decide at first he almost resolved to return to mrs boazoph and urge her confession again he thought it best to wait until he heard what hersham had to say it might be he thought that hershams confession would throw some light on his relation to mrs boazoph the hints of anne colmer the terror of hersham the fainting of mrs boazoph were all of a piece and fanks felt confident that beneath these perplexities lay the key to the riddle it was not that he had no clue he was in reality quite bewildered by the multiplicity of clues so bewildered that he did not know which clue to seize first at length he came to the conclusion that it would be best to wait till he saw hersham and heard what he had to say and afterwards to follow up the clue placed in his hands by the fainting of mrs boazoph ill write to hersham and remind him that he promised to see me in a few days and tell the truth said fanks going to his desk and if he reveals all i am certain that his confession will contain the information that mrs boazoph wrote and warned him against me he was confident as he said that she would do this if she tried to save binjoy she would certainly try to help hersham but her reason for doing the one was as inscrutable as her reason had been for acting in the way she did towards binjoy the further he went into the case the darker it grew and in sheer despair fanks wrote his reminder to hersham and did nothing more for the next few days but meditate over the tangle in which he found himself involved his meditations led to no result and when hersham called on him at the duke street chambers in three days the detective was at his wits end how to proceed however he was delighted to see hersham as he had doubted whether the young man would fulfil his promise now that he had come to do so there might be some chance of seeing a gleam of light fanks did not tell the journalist what he had discovered concerning his movements on the night of the twentyfirst as he wanted to see if hersham would confess as much if he did so such frankness would confirm his belief that the young fellow had nothing to do with the commission of the crime if on the other hand hersham concealed the proven facts fanks intended to force him into confession by revealing what he had heard from berry jawkins by the result he would be guided in his future movements the ensuing conversation was likely to prove as interesting and important as that which he had held with mrs boazoph i am glad to see you hersham he said in a gentle tone as i hope what you have to tell me may throw some light on the darkness of this tooley alley crime i can throw no light on the cursed thing said hersham gloomily i am only here to exonerate myself from what what do you mean why should you ask me that said hersham angrily is it not you who suspect me of killing this man decidedly not i do not think you killed fellenger as i told you before i do not believe you had anything to do with it then why did you have me watched demanded the young man ask that of yourself said fanks coolly you roused my suspicions you hinted that you knew something you thwarted me with regard to anne colmer cast your mind back to our first conversation man you will say that i had every reason for acting as i did if you had told me the truth at first had you become my ally instead of my enemy you would not have had all this trouble but for all that i do not suspect you of being a murderer had i done so finished fanks you would have been in a cell long eer this i held my tongue because i was afraid of you said hersham sullenly if you are innocent there is no reason to be afraid of me i am innocent and yet i am afraid of you yes i am dreading to tell you what i am about to reveal why so circumstances may so close round an innocent man continued hersham not heeding the interruption that it would seem as though he were guilty think yourself fanks innocent men have been hanged eer now because circumstantial evidence was strong against them true enough replied fanks i suppose it is natural that you should be afraid no man would run the risk of putting his head into the noose if he could help it you say that circumstances are strong against you what are these circumstances hersham bit his lip and turned a wan face on his friend i place my life in your hands mind you he said hoarsely it will be safe there replied fanks getting up and fetching a decanter of brandy from the sideboard nothing will induce me to believe that you had anything to do with the commission of this crime will you swear to that cried hersham stretching out a shaking hand certainly if it will comfort you here my friend drink this and tell me what you know it may help me to nab the person i have my eye on hersham drank the brandy have you found out who killed fellenger fanks shrugged his shoulders i think so he said but who can tell i may be wrong is it a man or woman asked hersham quickly i shant tell you is it i shant tell you my friend but i shall tell you this for the quieting of your fears that it is not you whom i suspect now sit down again and let me hear what you have to say hersham resumed his seat obediently and began his recital he confessed exactly what fanks expected he would confess what fanks already knew but the detective listened to this twicetold tale with the keenest attention thereby he hoped to learn some new detail which had been overlooked by the zealous berry jawkins about the beginning of june said hersham in a hesitating voice i was engaged on a series of papers for the morning planet on street music to gain the information i required i thought it would be an excellent plan to go about the streets of london in guise and to get at the root of the matter i told my editor that i would burntcork my face and go with some street minstrels he approved of the idea and i did so and how were you dressed in a great coat with brass buttons i also wore brown boots now you can see why i was afraid to tell you that is the dress the negro you are looking for wore yes said flanks perplexedly i know that but i do not see why you should have been afraid to tell me you can explain your movements on that night that is exactly what i cant do said hersham his face growing dark i dont understand i shall explain on the night of the twentyfirst i intended to go out in the streets in disguise before doing so i told the office boy that if a telegram came for me he was to bring it at once to me i expected a wire about six oclock and i told the boy that i would be in the strand near st clements church from whom did you expect the telegram from anne colmer that day i had received a letter from her saying that she was greatly worried about something what it was she did not tell me but she said that if she wanted me she would wire and that i was then to come down at once to taxtononthames go on said fanks greatly interested in the introduction of annes name well i blacked my face and went out with the genuine niggers to sing and play about six or a little after i was near st clements church and there the office boy came to me with a telegram why did you expect the telegram at six because i was in the office about five and it had not come then i thought it might come after i left so i appointed st clements church as the meetingplace where the boy might find me and you obeyed what was in the telegram a request that i should come down to taxtononthames at once yes there was no reason why i should not i thought that anne was in trouble i went down at once on my bicycle why did not you go by train it would have been easier not for me i was in the habit of running down to taxtononthames on my machine it is only two hours run had you your machine in town yes i had left it at a shop in the strand where i usually leave it though sometimes i ride it on to the office in fleet street on this occasion it was in the strand as soon as i got the telegram i left my troupe and went off on my bicycle didnt you wash your face not at that time i was in such a hurry and so anxious to learn what was the matter with anne that i did not think of doing so i rode along until i was recalled to the spectacle i must have presented by the laughing and the guying of the boys then i thought that i might startle anne and i determined to wash myself and did you not immediately on the way to richmond i had an accident and the tyre of my back wheel was punctured the air escaped and i was over an hour mending it then i had to go slowly and did not get to richmond till after eight oclock i went into the hotel called the eight bells and had a drink and a wash then i came out a white man to the astonishment of the barman and went on down to taxtononthames i got there shortly after nine oclock didnt you nearly run over a man as you neared the village yes i did said hersham in some astonishment but how do you know that ill tell you later on replied fanks smiling but about the result of your trip to taxtononthames hershams face fell there was no result he said in a low voice when i arrived i went at once to briar cottage and asked for anne i was told that she had gone up to town by the five oclock train gone up to town repeated fanks that is curious why did she go up to town after sending you a wire to bring you down i cant say she returned by the night train and i was at the station to meet her i asked her why she had gone to town and she refused to tell me she merely said that she had sent the wire shortly before five oclock and that she had found occasion to go up by the five train can you conjecture what took her to town no and she will not tell me fanks said nothing he was meditating on the strange story told to him by hersham and on the stranger conduct of anne colmer the mystery concerning this young lady which had begun in the chambers of sir gregory seemed to be thickening fanks was puzzled and gloomy chapter xxiv the clue of the handwriting on concluding the recital of his movements on the night of the twentyfirst of june hersham looked anxiously at fanks to see what the detective thought of the matter the latter made no immediate comment whereupon the journalist impatient of the silence made the first observation i have told you all he said now what is your opinion let me think for a minute or two replied fanks holding up his hand i must consider thereupon he thrust his hands into his pockets and strolled to the window where he stood looking absently at the adjacent chimneypots hersham eyed him with continued anxiety but he did not dare to interrupt so that fanks had ample time to reflect over the strange story which had been related to him he had heard the main facts of it before from berry jawkins and these corresponded entirely with the narrative of the journalist still the additional evidence concerning anne colmer disquieted fanks not a little her behaviour was strange to say the least of it and far more suspicious than that of hersham why had she sent a telegram to withdraw her lover from london at the very time of the committal of the crime and why had sheso to speaknullified that telegram by going herself to town almost immediately after she had despatched it such conduct was decidedly suspicious and it looked as though she was implicated in the matter in some underhand way why had she behaved in so mysterious a fashion and why had she refused to reveal her reason for so acting to hersham so far so good but there remained a greater mystery it was anne colmer herself who had instructed hersham to confess to fanks yet she must have known that her very extraordinary conduct would need explanation but would she explain fanks thought not he recalled his conversation with her how she had refused to speak lest her evidencewhatever it wasshould be detrimental to an innocent person clearly that innocent person could not be hersham for he had established his innocence in the eyes of the detective then if the person in question was not hersham who could heor shebe mrs colmer dr binjoy anne or caesar the missing negro not the first thought fanks decidedly not the first for mrs colmer was confined to her room by paralysis and could not take an active part in the business scarcely the second for anne could have no reason to screen the doctorat least no reason that fanks could even guess at if the thirdand seeing that mrs boazoph was her aunt it might be sothe motive might be that anne desired aid to carry out a scheme of revenge against the destroyer of her sister as to caesar fanks had quite settled in his own mind that the negro was innocent and that his personality was being made use of merely to screen the chief actor or actors in the tragedy the result of fanks meditations therefore resulted in his having an increased suspicion of mrs boazoph her behaviour at the time of the discovery of the murder her visit to mere hall and her fainting at the mention that hersham was the probable criminalall these things were suspicious and now the probable visit of anne colmer to her auntalthough such visit was not yet provedclinched the matter all the interest of fanks now centred in mrs boazoph and he addressed himself again to hersham in the hope of learning something tangible likely to connect her more intimately with her niece either in london or at taxtononthames he was right to act in this way an indefinable instinct had placed him on the right path i wish you had told me of this before he said to hersham as he resumed his seat it would have saved me a lot of trouble i did not wish to tell you i was afraid to speak lest i should inculpate myself i am sure my movements on that fatal night must appear very suspicious to you what is your opinion of me now the same as before i am satisfied that you have told me the truth no hersham it is not you whom i suspect then who is it asked the young man eagerly ill tell you that later on replied finks in the meantime you must answer a few more questions i am not yet quite clear on some points how did you obtain your disguise oh that was miss colmers suggestion the deuce it was said fanks rather startled at this admission yes i told her of my idea to disguise myself in order to obtain a thoroughly realistic description of street music and of those who make it i asked her how she thought i should dress in a halflaughing way she advised me to take binjoys servant caesar as my model which you did certainly i thought the suggestion a good one caesar was rather an oddity in his way and dressed with that mixture of vivid colours which is so dear to the black race when off duty he usually wore a red neck scarf a brown felt hat black trousers and a long green coat with large brass buttons quite a noticeable garb in fact he had several of these quaint garments and he had brought one to annes establishment to get yellow velvet cuffs and collar sewn on to it on the promise that i would not keep it more than a fortnight anne lent me the coat which i wore for my purpose strange said fanks thoughtfully so you wore the very coat of the man whom we suspected in the first instance i did it is odd now that you mention it fanks considered did anyone suggest your disguising yourself as a negro for this street music business or was it your own fancy it was the suggestion of dr binjoy oh was it humph i am beginning to see daylight why you dont think i think nothing at present said fanks quickly matters are in too crude a state this observation was hardly true for fanks was beginning to think that the affair of the green coat looked singularly like a conspiracy he was unwilling to communicate his suspicions to hersham because of necessity they included anne colmer therefore he passed the matter off as before mentioned nevertheless he thought it doubtful that the disguise was the result of an accident that binjoy should suggest the idea of blackening the face that anne should induce hersham to dress up in the very clothes of caesar both these things seemed suspicious and quite impossible to understand he could guess binjoys object presuming that binjoy had designed the murderit was to avert suspicion from himself and servant by throwing it on hersham but what fanks could not see was why anne should act as she did when hersham was her lover she surely did not wish to implicate hersham in the matterif it could be presumed that she was connected with it herself of which fanks was by no means sureand yet fanks was honestly puzzled to understand the action so at variance with her position with his usual sense he therefore abandoned the subject for the present and readdressed himself to the examination of hersham did you know dr binjoy i did and disliked him greatly i dont think he liked me either added hersham smiling for i was his successful rival with miss colmer yes fancy that old man fell in love with anne and wished to marry her asked her to be mrs binjoy four or five times in fact like his impudence wasnt it however anne told him that she was engaged to me and sent him off with a flea in his ear i dont think he liked me any better for my triumph no said fanks dryly i have no doubt he would do his best to injure you fanks do you think he designedly induced me to act as a duplicate of caesar that i cant say it looks suspicious his being at the red star on the night of the murder under an assumed name is still more suspicious all the same he has managed the business so cleverly that i can bring nothing home to him do you think that he designed the murder of fellenger so as to get the estates for sir louis his actions bear that interpretation said fanks scratching his chin but i have no proof as yet i may find out at mere hall are you going there next week i wish to see my employer sir louis and tell him what i have done at the same time i intend to observe binjoy by the way added the detective did you like sir louis hersham shrugged his shoulders so so he replied he is a dry stick wrapped up in his scientific studies he passes most of his days with binjoy in the laboratory making experiments a tall stout fellow he is not at all like a dryasdust savant humph said fanks twisting his ring a tall stout creature dr binjoy is also tall and stout yes and so is the negro caesar the trio are all fat and healthy humph said fanks again i wonderbut that is impossible what is impossible something that came into my head what it is does not matter i shall no doubt prove its impossibility at mere hall you suspect sir louis such a suspicion did cross my mind but as sir louis is employing me to hunt down the murderer he would hardly act in such a way never mind that at the present moment hersham but tell me if you have written to your father about the tattooed cross no i have not done so yet i dont see how my father can help you i am of another opinion said fanks dryly it is my firm conviction that the whole secret of that murder in tooley alley lies in the explanation of that tattooed cross do not look so scared hersham i do not suspect your father i should think not said hersham fiercely fanks laughed indulgently in nowise offended with the indignant tone adopted by the young man indeed he rather admired him for being so ready to take up the cudgels on behalf of his parent nevertheless he stuck to his point as he was determined to fathom the meaning of the tattooed cross and he saw no one was so likely to help him to an interpretation as the rev george hersham vicar of fairview isle of wight you must do as i ask he said and write to your father i must know why he had that cross tattooed on your arm i dont believe my father had anything to do with it said hersham angrily however as you insist on it i shall go home and see him if he tells me i shall tell you if he refuses as he has done before in that case ill come down to fairview and see him myself as you please said hersham with a feigned air of indifference but real vexation ill do my best i can do no more dont be angry old fellow i dont wish to vex either you or your father but you must see that it is important that i should know the meaning of this cross you will go and see mr hersham yes before the end of the week will that content you yes replied fanks in his turn and now before you go just tell me if you received a letter from mrs boazoph and if you have brought it with you now it is strange that you should have guessed that said hersham in astonishment i did get a letter from mrs boazoph i brought it to see what you thought of it it quite slipped my memory till you spoke of it here it is came yesterday from fairview from fairview repeated fanks making no attempt to take the letter which hersham held towards him was it sent to that address yes care of my father who forwarded it on to me see for yourself did mrs boazoph know of your address in the isle of wight no thats odd added hersham staring at fanks how did she get it from miss colmer i have never given any but my london address to miss colmer i had my reasons for not doing so so mrs boazoph knew of your address without your telling her said the detective stretching out his hand for the letter queer if i am not mistaken iby jove what is the matter wait wait said fanks in great excitement let me read the letter first my word here is a discovery what discovery asked hersham staring at the letter but fanks paid no attention to him he was already devouring the communication from the landlady of the red star which ran as follows dear mr edward hershamcome and see me at once important business and in the meantime hold no communication with the man who calls himself fanks i will explain when we meetyours louisa boazoph i wish you had shown me this before said fanks i was so anxious about what i had to confess that i forgot fanks is it important i should think so you must see her at once and tell me what she says we may find the key to the whole business in her conversation do you think mrs boazoph has anything to do with it for answer fanks got out the photograph of the dead emma calvert and the envelope which had contained the red star he pointed out the handwritings on both to hersham you see that he said eagerly the handwriting on the back of the portrait and that on the envelope are the same as that on your letter true enough said hersham examining the three objects closely but what of that only this that mrs boazoph addressed the envelope and enclosed the red cardboard star which lured the late sir gregory fellenger to his death on the evening of the twentyfirst of june chapter xxv at mere hall hants fanks was rather astonished when he learned that mrs boazoph had contrived the lure which had drawn fellenger to his death he had given the landlady credit for more cleverly concealing her scheme and that she should have carried out a plan so compromising in so open a manner seemed to him to be the height of folly nevertheless he was pleased that he had discovered who had directed the fatal envelope and he was still more pleased that mrs boazoph had sent for hersham if possible he intended to learn her reason for seeking an interview and to ascertain why she had fainted at the intelligence that hersham was likely to be arrested for committing the crime a true report of that conversationand fanks had no doubt that hersham would repeat it faithfully to himmight afford the clue to the mystery at the present moment fanks was convinced that the landlady of the red star could unravel the riddle if she chose and he was resolved to force her to do so but here an element on which fanks had not calculated came into play as instructed by the detective hersham duly called at the red star only to be informed that mrs boazoph was dangerously ill and could not see him this he reported to fanks and at first the detective deemed the illness an excuse to postpone the interview the more especially as dr turnor was the medical man in attendance he mistrusted turnor as much as he did binjoy and thought that the former had persuaded mrs boazoph to relinquish the idea of seeing and confiding in hersham such confidence might prove as fatal to turnor as to binjoy and if so there was no doubt that turnor had compelled mrs boazoph to hold her tongue lest she should compromise him thus fanks argued out the situation and he sought tooleys alley to ascertain if mrs boazoph was really ill or merely feigning at the order of turnor a view of the sick woman showed him plainly that he was wrong mrs boazoph was laid on a bed of sickness incapable almost of speech and fanks concluded promptly that there was no chance of learning anything until she recovered the result of the last interview had shaken her terribly and she was thoroughly worn out with nervous prostration turnor more like a ferret than ever eyed fanks complacently and seemed relieved that things were going so badly for the case fanks questioned him but could learn nothing definite for if the detective was clever the doctor was cleverer and defeated fanks on every point indeed he carried the war into the camp of the enemy i suppose i am right in ascribing this illness to you sir he said with a sly smile it seems that my patient fainted at her last interview she had with you she did i said something which startled her that was very wrong of you mr fanks mrs boazoph is a woman of delicate organisation and a sudden shock might bring about her death she has a weak heart i am sorry to hear so sir retorted fanks gloomily i counted on gaining some information from her do you think she will soon recover not for some time said turnor in a satisfied tone i presume you wish to learn something from her relative to the case you have in hand you are quite right i do wish to learn something relative to the murder which took place in this hotel but if mrs boazoph cannot tell me what i wish to know you may be able to do so dr turnor spread out his hands in a deprecating manner i my dear friend he said what can i know about the case as much as dr renshaw could tell you retorted fanks fixing turnor with his keen eye dr renshaw told me nothing because he knew nothing i have my own opinion about that dr turnor really i thought you were satisfied that my friend had nothing to do with the matter he went to india you know are you sure he went to india dr turnor oh yes he will be soon be at bombay i got a letter from him at aden where he changed into the clyde no doubt said fanks affably i expect you will hear from him when he is settled in bombay certainly renshaw and i are great friends i am sure of that you confide your secrets to one another and work in unison what do you mean by working in unison mr fanks said turnor drawing himself up i dont think i need afford you any explanation dr turnor you are playing a dangerous game sir you insult me sir is it possible to insult you dr turnor sneered fanks ill make you prove your words said turnor with rather a pale face there will not be much difficulty in doing thatat the proper time the ferret of a man eyed fanks nervously and savagely do you think i have anything to do with the matter of sir gregorys death he burst out ill tell you that when i return from mere hall was fanks reply mere hall repeated turnor betraying himself which was the reason fanks had mentioned the name what do you know of mere hall that is just what i wish to ask you what do you know of mere hall sir nothing nothing i merely repeated your words in a very singular fashion doctor the little man turned away with a scowl i shall defend myself from your insinuations he said in a stifled voice if you suspect me say so suspect you of what asked fanks innocently you speak in riddles turnor pointed to the woman lying on the bed perhaps mrs boazoph can solve them he said perhaps she can retorted fanks with equal coolness and i trust it will not be to your disadvantage when the answers come i can look after myself mr fanks said turnor and left the room without the detective making any effort to detain him fanks was suspicious of turnor from his connection with the socalled renshaw and this conversation went a long way towards confirming these suspicions however as he wished to go to mere hall and follow up the binjoy clue he had no time to attend to the turnor matter nevertheless on leaving tooleys alley he sought out crate and instructed him to look after the doctor find out his financial position said fanks what kind of practice he has how he lives what kind of character he bears and all about him very well mr fanks said crate noting the instructions down and what about mrs boazoph keep an eye on her and should she recover so far as to see mr hersham or to journey to taxtononthames let me know you can write or wire me at the pretty maid inn damington thats near mere hall aint it sir a quarter of a mile away i shall stay there some time to watch binjoy and sir louis fellenger do you suspect him mr fanks if you remember the name i mentioned you would not ask me that crate the underling was abashed and said no more but turned the conversation to the subject of garth what am i to do about him sir oh said fanks dryly you think he is guilty so i will leave him to you but do not neglect my interests to look after that business i tell you crate the man is innocent i have my own opinion about that then keep to your opinion but mind my instructions well i will tell you one thing sir said crate mr garth has left town you dont say so said fanks frowning he did not say that he was going away where has he gone to i cant tell you that sir i lost him but ill tell you where he hasnt goneand that is to taxtononthames i didnt expect he would go there but it does not matter i have my hands full without thinking of garth i leave him to you in the meantime goodbye i am off to hampshire fanks arrived at damington about five oclock and put up at the pretty maid inn as he had done before when following binjoy in the disguise of a parson but thanks to his cleverness in making up no one at the inn suspected that he was the same man the landladya genial soul with a plump person and a kindly face quite an ideal landlady of the dickens typewelcomed him without suspicion as a gentleman come down for the fishing and detailed all the gossip of the neighbourhood she was especially conversant with the affairs of sir louis fellenger such a nice gentleman said mrs prisom rather melancholy and given to hard study which aint good for a young man but he comes here and takes a glass with a kind word and a smile always does dr binjoy come over with him said fanks oh yes sir i am sorry to see that the doctor aint well lately he looks pale and mopeylike seems as if he had something on his mind and what do you think he has on his mind mrs prisom well it aint for me to say sir but i should think as he was sorry he and sir louis did not get on so well as they might what makes you think they do not get on well said fanks pricking up his ears it is the way they look at one another said mrs prisom reflectively and they say dr binjoy is going away though what sir louis will do without him i dont know dr binjoy going away murmured fanks rather startled now what is that for mrs prisom could not tell him she could only say that the doctor was departing from mere hall that day week and that it was reported in the village that he had quarrelled seriously with sir louis though of course added mrs prisom it may not be true i must see to this thought fanks i wonder if this sudden departure has anything to do with the murder is it a case of thieves falling out i must keep my eyes open after which resolution he asked the landlady if she was well acquainted with the fellenger family i should think so said mrs prisom with pride i knew that poor young man who was murdered in that wicked london as well as i know myself a noble gentleman but wild ah me sighed mrs prisom just like his father did you know sir gregorys father did i know sir gregorys father echoed mrs prisom contemptuously do i know the nose on my face sir the late sir francis and myself were playmates yes you may well look astonished sir but it is the truth i was the daughter of the steward at mere hall and i was brought up with the late sir francis almost like brother and sister i could tell you many a good story of him finished mrs prisom with a nod and a smile you must do so said fanks returning the smile i am fond of stories the fact is he was wondering if he could find the motive for the murder in the family history of the fellengers many great families had secrets which if divulged might lead to trouble and it might be that the mere hall folks secret had to do with the tattooed cross if it proved to be so then fanks thought there might be a chance of penetrating the mystery of sir gregorys death the family secret and the death in tooleys alley were widely apart but there might be a connecting link between them at present hidden from his gaze at all events it was worth while examining mrs prisom and hearing her story this fanks resolved to do that evening but in the meantime he left the garrulous landlady and went out for a stroll in the direction of mere hall it was not his intention to see sir louis on that evening but rather to wait till the morning nevertheless he had a desire to look again at the splendid mansion of the fellengers more to pass away the time than with any ulterior motive in the calm twilight he strolled along and soon left the village behind him his way lay through flowery hedges bright with the blossoms of summer and under the influence of the hour and the beauty of the landscape fanks quite forgot that he was at damington for the purpose of unmasking a murderer from his dreams he was rudely awakened and brought back to real life as he sauntered along swinging his stick he saw a man ahead whose figure and gait seemed to be familiar in the clear brown twilight he could see fairly well and so it appeared could the man he was looking at for the figure made a pause and jumped over the hedge fanks wondered at this for he had noted that the figure was that of a gentleman or at all events someone other than a labourer with his usual suspicion and as much out of curiosity as anything else fanks jumped over the hedge also whereupon the stranger began to run across the fields by this time fanks was thoroughly convinced that something was wrong so he gave chase at once with a chuckle of delight at the excitement of the adventure across the green meadow they raced and fanks saw the man fading into the dim twilight he redoubled his sped so did the fellow but in the next field fanks found that he was gaining the fugitive sprang over another hedge with fanks close on his heels but when the detective landed he could see nothing of the stranger a backward glance showed him that the man had doubled and was running along beside the hedge the next instant fanks was following on his trail and although the mysterious figure made the greatest efforts to escape fanks drew closer then an accident brought the race to an end for the man stumbled over a clod and rolled on the grass the next moment fanks panting for breath stood over him the detective peered down to see who it was he had caught and to his surprise he recognised garth chapter xxvi mrs prisoms story what the deuce are you doing here asked the detective angrily and why did you run away when you saw me as to my being here replied garth sitting up and wiping his face i came down to watch my cousin of whom i was suspicious and i ran away because on catching sight of you in the twilight i took you for louis fellenger oh and for what purpose are you down here i have told you i suspect that my cousin through his medical friend is concerned in the murder of sir gregory fanks frowned and garth having got on his feet they walked on together he wished that garth would leave the case to him and resented the presence of the young lawyer on the spot where are you staying he asked abruptly at the pretty maid inn i suppose you are there also as it is the only comfortable lodging in the village yes i am there and now as i have dropped across you we may as well go back to supper i had intended having a look at the hall but on second thoughts i shall go back with you to pump mrs prisom i know mrs prisom very well said garth she is an old servant of our family but i do not see what you can learn from her i may learn nothing on the other hand i may learn a great deal she was well acquainted with the father of the late baronet and she was well acquainted with my mother and with the father of the present baronet but in what way do you expect her to help you well ill tell you i want to find out if there is anything in the family history of the fellengers likely to have induced sir gregory to submit to that tattooing i am a member of the family and i dont know of any reason said garth mrs prisom belongs to a generation before you replied fanks and it is possible that she may know something of course it is only fancy on my part still a drowning man clutches a straw and i am clutching at this we may learn something garth shook his head he knew the history of his family and there was nothing he could recall likely to touch on the subject of a tattooed cross mrs prisom received them both with great dignity and in half an hour they were seated at a wellspread table both did justice to the viands set before them and during the progress of the meal they chattered about the case while they were thus conversing fanks elicited an important fact concerning sir louis i dont know why you should suspect your cousin he said in reply to a remark of garths mr vaud told us that both sir louis and binjoy were at taxtononthames on the night of the murder the first was ill and the second was in attendance true enough replied garth frankly all the same you proved that binjoy was masquerading in london on the evening of the twentyfirst yes it is strange that sir louis should say that binjoy never left his side i suppose you suspect your cousin on that account by no means i suspect my cousin because he was himself in london on that night fanks leaned back in his chair and stared at the barrister what is that you say he cried was sir louis in tooleys alley on that evening oh i wont go so far as that but louis certainly went up to london on that night i found that out from mrs jerusalem and who is mrs jerusalem she was the housekeeper of sir louis at taxtononthames when he came in for the title he brought her here i saw her yesterday and she inadvertently admitted that much how did you get that out of her well it was a fluke she is an old servant of our family like mrs prisom i met her while out walking and she recognised me i made her promise not to tell sir louis that i was here but what excuse did you make none said garth coolly ill tell you a secret fanks mrs jerusalem likes me and hates sir louis she was a fostersister of my mothers and she desires to see me in the place of my scientific cousin indeed said fanks eyeing garth in a strange manner and has she done anything likely to forward your interest in that respect i suppose you mean to hint that she would like to clear sir louis out of my path by accusing him of the murder said garth coolly well you are about right mrs jerusalem connects the absence of sir louis from taxtononthames with the death of sir gregory she saw the report of the inquest you know she recognisedas she thinksthe description of binjoys servant caesar and by putting two and two together she told me yesterday that it is her firm convictionon the slightest of proofs rememberthat louis killed gregory by means of the black man humph said fanks thoughtfully i must see this lady but if she dislikes sir louis and binjoy why does she stay in the service of the former garth shrugged his shoulders one must live he said and mrs jerusalem has a very easy time of it with my cousin when my mother died and we were as poor as rats my father got louiss father to take mrs jerusalem into his service and she has been there ever since oh she will not tell my cousin that i am here concluded garth with a satisfied nod mrs prisom may suggested fanks you may be sure that a good deal of gossip goes on between inn and hall how long have you been here about three days then you may be certain that your cousin knows of your presence in the village if he has any danger to fear from you he will take his measures accordingly i dont like your mrs jerusalem garth she ought to be true to her salt i cant help that retorted garth sulkily she would willingly keep house for me if i had a house to keep but as i have not she stays where she is but what do you think of her suspicions do yours point in the same way they did not replied fanks promptly but your discovery of sir louiss visit to town on that night puts quite a different complexion on the case all the same i can come to no conclusion until i see this spy of yours she isnt a spy said garth gloomily i did not drag the information out of the creature she thought that she was doing me a good turn by betraying my cousin she thinks that if he killed gregory he ought to suffer and let me have the property and what do you think asked fanks with a keen glance i dont want to build up my life on the ruins of another mans it is a bad foundation i know you believe that i wish to get my cousin into trouble but you are wrong i would help louis to escape if i could there may be no necessity for that we have proved nothing against him as yet i hardly think that a man who has committed a crime would put down money to hunt out himself and thereby lose the benefit he gained by his wickedness no no garth i do not believe sir louis is such a guilty fool however i shall give my opinion when i see him and question mrs jerusalem will you tell my cousin that i am here certainly there is nothing to be gained by concealment you only place your honour in the hands of that jerusalem creature and make yourself her accomplice however i am ready to bet you that sir louis knows you are here through mrs prisom garth made no reply but stating that he was weary went off to bed the detective left alone thought over what he had been told and found himself unable to come to any conclusion he did not like the way in which garth was acting but all the same he believed that the lawyer had no ill intentions towards his cousin despite crates opinion to the contrary the young man laughed as he thought how he had picked up the trail of garth when it had been lost by the astute crate i am afraid that crate will never make a success of the detective business thought fanks lighting his pipe but i dont agree with him about garth and i dont agree with garth about sir louis certainly it is strange that sir louis should have feigned illness and shielded binjoy and then have gone up to town on that night what the deuce were he and his medical friend doing there dr turnor knows i believe that sir louis was alone with binjoy in the great auk street house it is odd to say the least of it i wonder if that negro was the actual caesar or binjoy or sir louis in disguise at all events he wasnt hersham for that young man has exonerated himself clearly enough hm ill reserve my decision as to mrs jerusalems story till i see sir louis perhaps the secret of the crime is to be found at mere hall after all no no no said fanks getting on his feet with an emphatic stamp the secret is connected with that tattooed cross i wonder who can tell us about it at this moment as if in answer to his query the door opened and mrs prisom came in to clear away the dinner things as a rule she left this duty to the parlour maid but as garth an offshoot of the great fellenger family was dining under her roof she would let no one but herself attend to him she looked surprised when she saw that garth was not in the room at once fanks explained the absence of his friend mr garth has retired to bed he said as he is very tired i shall go myself soon as your country air makes me sleepy but at present i should like to have a chat with you mrs prisom mrs prisom smiled in an expansive manner and expressed the honour she felt at such a request adding that she dearly loved a chat all the better thought fanks as she cleared away the dishes you will be the more likely to tell me what i want to know in a few minutes the table was tidy and mrs prisom at fanks request had brought in her knitting he guessed that she would talk better with the needles clicking in her active hands and herein he judged wisely for thus employed mrs prisom would gossip for hours provided she had a good listener i suppose you knew the mother of mr garth said fanks plunging at once into the history of the fellenger family miss eleanor ah that i did but she was a proud young lady and didnt care to play with me even as a child because i was the daughter of the steward they were all proud the fellengers except sir francis that was sir gregorys father yes there was sir francis the eldest and the merry one mr michael the father of the present baronet sir louis he was proud too and then miss eleanor who married mr garth but i liked sir francis the best of all concluded the old lady with a sigh there was a look in her eyes as she said this which made fanks think that she had been in love with the gay baronet in the old days he was a bonny man sir francis fellenger she resumed never a maid but what he had a smile for and many a kiss did he take without the asking laughed mrs prisom oh he was a merry blade but all sailors have those ways was sir francis a sailor asked fanks suddenly he was a captain in the navy before he came into the title said mrs prisom then he settled down and married miss darmer a shropshire lady but she died poor soul when sir gregory was born and it was five weeks after her death that sir francis was killed by being thrown from his dogcart sir francis was a sailor asked fanks abruptly i suppose when he went to sea and came home a middy he had anchors and ships and true lovers knots and such like things tattooed upon his skin he just had replied mrs prisom laughing he had quite a fancy for that sort of thing he told me he learnt how to do it in japan he learnt how to do it echoed fanks leaning forward in his excitement yes yes and very clever he was at drawing such pictures on the skin i shall never forget how angered my mother was when sir francismaster francis he was theninsisted on pricking those blue marks on my arm did he do that demanded the detective little expecting what would follow he did sir the mark of it remains to this day and mrs prisom drew up the sleeve of her left arm fanks bent forward and saw tattooed thereona cross was he then about to unravel the mystery of the tattooed cross which had puzzled him for so long chapter xxvii mrs prisoms storycontinued fanks restrained his joy at this important discovery he was afraid lest mrs prisom should cease to speak should she think that the revelation was of consequence to him that she should have the same symbol as that possessed by hersham as that attempted on sir gregory appeared to hint at its owning a certain significance what that significance might be he now set himself to discover why did sir francis choose a cross to tattoo on your arm mrs prisom he asked as the old lady pulled down her sleeve i cannot say mr fanks i fancy it was because he could draw a cross better than anything else you see it is st catherines cross with four arms and a wheelat least that is what sir francis called it it is st catherines cross said fanks recalling the mark on hershams arm perhaps sir francis attached some meaning to it do you know if he tattooed anyone else with the same symbol at this remark mrs prisom suddenly desisted from her occupation and not only refused to speak but taxed fanks with trying to fathom her meaning for some ill purpose why should you come down here and ask questions about sir francis fellenger she asked with a troubled look why do you wish to know all these things there was no help for it if fanks wished to learn the truth he would have to tell her the real purpose of his visit and then out of love for the memory of sir francis she might do what she could to aid him to discover the person who had murdered sir gregory resolving to risk all on the casting of this die he spoke out boldly and to the point yet he approached the old lady with a certain amount of caution i have an important reason for asking you these questions he said in an earnest tone and i shall tell you my reason shortly but first say if you regretted the death of sir gregory i regretted it because he was the son of his father but i did not care over much for him he was a bad man mr fanks a very bad man i loved the father as an old playmate and as one who was always kind to me and mine but the sonah mrs prisom shook her head and sighed you know that he was murdered yes but they never found out who murdered him no they are trying to find out now you may be able to help me to do so help you said the old lady in a frightened tone who are you sir my name is fanks as you know mrs prisom but what you do not know is that i am a detective anxious to learn who killed sir gregory i know nothing of the murder sir i am a simple old body and cannot help you in any way oh yes you can mrs prisom you can help me by relating all you know about this tattooing but what can the death of sir gregory have to do with an old story of mans treachery and womans folly more than you think the whole secret of the death lies in the explanation of that tattooing come mrs prisom you must tell me all you know mrs prisom thought for a moment and then made up her mind ill do what i can said she those who are concerned in this tale are dead and gone and so long as it does not hurt the living i see no reason why i should not gratify your curiosity but i must ask you not to repeat what i tell you unless you are absolutely obliged to do so it is no good spreading family scandals but as you have appealed to me to help you to revenge the murder of my old playfellows son i will confide in you fanks assured mrs prisom that he would be as reticent as possible about her forthcoming history and would not use it unless compelled to do so satisfied on this point mrs prisom commenced at the same moment fanks took out his notebook to set down any important point the other person who was tattooed said mrs prisom was madaline garry fanks whistled softly and made a note in his book only a thought which struck me he explained madaline garry was she also tattooed with a cross yes sir madaline and jane garry were the daughters of old captain garry a retired naval officer who lived in damington i knew them both very well as we used to meet on terms of equality in parish work jane was the quiet one but madaline was a flighty girl fond of admiration and dress she attracted the attention of sir francis and it was thought at one time that he would marry her however he did not do so but brought home the lady from shropshire to mere hall still madaline must have been fond of him for she let him tattoo on her arm a cross similar to this one of mine i saw it one day while she was changing her dress and remarked it she said sir francis had pricked it on her arm as a sign that she was engaged to him and that it was like a wedding ring i warned her against sir francis and mentioned the lady of shropshire to whom he was said to be paying his addresses she laughed at this and said sir francis would marry her if he doesnt she added i shall know how to avenge myself did she know that you had a cross on your arm also oh yes i told her but i never expected to marry sir francis and he did me no harm i cant say the same of madaline he acted badly towards her i dont say that sir francis was a good man added mrs prisom in a hesitating manner but he was good to me he certainly should have married madaline garry did he go about tattooing all the girls he was in love with he was not in love with me rejoined mrs prisom with dignity and i only let him tattoo me because i was a schoolgirl and his old playfellow i knew no better then but madaline was a grown woman when he loved her and marked her with the cross i suppose it was to bind her to himnot that it did much good for shortly afterwards he married miss darmer and in a rage at his desertion madaline took up with an old admirerluke fielding was his nameand she married him almost on the same day that sir francis led his bride to the hall did she ever forgive him she said she did replied mrs prisom with hesitation but i have my doubts of that at all events she was stopping at the hall within the year of her marriage how was that well you see sir in nine months after the marriage mr fielding died leaving madaline with no money and a little child about the same time lady fellenger died at the birth of the dead sir gregory somebody was wanted as a nurse and madaline asked sir francis if she could come she was poor you see and wanted money although after the death of her husband she was living with her father at first sir francis would not let her comefeeling ashamedlike no doubtbut in some way she prevailed against him and went to the hall as the nurse to the heir and what about her own child she took him also by permission of sir francis oh was the child of madaline a son yes her son and that of sir francis were born almost on the same day she insisted that her son should come to the hall also so sir francis agreed in the end and madaline garry nursed the heirthat is the late sir gregory she did assented mrs prisom till sir francis was killed as i told you five weeks after the death of his wife his body was brought home and buried but almost immediately after the funeral madaline disappeared with her child she was never heard of again and i have no doubt that by this time she is dead how long ago is it since she disappeared asked fanks twentyeight years sir where she and the child went i do not know for she had no money poor soul i was sorry for her and her sister and captain garry captain garry died soon after madaline was his favourite child he never held up his head after she disappeared when the captain died miss jane went to some relatives in scotland and the heir sir gregory oh dr binjoy got another nurse for him fanks glanced up in astonishment dr binjoy he repeated was he here of course he was sir replied mrs prisom with a slight shade of surprise he was at the births of both madalines child and sir gregory afterwards when the father of sir louis died he asked dr binjoy to look after his son who was sickly the doctor agreed and he has been with sir louis ever since yet now they are about to part it seems strange doesnt it sir said mrs prisom but ever since dr binjoy has been here with sir louis they have got on badly i think it was the chemistry which kept them together for their characters are quite unlike one another you like sir louis yes but i dont like dr binjoy no not though i have known him for so many years he was a lover of madaline garry also but she would have nothing to do with him i am glad he is leaving sir louis was binjoy friendly with sir gregory i cant say sir i do not think he had much love for him because he was the heir and kept sir louis out of the property oh and no doubt binjoy wanted sir louis to have the property so that he could get a share of the money i think so sir they said that dr binjoy was always very gay and used to go to london to lead a fast life who said that did you ever go to taxtononthames no mrs jerusalem told me you know she was the housekeeper of the late mr garth and after his death she went to keep house for sir louis at taxtononthames when sir louis came in for the property he brought her here is she a native of this village oh yes she was a school friend of mine though i never liked her over much i believe she was in love with the late mr garth at all events she is devoted to his son i wonder she left him to keep house for sir louis but as poor young mr garth had no money i suppose she had to do the best she could for herself in fanks opinion the love of mrs jerusalem for the late mr garth explained why she was so anxious to benefit the son but it did not indicate why she should hate sir louis mrs prisoms next words enlightened him on this point it is more strange pursued mrs prisom because mr michael the father of sir louis treated mrs jerusalem very badly yes almost as badly as sir francis did madaline garry i wonder sir francis was not afraid that madaline garry would avenge herself for his treatment said fanks now satisfied as to the cause of mrs jerusalems hatred for sir louis i think he was afraid replied mrs prisom rising and rolling up her work i cant explain what he said to me in any other way what was that said fanks eagerly i was at the hall one day shortly after the death of lady fellenger said the landlady and i saw him in his study he was grieving greatly for the death of his wife but he also told me how pleased he was at the birth of an heir while he was talking madaline entered and spoke about something then she nodded to me and went away as the door closed after her sir francis looked anxious nancy he said turning to mehe always called me nancy said mrs prisom in parentheses nancy he said all in a flutter like if it should chance as i die and anything goes wrong about my son remember that cross i tattooed on your arm and if you want any further proof look in this desk just then we were interrupted and he did not say any more i never saw him again added mrs prisom with emotion for he was brought home dead that day week can you understand what he meant no sir said mrs prisom rising i can only say from the look he gave the door that he was afraid of madaline what he meant by the cross and the desk i know no more than you do but he was wrong in thinking that madaline would harm his childfor that was what he thought im surefor she went away a week after his death with her own and sir gregory grew into a fine young gentleman though wild very wild after which speech mrs prisom exclaiming that it was close on ten oclock left the room and fanks sat meditating over the strange history he had heard far into the night already he saw a connecting link between the story of madaline garry and the tragedy of tooleys alley chapter xxviii sir louis explains the outcome of fanks midnight meditations was that he resolved to devote himself entirely to following the clue afforded by mrs prisoms story of the tattooed cross the dead father had chosen the symbol of st catherines martyrdom for some unknown purpose the murdered son had perished while the same emblem was being tattooed on his arm for some reason he had wished to be marked in such a way and the murderer had taken advantage of the wish to inoculate the blood of his victim with a deadly poison if then fanks could learn the significance of the cross he might be able to fathom the mystery of the death the question he asked himself was whether he could find out the truth concerning the cross in the study of the late sir francis the warning which the dead man had given to mrs prisom seemed strange to the detective that it was dictated by fear of madaline garry he felt sure but as she had passed away and had foregone her vengeance it would seem that the warning was useless nevertheless fanks resolved to see the desk referred to by mrs prisom and to search for the evidence hinted at by sir francis also for reasons of his own which the reader may guess he wired to hersham at the fairview vicarage to seek an explanation from his father relative to the cross tattooed on his arm the tale of the reverend hersham might show why the special symbol of sir francis was figuring on the skin of a young man who had nothing to do with the fellengers and their mad freaks after concluding the first part of his scheme by despatching this letter fanks proceeded to the second and walked to mere hall to see the desk referred to by mrs prisom garth had refused to accompany the detective to the hall and gave his reason for such refusal it is no good my going he said i dont wish to see my cousin and if as you think he knows that i am here there is no longer any reason why i should stay in damington i shall go up to town by the midday train and leave you to find out if he has anything to do with the crime well as i know all you know and a great deal more besides i dont think it is necessary for you to stay said fanks dryly ill follow up the clue afforded by the malice of mrs jerusalem return to town by all means and if you want anything to do just join crate in watching the red star hotel in which mrs boazoph lies ill this garth promised readily enough much to the amusement of fanks as the latter was simply throwing him into the society of crate in order to afford that person a chance of learning the connectionif anyof garth with the crime he was assured in his own mind that garth was innocent but he was willing to afford crate some innocent amusement by setting him to find the mares nest of his own imagination when garth therefore departed fanks smiled in his own quiet way and went off to solve the more difficult riddle which awaited him at mere hall when he was nearing the hall a woman stepped out of a gap in the hedge almost in front of him she was dressed in a black silk dress with lavender coloured shawl over her shoulders and she wore also a bonnet of grey velvet made quaker fashion and close fitting over the ears but it was not at her dress that fanks looked he was staring at the most malignant countenance he ever saw in his life she was pale and thinlipped her hair and eyes and eyebrows were of a light sandy hue and she had a stealthy observant way with her which made fanks mistrust her on the instant like an apparition she arose from the ground and laid one thin hand on his breast to detain him one moment mr fanks she said in a perfectly unemotional voice you must speak to me before you go to mere hall why must i demanded fanks with a stare and how is it you know my name mr garth told me your name and your errand oh cried fanks remembering garths excuse for retiring to bed on the previous night so you are mrs jerusalem that is my name and i wish to tell you i wish to hear nothing said fanks roughly mr garth had no business to speak about me what is there between you and him that he should act in this underhand way without telling me he said he was going to bed last night instead of that he sneaks out and sees you there you are wrong replied mrs jerusalem still without a trace of emotion mr garth did not come to me on the contrary it was i who came to him at the inn while you were talking to mrs prisom he came out of his bedroom to see me for a few moments and then i went away and why did he not tell about this meeting asked fanks angrily because i asked him not to i wished to take you by surprise if you had heard of my midnight visit you might mistrust me as it is as it is i mistrust you still well mrs jerusalem we will waive the point i know you accuse sir louis of this murder is it to betray the master whose bread you eat that you have sought this meeting that is just why i am here was the quiet reply i hate my master because his father michael fellenger treated you ill i know all about that mrs jerusalem ah said the woman coldly i see you employed your time with mrs prisom to good purpose well you can understand that i hate sir louis and i would gladly see francis garth sit in his place and for this purpose you have concocted a story against sir louis i have concocted no story i tell the truth sir louis and dr binjoy went up to london on the night of the murder although they now pretend that the one was ill and the other attended him they sent me out of the house on that night but i suspected i watched i discovered do you know why the pair went up to london she continued grasping fanks by the arm to kill sir gregory do you know why they killed sir gregory to get money for their scientific experiments do you know how they killed sir gregory ask them about the poisoned needle yes they made use of their scientific knowledge to slay the man whose money they wanted who put the advertisement in the paper ask mrs boazoph she knows does she said fanks disgusted with her malignity and perhaps you know about the tattooed cross no i dont know about the tattooed cross said mrs jerusalem but i daresay madaline garry can tell you madaline garry do you know her is she still alive i know her she is still alive see sir louis mr fanks said the woman stretching out her lean hand tear the mask off the lying face of dr binjoy who loved madaline garry and ask him where she lives and what evil he has worked with her aid more fanks would have asked but with a sudden movement she eluded his detaining hand and before he could recover from his astonishment she was far down the road to the village gliding like an evil shadow into the sunny distance fanks thought of following her but on second thoughts he pursued his journey to the hall sir louis and binjoy first he muttered afterwards mrs jerusalem and madaline garry despite his belief in the evidence of mrs jerusalem which was obviously dictated by a malignant spirit he caught himself wondering if she was really right and if after all sir louis was guilty but the moment afterwards he rejected this idea as it was incredible that sir louis would commit a crime and then offer a reward for the detection of the assassin still fanks admitted to himself that if sir louis was not frank he would find it difficult to come to a decision touching his innocence or guilt on sending in his card at mere hall the detective was admitted into the study of sir louis fellenger here he found not the baronet but his old acquaintance dr renshaw who advanced boldly and introduced himself as dr binjoy in place of wearing a thick brown beard he was cleanshaven and his face looked young freshcoloured and smooth for the rest he was as tall and burly as ever as unctuous in his speech and to complete the resemblance between himself and the doctor of tooleys alley there lurked an unmistakable look of anxiety in his grey eyes it was impossible to think how he hoped to deceive so clever a man as fanks by so slight a change in his personal appearance but he evidently thought fanks knew nothing of the truth for he came forward with a bland smile prepared to carry on the comedy my dear sir said binjoy with magnificent pompousness your card was brought to sir louis but he has been busy in his laboratory and is rather untidy in consequence he deputed me to receive you pray be seated fanks smiled slightly and sat down while dr binjoy rendered uneasy by the silence carried on a difficult conversation i presume mr fanks that you have come to report your doings to sir louis touching this unfortunate death of my friends predecessor in the title may i ask if you have any clue to the assassin oh yes said fanks quietly you will be pleased to hear dr binjoy that i have every hope of arresting the right man binjoy turned grey and looked anything but delighted indeed an unprejudiced observer would have said that he looked thoroughly frightened but he controlled himself so far as to falter out a question as to the name of the guilty man fanks mentioned the name of renshaw and thereby reduced his listener to a state of abject terror renshaw is innocent sir said the doctor tremulously i would he were here to defend himself but he is in india at present at bombay i received a letter from him dated from aden how strange said fanks innocently dr turnor got a letter from him also binjoy saw that he had overreached himself and bit his lip we need discuss renshaw no longer he said coolly let us talk of other matters till sir louis enters by all means said fanks let me ask you dr binjoy what you were doing at dr turnors in great auk street on the night of the twentyfirst binjoy went pale again and stammered out a denial i was not in town on that night he protested i was attending on sir louis who was ill i never left the house at taxtononthames oh yes you did you went up with sir louis prove it prove it gasped binjoy with white lips i can prove it by the mouth of mrs jerusalem she saw you leave she saw sir louis return alone a lie a lie it is not a lie and you know it it is time to have done with this farce dr binjoy i know who you are i know all about your impersonation and disguise i know why you called yourself renshaw i traced you to plymouth and saw you disembark i followed you to this place and now i have you binjoy stared wildly for a moment at seeing his mask of lies fall away from him and then sank back in his chair with a shiver moaning and crying it is a lie a lie was all he could gasp it is not a lie said a voice at the door and fanks turned to see sir louis it is not a lie repeated the baronet binjoy is renshaw he went up with me to town on the night of the twentyfirst if you want to know who killed my cousin mr fanks there is the assassin chapter xxix dr binjoy protests silence ensued after this astounding statement had been made by sir louis during which time fanks narrowly observed the personality of the speaker the baronet was a tall and rather stout young man with a round face destitute of beard and moustache he was shabbily dressed in an old tweed suit he wore spectacles and his shoulders were slightly bowed as from constant bending over a desk his appearance was rather that of a studious german than that of a young englishman but fanks from this hasty observation judged him to be of a sensible and reflective nature such a man would not make so terrible an accusation unless he was able to substantiate it on every point binjoy arose to refute the accusation of his quondam pupil that man he said pointing an unsteady hand at the baronet is lying he hates me because i know his secrets for their preservation he seeks to destroy me but if i fall he falls also if i am guilty he is doubly so let him speak and admit that our sin is mutual i admit nothing of the sort retorted sir louis coming forward you tell your story and i shall tell mine mr fanks can judge between us you had better be careful louis said binjoy with an attempt at bravado i hold you in the hollow of my hand we will see said fellenger coldly be seated mr fanks before you leave this room you shall hear my story and decide as you think best i refuse to be the accomplice of that man any longer louis i implore you but fellenger turned a deaf ear to the voice of the charmer and sat down near fanks to whom he addressed himself for the sake of binjoy i concealed the truth out of pity for him i held my tongue but when he strives to make me an accomplice in the crime when he attempts to blackmail me by threatening to inform you of our doings on the night of the twentyfirst of june i prefer to forestall him and let you know the worst of myself you were listening to our conversation sir louis said fanks i was replied the baronet coldly i know what mrs jerusalem thinks i know how binjoy has been lying to you and i am sick of living on the verge of a precipice over which that man and my housekeeper threaten to push me at any cost you shall hear the truth so far as i am able to tell it to you ask what questions you like mr fanks and i shall answer them when i fail no doubt the worthy doctor there will come to my aid and shield himself if possible at my expense i shall say nothing said binjoy wiping his lips my only desire is to save myself from the consequences of your falsehoods i wish you no harm just hear him cried louis in a mocking tone would you believe that my friend there threatened to blackmail me last week by saying he would denounce me to the police well binjoy here is a representative of the law you can now speak i give you full power to do so binjoy did not accept this challenge he sat back in his chair to listen to the forthcoming conversation and to defend himself if necessary well sir louis said the detective i have heard your accusation and the denial of dr binjoy until i hear your story and his i attach no value to either binjoy drew a long breath of relief i can defend myself he said in a defiant tone i can prove to you that louis lies you shall have ample opportunity of doing so replied fanks coldly in the meantime i shall hear what sir louis has to say i must begin at the beginning said louis quietly that man binjoy was the doctor in this village of damington when my father died leaving me an orphanfor my mother had died some years beforehe asked binjoy to look after me and i have done so broke in binjoy and this is my reward this is your reward for trying to blackmail me said fellenger dryly you did your best to ruin me and to put bad thoughts into my heart as to gregorys wealth and my own poverty see here mr fanks added louis turning to the detective i am a man of science i am devoted to my work i wanted neither money nor title and i would not have lifted a finger to obtain either i did not like gregory he was a brutal and wicked boy and when we were playmates together he treated me like a dog i never saw him for years we never corresponded or treated each other as relatives but for all that i did not wish him evil i did not desire his death least of all did i desire to rob him of his titles and lands do you believe me sir fanks looked at the open face of the young man and glanced at the scowl which rested on the countenance of binjoy drawing his own conclusions he replied quietly i believe you sir louis proceed if you please binjoy pursued louis was always lamenting that i was not the owner of the fellenger estates and now that i am he hopes to make me pay him large sums of money to purchase his silence what does he threaten to accuse you of said fanks of murdering my cousin under the disguise of the negro caesar but i am innocent mr fanks as i hope to prove to you i was trapped by that man and his accomplice dr turnor ah murmured fanks while binjoy scowled i was sure that the ferret had something to do with the matter of that you shall judge for yourself said fellenger have you heard of mithridates mr fanks the detective was rather astonished at this apparently irrelevant question but having some knowledge of ancient history he said that he had heard of the monarch he was a king of pontus wasnt he who lived on poisons exactly he accustomed himself to taking poisons for so long that in the end the most deadly had no effect on him i always thought that this was a fable and i wanted to see if i was right for this purpose i tried experiments on dogs i inoculated an animal with a weak poison and gradually increased the dose whether i was successful does not matter it has nothing to do with my story but i may tell you this that with the aid of binjoy i prepared a very powerful vegetable poison for my final experiment with this i impregnated a needle oh said fanks now i am beginning to see was it an ordinary needle no it was not an ordinary needle replied fellenger in the first place it was silver in the second it was hollow in the third it was filled with this deadly vegetable poison of which i told you prepared by dr binjoy prepared by both of us said binjoy savagely let him take his share of the guilt i am not guilty mr fanks can judge of that for himself when i tell him what i know retorted the baronet well mr fanks we prepared this needle and placed it in a case for the least prick with it meant death by blood poisoning we intended to use it on the dog when the animal was sufficiently saturated with weaker poisons to admit of the experiment being made you may be sure sir that i was very careful of that needle i placed it in my cabinet dr binjoy had access to that cabinet i had not contradicted binjoy yes you had you possessed a key as well as myself retorted sir louis sharply i did not said the doctor obstinate in his denial dont lie binjoy i found you with it opened one day the day anne colmer was with you and i was so angry oh anne colmer knew about this needle said fanks i cant say said fellenger while i was living at taxtononthames miss colmer sometimes came to the house but i was angry at binjoy for opening that cabinet in her presence as there were a lot of dangerous drugs in it she touched none of them growled binjoy oh said fanks sharply then you admit that you showed miss colmer the cabinet of poisons binjoy scowled and grew a shade paler as he saw that he had over reached himself however he said nothing lest he should make bad worse and with a significant glance at fanks the baronet resumed his story one day in the middle of june said fellenger i found the needle missing and binjoy told me he had given it to turnor i did not say that exclaimed binjoy wrathfully i said that i missed it one day when turnor was in the laboratory and i thought that he might have taken it as it proved he did not i know no more than yourself who took it we will see said louis i was ill at the time and when binjoy hinted that turnor had it i determined to go up to london and get it again i rose from my bed of sickness and went up to london on the evening of the twentyfirst but was it necessary that you should have gone up said fanks would not a line to dr turnor have done probably but the preparation of the poison was a secret and when i heard that the needle was in turnors possession i was afraid lest he should analyse the preparation i went up to town with binjoy post haste to recover it again this haste may appear strange to you mr fanks but you do not know how jealous we men of science are of our secrets but at all events we went up to town that evening do you deny that binjoy no i dont deny it retorted binjoy gloomily mr fanks tracked me to plymouth he knows that i am renshaw i do may i ask dr binjoy why you took a false name binjoy pointed to his friend it was to save that ungrateful man he said in a tragic voice when i saw you at the red star and found out that it was sir gregory who had been murdered i foresaw how you might suspect louis as the cousin of the dead man mrs boazoph sent for dr turnor i came instead of him leaving turnor with louis i had been to the red star before and mrs boazoph knew me as renshaw and you wore a false beard how was that i used to go up to london to enjoy myself said binjoy apologetically and i did not want any rumours to creep down to taxtononthames concerning my movements this is why i adopted the false name and disguise did you know of this said fanks turning to louis i do now i did not then said he promptly when i arrived in town i went with binjoy to dr turnors house in great auk street turnor denied possession of the needle shortly afterwards a message came that the landlady of the red star wanted turnor i would not let turnor leave the room as i felt sure that he had the needle and thought that he might make away with it binjoy went in his place but he had no disguise on when he went out of the house i put it on outside explained renshaw alias binjoy i did not tell you all my secrets as you were always so straightlaced you might have objected to my enjoying myself i should certainly have objected to your disguising yourself and going under another name said louis coldly i do not like such underhand doings i did not know that you went to the red star as renshaw when you came back i had gone ah murmured fanks that accounts why we didnt catch you the house was not watched till binjoy came back did you return to taxtononthames yes i returned without the needle which turnor denied having i felt very ill and got into bed at once was mrs jerusalem in the house then yes binjoy as i afterwards learned had sent her out it was part of the trap he wanted to make out that i had got rid of the woman so that i could go up to town and kill my cousin when did you hear of your cousins death the next day turnor came down and said that binjoy could not return as he was being watched by detectives quite so and turnor told you about your cousins death he did and then he said that if i did not hold my tongue and pretend that i had not left taxtononthames that night i should be in danger of being accused of the crime what could i do mr fanks i saw my danger i held my tongue yes said fanks i can see why you were afraid you were in a dangerous position i was in a trap retorted louis cant you see mr fanks gregory was killed with a poisoned needle i had talked about that needle to many people many scientific men knew that i was experimenting with it i was in turnors house at the very time that the crime was committed and you were thereby able to prove an alibi indeed no turnor told me that he needed money and he swore that he would deny that i had been in his house that he would denounce me as the murderer of my cousin if i did not give him a cheque i could do nothing i was afraid the circumstances were too strong for me i would have told the police but in the face of turnors denial in the face of binjoys treachery in luring me into that house at the very time of the murder i dreaded lest i should be arrested and condemned on circumstantial evidence and the negro binjoys servant was smuggled off to bombay by binjoy to close the trap more firmly on me thats a lie said binjoy i sent the negro away to bombay to avert suspicion i feigned a voyage to plymouth for the same reason i ordered caesar to meet me at plymouth and sent him to bombay in my place i know you did said fanks you no doubt did that when i lost you in the town after you disembarked well you see mr fanks said louis that i am innocent i held my tongue and lied about binjoy because i was afraid of the circumstantial evidence which might be brought against me thanks to binjoy and turnor i was in a trap i was at their mercy i have told you all because binjoy tried to blackmail me last week now what do you say say sir louis i believe that you have told the truth you are innocent of this crime but the question is what does dr binjoy say i say that there is not one word of truth in the whole story said the doctor with a scowl chapter xxx a letter from hersham senior upon hearing this untruthful and obstinate denial of the baronets story fanks wheeled round his chair until it directly faced that of binjoy at the sullen creature he looked sternly and shook an emphatic forefinger in his face now look you here dr binjoy or renshaw or whatever you choose to call yourself he said sternly i believe that sir louis has spoken the truth about this matter i have not the least doubt that you and your accomplice turnor lured him into the tooley alley crime with which to my belief he has nothing to do whatever you laid a trap and he fell into itunluckily for him but for his wise resolution to confess his doings on that night to me i have no doubt that you would have blackmailed him i did not want to blackmail him said binjoy in a low voice i did not lure him into a trap on the contrary when i found out that it was his cousin who had been murdered i did all i could to save himto draw suspicion on to myself i feigned the voyage to plymouth i made use of my false name i sent off caesar to bombay and i closed the mouth of dr turnor what more could you expect me to do i quite believe that you did all these things and for why because you wished to rivet your chains more securely on your victim when you found that he was in possession of the property you resolved to get whatever money you wanted out of him in order to lead a debauched life in town oh yes doctor i quite believe you changed your name and assumed a disguise while in london you did not wish that the scampish renshaw of the red star should be identified with the respectable dr binjoy late of taxtononthames and now of mere hall in hampshire i can understand that and i can understand that you designed the murder so that sir louis could become possessed of money which you intended to spend i did not design the murder said binjoy in a hoarse voice i swear i do not know who committed the crime when i was called in by mrs boazoph i was as ignorant as anyone that gregory fellenger had been murdered i only acted as i did because i saw how dangerous it was that louis should be suspected he was in the neighbourhood lured there by yourself no no i did not lure him there that we should be at turnors house so near to tooleys at that time was quite an accident was it an accident that dr turnor came down to taxtononthames and threatened to blackmail me broke in louis i know nothing of what turnor said or did it was not because you paid him money that he held his tongue but because i told him to do so you tried to blackmail me also that was why we quarrelled that was why you were going away next week and i dare swear binjoy added sir louis quietly that had you gone you would have found means to betray me to the police that is why i have told mr fanks everything you cannot harm me now dont you be too sure of that growled binjoy you have got to clear yourself of suspicion sir louis has cleared himself in my eyes said fanks but you have yet to explain what became of the poisoned needle i do not know i missed it as did sir louis but i do not know who took it you cant prove that i committed the crime i am not sure of that said fanks coolly see here dr binjoy you wanted sir louis to get the fellenger estates so that you could handle the money sir louis can prove that much you had access to this poisoned needle with which the crime was committed you went up to london on the evening of the twentyfirst of june you repaired to the red star about the time the deed was committed you lied about your name you took a pretended voyage you sent your negro to bombay in order to throw the suspicion on him now you attempt to blackmail sir louisyou and turnorby threatening to accuse him of committing a crime of which he is guiltless from my own soul i believe that he is the victim of conspiracy i believe that you lured him up to great auk street to entangle him in the matter and added fanks rising i believe that you in disguise of a negro killed sir gregory fellenger with that poisoned needle i did not i swear i did not it is all a mistake gasped the wretched man ask turnor the other blackguard the other blackmailer no thank you he would only lie to me as you are doing you are guilty confess your share in this crime confess the mystery of the tattooed cross the tattooed cross what do you know about the tattooed cross more than you think returned fanks significantly what about madaline garry and her revenge binjoys eyes seemed to be starting out of his head with terror and surprise his face was of a deathly paleness and great drops of perspiration rolled down his cheeks he tried to speak but the words rattled in his throat and with a gasp the man strong as he was fainted quietly in the chair he had been struck down by his own terrors rendered insensible by an instinctive knowledge of his danger what do you intend to do mr fanks asked louis looking at the inanimate form of binjoy with strong distaste arrest this man i do i shall send a telegram to london to get a detective down in the meantimei shall stay here so as not to lose sight of him you dont think that i would help him to escape said louis indignantly i am only too glad to see the scoundrel captured he has been the curse of my life ever since my father placed me in his care he spoilt my nature he half ruined me but i stood it all until he tried to blackmail me then i revolted against his tyranny if you had not appeared here so opportunely i should have written for you to come and hear my confession i admit that i was afraid to speak before for these villains had laid their plans so skilfully that i was afraid my tale would not be believed but now the scamp has been caught in his own trap and i am glad of it all the same i am not sure that he killed your cousin why not all the circumstances seem to point to his having done so no doubt but some time ago i thought i had spotted the person who had executed the crime from that opinion i am not inclined to depart evidently binjoy knows all about the affair and possibly he may be brought in as the accessory before the fact but you can see for yourself that the man is a rank coward he has fainted no man of his timid nature would be brave enough to commit so daring a crime and then face me within an hour of such commission no sir louis we have not yet caught the assassin then why arrest binjoy because he knows who is guilty and i wish to force him into confession just send the servant with this telegram will you and tell him to ask if there are any letters for me at the pretty maid inn what about binjoy leave him here with me for a time should i get a letter i may ask you to take me over the house till then i shall watch my man what is this letter you expect demanded louis with curiosity ill tell you that when i have despatched my telegram send a groom with it at once please sir louis obeyed and left the room while fanks remained to revive the insensible binjoy he threw water on his face loosened his collar but the doctor still continued insensible becoming alarmed fanks rang the bell and sent for a medical man the upshot of the affair was that binjoy was put to bed in high fever the shock inflicted on him by the detective had unsettled his brain and when crate arrived at mere hall there was no question of arresting the guilty man binjoy was dangerously ill and suffering from an attack of brain fever what with the doctor ill in the country and mrs boazoph ill in town fanks began to grow uneasy if all the principals of the case were rendered incapable of confession in this manner he did not see how he was to arrive at any solution of the riddle he was two days meditating over the next move in the game mrs boazoph knows something said fanks to himself and dr binjoy knows more but if both are ill and incapable of confession what am i to do there was no answer to this question but later on the detectives hands were full in elucidating the mystery of the tattooing he asked the baronet if he knew anything about the fancy sir francis had for pricking crosses on the arms of women whom he loved i never heard of it said louis i did not know much about my uncle francis and still less about my cousin his son gregory i am afraid we are a singularly unamiable family mr fanks for we all seem to quarrel have you quarrelled with garth not exactly but we do not get on well together he used to come and see me at taxtononthames but i am afraid he thought me a scientific prig indeed he hinted so much fanks laughed at this remembering how garth had made use of the words attributed to him by sir louis however he did not explain the reason of his laughter but asked the baronet about madaline garry to this also he received a denial sir louis knew nothing about the lady or her connection with the late sir francis all these things were before my time he said shaking his head if you want to know about our family secrets ask mrs prisom at the inn i believe she is a perfect book of anecdotes regarding the fellenger family i have asked her said fanks quietly she told me a great deal but not all i wish to know is there anyone else well there was mrs jerusalem said sir louis but she has walked off i intended to tell you since you referred to her where has she gone i do not know on that day you met her she went off and never came back i cant say i am sorry as i feel from your description she bore me illwill perhaps on account of the way my father treated her but you must ask mrs prisom to tell you that story i dont need to do that replied fanks i know that mrs jerusalem hated you and that is enough she must have intended to bolt the day i met her but i thought she would have waited with the amiable intention of assisting you into trouble i wish i knew where she had gone perhaps she will come back let us hope so now that binjoy is ill and she hates him i should like to know what she can say about him by the way there is a question i wish to ask you why was it when you were afraid of being implicated in the crime that you offered to supply the money for me to hunt down the criminal well that was binjoys idea you see he thought that he had completely destroyed the trail likely to bring you across my track so he said it would still further avert suspicion if i offered that reward i did so but to tell you the honest truth if i had not intended to confide in you in order to stop the blackmailing of messrs binjoy and turnor i should not have risked doing so by the way are you going to arrest that atrocious little scamp not yet binjoy is ill and cannot have warned him mrs boazoph is in the same plight no i will let him wait he has no idea that he is in any danger when the time comes i will pounce on him if necessary though i hope he will not take a fit also i can get nothing out of binjoy or mrs boazoph while they are ill you may not need to do so you may find out the truth when the letter comes from hersham i wish it would come said fanks i want to know why he has the same symbol on his arm as that on the arms of mrs prisom and madaline garry you speak as if madaline garry were still alive mrs jerusalem says she is that is why i want to trace mrs jerusalem she might help me to learn where i can find madaline garry the clue to the mystery of the cross lies with her or else added fanks it is hidden in the desk of the late sir francis you remember i told you his parting words to mrs prisom two days after this the long expected letter came from hersham and not only from him but one from his father was enclosed also the contents caused fanks surprise and yet he half expected to read what he did he was beginning to guess the mystery which filled dr binjoy and mrs boazoph with such fear after all he would be able to discover the truth without them although their testimony would be necessary to confirm it dear fanks wrote hersham when you read the enclosed you will be astonished as i was i have not yet recovered from the shock of learning the truth but as you will see the mystery of the tattooed cross is a greater one than ever i can give you no assistanceall is told in the enclosed letter which i particularly asked to be written for you i cannot say if it will solve the tooley alley riddle but it has certainly invested my life with a mystery which i shall not rest until i solve i can write no more for my head is in a whirl tell me what you think of enclosed and believe me yours ted hersham as i suppose i may still sign myself the enclosed was a letter from the rev george hersham to the effect that ted was not his son that he was no relation to him i am a bachelor wrote mr hersham i adopted ted from motives of pity and a desire to cheer my lonely life nearly twentyeight years ago a poorly clad woman came to my door she was starving and carried an infant in her arms i gave her succour and procured her work after a time she grew restless and wished to go away but in that time i had become fond of the child in the end i offered to adopt it to this she consented rather to my surprise though indeed she did not seem at any time very much attached to the babe however she gave me the child and went away with a little money i had given her i afterwards received a letter from her in london but she then stopped writing and for years i have never heard anything about her the childnow my son tedwas marked with a cross on the left arm when i adopted him the woman never told me why he had been so tattooed i knew nothing of the womans history save that her name wasmadaline garry chapter xxxi the secret is revealed on receipt of mr hershams letter fanks sought out sir louis and showed him the communication he had told the baronet all that he had heard from mrs prisom for without permission he could not hope to examine the desk of the late sir francis if he did not do so he would not be able to discover the secret of the tattooed cross therefore for the gaining of his ends and also with a belief in fellengers good sense he made him his confidant and finally placed the letter in his hands louis read it carefully and knowing all that had gone before he understood it partially nevertheless he was puzzled as to the real meaning of the affair and looked to fanks for an explanation what do you think of that asked fanks when the baronet gave back the letter in silence can you understand it i do not think it is very difficult to understand said fellenger with a shrug of his shoulders madeline garry went from the isle of wight she was starving and she met with a good samaritan who took her in afterwards she sought london and left her child behind to be adopted that child is your friend edward hersham the story is plain enough it is so far as you have related it but hersham has the cross of st catherine tattooed on his arm why should the child of madaline garry be marked in that way perhaps my uncle marked the child he seemed to have had a passion for tattooing why should sir francis mark the child of fielding there was something so significant in the tone of the detective that sir louis looked at him intently what he saw in his face prompted his next remark you dont think hersham is illegitimate do you he asked indeed that is my opinion returned fanks why was sir francis afraid of madaline garry because he had done her a wrong why did she marry fielding almost on the same day that your uncle married miss darmer why did sir francis tattoo the child with his favourite cross the answer to all these questions isto my mindto be found in the fact that the child of madaline garry was also the child of sir francis fellenger i feel convinced that hersham is the halfbrother of the man who was murdered at tooleys alley it seems likely assented louis nursing his chin with his hand but how can you establish the truth of your statement there are two ways one is by asking binjoy he may know as he was in attendance both at the birth of gregory and at that of hersham he may tell the truth but as he is delirious there is no chance of getting any information from him the second way is to find out madaline garry and force her to own up but the only person who knows where she is is mrs jerusalem who has vanished if i find mrs jerusalem i may find the other woman but at present that is impossible also quite impossible i do not see what you can do do you remember what mrs prisom said about the desk in the study of your late uncle yes she alluded to some secret in connection with the desk which was to be used for the benefit of gregory should madaline garry attempt to revenge herself exactly well we must examine the desk i fancy that sir francis dreading the anger of the woman whom he had wronged wrote out a full account of his sin and of the reason why he tattooed the cross on the arm of the child if we can find that paperwhich sir francis plainly hinted was in the desk we may discover why your cousin was murdered i cannot conceive what you mean you will know soon enough replied fanks a trifle sadly i have a very shrewd idea of what will be the outcome of my search if things are as i think it will not be long before i run down the assassin of sir gregory i have an instinctand more than an instinctthat the clue to the mystery which has eluded me so long is about to be placed in my hand i shall be pleased for my own sake i shall be sorry for yours why what do you mean i do not understand explain yourself mr fanks no replied fanks shaking his head i may be wrong and i do not wish to cause you unnecessary pain let me examine the desk if i am wrong all the better for you all the worse for the case if am right i had rather you learned the truth without my intervention come sir louis let us seek the study of your late uncle do you know where it is oh yes said sir louis leading the way it has been shut up since his death you know my cousin was not a man of books so he did not use it as for myself i am always in my laboratory in the old wing if sir francis left any secret paper in his desk it will be there still unless added louis with an afterthought unless it was taken away by the woman he feared no if the paper had given madaline garry power to revenge herself on the heir of her old lover she would have used that power and then mrs prisom might have interfered by acting on the last request of sir francis nothing of this has happened so i am sure that if the paper is in that desk we shall find it if we find it we shall learn the truth about this tattooed cross and consequently discover the motive which prompted the murder of your cousin after which speech the detective went with sir louis to the study of the late sir francis fellenger sir louis unlocked the door and they entered into the longdisused room it had been shut up for many years the atmosphere was dusty and musty with a chill smell of decay fanks opened the shutters and the strong sunlight poured into the apartment it illumined the dusty carpet on which their feet made marks it gleamed on the oldfashioned furniture cumbersome and comfortless such as was used in the early days of the victorian era andto the satisfaction of the detectiveit revealed a mahogany escritoire all drawers and pigeonholes and brass handles the key massive and rusty was still in the lock and louis turning it over with a harsh creak threw open the heavy sheet of mahogany which covered the writing cloth this was lined with dingy green cloth inkstained and dusty but on it there rested no papers nor pens nor ink evidently the papers had been arranged before the desk had been closed and left to its many years solitude fanks bent down and unlocked the drawers one after the other these contained nothing but masses of newspaper everyone of which they examined carefully but without finding any writing referring to the cross there were also bundles of old letters and musty accounts and ancient records of ships and stores and divers expenses doubtless remnants of fellengers naval days in another drawer they found seashells and seaweed mounted on cardboard while some shallow repositories contained pictures and small charts but nowhere could they discover the paper to which sir francis had referred in that last long conversation with mrs prisom well it is not in any of these said fanks rising with a look of disappointment i wonder where it can be perhaps there is a secret drawer suggested sir louis it is not unlikely and no doubt the paper would be hidden in such a receptacle out of fear of the woman i believe you are right sir louis let us look for a secret drawer if there is one i shall find it i have been at this sort of work before and i have an idea how to go about it fanks made no vain boast for after a hard search of an hour or more after sounding with the knuckles and measuring with a tape they stumbled across a hidingplace contrived in the thickness of the wood at the back of the desk herein was a paper yellow with age which fanks drew slowly out for it was so fragile with time that he thought it would crumble in his hand carrying this to the strong light of the window he read carefully while sir louis waited for a revelation of its contents the face of the detective paled when he read it and he glanced pityingly at the baronet when he finished his perusal it is the paper i hoped to find he said slowly and it clears up the most important point of the case but i told you mr fellenger that the contents would give you pain read them for yourself why do you call me mr fellenger asked louis quietly you will find the answer to that question in this paper replied fanks and passed it to the baronet after a pause and a sharp glance at the detective fellenger took the thin yellow sheet and read it slowly this was what he read in the faded handwriting of sir francis i have deceived madaline garry i am the father of the child born to her about the same time that my heir gregory was born madaline wished me to marry her but for reasons which i need not explain here i was unable to do so she married luke fielding and he is supposed to be the father of her child this is not so the boy is mine when my wife died madaline insisted on coming to the hall and nursing gregory for obvious reasons i could not refuse her she would have revealed the truth and have disgraced me and her family had i not yielded to her wish she came to the hall with her own child and nursed that of my late wife but i was afraid that she would change the children so that her son should enjoy what rightfully belonged to his halfbrother i was twice nearly sending her away on account of this fear but she threatened to disgrace me by revealing the truth so i let her stay but to avert the danger i one night tattooed on the left arm of my son gregory the cross of st catherine which i had already tattooed on the arm of madaline and of nancy prisom should the children be changed and i die the truth can be ascertained by the tattooed cross the child marked with the cross is my son and heir gregory fellenger the other is his brother edward the son of myself and madaline garry i hope in this way that i shall prevent madaline from revenging herself on me as i feel sure she intends to do signed francis luddham fellenger on reading this extraordinary document louis felt the room whirl round him and he was fain to be seated fanks turned silently towards him and received back the paperthe paper which robbed the young man at one sweep of title and property louis recovered himself and smiled faintly i understand he said in a low tone sir gregory enjoyed the title and estates wrongfully hersham is the rightful heir yes madaline garry fulfilled her vengeance she put her child in the place of the real heir after the death of sir francis and took away the son of lady fellenger that was why she came to the hall to be the nurse she wanted her child to enjoy the property owing to the tattooing and the father being alive she could not change the children but when sir francis was killed she did so and therefore secured the title for her son i now understand why she parted so readily with hersham so that he should be adopted by the vicar of fairview he was not her child but that of her rival in the affections of sir francis i can see all this so can you but added fanks with hesitation can you guess how this discovery affects you certainly replied louis calmly i shall have to give the property up to my cousin who now goes by the name of hersham i assure you i shall not mind the loss so much as you seem to think as i told you i care nothing for money and everything for science oh believe me mr fanks i am quite content to surrender title and estates and go back to taxtononthames as plain louis fellenger you can contest this matter i shall not contest the matter i believe that paper to be true we found it together and it proved beyond a doubtby the evidence of the cross tattooed on hershams left arm that he is the rightful sir gregory and the owner of these estates let him have them i shall not raise one finger to prevent his enjoying what is rightfully his own besides i like hershamas i may still call himhe is a good fellow i used to meet him at taxtononthames let him marry anne colmer and take up his position he will make a much better baronet than i they left the room and went downstairs again to the library in there louis asked fanks a question which had been in his mind for some time i say mr fanks he said what makes you say that this tattooed cross clears up the mystery of tooleys alley well said fanks someone must have known this story and have told it to sir gregory that was why he allowed the cross to be tattooed on his arm i dont see that why the person who told him the story assured him that the only chance he had of keeping the property was to be tattooed with the mark which sir francis said was on the arm of his real heir oh i understand now but who was the person who told sir gregory the secret of that cross and tattooed it on his arm ah said fanks tell me the name of that person and ill tell you the assassin of the son of madaline garry who wrongfully bore the title and name of sir gregory fellenger chapter xxxii mrs boazoph tells the truth immediately after this great discovery fanks received a letter from garth informing him that mrs jerusalem was in london located at the red star mrs boazoph said the writer is much better and is now permitted to leave her bed rather i fancy to the disappointment of turnor should you want to get any information out of mrs boazoph now is the time to do so the result of this communication was that fanks resolved to go at once to town and interview the landlady you see that i want to get something out of mrs boazoph he said to louis i want her to tell me who killed sir gregory do you think she knows that i think she has known it all along retorted fanks you can take it from me fellenger she recognised the negro when he entered the hotel on that night for some reason which i mean to discover she has held her tongue i intend to force her to reveal the name by threatening to arrest hersham in the event of her refusing to speak will she tell in order to save hersham i think so and for more reasons than one you see she fainted when i told her that i could prove the crime against that young man it may be that she knows how hardly he has been dealt with by madeline garry and therefore she may be anxious to save him further trouble but how could she learn the story of madeline garry and the changing of the children objected fellenger from anne colmer who must have learned it from dr binjoy i believe he is at the bottom of the whole affair i do not say that he killed gregory but he can tell us who did how can you prove that well the person who killed gregory must have known that story of the changing of the children so as to induce him to let the cross be tattooed on his arm dr binjoy must have told that person dr binjoy must have supplied that needle dr binjoy my friend is at the bottom of the whole devilish affair you forget madeline garry she might have told the murderer about the changing of the children i dont think so madeline would not have been likely to reveal anything detrimental to her son and on the face of it she could not have obtained access to the poisoned needle no i suspect binjoy as an accessory before the fact i shall see mrs jerusalem and force her to tell me where to find madeline garry though to be sure i have a pretty good notion of where to find her as it is what do you know who madeline garry is i think so a speech of mrs prisoms put me on her track but i may be wrong so i shall say nothing as yet you are clever in guessing things mr fanks perhaps you can tell me who killed gregory well said fanks looking straight at his questioner i might even go as far as that i do not know for certain who is the assassin but i have a shrewd notion i shall have my doubts set at rest on that point when i see these women in town i shall interview mrs boazoph take down her confession and make her sign it i shall act in the same way with binjoy with anne colmer with robert the valet of the dead man and with turnor the accomplice of your medical friend do you think they are all in it i am more than certain they are said fanks in a confident tone well mr fellenger will you come up with me and see the last act of the comedy no i shall stay here with mr crate and keep an eye on dr binjoy but you must write me all that befalls you at the red star do you really think that you will find the truth in that house i am certain of it believe me the tragedy will end as it beganin the red star in tooleys alley i hope all will go as i wish added fanks with a gloomy air i have had no end of trouble with this case and although i think i see daylight at last i must not be too confident the whole proving of my theory lies with mrs boazoph having thus settled his plans fanks left crate at mere hall to look after dr binjoy and repaired to town immediately on his arrival which took place about noon he sent for garth and questioned him concerning mrs jerusalem having received satisfactory replies he entrusted a special commission to the lawyer and with a detective he went himself to the red star that short conversation with fanks so astonished garth that he went on his errandwhich had to do with such conversationin a state of great surprise and no little nervousness at the red star fanks inquired for mrs jerusalem and was confronted by dr turnor the ferret looked rather disconcerted as the detective appeared and tried to dissuade him from seeing mrs boazoph as he wished to do she is yet weak he urged and i do not think it will be wise of you to talk with her as yet i dont care how weak she is said fanks grimly i intend to talk to her and to you too what can you have to say to me demanded turnor with an attempt at bravado ill tell you that after i have seen mrs boazoph and mrs jerusalem was the reply i know all your doings on the night of the twentyfirst dr turnor and i am aware of your attempt to blackmail sir louis fellenger after which speech fanks went upstairs to the room occupied by mrs boazoph at the door he met with mrs jerusalem she looked at him in an expressionless way and spoke in her usual cold and unemotional manner her first question was of fanks visit to mere hall did you find out the truth sir she asked i found out the truth but not the particular truth you wished for replied fanks who disliked this woman immensely your master is not guilty then who is guilty if he is not ill reveal that in a few moments mrs jerusalem i may tell you that i know all about madaline garry and the tattooed cross also about mr louis fellenger the woman drew back and for the first time since fanks had known her an expression of surprise flitted across her face he said mr louis she said to herself how much does he know he knows most of the circumstances which led to the murder in this house retorted fanks moving towards the door and now with your assistance he is about to learn the rest at all events the truth will be bad for louis fellenger muttered mrs jerusalem if it was to benefit him i would not move a step as it is she added throwing open the door come in mr fanks and ask mrs boazoph to tell you the story she related to me this morning fanks nodded and without saying a word entered the apartment in spite of the warm weather there was a fire burning in the grate and beside it crouched mrs boazoph she was seated on the carpet warming her thin hands at the blaze and she turned her face as the detective entered he was astonished at the change wrought in her by illness her face was lined and drawn with pain her hair was falling about her ears in rough masses and the looseness of her dress showed how emaciated she had become the poor creature was but a shadow of the notorious woman who had defied the police for so long and at the first glance fanks saw that death was written on her haggard face if there was anything to be learned from this wreck there was no time to be lost in hearing it nemesis had claimed at least one victim for the death of sir gregory fellengeror rather edward fielding have you come here to see me die mr fanks asked mrs boazoph with a faint smile i hope it is not so bad as that replied fanks gently for he pitied the exhaustion of the poor creature you may get better mrs boazoph shook her head i think not she said quietly the end is coming fast i do not care my life has been none so happy that i should wish to live i am anxious to die are you anxious to make reparation for your crimes with a start mrs boazoph looked at the other woman who still stood at the door what have you told him she asked in a hoarse voice i have told him nothing replied mrs jerusalem coldly but he knows all that is impossible muttered mrs boazoph with a shiver he cannot know all who is there to tell him i was told by the dead the dead what dead by your dead lover on whose son you avenged your betrayal mrs bryant she shivered and looked up angrily not that name i am not mrs bryant i can give you another name if you like said fanks pointedly shall i say mrs fielding ormadaline garry the woman rose to her knees with an effort and parting the tangled mass of her grey hair she looked at fanks in a terrified manner madaline garry is dead she said in a low voice she died when she married luke fielding neglect and dishonour killed her madaline garry did not die then said fanks determinedly she lived to avenge herself on her lover by exchanging his child for that of her own they were both his children cried mrs boazoph with sudden fury i see you know all so i can speak as i choose i loved francis fellenger and he betrayed me i should have been his wife but like the coward he was he married another woman i became the wife of luke fielding of the man i hated in order to conceal the truth from my father the child i bore was not his it should have borne the title of the fellengers and it did bear the title of the fellengers said fanks in an impressive voice it took the place of the real heir thanks to your schemes and you madaline garry deserted the infant of your rival after you had robbed him of his birthright wretched woman make reparation while you can give back his name to edward hersham before it is too late or added fanks drawing nearer keep silence to the end and let him suffer on the gallows for the murder of your son no no shrieked mrs boazoph clutching at her chair to raise herself not that anything but that he is innocent i tell you that he is innocent if he is innocent who then is guilty asked fanks mrs boazoph reeled and would have fallen but for the arm of mrs jerusalem who sprang forward to catch her a draught of brandy brought back her strength and she sat in the chair by the fire rocking herself to and fro with heartrending sobs fanks approached to speak to her but she waved him off do not touch her yet said mrs jerusalem in a low tone she will recover soon quiet as was the whisper mrs boazoph heard it and moaned never never on this side of the grave he wept my race is run and weary have been my days i never had a chance like other women once i was madaline garry the darling of her father the prettiest girl in damington but francis fellenger made me what i am i curse him living or dead i curse him she broke into hysterical laughter i revenged myself well i put my child and his in the place of the heir it was my son who reigned at mere hall it was my son who spent the moneys of that evil family and bore their title i am glad of it i am glad of it the real heirher childhad to work for his bread but mine reigned in his place he took the seat of his father of what use was it that francis marked his son as he marked me see she cried pulling up the sleeve of her dress do you see this cross on my skin you bloodhound of the law francis fellenger marked me like that to show that i was his wife yet he married another francis marked his legitimate son like that yet the son ate the bread of strangers and another sat in his seat i have done my work i have had my revenge i am willing to die are you willing that the son whom you disinherited should die at the hands of justice mrs boazoph moaned and hid her face in her hands ah no she said in a plaintive voice he has suffered enough my son is dead so let the other take back his name and estates my son is dead he perished in the house of his mother the mother who was too cowardly to avenge him who was afraid to reveal the name of the assassin my son is dead but not by the hand of his halfbrother did he meet with his death then who killed him tell me cried fanks eagerly you have sinned make what reparation you can for your sins while there is yet time look up madaline garry and tell me if that man slew your son while fanks had been speaking the door had opened softly and garth in the company of another man appeared on the threshold the two stood spellbound when they heard this speech of the detective and mrs boazoph turned her face slowly towards them suddenly she crushed down her weakness and arose to her feet with miraculous strength stretching out her hand at the man who stood terrorstricken awaiting her words she cried out in a shrill and triumphant voice yonder is the man who killed my son yonder is the man who must suffer in the place of edward hersham you wish to know who came here as a negro and killed my son there he standsherbert vaud i thought so murmured fanks and the next instant he had the handcuffs on vauds wrists chapter xxxiii how and why the deed was done the evidence of mrs boazoph my name is madaline garry i was born in the village of damington where my father lived for years after his retirement from the navy i have one sister jane now mrs colmer of taxtononthames we lost our mother at an early age and being without maternal care we grew up to be rather more independent than most young women jane was always much quieter than i and she was not considered so beautiful yes i am now an old woman and i can speak without vanity i was considered very beautiful in my youth and i had many lovers who wished to marry me luke fielding especially was in love with me but i refused to marry him as in my turn i was in love with sir francis fellenger he had then lately given up the sea on his accession to the title but still retaining his pleasure in his old profession he was accustomed to visit my father and the two would talk over naval matters together at first he came solely for these chats but afterwards he came because he was in love with me had i played my cards well i might have been lady fellenger but in my love and weakness i trusted too much to his honour and i learned too late that he had none he had promised to make me his wife but he afterwards told me that the fortunes of his family were at a low ebb that if he did not make a rich marriage he should be forced to sell the hall he swore that he loved no one but me and said that although he married another woman i should always be his real wife again i yielded to his cunning and held my peace about his villainy nay more to hide his wickedness i married my old admirer luke fielding almost at the same time that francis brought home miss darmer to take the place which should have been mine i should have been lady fellenger and not that puling minx afterwards i discovered that he loved herloved her the villain after all the lies he had told to me i swore to be revenged and i told him so then my husband died and i was left penniless as luke had been trying to increase his fortune by speculation i became a mother and the son born of me had the right to call sir francis fellenger father in my destitution i went back to my father and nursed my boy while i watched events at the hall there the punishment of francis had already begun his wife for whose sake he had forsaken me died at the birth of her son so matters stood the two children both of francis fellenger although but one was acknowledged had been born within a few days of one another a nurse was wanted at the hall i required money and i saw an opportunity of working out my revenge by changing the children i insisted that i should come to the hall as the nurse of the heir francis resisted until i swore to reveal all his villainy then he yielded and i attained my end i was established at mere hall as the nurse of the heir and my child edward fieldingfalsely so calledwas in the nursery with me the two children lay side by side in the cradle i could have changed them then but i was unable to do so with safety for guessing my purpose francis had marked his son with the st catharines cross which he had long before pricked on my arm i could not therefore change the children with safety while francis lived and i began to think that i should not succeed in my revenge then the powers above us intervened francis while driving home one stormy night was thrown out of his dogcart and killed i saw my opportunity and i took it nobody knew of the tattooed cross on the skin of the real heir save myself and dr binjoy who had been attending on both children he was in love with me and i made him promise to be silent when i had secured his promise which i did by saying that i would marry him i changed the children in the cradle of the heir i placed my own child and with the son of my rival i left the village i never intended to marry binjoy whom i hated and when i fled he was forced to hold his tongue lest he should be accused of complicity in the abduction i went to london but my money came to an end i travelled to the isle of wight where my sister was staying she had left ryde i found out and had gone to scotland i had no money i was hungry and perishing with cold when i was rescued by that good samaritan the vicar of fairview he wished to adopt the child and as i hated it as being the son of my rival in the affections of francis i let him take it then i went to london afterwards to scotland where i lived with my sister who married mr colmer later on i became the wife of a drunken and wealthy brute called bryant then came misfortune my sisters husband lost his money and died of broken heart she took her little girls emma and anne and set up in taxtononthames as a dressmaker i came south with my husband he lost his money also but he was set up by his friends in the red star publichouse in tooleys alley we took the name of mr and mrs boazoph so as to cut off all links with our former lives my husband drank and ultimately he died of drink as mrs boazoph i carried on the business and drifted into evil ways i assisted thieves and rogues if you wish to know my history for twenty years ask the police they will tell it to you my sister had become paralytic and never knew me as mrs boazoph to her i was mrs bryant living on the little money left to me by my good husband i hope she may die in that belief so that i may retain at least one persons respect all this time i had watched the fortunes of the two children the false sir gregory had grown up to be a wicked young man fast and dissolute the true sir gregory passing under the name of edward hersham had become a journalist and was reported steady and clever dr binjoy had left damington and was living at taxtononthames with louis the son of michael fellenger then my niece emma came to london to enter a dressmakers establishment she found out the truth about my life and told her sister i asked them to keep the knowledge from their mother binjoy also found out where and how i was living he used to come up to town and stay at dr turnors or with me as dr renshaw hoping by a feigned name to hide the iniquitous life he led while in town he wanted to oust my son and get sir louis to hold the fellenger estates i refused to let him do this and threatened to produce the real heir should he attempt to do so young vaud used to come to my hotel he saw emma and fell in love with her i was glad of this as i knew that the young fellow was good and true much better than my wretched son for whom i had sinned vaud became engaged to emma he went to taxtononthames and saw my sister she gave her consent to the match all was going well when emma who had become acquainted with my son the false sir gregory went off with him to paris he married her and neglected her she destroyed herself as was confessed to me by the valet robert a dog of a creature i was distracted when i learned all this i went to my sister and i told her that the false sir gregory was my son i returned to town to find that young vaud was seriously ill afterwards he was sent on a sea voyage and he went over to paris when he got back to rescue emma from my miserable son she was dead and he returned to see if he could take vengeance on her murderer he told me that he would kill sir gregory but i thought that it was an idle threat afterwards i saw nothing more of him for some time my sister asked for the address of sir gregory as she wanted a photograph of emma which had been taken at taxtononthames when i went to gregorys rooms in halfmoon street to tell him the truth i saw the photograph i wrote on it the date of the birth and death of his victim i told him about the tattooed cross and how i could prove that he was not the real sir gregory because he had not that mark on his arm he did not believe me and turned me out of his rooms mehis mother at that moment i hated him for his likeness to his father who had wronged me but i could not harm him i went to taxtononthames i said nothing i wrote on an envelope the address of sir gregory and gave it to my sister so that she could write to him for the photograph on the back of which i had written all this took place before the murder then gregory came to my hotel on the evening of the twentyfirst of june i did not see him but i saw vaud who entered afterwards disguised as a black man i recognised him at once and asked him why he was dressed up like the servant of binjoy he said it was to play a trick on the doctor who was in the inner room waiting to see him i believed him although i thought his behaviour strange but i know that he had not been quite right in his head since his illness so that i thought his dressingup was a freak and let him pass into the inner room where i presumed he was about to see binjoy i went back to my own room and never dreamt that the supposed doctor was my son in disguise had i known i would not have left the halfcrazed vaud go into him knowing how he hated my son as the destroyer of emma i know nothing more i saw binjoy later on i asked him if he had seen vaud he said no that he had just come to the hotel i went into the inner room and found my son dead i did not know how he died till binjoy told me about the bloodpoisoning then i sent for the police and mr fanks arrived i saw the grains of gunpowder i thought they were the evidence of some drug which had destroyed my son i got rid of them by pulling off the tablecloth i did not tell the truth or speak out because i was afraid of being inculpated in the crime my character was so bad that i knew the police would have no mercy if they thought i was mixed up in the murder i did not want to disgrace my sister or let her know my real life my feigned name i afterwards went down to mere hall and saw binjoy i said i would put the rightful heir in his own place and oust louis binjoy said if i did he would tell my story and that with his evidence i would be accused of the murder i therefore held my tongue i could not bring back my son to life he had treated me badly and i did not want to get vaud into trouble as i knew that he was mad with grief and rage and was not responsible for his actions on the whole i thought it best to hold my tongue and for the above reasons i did so i have now spoken because edward hersham the rightful heir is accused of the crime he has suffered enough injustice and i do not wish to see him hanged binjoy can tell his own story of how he came to the hotel on that night and met with mr fanks vaud can confess if he will as to how he plotted and carried out the crime for myself i have said all i have to say what is set down here is the truth i am deeply sorry for my evil ways but i am paying for my follies with my life all i ask for is forgiveness and forgetfulness i have sinned i am punished all good christians pray for the soul of a wicked but deeply wronged woman signed madaline bryant better known as louisa boazoph chapter xxxiv the same the evidence of theophilus binjoy i am a medical man and in my early manhood i practised in the village of damington i was present at the birth of edward fielding and of gregory fellenger i know about the mark on the arm of the real heir madaline changed the two children and i said nothing as she promised to marry me i was madly in love with her she left the village and deceived me afterwards i held my tongue lest i should get into trouble also i hoped when the false sir gregory grew up to have a hold on him i was prevented from doing this by madaline whom i had discovered in tooleys alley under the name of mrs boazoph she threatened to reveal the name of the true heir if i meddled with her son i therefore did nothing i saw the poisoned needle which louis had made ready for an experiment it was in a cabinet in the laboratory young vaud came to taxtononthames nearly crazed with the death of emma colmer whom he had courted as emma calvert she had been driven to her death by her husband the false sir gregory and had killed herself in paris vaud asked me about poisons he said nothing to me about killing sir gregory or i should have dissuaded him from doing so wicked and rash an action i swear i did not wish the death of the young man what i said to him in the laboratory was purely without ulterior motives i admit i showed him the poisoned needle i was interested in the experiment and being full of it i spoke of our intention of trying the poison on the dog when vaud left the laboratory i did not miss the needle i did not miss it until louis spoke to me about it as turnor had lately been in the laboratory and we had been speaking about the experiment i thought he had taken the needle it never struck me that vaud had benefited by my explanation and had stolen the needle to kill gregory with louis i went up to town on the twentyfirst of june to see turnor and ask him for the needle i had no motive in taking louis to turnors if turnor attempted to blackmail louis i knew nothing about it i repel with scorn the insinuation that i purposely inveigled louis to great auk street to entangle him in the crime and so blackmail him i never heard of the murder until i went to the red star according to my usual custom of an evening madaline asked me if i had seen vaud who was disguised as a negro i said i had not we went into the room and found the body of sir gregory he was disguised as a workingman vaud had disappeared i ordered the body to be taken upstairs and made an examination i then saw that gregory had been killed by being inoculated with the poison which louis and i had discovered i recognised the cross of st catherine half tattooed on the arm and i guessed from that how vaud had induced gregory to let himself be pricked with the poisoned needle i showed the mark to fanks when he came upstairs but before doing so i obliterated it with a cut of the knife i did this because i thought i might be inculpated with the crime i remember advising hersham who i did not know was the real heir to disguise himself as a negro so as to gain realistic descriptions of street music i did not do so with any wrongful intention of connecting him with the murder madaline had told me how vaud was dressed as my negro servant i saw that the death had been brought about by the poisoned needle stolen from our laboratory by vaud and with these two things in my head i recognised my danger at once i gave my feigned name to fanks i suggested that the crime was the work of a secret society then i went back to turnor and i was aware that i was being watched and could not return to taxtononthames without being discovered i consulted turnor he advised the voyage to bombay and said i ought to send caesar in my place in order to get rid of him since the murderer of gregory had been disguised in his livery and also that caesar could send letters already written by me from india in order to keep up the deception and baffle the police i adopted the idea and assisted by dr turnor i carried it out with great success i had an interview with fanks in the character of dr renshaw and i told him that i was going to bombay i then took a passage to india in the p and o steamer oceana and wired to caesar to meet me at plymouth thither i went and gave the letters purporting to be written by myself from bombay to caesar and sent him off in my place afterwards i took off my disguise and went back to mere hall i had no idea that i had been followed by mr fanks and thinking that i had destroyed all links with the crime in tooleys alley likely to endanger louis and myself i advised him to offer a reward so as to still further avert suspicion this he did and i thought all was well till madaline came from mere hall to warn me against fanks and to threaten to put the real gregory in the place of louis i stopped her doing this and defied fanks how he overreached me how i was betrayed by louis has been told by others i can swear with a clear conscience that i acted throughout in the interests of louis who has treated me with the basest ingratitude i have no more to say save to express my pleasure that mr hersham has recovered his real name in the world i hope he will remember that it was indirectly through me that he was reinstated in his estates by my confirming the statements of madaline and that of the late sir francis his father i think that he should reward me in this hope i take my leave signed theophilus binjoy the evidence of anne colmer i am the daughter of mrs colmer of taxtononthames the sister of emma colmer who died in paris under the name of emma calvert and the niece of madaline garry better known as mrs boazoph i saw the letteror rather the envelopewhich she directed for my mother to get back the photograph of my sister from sir gregory it was taken out of our house by herbert vaud and i believe he sent it to sir gregory with the cardboard star making the appointment in tooleys alley i had no idea that vaud contemplated revenging the death of my sister on gregory i knew that he hated him and that he would do him harm if he could but i did not know that he would go so far as murder i wired to ted hersham on the twentyfirst as my mother told me that she suspected that vaud had taken the envelope and that he contemplated harm to sir gregory i wanted ted to get back the envelope afterwards i thought that i would see my aunt in tooleys alley as i knew she had great influence with vaud i sent the telegram and immediately without returning to the house i went up to town i was detained by the train breaking down and i did not arrive in town till nearly seven oclock i went to the red star where i saw mr fanks and then heard of the crime i fancied that vaud might have committed it but i was not sure i was afraid lest my mother should be implicated in it as she informed me that she had told vaud about the substitution of the false sir gregory and about the tattooed cross this story had been related to her by mrs boazoph when we learned that sir gregory had caused the death of his wife my sister i determined to recover the envelope in case my aunt should get into trouble and to obtain the photograph lest the police should trace the connection of the socalled emma calvert with myself and my mother i went up to the chambers in halfmoon street there i saw mr fanks and i recognised him as a detective i had seen him and heard his name when i had been at the red star shortly after the committal of the crime i was afraid we would all get into trouble therefore i took advantage of roberts faint to leave the room i got into a cab and told the man that i was being followed by a gentleman he assisted me to escape by dropping me in piccadilly and afterwardsas i learnedhe misled mr fanks who followed me i know nothing about the poisoned needle or how the crime was accomplished i heard afterwards about the tattooed cross from my mother it was with no intention of getting ted into trouble that i told him to assume the dress of caesar when the detective suspected it i advised him to make a clean breast of it which he afterwards did i did not tell mr fanks what i knew as i was afraid of getting my mother and aunt into difficulties all this is true i swear and i know no more about the matter signed anne colmer the evidence of mrs colmer i told vaud about the substitution of gregory for edward hersham my sister mrs bryant had confessed it to me i was mad with rage and grief at the way in which my girl had been treated by gregory and i thought vaud might see about getting him turned out of the place he wrongfully occupied and so punish his wickedness i had no idea that vaud intended to kill sir gregory bad as he was i did not wish to go that far i only wanted him to be deprived of his estates and title so that he should suffer i gave the envelope which had been written by my sister mrs bryant with the address in halfmoon street so that vaud should call on sir gregory and tell him the truth and should get back the photograph of my poor girl i knew nothing of the murder which took place in a low hotel in tooleys alley and which was kept by a notorious woman called mrs boazoph i also told vaud that ted hersham was writing articles on street music and that to study the subject he was going about london in the guise of a negro i only told him this in the course of conversation and without any motive this is all i know about the affair signed jane colmer the evidence of dr turnor i did not take the poisoned needle i knew nothing of such an instrument louis and binjoy came up to me on the twentyfirst to ask me about it i denied having it but louis did not believe me when i was called in by mrs boazoph he would not let me go out of the room binjoy went under the name of renshaw he used that name and a disguise in order to enjoy himself in london after he left louis finding that i had not the needle returned to taxtononthames binjoy came back he told me that gregory fellenger was dead and that he was being watched i saw his danger and advised him to keep up his fictitious character so as to deceive the police i suggested the voyage to india i helped to carry out the plan he got away to mere hall safely as we thought when fanks asked me questions i did my best to baffle him for the sake of binjoy i had no other motive i was ignorant of the tattooed cross of the changing of the children i saw sir louis when he succeeded to the estates by the death of his cousin i did not blackmail him the sum of money he gave me was a reward for my helping binjoy to escape i know nothing of the murder save what i read in the newspaper i consider that i have been ungratefully treated by mr louis fellenger and most insolently by the man who calls himself fanks i have nothing more to add signed walter turnor the confession of herbert vaud i killed gregory fellenger i am glad that i killed him when i found out in paris how he had deceived and slain the woman i loved i determined to make him pay for his wickedness an eye for an eye that is scripture i wished to kill gregory without harm to myself and an opportunity soon occurred i was at mrs colmers at taxtononthames commiserating with her on the death of her daughter and my affianced wife i did not tell her i wished to kill the scoundrel i told nobody she related to me the history of the changing of the children which had been told to her by her sister mrs bryant whom i knew as mrs boazoph she wanted to avenge the death of her daughter on gregory by depriving him of his title and estates also she gave me the address of gregory written on an envelope by mrs boazoph and asked me to call upon him for the double purpose of telling him what he really was and also to get the photograph which had been seen and written upon by mrs boazoph in gregorys chambers i took the envelope but at that time i did not design the murder i wanted to kill gregory but i could not see how to do it with safety to myself i afterwards went to mrs boazoph and learned from her that she had told her son about the tattooing and the falseness of his position she implored me not to see him about his relationship to her i agreed for i wished to kill him and make him suffer the taking away of his property was not good enough in my eyes to punish him for his wickedness afterwards i went to taxtononthames to see binjoy i knew that he was a chemist and i desired to ask him about a poison to kill gregory he told me about the poisoned needle and showed it to me whether he did so in order to put the idea into my head i do not know i did not tell him that i intended to kill gregory so far he is guiltless but he certainly showed me the wayinnocently perhapsto kill gregory when i came back from taxtononthames i had the poisoned needle in my possession and saw how to carry out my plan i remembered the tattooed cross on the arm of the rightful heir and i resolved to make use of that to induce gregory to let me tattoo his arm with the poisoned needle i placed the advertisement in a paper which i knew he took in i saw his answer and i then sent him the cardboard star appointing the meetingplace in tooleys alley i imitated the writing on the envelope when designing a star so that if necessary the blame might rest on mrs boazoph his mother for the same reason i chose the red star as the meetingplace to make things doubly sure i made use of hershams masquerade as a negro and i adopted his disguise to implicate him moreover i thought that failing hersham i might be able to throw the blame on binjoy and his negro servant in every way i thought that i was safe i went to the red star on the twentyfirst i met mrs boazoph and made an excuse to her for my disguise which she penetrated that i was about to play a trick on binjoy she thought that i was mad and i let her remain in that delusion but i here state that i am quite sane that i killed gregory with the greatest deliberation and that i do not regret what i have done i went into the room i met gregory he took me for the negro of dr binjoy whom he had never seen the lights were low and i said little also i disguised my voice gregory was a remarkably stupid creature else i should never have succeeded in my plan also he was rather drunk i counted on his density in coming into his presence at all events he did not know me and when i told him that the rightful heir must have the cross pricked on his arma fact which i said i had heard from binjoyhe let me tattoo it in his arm i did so with the poisoned needle and in a short space of time he became insensible afterwards he died then i pulled down his sleeve and left the hotel the gunpowder scattered on the table was used by me as a device to make gregory think that i was really tattooing him afterwards i left a parcel containing the poisoned needle at his chambers to rid myself of all evidence of the crime well i killed him and went away no one else is guilty of the crime but me i conceived it without assistance i alone committed the crime in tooleys alley and killed gregory fellenger or rather edward fielding the son of madaline garry and sir francis i am not sorry i glory in having punished a villain i am sorry that i was found out but i was not surprised when mrs boazoph betrayed me i wondered that she did not do so long ago when this is read i shall be dead signed herbert vaud chapter xxxv the opinion of octavius fanks a few months after the confession of vaud and the end of the tooley alley case fanks was seated with louis fellenger in the house of the latter at taxtononthames lois had surrendered the estates to hersham who was now known by his rightful title of sir gregory fellenger mrs boazoph was dead anne colmer contemplated marriage with the new sir gregory and mr fanks was having a chat with fellenger about the extraordinary matters in which they both had been concerned when did you get back to town fanks asked louis when they were comfortably seated last week old fellow i have been enjoying myself in italy and i assure you that i needed it after the wear and tear of the tooley alley affair i came down to have a chat with you about it i am glad you have there are one or two points about those confessions which i do not understand that case was a hard nut to crack fanks fanks looked up from the pipe he was filling hard he echoed you may well say that fellenger i have had many hard cases in my time but the tooley alley mystery was the hardest of them all the affair of monsieur judas was difficult so was the chinese jar puzzle the carbuncle clue gave me some trouble but all these were childs play compared to the mystery of your cousins death i thought i should never get a hold of the rope with which i designed to hang vaud you didnt hang him however no he managed to hang himself before his trial i was not sorry poor devil nor was i said louis and i think that vaud was mad when he killed gregory mad with despair and grief at the end of emma calvert the old man has gone abroad i hear yes i met him in italy he is quite broken down as he was very proud of his son herbert but he told me that he always thought herbert would do something rash although he never suspected that he killed gregory how could he when the young man conducted himself so circumspectly i dont think herbert was insane said fanks decisively he acted too cleverly and cunningly for that he killed gregory in cold blood with the greatest determination besides look at the measures he took to secure his safety no no my friend vaud was not mad crate told me that you suspected him for some time before you found out the truth yes i did i suspected him without any evidence to go on but he protested so much and behaved so queerly that i thought he was the man i wanted all the same as i had no evidence to go on i held my tongue until i was certain when i left binjoy ill at mere hall i could think of no one so likely to have committed the crime as vaud so on the chance that mrs boazoph would tell the truth i sent garth for him when he came into the room at the red star mrs boazoph spotted him at once i knew that the woman was aware of the real murderer i saw that on the night the crime was committed her action with the gunpowder gave me that tip and mrs boazoph alias mrs bryant alias mrs fielding alias madaline garry is dead also i was sorry for that woman fanks so was i said the detective promptly she had a hard time of it i dont think that she was naturally bad and in happier circumstances she might have been a decent member of society but look at the training and misfortunes she had sir francis a fool of a first husband a brute of a second and all the temptations at tooleys alley to contend against i wonder she was as decent as she was i am a deal sorrier for her than for your friend binjoy who got off scotfree dont call him my friend said louis with a shudder i hate the very name of the man it was only out of respect for my father that i bore with him for so long i was glad when he went away did you ever see so insolent a confession as he made oh i was prepared for anything from a scoundrel like binjoy he gave me a rub for myself and so did his friend turnor arcades ambo blackguards both quoted fanks smiling but hersham did not remember him as he expected him to no the present sir gregory whom you will call hersham sent binjoy away pretty sharply i can tell you binjoy and turnor actually had the cheek to call on him at mere hall and ask him for money in order to leave england on the plea that their substantiation of mrs boazophs evidence had gained him the estate i think it was your decency in letting hersham have the estates without going into court that made things so smooth fellenger do you regret the loss no i assure you i do not i was satisfied that hersham was truly the heir the evidence of that paper we found and of mrs boazoph was quite enough i was glad to come back here and go on with my experiments in peace i accepted a thousand a year from hersham which he insisted on giving me so you see i am fairly well off and you are good friends with hershami beg his pardonsir gregory fellenger of mere hall in the county of hants i am excellent friends with him and with his future wife anne colmer you know of course that they are going to be married in a month or so that is if mrs colmer does not die in the meantime from what i hear from garth it is likely that she will die said fanks i expect the poor woman will be glad to go now that she sees her daughter will make a good marriage garth came to see me the other day said louis and he told me that at one time he thought i had committed the crime i thought so too said fanks quietly mrs jerusalem did her best to make me suspect you i am glad you found that i was guiltless by the way where is mrs jerusalem she is keeping house for garth i hear that hersham gave garth some money knowing how hardup he was so he has set up a house on the strength of it i dont envy garth his housekeeper oh she loves him in her own savage way said louis coolly i daresay when he marries he will give her the goby i am sure she deserves it for the double way in which she treated me then she will go to the union or become an emigrant to america like messrs binjoy and turnor why america she has a sister there i wonder what those two scoundrelly doctors are doing in the states evil you may be sure of that replied fanks let us hope that they will be lynched some day i am sure that they deserve it they do assented fellenger i am sorry they did not get into trouble fanks laughed that was certainly your own fault my dear fellow he said well i was unwilling to prosecute for that blackmailing because i did not want the public to know more of our family scandal than was necessary i was sorry to let the blackguards go but after all it is best so dont you think so yourself no i dont said fanks you are too full of the milk of human kindness my dear fellenger i should have punished the rascals i am sure you would not if your family had been involved in such a business i am glad you kept so much from the public ear there are quite enough scandals as it is well we have discussed the case a good time so suppose you come inside and have some luncheon im agreeable was fanks reply and he got up to follow his friend by the way can i take any message from you to hersham and miss colmer i am going down to mere hall next week tell them i hope they will ask me to dance at the wedding of course they will i shall dance also added fanks with a smile i deserve to for i danced enough after the evidence of this tooley alley case may i never have such another it was more like a detective novel than a story in real life but it is over now thank heaven we have acted our several parts the bad have been punished and the good rewarded so we can drop the curtain on the tragedy of tooleys alley the end
