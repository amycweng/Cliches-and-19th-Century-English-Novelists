desperately bored like xeres he longed for some new pleasure yet knew not where to look for one this was the result of being surfeited with the sweets of extraordinary good fortune born to a title endowed with passable good looks gifted with abilities above the average and possessed of admirable health he should have been the happiest of men the more especially as his income ran well into five figures and he had the whole wide world to play with certainly he had played with it and with life up to his present age of thirtyfive years perhaps this was the reason of his acute boredom if all work and no play makes jack dull all play and no work must necessarily make him blase therefore in spite of the excellent breakfast spread before him on this bright summer morning when london was looking at its best the young man was ungratefully wondering what he could do to render life endurable he ate from habit and not because he enjoyed his food he read the morning papers since it was necessary to be abreast of the times for conversational purposes although very little was new therein and still less was true by the time he arrived at the marmalade stage of the meal he was again considering the possibilities of the next four and twenty hours in this discontented frame of mind he was discovered by his aunt lady sophia haken bustled into the pleasant room exasperatingly cheerful and very pleased with life in general and with herself in particular she was an elderly woman of a somewhat masculine type who lived a simple outofdoor existence and who proclaimed loudly that it was necessary for humanity to return to the stone age for true enjoyment having been riding in the row for the last two hours she entered in her habit filled with the egotism of the early riser as a near relative she could not do less than scold prelice for lingering over a late breakfast and told himalso as a near relativethat she scolded him for his good she had done so very often before without result and but that she loved to lay down the law would have long since given over the attempt to improve her nephew nevertheless anxious to achieve the impossible she attacked him with pristine vigor as though aware for the first time of his bad habits nine oclock and still at breakfast said lady sophia significantly and slapped her skirts with a whip which she would have dearly liked to lay across her lazy nephews broad shoulders prelice looked indolently at the clock then at the table and finally at his fuming aunt i cannot deny it he said with a yawn is that all you have to say she asked much disgusted prelice heaved a sigh it was necessary to say something if only to stem the coming tide of verbose speech how well you are looking because i have been up since six oclock how unwise you will probably sleep all the afternoon lady sophia snapped tartly i shall do nothing of the sort oh very well he assented you will do nothing of the sort anything for a quiet life even agreement with the improbable his aunt grasped her whip dangerously how exasperating you are i was just thinking the same about you confessed prelice goodhumouredly it is so disagreeable for a late riser to be reminded of the time and having folded his napkin he lighted a cigarette how long is this going on demanded lady sophia fiercely his imperturbability made her long to shake him thoroughly how long is what going on asked prelice provokingly this idle idiotic insane sensual foolish wicked dilatory existence seven adjectives murmured the young man opening his eyes waste wasteoh what waste how long is this going on inquired his relative again and whipped her skirtsinstead of prelices backwith renewed vigour he was forced to answer as long as i do no doubt what else is to be done i should like to know you shall know serve your country what and be abused in the penny press no thank you you can surely help your brotherman surelyonly to learn how much ingratitude exists in the world lady sophia stamped bit her lip and looked like a ruffled cockatoo in a bad temper she wanted to quarrel and it annoyed her that prelice would not meet her half way by supplying a reason she had to invent the quarrel and bring about the quarrel and carry on the quarrel and finish the quarrel without assistance marry was the one word which suggested itself and she hoped that it would be like a red rag to a bull oh jerusalem prelice shook his closely cropped fair head i would much rather serve brotherman than marry sisterwoman you offer me a choice of unoriginal evils you never will face the truth declared lady sophia irrelevantly and forthwithaccording to an oldestablished customshe proceeded to recount the family historythat is she picked out the worst traits of prelices ancestors and debited them to his account he smoked through two cigarettes and nodded at intervals not very much interested since he had heard the same oration at least a dozen times lady sophia having worked her way from the reign of elizabeth down to that of edward vii ended with a lurid pennysensational picture of what would befall her listener in the near future unless he worked like a nigger such a bad illustration interposed prelice placidly niggers dont work as i have just returned from the west indies i ought to know lady sophia snorted down the interruption and seeing that he was still unimpressed tried to goad him into industry by mentioning several of his schoolfellows who had attained to comparative fame and fortune while preliceas she scathingly put ithad been grovelling in the mud even young shepworth ended lady sophia somewhat out of breath and he was never clevereven he is counsel for the defence this very day in an important murder case im deuced sorry for his client murmured prelice indolently why should you be demanded his aunt aggressively you said that he wasnt clever he must be lady sophia contradicted herself with feminine calmness if he wasnt he certainly would not be talking this very day at the new bailey go and hear him prelice and be ashamed that a foolyes a superlative foolshould succeed where you fail what do you mean inquired her nephew with great curiosity first you say that ned isnt clever ned ned i never mentioned ned who is ned shepworth edward shepworthned for short we were great chums at eton you know but you say that he isnt clever then you insist that he is and wind up by calling him a fool you know quite well what i mean said lady sophia with dignity i really dont confessed her nephew artlessly you describe such a complex character however as i have nothing to do today and never have anything to doidler i shall go to the new bailey and listen to ned hanging his client so brilliant a barrister as mr shepworth will certainly get her off said lady sophia decisively prelice passed over this new contradiction its a woman yes mona chent you know her im sure i dont the criminal classes dont attract me she is not a criminal but a lady said his aunt as though the two things were incompatible and you do know her mona chent the niece of old sir oliver lanwin prelice reflected with bent brows i never heard the name before i assure you aunt sophia he said at length remember that i have been travelling round the world for the last seven years and know very little of the latest london sensation you ought to stay at home and make yourself acquainted with people prelice including this murderess she is not a murderess cried lady sophia energetically i always did think that she was a sweet girl and if she did kill her uncle it was no more than he deserved i never liked him therefore he ought to be murdered said prelice rising and stretching himself before the empty grate so sir oliver was the victim i have heard of him he used to send ned shells and barbaric things from the south seas and now ned is repaying him by defending his murderess i tell you mona did not murder the man i know her i have received her would i receive a murderess it might be a draw to some of your parties said prelice politely and with a recollection of several dull entertainments but i cannot quite gather from your clear explanation if she is guilty or not half london thinks that she is and half asserts her innocence what does shepworth think he naturally believes her to be innocent because he defends her because she is his future wife prelice looked startled oh jerusalem and if he proves her innocence hell marry her i suppose as she is her uncles heiress and mr shepworth is poor i presume he will ten thousand a year is not to be despised but a wife with such a past protested the young man ugh did miss chent murder her uncle to get the money she didnt murder him at all look at the facts of the case i shall be delighted to if you will place them before me you ought to know all about them said lady sophia rising impatiently everyone has been talking about the case for the last monthever since mona chent was arrested in fact ah but you see i have only just arrived in london i shall go to my club and get posted up in the latest scandal the latest sensation corrected his aunt go to the new bailey instead and hear mr shepworth place the case before the judge and jury his eloquence will make you sorry for your lazy useless life he will be a kc cried lady sophia becoming prophetic and attorneygeneral and lord chancellor and king of timbuctoo no doubt loud cheers lady sophia looked indignantly at the scoffer who beamed on her benignly with laughing blue eyes you have deteriorated since you left the army no doubt the standard of morality in the army being so high oh his aunt stamped and flung open the door with a tragic air i have done with you your flippancy is disgusting i repeat prelice i have done with you and she departed hastily lest a reply from the scoffer should spoil her impressive exit prelice laughed knowing that lady sophia would never be done with him while she had a tongue to wag also he believed that she was truly fond of him and knew that she had only too much reason to accuse him of wasting his life he resolved to mend his ways more as an experiment in selfdenial than because he wanted to and cast about for a model person to imitate after lady sophias conversation the name of edward shepworth naturally suggested itself so prelice arrayed himself in purple and fine linen and ordered round his motor car within two hours he was driving out of halfmoon street and was soon dodging the traffic of piccadilly it was so delightful manipulating the machine in the sunshine and acting as a chauffeur so appealed to him that he was minded to turn the mercedes in the direction of richmond but the hints about the murder being an unusual one kept him to his earlier determination also a copy of the daily mirror assured him that the accused girl was exceedingly pretty finally he had always been friendly with the counsel for the defence and thought that he would renew the tie of old schooldays these things brought his smart mercedes to the brannew portals of the criminal court and when he had handed over the steeringwheel to his chauffeur he sought out the arena wherein shepworth was fighting for the life of his promised wife naturally the first person at whom the young man looked was the prisoner in the dock and he mentally confessed that the daily mirror photograph had not done her justice it could scarcely do so in mere black and white as miss chent needed vivid tints to convey her peculiar charm she was one of those rare blondes who embody sunshine in hair and eyes a dragonfly of humanity all radiance and glow since she was on trial for her life prelice quite expected to see a whitefaced terrified creature worn out with shame and suffering but miss chent might have been in an operabox for all the emotion she displayed prelice had more experience of women than was good for him but he never beheld so perfectly dressed or so perfectly serene a girl it would be absurd to say that so levelheaded a young man fell in love with this attractive criminal at first sight but he certainly felt drawn to her she looked like a captive angel and without knowing the rights or wrongs of the case prelice mentally pronounced her to be entirely innocent her calmness if not her beauty acquitted her as his susceptible heart decided for no woman with an unclean conscience could have faced judge and jury with such manifest confidence prelice thought of joan of arc on trial for sorcery of mary stuart before a prejudiced tribunal of marie antoinette and of the vestal who proved her innocence by drawing tiber water in a sieve he might also have recalled the marquise de brinvilliers likewise calm beautiful andguilty but he did not the court was filled with more or less fashionable people who came to make a roman holiday of sir oliver lanwins violent death and miss chents position doubtless she had been well known in society and those who had been her friends were here to watch her in the new role of an accused criminal prelice was disgusted at the heartless conduct of some ladies who whispered and tittered and used operaglasses to stare at the unfortunate girl he internally commended his aunt for having had the good taste to remain absent and then turned his eyes on the array of barristers to search for ned shepworth if the prisoner was serene in the consciousness of innocence her counsel certainly was less composed a strong will and the second nature of custom kept shepworth sufficiently selfcontrolled to deceive those who had but a passing acquaintance with his personality but prelice who had known the young barrister for years noted that his usually ruddy complexion was whiter than usual and that his eyes seemed to be sunken in his head by reason of the dark shadows beneath them shepworth was a slim handsome man brownhaired and browneyed with a cleanshaven face and a resolute mouth in his wig and gown he looked a very presentable son of themis if somewhat less composed than the traditionally unemotional lawyer should be he was seated at the long table with two older men who apparently were his coadjutors and near the defence trio the counsel for the prosecutionappointed by the public prosecutor on behalf of the crownwas chatting amiably with his colleague a keenfaced young barrister behind sat many other lawyers wigged and gowned who were taking the deepest interest in the proceedings for the moment the court was so still that the rustling of the briefs as the barristers turned their pages could be plainly heard are those two fellows assisting mr shepworth in the defence prelice whispered to a legallooking bystander at his elbow no replied the man in a low voice the big fellow is cudworth kc and the other is young arkers who acts as junior counsel shepworth is not defending as he was in the house when the crime was committed and will be called as a witness so lady sophia was inaccurate as usual and prelice felt somewhat disappointed that he would not have an opportunity of hearing his old schoolchum orating however he had little time to think for at this moment the prosecuting counsel got on his legs to open the case prelice felt that the curtain had risen on a tragedy he wondered what would be the scene when the curtain fell chapter ii the trial the counsel in a clear and deliberate voice opened his speech with an unvarnished statement of the case and a very remarkable story he unfolded prelice as an experienced traveller had always believed in the impossible but it seemed to him that he had returned to prosaic england to hear a veritable fairytale there was something extremely fantastic about the way in which the crime was said to have been committed as set forth by the speaker the event happened in this wise sir oliver lanwin the last male heir of an ancient kentish family whose seat was situated near hythe had found himself some forty years previous to the trial a pauper with a newly inherited title seeing no chance in england of rehabilitating his fortunes he had taken what little money he possessed to new zealand leaving his only sister well provided for as the wife of an army officer named chent after making some money in various ways at hokitika sir oliver had purchased a fruit schooner to trade amongst the south sea islands being successful he had bought other ships and for more than thirty years he had been a kind of polynesian merchantprince owing to his wealth and enterprise and keen business capacity he had never married because of an early disappointment and ten years before he had returned to england with a capital representing ten thousand a year with this he had retired to his ancestral seat near hythe and there proposed to end his days in comfort after the fashion of sinbad the famous sailor of the arabian nights he brought with him an old shellback mariner steve agstone by name who was an important witness for the prosecution unfortunately said the counsel the man had disappeared immediately before the inquest after hinting to the housekeeper mrs blexey that he had actually witnessed the committal of the crime for which the prisoner was being tried in spite of all efforts made by the police this witness could not be discovered and it was impossible to say why he had disappeared but counsel hoped to produce other witnesses who would prove beyond all shadow of a doubt that the prisoner was guilty after proceeding thus far counsel sipped a glass of water hitched his gown more comfortably on to his shoulders and continued his speech amidst the breathless silence of the listeners being a bachelor sir oliver felt somewhat lonely since he was of a sociable disposition for a few months he kept open house but as his nature proved to be exacting and imperious he did not get on well with his neighbours finally he proclaimed that they were all idiots and closing his doors he became more or less of a recluse it was then that sir olivers widowed sister mrs chent died suddenly leaving her daughter monathe prisonerto the care of her uncle sir oliver became extremely fond of the young lady who was of a lively and amiable disposition indeed his attachment was so great that he made a will in her favour by which she was to inherit ten thousand a year and the familyseat and here proceeded counsel impressively i may mention a circumstance which in the light of after events has some bearing on the case mr oliver while bathing at samoa had his leg taken off from the knee by a shark he thus was unable to indulge in field sports in games or indeed in any kind of outofdoor life he therefore took to reading and of a somewhat unusual kind jacob bohme paracelsus and eliphas levi were his favourite authors from which it can be judged that the dead man took a deep interest in psychic questions he also consulted palmists fortunetellers astrologers and crystalgazers frequently asking them down to lanwin grange in fact at the very time when the crime was committed madame marie eppingrave a wellknown bond street interpreter of the future was staying in the house she will be called as a witness but you can see gentlemen of the jury that the late baronet was an exceedingly superstitious man although clearheaded in business and perfectly capable of managing his affairs it was at this point that shepworth caught sight of prelice and he nodded in a friendly manner then he scribbled a note and sent it by an usher to the young man it proved to be a request that prelice would wait for him at the door when the court adjourned for luncheon prelice slipped the missive into his pocket and nodded a reply shepworth seemed to be pleased with this prompt acceptance and immediately resumed his attitude of attention while counsel continued to boom out facts with the drone of a bumblebee as the narrative proceeded it appeared that a few months before his death sir oliver had received a south sea visitor in the person of a young sailor called captain felix jadby whose father he had known at tahiti the baronet was extremely intimate with the visitor and practically gave him the run of the house captain jadby came and went at will and sir oliver talked to him a great deal in connection with matters dealing with polynesian trade this was not to be wondered at since the baronet having been a trader himself it was pleasant for him to converse with one who knew about such things unfortunately captain jadby fell in love with the prisoner and wished to marry her she refused to become his wife on the plea that she loved mr edward shepworth and was engaged to him sir oliver was annoyed at the engagement as he desired the marriage with captain jadby to take place on the day of his death he quarrelled seriously with the prisoner and according to madame marie eppingraves evidencesince she was present during the quarrelsir oliver stated that if the prisoner did not marry captain jadby he would disinherit her prisoner still refused and retired to her room saying that she would not reappear until captain jadby was out of the house for the sake of peace jadby went up to london that same day with the intention of returning by the ten oclock train then if prisoner still remained obdurate he intended to say goodbye to his host and leave for the colonies within the week and now gentlemen of the jury continued counsel with another hitch of his gown we come to the most important part of the story previous to going to london captain jadby had a wordy quarrel with mr shepworth and from words the quarrel came to blows mr shepworths foot slipped and he slightly sprained his ankle so that he was not able to leave lanwin grange as he desired his position was an unpleasant one since sir oliver was not well disposed towards him on account of the engagement which existed with the prisoner as captain jadby had left the grange mr shepworth wished to go also and would have gone but that his sprained ankle prevented his removal and he therefore remained in his room now gentlemen you can see the position of the several people connected with this matter at the time when the crime was committed captain jadby was in london intending to return at ten oclock mr shepworth was in his room with a sprained ankle which prevented his leaving it the prisoner was also in her room and even though captain jadby had departed for the time being she declined to come down to dinner madame marie eppingrave and sir oliver dined alone and then the baronet retired to his library where until nine oclockaccording to madame maries evidencehe chatted with her on occult subjects also as madame marie will state sir oliver expressed himself strongly on the subject of the prisoners refusal of jadby as sir oliver was in the habit of retiring early to bed on account of his health his factotum steve agstone entered the library at nine oclock to bolt and bar the windows there were no shutters and this please remember gentlemen as it is an important point the servants had already retired and after making the library safe steve agstone left the room with the intention of waiting up for captain jadby who was expected back by the ten oclock train and who intended to walk to the grange madame marie lingered for a few minutes to say goodnight and then retired to her bedroom she declares that it was five minutes after nine oclock that she left the library sir oliverso she sayswas seated at the table near the window reading and smoking here gentlemen pursued counsel taking up a plan is a drawing of the library he passed it by an usher to the foreman of the jury you will see that there is only one door to the library which leads out into the hall and which is opposite to the fireplace the inner walls of the room on three sides are covered with books but the fourth wallthe outer wall gentlemenhas in it three tall french windows which lead on to a terrace over a lawn the lawn extends for some distance ending in flowerbeds these in their turn being encircled by shrubs and farther back by the park trees when madame marie left the room sir oliver was seated at his writingtable marked x immediately before the middle window as the night was chilly there was a fire burning in the grate you understand gentlemen good now we come to the discovery of the crime counsel then went on to state that captain jadby returned according to his promise at ten oclockthat is his train arrived at the station which was about halfamile from the grange he walked to sir olivers house as he had no luggage to carry and the night was fine if somewhat cold on emerging from the avenue on to the lawn he saw that there was a light in the library and it was here that counsel again drew the jurys attention to the fact that the windows had no shutters captain jadby therefore thought that as sir oliver had not retired to bed he would knock at one of the windows and enter the house that way so as to avoid rousing the other inmates by ringing the bell he advanced to the lighted windows and looked through the middle one which was veiled as were the others with curtains of indian beadwork to his surprise he saw that sir oliver seated at his desk was lying forward on the writingtable i am precise to a fault here gentlemen said counsel jocularly but it is absolutely to be even pedantic so that you will understand sir oliver he continued was lying with his face on his outstretched hands and in an armchair near the fireplace sat the prisoner in a white dressinggown with her hands on her lap captain jadby could not see very distinctly owing to the beadwork curtains but he saw sufficient to guess that something was wrong especially as his knocking produced no effect either on sir oliver or on the prisoner he unconsciously pushed at the middle window and to his surprise discovered that it was not locked he therefore entered and what he saw made him ring the bell at once to summon the household and what did he see gentlemen of the jury he saw that sir oliver was dead he had been stabbed to the heart under the left shoulderblade apparently while seated at his desk the body had naturally fallen forward the prisoner seated in the armchair with her hands on her lap was in an unconscious state but her hands and the white dressinggown were stained with bloodwith the blood gentlemen said counsel impressively of her uncle before anyone could enter the room she revived and on seeing the body of her uncle displayed great terror and horror steve agstone who had been waiting up for captain jadby was the first person to enter and on discovering the dead body of his masterto whom he was sincerely attachedhe at once rushed out of the house for a doctor by this time the servants were aroused by the noise and with them came madame marie eppingrave even mr shepworth lame as he was managed to crawl down the stairs so loud had been the clamour which had awakened him and what did the prisoner say to all this gentlemen she told a most ridiculous story to account for her presence in the library according to her statement which the inspector from hythe took down in the presence of witnesses prisoner said that she could not sleep on account of her quarrel with her uncle she came down the stairs at a quarter to ten oclock and entered the library with the intention of making friends with her uncle when she enteredso she declaresthe room was filled with pungent white smoke through which she could dimly see sir oliver seated at the writingtable the smoke made her senses reel but by holding her handkerchief to her mouth she managed to stagger to the middle window she had just managed to unfasten the catch when she fell unconscious the next thing she remembersaccording to her preposterous storyis the presence of captain jadby she declares that she did not know when sir oliver was stabbed and when she entered the library did not know why it should be filled with smoke when captain jadby enteredas he will tell youthere was no smoke and the fire had burned down to red cinders again counsel had to drink a sip of water as he had been talking for some time and there was a low murmur of conversation heard before he again began to speak the story which he alleged that miss chent had told seemed ridiculous and even prelice prejudiced as he was in her favour thought that the defence was absurd but miss chent never moved a muscle she did not even change colour quiet and without a word she sat in the dock waiting patiently for her innocence to be made manifest and yet as everyone thought her tale was too ridiculous for words and finally gentlemen said counsel taking up his brief i would draw your attention to the medical evidence the doctor called in stated that sir oliver was murdered about ten oclockmark that gentlemenabout the very time that the prisoner confesses she was in the library in a state of unconsciousness captain jadby did not arrive until thirty minutes after ten as he did not walk very quickly and again gentlemen no weapon was found wherewith the wounda wide clean woundcould have been inflicted but an indian dagger with a jade handle used by sir oliver as a paperknife is missing with that i verily believe the deceased was stabbed and remember gentlemen that the window was unfastened and if we are to believe this foolish tale of a pungent smoke prisoner unfastened it when she entered and immediately before she fainted gentlemen she did faint but not then no can you not guess what took place the prisoner came down the stairs to see her uncle perhaps as she declares to make it up with him since we may as well give her the benefit of the doubt but in place of reconciliation the quarrel grows more bitter impulsive and furious the prisoner snatches the paperknifea dangerous weapon remember gentlemenand while sir oliver turns again to his book stabs him in the back she then opens the window and buried the paperknife all bloody in the garden on reentering the sight of the dead body shows her what a terrible crime she has committed instead of refastening the window she staggers forward with the intention of regaining her bedroom and of playing the part of an innocent woman but her nerves which maintained her strength and consciousness so far fail at the critical moment she manages to reach the armchair and falls into it unconscious some time after ten oclock there she lies with bloodstained hands and dress until captain jadby arrives when she recovers her senses to tell a wild and improbable story sir oliver as the medical evidence proves was alive when she entered the library at a quarter to ten he is dead and his blood is smearing the prisoners dressinggown at halfpast ten when captain jadby arrives and all that time prisoner says that she was unconscious quite so she was up to the moment of captain jadbys arrival and from the moment when she staggered into the room after burying the knife in the garden and now gentlemen here counsel went on to state that in spite of all efforts the knife could not be found he also detailed more explicitly the medical evidence and gave the name of the witness whom he proposed to call and ended with a damning indictment of the reasons which had led the prisoner to commit the crime amongst these was the fact that by sir olivers death prisoner would inherit ten thousand a year at once and would thus have been enabled to marry edward shepworth when his speech was finished counsel sat down wiping his brow and a hum of conversation rose in the crowded court monas eyes wandered here and there and rested finally on the pitying face of lord prelice for a moment she remained calm and then flushed deeply the first sign of emotion she had given a moment later and she was led away in charge of a warder while the court adjourned for luncheon chapter iii the papercutter i am delighted to see you dorry said shepworth addressing prelice by his eton nickname when the young man had been called dormouse shortened as above on account of his lethargic habits i want you very badly come and grub somewhere and we can talk prelice responded very cordially as the two had been very close friends at the old school and submitted to be led round the corner to a small hidden restaurant much affected by the gentlemen of the long robe here when they were snugly ensconced in a corner shepworth ordered food for his friend but contented himself with a cigarette and a cup of strong coffee i cant eat a morsel he protested when prelice advised a meal i am too much bothered over this case how the deuce did you come to the court dorry prelice who possessed a hearty appetite tackled a plate of cold beef and answered between mouthfuls my aunt sophia bullyragged me this morning as an idler and advised me to hear you spouting she wanted to make me ashamed of myself and are you asked shepworth aimlessly rats said his lordship inelegantly but im sorry old man this is a sinfully hard business for you why didnt you write me that you were engaged i didnt know where to find you dorry lady sophia whom i met once or twice told me that you were scampering round the world i have wanted you prelice these last few months yes and before that before the murder do you mean yes i have never had a chum since i left school lots of friends no doubt good men all but a chum he laid his hand on prelices shoulder with a burst of emotion oh dorry what a mercy you are here and that i have some safe person in whom to confide i should have had to tell someone in the long run tell someone what asked prelice soberly about that poor girl miss chent yes it is an awful position for her and for me no dont look at me like that dorry i swear that im not thinking of myself id give my right hand to save mona she is innocent of course asked prelice pushing away his plate yes i am certain that she is innocent although he hesitated for a moment then flung away his cigarette leaned his arms on the marbletopped table and looked earnestly at his friend you heard belmains speech prelice nodded you mean the prosecuting counsel yes he was fair enough in the beginning and in the middle but he had no right to rub it into the jury about the knife and about monas guilt being so certain that part should have been left to the time when he addressed the jury and after the evidence on both sides had been heard i thought it was rather prejudging the prisoner myself ned shepworth shuddered dont call mona a prisoner he expostulated every time that infernal belmain alluded to her so i felt sick it is rough on you undoubtedly murmured prelice and not wanting any more food for shepworths agitation had spoilt his appetite he turned to the waiter and ordered coffee shepworth passed along his cigarette case very rough on you ned oh dont talk about me rejoined the barrister restlessly think of mona a young girl gently born and bred being accused of murder and being put into prison its horrible she seemed to me to be the calmest person in court because she knows that she is innocent shes a religious girl too and firmly believes that god will prove her innocence well he will said prelice quietly im not a saint myself but i know that god looks after us all yet innocent people have been hanged before now dorry prelice did not answer immediately lighting his cigarette he meanwhile looked very straight at his friend you dont seem to have a good defence he remarked suddenly yes and no replied shepworth fidgeting not only is there a very good reason why she should love her uncle but a better one that she should wish him to have remained alive what do you mean that will you know dorry the will made by sir oliver in favour of mona prelice nodded it has been destroyed went on shepworth bits of it were found in the grate there was a fire burning in the library on that night if you remember belmains speech well the will had been torn up and thrown into the fire a few bits fell under the grate and these prove beyond all doubt that it is the will which sir oliver made in favour of mona now if guilty why should she destroy a document which gave her ten thousand a year but i say remarked prelice thoughtfully towards the end of his speech belmain distinctly stated that miss chent had killed her uncle so as to get the money if he knows of the burning of the will oh the other side admit that a will was burnt but deny that it was the one made in monas favour they will try and prove that sir oliver was drawing up another will disinheriting her because she would stick to me and that she burnt this will after killing the old man we fight hard on that point dorry has the will in favour of miss chent been found no the lawyers have not got it as sir oliver kept it himself it cant be found and of course we saythat is our side cudworth arkers and myselfthat the will was burnt presuming it is who inherits captain jadby whatthe south sea chap shepworth nodded it seems that sir oliver was a great friend of his fathers at tahiti and made a will out there in favour of young jadby he brought it home with him i believe of course the will in monas favour invalidated the first document so unless the second will had been destroyed the first would not hold good which points to the fact said prelice quickly that jadby had a reason to murder sir oliver i say shepworth glanced around in alarm dont talk so loud there isnt a shadow of evidence to connect jadby with the crime he was in london on that day and only returned by the ten train however he claims the property but until this trial is ended nothing will be done about that humph said prelice reflectively i expect it was on account of the earlier will that sir oliver wished miss chent to marry jadby shepworth nodded he thought to kill two birds with one stone to let them both have the money and so to speak blend the two wills into one jadby loves mona too but she hates him and moreover is engaged to you mused prelice tipping the ash off his cigarette its a queer case much queerer than you think dorry now what do you mean by that asked prelice shepworth glanced round again and cautiously brought his lips to his friends left ear i swear that mona is innocent she is a good kind religious girl who would not hurt a fly much less sir oliver whom she loved in spite of that ridiculous quarrel all the same well well go on said prelice impatiently that knife breathed shepworth nervously the jadehandled papercutter well she had it in her hand when where prelice could not grasp the true significance of this very serious statement in the library when she was unconscious in the chair how on earth do you know ned shepworth looked round again and wiped his face see here he whispered i was in bed with that sprained ankle as belmain said in our row i gave jadby the worst of it including a black eye although he fought like a cat with nine lives but i tripped and hurt my foot as belmain said in his speech it was swollen and painful but not so much but what i could have got away to town why didnt you because mona asked me to stop and support her she expected further trouble with her uncle i lay awake trying to bear the pain as best i could for my ankle got worse when i lay down about a quarter to ten i heard mona pass my door and go down the stairs how did you know that it was miss chent i would know her footstep amongst a hundred and she admitted afterwards that she had gone down to the library at that hour i wondered where she was going but lay quiet listening for her return at length some fifteen minutes or so after ten oclock i could bear the suspense no longer and hobbled downstairs in my dressinggown i thought that she might have gone to the library to see her uncle and that further trouble might be brewing as i promised to stand by her ankle or no ankle it seemed right that i should learn what was going on very reasonable of you ned continue prelice was deeply interested i opened the library door and saw her seated in the armchair was there any sign of smoke no but there was a peculiar smell in the room what kind of a smell shepworth wrinkled his brows i can scarcely describe it he said after some thought a sweetish heavy sickly scentlike a tuberose thats as near as i can get mona told me afterwards that she also thought it resembled the thick perfume of a tuberose it came from the smoke of courseit must have come from the smoke you believe in the smoke then oh yes sir oliver had evidently been trying some magical experiment prelice looked doubtful magic is all bosh he remarked im not so certain of that dorry there are queer things done even in this twentieth century hm then you believe miss chents improbable story i dobecause i saw her insensible in the chair his listener reflected was sir oliver dead then yes sitting in his chair and lying half on the desk he had been stabbed in the back was the window or one of the windows open i never noticed and remember jadby did not say that the middle window was ajar but only that the latch had been unfastened i remember that what happened next shepworth explained i found sir oliver dead and mona unconscious one moment please prelice became quite like a crossexamining barrister himself had she fainted it was more than a faint dorry she was in a kind of trancequite like a person seized with catalepsy i know i am sure because i shook her and pinched her and tried my best to rouse her you should have opened the window to admit the fresh air i never thought of doing so i was too agitated natural enoughnatural enough murmured the other absently and cast his eyes round the restaurant idly while thinking of what next to say his gaze fell on a slim boyishlooking young man of medium height who had just entered and who was looking at the unconscious shepworth with an undeniable scowl who is that asked prelice in a whisper he seems to know you shepworth looked up and across the crowded room whereat the manhe was dark and cleanshaven and somewhat italian in his looksscowled more than ever jadby said the barrister under his breath captain jadby and he stared hard at his enemy on his part the captain returned the stare with scowling interest and dropped into a seat near the door no great distance away looks like a halfcaste breathed prelice glancing furtively at the young man goodlooking too but with a bad temper i should say if expression went for anything jadby certainly did not possess a superlatively even temper his mouth was hard his eyes were filled with sombre fire and he seemed to be an alert wiry impetuous man who could hold his own excellently in a fight dressed in a wellcut frockcoat with darkstripped trousers a white waistcoat a highlypolished silk hat and patentleather boots with spotless spats he looked a great dandy quite of the bond streetpiccadillypallmall type all the same there was a suggestion of the sea in the way he rolled in his gait and held his slim brown hands a dangerous man to have for an enemy thought prelice looking furtively at the smooth feline face and sullen eyes however as jadby busied himself in selecting a luncheon from the menucard prelice after taking in his picturesque personality paid no further attention to him nor did shepworth he and the captain scowled grudging recognition of one another and then ostentatiously looked in other directions lord prelice lighted another cigarette and resumed the conversation which the episode of jadbys entrance had interrupted you say that miss chent was holding the papercutter when you found her yes it was a dangerous indian dagger and the blade and the hilt were stained with blood monas hands and dress were also stained i really believed for the moment that she had killed sir oliver and my only thought was how to save her a terrible situation murmured prelice looking round again for jadby and then saw to his surprise that the man had disappeared it was apparent that the captain not liking to be in the same room with the barrister who had thrashed him had gone out again however this was just as well as jadby could not listen so you removed the knife said prelice eying his friend yes it seemed the most reasonable thing to do i took it away at once seeing that i could not rouse her for an explanation it was my intention to hide the knife in my bedroom and then return to take mona away i ran upstairs with the knife and concealed it in my mattress and then cautiously came back to the library when i reached the door however i heard someone moving in the room so thought it best to go back dont think me a coward dorry you must see that i was in as dangerous a position as mona herself after i hid the knife i quite understand replied prelice swiftly i expect captain jadby was in the library he was i am certain he was for just as i reached the first landing i heard the library bell ring remember that he said he rang it as soon as he found mona insensible and sir oliver dead what have you done with the knife it is concealed in my desk in my study in my flat i dare not produce it lest i should get into trouble besides its production would do mona harm as would my evidence of finding it in her hand i must hold my tongue dorry and lie as best i am able but now you can see how needful it was for me to hold my tongue and have you beside me you must be silent and stand by me prelice shook hands and they rose to return to the court the action brought them round to face the door and thereat the marbletopped tablethey saw jadby sipping coffee as though he had never moved hm said prelice rather puzzled the fellow comes and goes like a ghost just like a halfcaste cat and he stealthily glanced at the captain who was ostentatiously reading a newspaper and took no notice even when the young men brushed past him to leave the restaurant i say ned remarked prelice thoughtfully when they were outside do you think that miss chent will be proved guilty no i suppress my evidence about the knife remember and then the destroyed will is in her favour the sole chance for the prosecution to prove monas guilt is to find steve agstone he declares that he was looking through the window and saw mona kill sir oliver to whom did he say this to mrs blexey the housekeeper she is a witness for the prosecution and is nearly brokenhearted she loves mona like everyone else hm do you believe agstones story no the old man hated mona for some reason or another and besides he was drunk when he confessed to mrs blexey i expect when sober again he found that he would be forced to prove his words and knowing that he could not made himself scarce i hope that he wont be found dorry what does it matter if he is telling lies i believe it is a lie dorry and so do you but will the judge and jury believe as we do if agstone appears and sticks to what he told mrs blexey no hang him i hope hell not turn up who do you think murdered sir oliver i cant say but remember that the middle window was unfastened anyone could have entered from the outside and stabbed him you forget said prelice quickly miss chent herself confesses to having unfastened the window quite so but recollect also that she did not know when she entered the library if her uncle was dead or alive a quarter to ten that was but he surely would have made some sign if no interrupted shepworth decisively what of the thick white smoke at which everyone jeers it probably rendered sir oliver insensible as it did mona can you explain the smoke i cannot unless sir oliver was trying one of his infernal experiments in connection with the next world what book was he reading when found dead there were several books open on the desk explained shepworth one was the first volume of captain cooks voyages another pierre lotis reflets sur la sombre route and the third polly in polynesia some silly book with a silly title by a silly feminine globetrotter i expect sir oliver had been refreshing his south sea memory were the books open at pages dealing with any particular subject demanded prelice after a pause shepworth considered when examining sir olivers body i glanced down at the open pages and saw something about easter island i didnt take much notice as you may guess but an illustration of the easter island statues was displayed in cooks voyages but ill tell you a queer thing dorry afterwards when the murder was discovered the three books were all closed that is natural i dont agree with you rejoined shepworth emphatically the desk should have been left in its original untidiness until the police came to take possession but someone closed those books what do you make of it demanded prelice abruptly well my theory is that someonei cant say whowished to prevent the police seeing that sir oliver had been reading about easter island why i dont know and perhaps i may be making a mountain out of a molehill molehills are important on occasions said prelice dryly witness the death of william iii easter island easter island he went on in a musing way hm hm hm now what the dickens do i know about easter island in connection with this case but he asked this question in vain his memory refused to supply information chapter iv evidence for the prosecution the court had reassembled rather late in the afternoon so there was little chance of much evidence being taken prelice went back to his seat still wondering what thought hovered at the back of his brain about easter island he had visited that lonely and little known spot during his travels in the company of a friend given to occult studies who insisted that the dismal spot of land was one of the remaining portions of the great continent of lemuria which was said to have stretched from new zealand to africa they had seen the famous statues and had fraternised with the somewhat dirty natives who had welcomed them warmly as might be expected seeing how few visitors ever came to the desolate land for one week prelice and his friend dr horace by name had dwelt with the savages and during that time had seen much of their manners and customs and even had witnessed religious rites in front of the gigantic statues prelice had an idea that there he had seen something suggested anew by this murder case but vainly attempted to recall what it was his memory would not help him in the least meanwhile shepworth looking much more cheerful now that he had unbosomed himself to his chum was again beside cudworth kc and young arker belmain called his first witness as soon as the judge took his seat in the person of the medical man who had examined the body of the murdered baronet the medical evidence was very scanty dr quick stated that to the best of his belief the dead man had been stabbed somewhere about ten oclock the blow had been delivered straight and strong and the blade of the weapon used had penetrated right to the heart death must have taken place instantaneously and while sir oliver suspecting no treachery had been reading belmain in crossexamination deduced from this that the prisoner was guilty since sir oliver would scarcely have turned to his reading again had a stranger been in the room also had the person who committed the crime been one whom the dead man suspected of any such design he would assuredly not have presented a defenceless back to such an assassin no it was evident that the prisoner after quarrelling with her uncle had waited until he again was buried in his books and then had stabbed him with the paperknife the doctor stated that the wound had been caused by a broad thin blade which exactly described the jadehandled paperknife which was missing several of the grange servants were called to prove that sir oliver had been heard quarrelling violently with his niece he was as the evidence proved a very hottempered and imperious man and used language of the worst in fact the coachman called to prove an outburst of temper when driving his master said the late baronet could outswear any navvy it was also clearly proved that sir oliver and his niece were on the worst possible terms when the crime was committed several times sir oliver declared that he would disinherit her unless she surrendered her will and married captain jadby but prisoner as her maid said had as imperious a temper as her uncle and was well able to hold her own i dont mean said the witness that miss chent was ever unkind to me for she always behaved with consideration i only mean that sir oliver could not browbeat her as he did the rest of them what do you mean by that asked belmain who did he browbeat captain jadby for one sir he was fond of captain jadby and used to walk arm in arm with him in the garden using him as a crutch for his lameness as it were sir but he stormed a good deal and captain jadby didnt fight like miss chent you imply then that captain jadby was frightened of sir oliver witness evasively i dont know sir im sure that my master was a terrible man and only liked those who gave way to him in crossexamination cudworth for the defence asked do you believe that prisoner is capable of committing the alleged crime no sir no declared the ladys maid fervently miss chent is as good and kind a young lady as ever breathed i dont think for one moment that she killed the master and no more does anyone else the other servants gave similar evidence all pointing to sir olivers ungovernable temper and to miss chents dexterous way of managing him by meeting like with like with sir oliver she fought on every occasion otherwise she would have been reduced to slavery but with other people miss chent was always kind and eventempered although the witnesses called were for the prosecution not one of them would confess to a belief in the prisoners guilt belmain was rather disconcerted by his unanimous approval of miss chent and tried his best to bully the witnesses into blaming her but he failed on every occasion and even when mrs blexey was hoisted into the box he could not induce her to run down the girl this loyalty created a deep impression and prisoner for the first time showed emotion mrs blexey was very stout and very redfaced and very tall and extremely frightened she looked like an elephant and certainly possessed the timid nature of a rabbit the contrast between her gigantic appearance and her timid speech amused those present so greatly that a continuous tittering was heard until the judge threatened to clear the court belmain you are emma blexey the late sir olivers housekeeper mrs blexey yes my lord with a curtsey belmain facetiously you need not give me a title before i have earned it my good woman laughter mrs blexey oh no my lordi mean my dear sir laughter when the laughter over this second form of address had subsided mrs blexey stated that the prisoner was as attached to her uncle as he was to her they had tiffs on occasions as sir olivers temper was none of the best but miss chent was never in the wrong and usually contrived to pacify the irascible baronet he was as fractious as a child said the housekeeper and required similar management but on the whole he and miss chentmrs blexey refused to call her young mistress the prisonergot on extremely well as to the phrase about disinheriting that was a favourite threat of sir olivers which meant practically nothing he used it on every occasion sometimes in earnest and often in fun it meant nothing she said again belmain he meant it when the prisoner refused to marry captain jadby no doubt mrs blexey wiping her red face the lord knows what he meant sir he was a queer gentleman then belmain proceeded to question the housekeeper regarding the admission which steve agstone was said to have made to her it would have been preferable to obtain the evidence of the old sailor first hand but since he could not be discovered the counsel got what he could out of mrs blexey and what she knew he had to drag out of her by persistent questioning for her sympathies were entirely with the prisoner she stated that agstone drank a great deal and was always in trouble with sir oliver on that account but that he had been the baronets factotum for many years he would have been dismissed dozens of times a drunken grumpy sullen savage was the description given by the housekeeper but he was goodnatured enough when sober she confessed and quite devoted to sir oliver belmain a kind of loyal henchman in fact well and what statement did he make to you and when did he make it mrs blexey on the morning after the murder agstoneor steve as everyone called himwas drinking rum to drown his grief at the death of sir oliver he sat for a long time in my room weeping and said that he knew miss mona would do for her uncle those were his very words and i told him that he was speaking rubbish belmain what happened then mrs blexey he fired up and declared that while waiting up on the previous night for captain jadby he had gone down the avenue to see if he was coming not finding him and seeing the light still in the library he wondered if captain jadby had arrived and had gone in to say goodnight to sir oliver he therefore went to one of the windows and saw miss chent stooping over the fire to burn something sir oliver was leaning forward on the desk with his head on his outstretched arms miss chent also had a knife in her hands steve said that he thought there had been a row and that sir oliver was weeping as he sometimes did being old and feeble from much hardship he said that had he guessed that miss chent had just murdered his master he would have given the alarm as it was afraid lest sir oliver should be angry at his spying he stole back into the house by the front door and went to his own room at the back of the house there he waited for captain jadby and rushed into the library when he heard the bell belmain i understood that agstone told you that he had actually seen the prisoner kill sir oliver prelice in the body of the court thought so too as he remembered what ned had said during the luncheon but mrs blexey emphatically denied such a story i mentioned the matter to mr shepworth but i am sure that he said nothing but steve might have talked in his drunken way to others and might have told a different story i know that there is a prevailing impression that he saw the murder but he did not say so to me so spoke mrs blexey and belmain looked worried you are telling the truth he demanded in vexed tones i am here to tell the truth retorted mrs blexey and i am so there after this somewhat incoherent speech she was crossexamined by cudworth and expressed her belief that agstone had scarcely measured his words being devoted to sir oliver himself he had always been very jealous of the favour shown to miss chent and fairly hated her undoubtedly his wild maunderings were intended to hurt miss chent and to get her into trouble but agstone had disappeared before the inquest where he would have had to give evidence on oath mrs blexey firmly believed that had he been put on his oath he could not have substantiated what he had said to her i never could bear that steve she cried he was a sneaking dog saving your presence and had no love for anyone except sir oliver do you know where he is now asked belmain returning to the attack no i dont sir and i dont want to i quite believe that rejoined counsel dryly seeing that you are prejudiced in prisoners favour as mrs blexey had surmised that steve might have told a story of actually seeing prisoner kill her uncle to the other servants belmain recalled several witnesses but not one of them could state that the current report was true steve had certainly hinted to several that he could bring home the crime to miss chent but he had supplied no details and as his hints were given when he was drunk no one paid much attention to them on the afternoon of the day following the night of the murder steve had gone out for his usual stroll in the direction of sandgate and had not returned the evidence of a detective proved that he had taken the train to london and had been traced as far as charingcross station there he had disappeared and in spite of all search his whereabouts could not be discovered by this time it was growing late and judge jury lawyers and listeners all exhibited symptoms of weariness therefore the court rose with the intention of sitting at eleven oclock on the following morning it was the general opinion that unless steve agstone could be placed in the witnessbox the prisoner would not be convicted also miss chents calm demeanour and the loyalty of the grange servants which had placed her character in so attractive a light went far to enlist public sympathy in her favour those who left the court had more belief in her innocence than when they had entered many insisted that she could not possibly be guilty but others pointing to the factwhich had been forthcoming at the inquestthat she had burned a new will disinheriting her declared that without doubt she had murdered her uncle so as not to lose the money all the same the majority favoured the prisoner and many wellwishers hoped for her acquittal shepworth was pleased and hopeful the tide is quite in monas favour dorry he said to prelice when the court rose and unless steve agstone turns up she must be set free for want of evidence there is the question of the burnt will you know ned we can prove that it was the will made in monas favour which was burnt said shepworth decisively sir oliver made no new will as he had not left the house for quite a month and could not have altered his will before then his lawyer never came down to the grange to draw up a will and if sir oliver had drawn up a new one himself he would have asked some of the servants to be his witnesses we know that no one was asked to witness any document captain jadby and steve agstone might have witnessed no there is a chance certainly that agstone might have done so but one signature would have been of no use and had jadby witnessed a new will he would not have benefited under it besides since he had the will made in the south seas and sir oliver assuredly wished him to have the money along with mona all that had to be done was to destroy the will made in monas favour and then jadby having the cash could leave her penniless unless she married him which is just what has happened ended shepworth of course said prelice thoughtfully miss chent might have been trying when seen by steve to rescue the will from the fire into which it had been thrown by sir oliver shepworth wheeled round do you believe that she is guilty oh no but we must look on all sides and agstone is a liar interrupted the barrister quickly i dont believe that he saw mona bending over the fire she was insensible by her own showing from the moment she entered the room until jadby woke her and remember that i found her insensible it would help her if you said so i dont agree with you were i examined about my presence in the library i might let slip that the knife yes yes said prelice hastily i see it will be better for you to hold your tongue i hope that agstone will not appear if he does not mona is safe rejoined ned with a sigh of relief oh poor mona think of her in prison dorry she will soon be out of it answered prelice soothingly i am quite sure that she will be acquitted where are you going now home to my flat i am quite worn out come and look me up this evening about ten or eleven when i have had a sleep i live at alexander mansions kensington gore number forty alexander mansions repeated prelice surprised why here is the long arm of coincidence ned mrs dolly rover has asked me to a masked ball which she is giving in her flata most unsuitable place for a bal masque i think oh no said shepworth with a flush of colour though why he should show this emotion prelice could not say the flat occupied by mrs rover is above mine she has in fact two flats furnished on a most palatial scale her husband is a rich little beast you know why a little beast asked prelice rather perplexed shepworths colour grew deeper he is not worthy of his wife she was miss newton you know very clever and very beautiful dollyfancy a man being called dolly short for adolphus it is not an uncommon abbreviation it is contemptible for a manand hes a rat dolly rover added shepworth contemptuously fooh the effeminate monkey well goodbye ill see you between ten and eleven when ned jumped into a cab prelice walked home wondering why he should run down the dapper little stockbroker whom miss newton had married then he remembered that shepworth had admired miss newton before she changed her name to rover chapter v mrs rovers masked ball it is a long lane that has no turning lord prelice began to believe that there might be some truth in the proverb for the lengthy lane of idleness down which he had sauntered for many years seemed to be rounding the corner to open out into the road of industry the chance observation of lady sophia which had sent him to the new bailey had become a signpost as it were showing him which way he was to go in other words he was now involved in shepworths troubles out of sheer friendship ned had confessed that he required assistance and had turned to his old schoolchum for the same prelice was naturally willing to do what he could towards aiding ned in extricating miss chent from her perilous position and so found work for his idle brain to do of course as he tried to believe he could resume his former life when the service was duly rendered the weddingbells which rang for mr and mrs shepworth would dismiss their best man once more to his sauntering but this as prelice began to think was easier said than done mainly owing to the looks of miss chent he had not spoken to the girl and knew her character solely through the evidence of the grange servants who had been placed in the witnessbox also ned as he remembered had said very little about his affianced wife and prelice knew none whom he could question as to the prisoners qualities yet for all his scanty knowledge he felt strangely drawn towards the unhappy woman and confessed inwardly that he would feel a pang on seeing her become mrs shepworth without doubt prelice was in love although not head over ears and he swore at himself for being so disloyal to his friend monathe name slipped quite naturally into his mindmona would assuredly be acquitted unless the missing agstone appeared which was extremely unlikely and then she would as assuredly marry ned who had so manfully stood by her in this grave trouble therefore it behooved prelice as an honourable gentlemanand he was all thatto put her out of his mind if he wished to continue meeting shepworths gaze squarely and after all a peer worth twenty thousand a year could pick and choose almost any woman for his wife it was hard on ned that such a peer should play the part of david in the parable and select the less fortunate commoners one ewelamb the struggle between more than a liking for mona and a feeling of genuine friendship for ned made prelice waver in determining his future behaviour his first inclination when aware of his feeling was to cross the channel for a prolonged stay abroad and leave shepworth to his own devices then it occurred to him that this course would be cowardly and he resolved to remain and help nothing that the world could cavil at could ever take place since prelice with his high sense of honour never dreamed of paying marked attentions to miss chent all the same if he came often into monas companyand that seemed inevitable should he remainhis lifes happiness would certainly be at stake he would have his feelings to smother and thereforeas he plainly sawwould be most unhappy prelice at this early stage of infatuation termed his feeling towards the girl affection but he knew very well that given time and opportunity affection of this sudden kind might easily increase to love in that case seeing how miss chent was engaged to be married he would be vainly crying for the honeymoon his lordship then felt less happy in the evening than he had done in the morning then he had been heartwhole now the sight of a beautiful woman in peril had aroused the deepest and most chivalrous feelings of which his nature was capable placed thus between the devil and the deep sea prelice compromised dangerously with his conscience he resolved to crush down his newly born desire for mona and to help ned as best he could in this way did the young man mix fire and snow in the vain hope that such hostile elements would blend commonsense should have told him otherwise having so decidedalthough not overpleased with his decision and with good reasonprelice dressed for dinner he remembered that he had promised to partake of this agreeable meal at his aunts a solitary chop at his club would have been preferable as he was disinclined for company but aware from experience that lady sophia would strongly object to an excusing telegram prelice smothered his unwillingness and reached the abode of his relative shortly before eight oclock lady sophia lived magnificently in brummel square the fourth daughter of a pauper duke she had married a wealthy city manthat is she had entered into a social partnership as there was little genuine marital feeling about the union simon haken was a driedup active atom of humanity with a bald head a pair of piercing dark eyes and an exasperating chuckle which he used when getting the better of anyone as he usually scored over less clever financiers he chuckled very often and this sardonic merriment imparted a somewhat cynical expression to his withered face his wife large and expansive and freshcoloured looked like an elephant beside a grasshopper when the two went into society and they were generally known as the mountain and the mouse but haken cared as little for the jest as did lady sophia as husband and wife in its strictest sense they were failures being two and not one as partners they were admirably matched having no children and plenty of money and excellent health and no strong emotions the two enjoyed life immensely possessed of a complacent husband of a good position ample cash and absolute freedom lady sophia even forgot to sigh for the delights of the stone age when she reflected upon the position in life to which it had pleased providence to call her on this occasion mr haken as usual had wired detention in the city on business so lady sophia received her nephew in a solitary drawingroom as handsomely furnished as she was dressed you are just in time for dinner said she with emphasis implying thereby that prelice was usually late i always am in time answered the guest smiling but preoccupied dinner is a sacred feast which cannot be trifled with i would as soon insult the king as the cook then he sat and stared at the points of his patentleather boots with the air of a misanthrope you are out of spirits declared lady sophia rapping his knuckles with her lorgnette i prescribe a round of pleasure tonight you shall escort me to two dances and four musical parties but i havent done anything to deserve such punishment how absurdly you talk these festivals i agree with the man who said that life would be endurable were it not for its festivals nonsense he could not have been in society he just was and so made a profoundly true observation i renounce society and all its play besides added prelice inconsequently i am going to a masked ball tonight at mrs dolly rovers that woman cried lady sophia with disdain prelice looked up surprised i thought you liked her as constance newton not as mrs rover she informed him swiftly they are one and the same he urged not at all marriage changes a woman into something entirely different constance was a charming girl mrs rover is a flirting fastliving heartless spendthrift society doll society dolly rover murmured prelice noting his aunts usual waste of adjectives will you come to this ball what lady sophia almost screamed a masked ball and at my age oh how can you be so ridiculous prelice and at mrs rovers too a woman who neglects her husband and squanders his money and whips him like a poodle i believe he is something of a poodle isnt he that is no reason why he should be whipped she snapped heatedly and if you knew how she had treated your friend mr shepworth you would not go near her disreputable ball prelice pricked up his ears remembering the unnecessary blush of the barrister at midday how did she treat shepworth he asked how can you ask of course seeing that as a newly returned traveller i know nothing well then she was almost engaged to him and he was very much in love with her she threw him over in a coldblooded way because dolly rover came along with a betterfilled purse hes a horrid little cad added lady sophia candidly and his father was a chemist or a draperi forget which all the same he is too good for a jilt who played blind hookydont raise your eyebrows prelice its vulgar but expressive and i shall use itwho played blind hooky with poor mr shepworth but are you sure aunt ned is engaged to miss chent out of piqueout of pique she assured him mona is a nice girl poor darling even though she did murder her uncle not that i believe she did but constance is the one love of mr shepworths life and fifty monas wont make up for the loss mona if ever she does become mrs shepworth which i very much doubt will only be a makeshift oh prelice was almost too indignant to speak that so peerless a girl should be talked of as a makeshift seemed positively wicked you must be mistaken ned would not behave so badly ask him then i shall do this very night then you will go to that womans yes i accepted as i always liked constance besides i have to see ned who lives in these same mansions i know he does burst out lady sophia quite indecent i call it oh hang it aunt a man must live somewhere not next door to a woman who has jilted him he doesnt live next door but on the floor below it would be more creditable if he lived in timbuctoo i believe that he loves her still and shes quite capable of loving him back in spite of the marriage service which i dont believe she listened to as for her husband lady sophia was about to give her opinion of mr dolly rover when the butler threw open the door and announced dinner at once she took her nephews arm and changed the conversation tell me about the case she chattered as they passed to the diningroom have they hanged that poor girl who miss chent no and i dont believe they will ah lady sophia pulled off her gloves i always said that she was innocent of course if agstone turns up she may be convicted agstoneoh yes the man who declares that he saw her kill sir oliver prelice corrected her while taking his soup he only saw her bending over the fire with a knife in her hand burning the will after killing her uncle what a horrid girl aunt sophia will you tell me plainly if you believe miss chent to be innocent or guilty how can i judge when i havent heard the evidence you talk as though i were on the jury i like mona and im sure she didnt kill him but if she did he deserved it as he was a nasty old bully prelice desisted in despair and helped himself to fish lady sophia seemed to change her mind every half minute and never considered facts when she wanted to deliver an opinion besides she preferred fiction as it was less trouble to invent than to remember all the same her sympathies appeared to be with mona and prelice felt pleased that it should be so should the girl be acquitted her position would be extremely difficult and she would require a staunch friend of her own sex why should not that friend be lady sophia whose support could do much to efface the stain of a criminal court but until the case was decided prelice did not dare to hint that such an idea had crossed his mind as the servants were hovering round the table he could not talk confidentially to his aunt so drifted into general conversation about mutual friends he thus became posted up in the latest mayfair gossip and so was brought up to date in necessary knowledge and lady sophia knew as much about london as asmodeus did about madrid and like that delightful demon she could unroof houses to some purpose luckily for the men and women about whom she talked the presence of the butler and two footmen prevented entire candour as the food was excellent and the conversation interesting not to say necessaryfor prelice as a newly returned traveller required much postingup in recent scandalsnephew and aunt lingered for a considerable time at table when the meal was ended prelice preferred to accompany lady sophia to the drawingroom instead of remaining solitary over hakens famous port they had halfanhour left for coffee and then lady sophia would have to start out on her round of festivals you ought to come with me prelice she said later as he helped her on with her cloak everyone thinks that you are dead well aunt you would not have much pleasure in taking a corpse about with you besides i promised to look up ned this evening no doubt and hell be at that womans ball most indecent seeing that poor mona is in gaol ned isnt such a blighter cried prelice crossly i never called him a blighter whatever that may mean retorted lady sophia with great dignity mr shepworth is an estimable young man whom you would do well to imitate i intend to he and i are going to save miss chent how horrid youll be a kind of detective prelice nodded its something to do as if you required anything to do with your rank and money but i say aunt you advised me this morning oh i never remember anything i say in the morning said lady sophia airily you are so stupid prelice you always take one at the foot of the letter you wont come with me oh very well help me into the brougham you horrid boy i believe youll fall in love with mona and give me a criminal for a niece this was lady sophias parting shot and when her motorbrougham spun towards the first turning out of the square prelice laughed long and loudly his aunt was nearer the truth than she had been the whole evening although she was far from suspecting it it never entered her elderly head that a man of the world such as her nephew certainly was would fall in love on the spur of the moment and i should not have suspected myself of such lunacy either thought his lordship as he turned in the direction of halfmoon street to procure domino and mask for the ball the street before alexander mansions was filled with carriages and motors and fourwheelers and hansoms together with a crowd of onlookers who passed remarks complimentary and otherwise on the many guests of mrs rover the mansions themselves were palatial and splendid with a royal flight of broad marble steps to the main entrance prelice shuffling on his domino and assuming his mask climbed these to find himself with other revellers in a vast hall with two staircases ascending on either side at the farther end and between them two lifts the cages of which soared and sank with parties of pleasureseekers prelice delivered his rainbowhued ticket of invitation to a gorgeously uniformed commissionaire and took his time in climbing the long stairs many other people did the same instead of waiting for the lifts but as all were masked and cloaked the young man could recognise no one as shepworth had stated mr and mrs dolly rover occupied the whole of the third floorthat is they tenanted two flats which faced each other and the outer doors of these opening on to a spacious landing had been removed from their hinges thus the guests could pass easily from one flat to the other and the landing between was a nest of greenery and roses like the hanging gardens of babylon the flats themselves had wide corridors spacious rooms and lofty ceilings so they were capable of receiving a large number of guests on this occasion they were crowded and it would seem as though mrs rover had invited everyone on her visitinglist and there may have been others not set down on that list since the masks and dominos prevented recognition prelice looked about for his hostess but found himself received by a tiny palefaced man with large plaintive blue eyes set in a white expanse of absolutely colourless skin he wore a domino over his smart eveningdress but no mask and was so clipped and curled and brushed and washed that prelice easily guessed him to be the poodle mentioned by lady sophia pushing out a small tightly gloved hand he murmured a nervous greeting to each new arrival but after this ceremony was ended no one seemed to take any notice of him as all who came were masked prelice wondered how mr rover could possibly know whom he was greeting of course there was the rainbowhued ticket given to the commissionaire below which would guarantee the respectability of the presenter but tickets of this sort could be stolen and forged and as no further supervision was exercised to ensure the identity of the guests prelice considered that such a procedure was somewhat rash his thoughts were confirmed by a driedup little man who appeared without a mask and who was rebuked by mr rover for his originality you shouldnt you know expostulated the host in a penny whistle kind of voice no one is to know anyone until the clock strikes twelve when we all unmask for supper why even my wife insisted that i should receive in her place she would be spotted you know if she stopped here to shake hands and she doesnt want to be found out until midnight the whole fun of a masquerade lies in secrecy so obey the rules haken and put on your mask prelice started when he heard the name and twisted his neck to see if the newcomer really was his unclebymarriage it was simon haken sure enough for no one could mistake his looks let alone his celebrated chuckle the young man laughed and wondered what hakenby no means a society butterflywas doing at the ball of a lady whom his wife openly disliked and then he remembered that lying telegram from the city mr haken had his little secrets it would seem and was more human under the rose than when posing as a moneymaking machine his dutiful nephew determined before the evening was out to let his sly uncle know that his misdoings were discovered meanwhile the little millionaire was chuckling and masking it is a risk you know rover he observed dryly you dont know who is here half the swell mobsmen of london may have come after diamonds oh dear me how can you talk so haken said the host fretfully the man below examines the tickets as if anyone could not forge or steal one retorted haken voicing his nephews thoughts well in tomorrows papers i shall look for a criminal scandal and with his odious chuckle haken brushed past prelice towards the ballroom of the lefthand flat his lordship tired of watching new arrivals thought that he also would go and view the revellers but he had hardly moved halfadozen paces when he unexpectedly began to think of easter island a sweet heavy perfume as of tuberoses was wafted in his nostrils but why should such a familiar fragrance recall that desolate land environed by leagues of ocean chapter vi a startling discovery odour is one of the strongest aids which memory can have and a chance whiff of a particular scent will recall to the most lethargic brain circumstances both trivial and important of longforgotten years but the wellknown fragrance of the tuberose usually brings funerals to mind since that flower is so extensively woven into burial wreaths and mortuary crosses it was strange indeed that it should conjure into an idlethinking mind the vision of a heathen festival there were many people crowding the corridor so that it was impossible for the young man to tell who wore the flowers which gave forth the magical scentfor magical it was in its effect they might adorn a mans buttonhole or a womans bodice he could not tell since the eveningdress of both sexes was veiled by voluminous dominos but as he leaned against the wall the vision became clearer and more insistent his body was in londonin alexander mansions at a masked ball as he well knewbut the scent of the tuberose had drawn his spirit across leagues of trackless sea to the uttermost parts of the earth the present vanished and he beheld the past before him as the interior vision opened he saw colossal images of a vanished and forgotten race rudely hewn into the semblance of human beings each bearing a cylinderaccording to captain cooks descriptionon its gigantic head these reared themselves from vast platforms of cyclopean architecture overgrown with tropical vegetation and strewn with bleaching bones and in the soft radiance of the southern moon prelice beheld a kneeling crowd of bronzehued worshippers tattooed and painted adoring the weird stone gods an old priest his face and body streaked with white pigment murmured strange names over a rude stone altar whereon blazed a clear fire he invoked terrible deities incarnate in the giant idolskanaro gotomoara marapate areekeeand cast upon the flames the yellow leaves of a sacred herb a thick white cloud of smoke spread like a milky mist before the statues veiling their grotesque looks and vast outlines and the sickly scent of the tuberose grew powerful then did the priest become rigid as the dead and his spirit blended with the spirits of those grim gods he worshipped finally the fragrance which loaded the heavy airwhether of easter island or london prelice could not tellpassed away and with that odour passed the vision it could only have lasted a minute or so but was so terribly vivid that prelice could scarcely believe that his surroundings were real when the material asserted its sway he had closed his eyes to behold the vision which the scent had invoked and opened them again with a bewildered expression to see the pushing laughing chattering throng of guests although a commonplace young man and contemptuous as a rule of the unseen he felt that the recollection had not been brought back for nothing the dead man at lanwin grange had been reading about easter island when foully stabbed and the accused girl had described to her lover the white smoke and sickly perfume which also had to do with that isolated land and mona alsoprelice remembered faithfully what shepworth had told himhad been in a state of catalepsy like the priest of the vision and after all although he chose to call what he had seen mentally a vision it was simply a vivid recollection of what he and dr horace had beheld a year or two before but what had a fetish worship in easter island to do with a murder in kent that was a question which prelice could not answer there was no time to invent possible explanations or to reason out answers being in rome the momentary dreamer had to do as the romans did and as prelice was at a ball he was compelled out of courtesy to his hostess and host to enjoy himself he did not have far to go for an adventure as a lady in a blue domino and with a fringed mask to disguise her voice stole to his side and engaged him in airy conversation who she was the young man did not know and probably she was equally ignorant of his identity but on this especial night mrs rovers flat was liberty hall with a vengeance for men and women trusting in masks and dominos for concealment flirted and danced and drank and laughed with one another in a most outrageous manner there was no need of introductions or of reticence or of timidity in that edens bower of flowers and ferns faces were hidden but souls were revealed the blue domino proved to be a most charming companion full of fun and flirtation and a delightful dancer prelice found her extremely entertaining and she appeared to reciprocate the feeling after a particularly perfect waltz and an inspiriting glass of champagne his lordship did his best to lure the unknown into a corner where she might unmask but the lady shook her head laughingly and ran off to the ballroom with another man whose stature of a lifeguardsman had caught her roving eyes prelice solaced himself with another glass of wine and looked about him for another female of man it was then that a chuckle at his elbow made him turn now then now then said the gentleman who had chuckled let me come to refresh myself he spoke irritably and pushed past prelice in a hurry waiter waiter a glass of champagne i thought you were a teetotaler uncle whispered prelice mr haken betrayed by his chuckle and wheeled suddenly and spilt the wine he was about to sip to his nephews surprise he was trembling and his stammering voice betrayed his agitation whowho are you prelice whispered his name you neednt be alarmed he added i wont tell aunt sophia that you are accepting her enemys hospitality haken drank off his wine in one deep gulp and set down the glass with his hands still shaking i would rather you did not tell her he said in a low tone sophia dislikes mrs rover and would be annoyed if she knew that i was here i have come on business what business at a ball invent a more credible story uncle it is true insisted haken becoming more composed i have to see a political man from the continent about a loan he doesnt want it to be known that i am meeting him so we thought that this would be the best place to ensure secrecy not a word of this prelice of course not replied the young man puzzled to know why haken should take the trouble to explain but dont mention my name i also wish to be unknown what are you doing here asked haken abruptly i came to the ball and also i have to see ned shepworth who shepworth gasped haken backing nervously oh yes friend of our charming hostess friend of mine also is he here no he would not come to a ball when his promised wife is in prison of course not very creditable of him to be sure muttered haken and took another glass of wine with a whispered apology i am teetotal as a rule you know but society always tries my nerves and i need sustenance i wish the man i have to meet here had chosen my office in the city but it wouldnt have doneit wouldnt have done there would be trouble were it known that he was in london what is the time prelice dont mention my name or ill mention yours said prelice impatiently and drew out his watch it is eleven oclock haken nodded i must meet my man elevenfifteen is the time as to mentioning my name what does that matter i came here without my mask never thought of putting it on prelice nodded in his turn i saw you when rover received you then hold your tonguehold your tongue not a word to sophia mind not a word prelice promised gravely and mr haken drawing a long breathit would seem to be of reliefat having extracted the promise vanished into the manyhued crowd with his usual chuckle while the millionaire gave vent to that chuckle there did not seem to be much chance of his concealing his identity lord prelice looked after him somewhat puzzled he could quite understand why haken did not want his wife to know of his presence in alexander mansions but it was difficult to account for the old mans agitation and quite unnecessary explanations as a rule haken was extremely reticent and on such an important matter as a secret meeting with a continental diplomatist would be much more so yet he had gone out of his way to set himself right with his nephew and by telling his private business when a gay excuse of needing a night off would have been sufficient to account for his presence however prelice simply shrugged his shoulders and did not deem the incident worth remembering why should not simon haken enjoy himself in this way if he liked and turn mrs rovers ballroom into an office wherein to meet his foreign clients all the sameand prelice gave this a passing thoughtit was strange that the chance meeting with one who knew him should so upset him and it was still stranger that if mr haken wished to preserve his incognito he should have arrived unmasked having lost both his uncle and his charming blue domino prelice took a tour through the rooms in search of further adventures he could only afford a few minutes since he had to call upon shepworth at eleven oclock and it was already that hour as he had told haken still a few minutes more or less would not matter and prelice wished to see if he could espy mrs dolly rover in order to renew his acquaintance with her and to compliment her on the success of her ball and it undoubtedly was a success for everyone seemed highly amused and the laughter and small talk went on incessantly many people were dancing to the music of a gaily uniformed hungarian band and many more were ensconced in flirtation corners making the best of the hour which would elapse before everyone unmasked for supper prelice therefore wandered leisurely throughout the two flats exchanging a few chaffing words with the different women who addressed him and looking for the tall form of his hostess alas there were many tall women who looked as imperial and graceful as mrs rover and prelice felt like ali babas robber when he examined morgianas chalkmarks on the various doors he therefore began by way of some diversion to admire the costumes of the women which showed themselves more or less plainly from under the flowing dominos of silk in fact the heat of the night and of the rooms was so great that many ladies loosened the strings and buttons of their dominos and permitted their frocks to be plainly seen they would have removed their masks also in some cases so stifling was the perfumed air but the rule of the ball stopped them from doing so still as many revealed the gowns they were wearing it was probable that some would pay for their flirtatious sins when the supper hour and recognition came the young man had an eye for colour but knew very little about millinery so if anyone later had asked him to describe the various dresses he would have been puzzled but one woman wore a dress which attracted him from its oddity it was a flowing gown of white silk and from hem to waist the skirt was adorned with triple lines at intervals of narrow red velvet the spaces between the triple lines were equal and the lines of red velvet themselves ran apparently entirely round the skirt the effect was bizarre and rather fascinating but what made prelice note the dress so exactly was the wonderful ubiquity of the lady who wore it he went into the ballroom of the righthand flat and there she was dancing he strolled into the lefthand ballroom and found her flirting in a corner with another partner then he stumbled across her in the corridor and later discovered her at the buffet sipping champagne her domino was green as was her mask and she seemed to be in several places at once prelice was amused at her activity and at the way in which she seemed to permeate the entire place she was certainly getting all the enjoyment she could out of the ball he spoke to her once but she made no reply and disappeared before he could address her again rather annoyed that she would not respond prelice yawned and discovering that it was halfpasteleven decided to descend and look up shepworth the stairs were crowded not only with people leaving and arriving but with flirting couples who were cooling themselves in the purer air which ascended from the main entrance of the mansions these expostulated loudly and sometimes silentlyif irritated gestures went for anythingwith those who pushed past them to go up or down prelice came in for his share of blame as he cautiously steered his way to the second floor here there were but few people as the guests kept to the thirdfloor stairs and to those leading to the fourth a look at the lefthand door as he came down showed prelice that it was number forty so he pressed the button of the electric bell and waited for the door to be opened as he did so and while he was leaning against the wall still wearing his mask and domino the ubiquitous lady in the green domino with the oddly trimmed frock descended the stairs alone she cast a swift look at him as he passed and it was not until she vanished below that prelice became aware that the scent of the tuberose was again in his nostrils he had half a mind to run after her andassuming the privilege of a masked ballask her if she was wearing such a flower but in his idle way he did not think it was worth while and remained where he was no one came to answer the bell so prelice judged that shepworths servants were out perhaps fraternising with mrs rovers domestics at the ball overhead he rang again however believing that shepworth must be within and awake by this time as again the door did not open prelice raised his hand to the knocker to his surprise the door yielded a trifle and then he discovered that it was slightly ajar but so little so that he had believed it to be closed for the moment there was no one on the landing so he stepped into shepworths flat without closing the door after him i say ned ned are you in cried the young man pausing in the corridor which was similar to that overhead in mrs rovers flat i say ned it is me it is prelice and he slipped off his mask there was still no reply and then prelice smelt stronger than ever that strange odour which had evoked the easter island vision his thoughts again flew back to the heathen festival and he walked along the corridor wondering why the scent should follow him here on the lefthand side he peeped into a drawingroom but it was empty the door opposite was surely that of the diningroom it was closed but prelice opened it and walked in to look for his friend shepworth was in the room sure enough but prelice uttered an irrepressible cry when his amazed eyes fell on the barrister in a deep saddleback chair placed between the fireplace and the near window sat shepworth bolt upright with his hands resting upon his knees in the hieratic attitude of an egyptian statue his intensely calm face was pearlywhite his brown eyes were fixed in a glassy unnatural stare and he appeared as rigid and stiff and unbending as though hewn out of granite there was no disorder about his clothing the eveningdress he wore was as accurate and neat as though he had got ready to go to the ball overhead prelice stared at him tonguetied and motionless with astonishment then his eyes mechanically wandered round the room they fell immediately upon another figure seated on the far side of the diningtable with outstretched arms sprawling nervelessly across the cloth on them rested a huge head covered with shaggy red hair drawn as by a loadstone prelice stole forward with staring eyes and saw with a sudden shudder that the man at the table was stonedead he had been stabbed ruthlessly in the back under the left shoulderblade everything in the room was in absolute order only one man dead sat at the table sprawling half across it and the other man insensible was stiffly seated in the armchair and the whole apartment was permeated with the scent which suggested easter island suggested also that other murder at lanwin grange chapter vii shepworth explains an unsteady footstep roused lord prelice from his momentary stupor and he wheeled automatically to see a little man masked and wearing a black silk domino swaying to and fro at the open diningroom door but the sight of the two apparently dead men and the presence of their possible murderer seemed to sober the newcomer in a single moment before prelice could spring forward he gasped and fled almost immediately his voice tense with terror was heard shouting the news of his discovery to the revellers on the stairs prelice cursed under his moustache and ran into the passage to close the outer door which he now remembered he had foolishly left ajar possibly the little man being intoxicated had stumbled up the stairs on his way to the ball and finding the door open had so far mistaken his way as to stagger in prelice wondered if the stranger was haken or rover both small of stature but he recollected that he had never seen either drunk besides drunk or sober rover or haken would never mistake shepworths flat for the one overhead at the outer door prelice swiftly changed his mind he saw that the murder of the redheaded man was similar in all respects to that of sir oliver lanwin then miss chent had been given time to recover and so had been accused of the crime although she protested that she had been in a state of catalepsy induced by the scented smoke shepworth likewise was insensible and judging from the odour in the diningroom from the same cause it would be better decided the young man rapidly that shepworth should be seen by a score of witnesses thus insensible for then it could be proved that so helpless a man could not have struck the blow thus when a crowd of startled people came pouring down the staircase and into the flat on the second floor prelice threw open the door widely and admitted them with a hurried explanation there has been a terrible crime committed he declared leading the way to the diningroom i came here a few minutes ago to find mr shepworth the owner of the flat insensible as you see and this other man stonedead he has been stabbed stabbed several voices echoed the word and one woman gave a faint scream the passage was crowded to the very door of the diningroom and as many as could were looking over one anothers shoulders to view the sinister scene and like a ball from one person to another was tossed in various tones the ominous word murder who stabbed the man asked a mediumsized masker in a blue domino who had placed himself directly in front of the mob blocking the doorway he addressed prelice and his manner was offensively suspicious i do not know disclaimed that young gentleman quietly for it seemed absurd indeed that he should be suspected i came here to see mr shepworth only ten minutes ago how did you enter the tone of the question was still offensive the outer door was slightly ajar explained the other suavely i pushed it open as i had an appointment with my friend i decline to defend myself further as you seem to suspect me send for the police send for the police said many voices and a rough male voice was heard recommending that preliceonly the voice called him the murderershould not be allowed to escape what nonsense cried the young man indignantly raising his voice on hearing so direct an accusation i have nothing to do with the matter i am lord prelice if anyone here knows me the utterance of a title had a magical effect and several people began to unmask amongst these was the aggressive masker who had questioned prelice you can explain to the police said this man sharply certainly captain jadby you know me i saw you in court today and also in geddys restaurant burns street jadby nodded but did not relax his suspicious manner it is strange that you should be here he said marching into the room not at all rejoined prelice hotly i had an appointment to see mr shepworth and came only a few minutes ago jadby took no notice of this speech but lifted the shaggy red head of the dead man apparently he knew who he was for after a single glance he dropped the heavy head again and wheeled round with an amazed face steve agstone he gasped the missing witness prelice also startled backed against the wall with outstretched hands and open mouth in a flash he saw how dangerous was the position of the barrister and indeed many confused voices were muttering as to the guilt of shepworth captain jadby letting his eyes fall on the dead man made himself spokesman for all shepworth murdered him to win the case he said nodding i ask your pardon lord prelice for suspecting you i would rather you continued to do so cried prelice angrily it is absurd to think that shepworth killed this man look at him he pointed to the rigid form in the armchair he is incapable of raising a hand miss chent was also incapable sneered the captain yet she is innocent stormed prelice fiercely she no more killed her uncle than did shepworth this witness everyone was listening eagerly with open eyes and ears to the altercation and it is impossible to say how long it would have continued but for the entry of the police two constables pushed their way through the crowd and forthwithwhen they had taken in the situationbegan to clear the place the crowd of pleasureseekers now unmasked for the most part were driven outside some fled down the stairs anxious to get away from the scene of the tragedy while others returned to the rovers flat but the fact of the murder ruined the ball it broke up like macbeths famous banquet with most admird disorder and in ten minutes the rooms were deserted everyone ran away as though from the plague and mr rover looking like a frightened rabbit came down to make inquiries is shepworth dead he asked tremulously of a stalwart policeman whom he found guarding the closed door of number forty everyone says that shepworth is dead and my wife has fainted the doctor is with mr shepworth now said the constable gruffly i dont know whats the matter with him and it aint my duty to say anything sir oh dear oh dear rover wrung his small white hands how very very dreadful all this is who is the other manthe dead man he handed the officer halfasovereign so as to gain a reply dogberry unbent they do say sir as the corpse is steve agstone who is the missing witness in the lanwin murder case how wickedhow very wicked but if mr shepworth is dead he aint sir the constable slipped the gold into his pocket hes in a faint of sorts i believe and they do say as he killed steve agstone so as to save the young lady hes defending now i cant tell you more sir and ive said too much already just go home and keep quiet sir the police will look after this matter here rover still wringing his useless hands and muttering to himself like the weakbrained little man he was wearily climbed the stairs to his deserted ballrooms as he ascended two women and a man came down whitefaced and shaken they tried to enter number forty but the constable stretched forth a brawny arm to prevent entrance but we must come in said the man deferentially we are mr shepworths servants i am his valet this lady is the cook and yonder is the housemaid we have a right to enter you cant until the doctor and the inspector have done with your master said the constable stolidly and why arent you in bed the cook a large redfaced lady gaily dressed replied mr shepworth allowed us to join mrs rovers servants at the masked ball then none of you were in this flat when the murder was committed questioned the policeman doing a little detective business on his own account oh lor no cried the housemaid timidly weve been upstairs since nine oclock helping mrs rovers servants with the party do let us in mr policeman stay where you are until orders come commanded the officer sternly and the trio sat disconsolately on the stairs with the instinct of selfpreservation they had thoroughly explained their absence from the scene of the crime and now felt perfectly safe meanwhile in the diningroom a young medical man who had fortunately been present at the ball was reviving shepworth with brandy and ammonia the windows had been thrown open and the fresh air was filling the room so rapidly that scarcely a trace of the tuberose fragrance remained prelice having laid aside his mask and domino was standing near the door with his hands in his pockets watching a man in uniform who examined the dead along with the official doctor whom the police had called in the first individual was inspector bruge a keenlooking sharpeyed man with a cleanshaven face and closely clipped grey hair and an abrupt redtape manner captain jadby was not present having departed with the rest of the too curious onlookers but lord prelice remained as he had been the first to discover the crime and bruge wished to hear his account of it already the inspectors notebook was in his hand to note down the result of the official doctors examination there was a dead silence in the room faintly broken by the distant roll of vehicular traffic with the occasional hoot of a motor horn the bell of a near church boomed out midnight so unexpectedly that prelice jumped he might well be excused for doing so as his nerves were considerably shaken twelve oclock said bruge crisply when did you discover the crime my lord at halfpast eleven replied prelice shivering good heavens is it only halfanhour since then it seems like years we were on the spot in ten minutes said bruge with official satisfaction and havent been long in getting things shipshape now that these ladies and gentlemen have gone we can look into matters doctor he glanced at the young man attending to shepworth is your patient reviving a trifle answered the other rising help me to place him near the windowin a draught it is a long faint said the inspector helping to wheel the armchair to the open window it is not a faint at all the man is in a cataleptic state induced by the administration of some drug induced by the odour of a burning herb you mean said prelice looking at the rigid face of shepworth which was as expressionless as that of the dead man at the table whats that questioned the inspector turning his head prelice waved his hand ill explain later and after i have seen my friend dr horace horace horace the medical man who was examining the corpse looked up at this remark i know him slightly a great traveller isnt he yes answered prelice quickly he travelled with me to a little known part of the world called easter island lucky that he did so and that i was with him between us we may be able to solve the mystery of this cataleptic business you know that it is catalepsy induced by some odour of course i do i have seen a man in that state before and prelice pointed to the rigid form of shepworth where asked bruge looking at him with keen eyes somewhat puzzled on easter island the inspector would have asked further questions when the elder doctor rose from examining agstones body and stretched himself well thornton he asked curtly the man is dead right enough said thornton with a shrug that stab under the left shoulderblade reached the heart at one blow i dont see the weapon with which it was committedthe crime i mean we havent searched the flat yet rejoined bruge brusquely and if you remember thornton the weapon which killed sir oliver lanwin was not found either what has this case to do with sir oliver lanwins death bruge looked surprised dont you read the papers doctor there is a murder case on at the new bailey which resembles this in every particular sir oliver lanwin was stabbed seated at his desk and under the left shoulderblade his niece who is accused says that she is innocent and was in a cataleptic state just as this counsel of hers is what we see here mused bruge will go a long way towards helping her to prove her innocence mr shepworth need not have got rid of agstone in this way he didnt cried prelice sharply ill stake my existence that mr shepworth is perfectly innocent my lord we know that the prosecution hoped to convict miss chent on agstones evidence it was necessary that the defence should keep him out of the way and here is the man very forcibly removed and in the rooms of the young gentleman who is not only helping to defend miss chent but who is her affianced husband it looks strange prelice pointed to shepworth who now showed signs of reviving i say to you as i said to those people who burst into the flat when the alarm was given that shepworth is incapable of lifting a hand ah but we dont know how long he has been incapable said bruge cunningly when was agstone murdered doctor thornton who was twisting a cigarette answered promptly enough i should say judging from the condition of the temperature of the body some time between ten and eleven oclock and can you tell asked the inspector turning to the other doctor how long mr shepworth has been insensible no said the young physician promptly but hell tell us himself soon he is coming round even as he spoke shepworth opened his eyes and stared vaguely at those in the room his gaze wandered in a bewildered manner from the inspector to prelice and from prelice to the two doctors finally he looked meditatively at the dead body which was stretched right across the blue cloth of the diningtable with its glassy eyes staring at the ceiling a shudder shook the barristers frame and as though moved by wires he sprang stiffly to his feet prelice prelice he cried and his voice grew stronger as his strength came back as did his colour and senses look look isnt it the same as in the grange library agstone is dead and i have been in a trance you know then asked bruge swiftly that the dead man is agstone yes i have seen him many times at the grange but how did he come here who murdered him and his eyes questioned those present dumbly that is what we wish to ask you said the inspector shepworth passed his hand across his forehead which was now moist with perspiration the police he murmured and agstone dead will you place me in the dock beside mona he asked bruge passionately prelice sprang to his side and caught him by the hand ned ned he urged pull yourself together and tell us how agstone came to be murdered in this room i cant tell you cried shepworth wrenching away his hand i can tell you no more than mona could she was in a trance and saw nothing only coming out of it to find the dead beside her i was in a trance and saw ah he broke off and his wild eyes went roving round the room where is the woman what woman asked bruge suddenly and kept his eyes on shepworths face with a look of severe scrutiny the woman who came in masked and cloaked she came in agstone admitted her she waved the bronze cup before me and then ii oh what does it all mean he asked breaking down and with every reason considering what he had undergone prelice shook him gently by the shoulders i am beside you ned i am looking after you only tell us everything you remember shepworth stared straight before him and then as though a spring had been touched he began to speak swiftly and coherently i was sitting reading in the drawingroom when i heard three heavy blows struck on the wall of this room as my servants were all upstairs assisting at the ball i wondered who was in my flat and came out to inquire the door of this room was closed and i opened it to find a thick white smoke smelling sweetly and sickly curling from a bronze cup placed on the table the fumes choked me and i staggered instinctively to open the window before i could reach it i fell senseless interpolated thornton keenly no shepworth turned irritably how could i be senseless when i heard and saw everythingup to a point that is what did you see questioned bruge eagerly i could move neither hand nor foot nor could i call out went on shepworth slowly and i lay on the floor half propped up against that chair then i saw he shuddered a large hairy hand push aside the tablecloth and shortly a man crawled from underneath it was agstone for i recognised him without difficulty he growled in a pleased manner and lifted me into this chair then he went out and remained absent for some time when he returned a tall woman was with him wearing a mask and a green domino taking the bronze cup from which the white smoke still poured she waved it under my nose my senses left me and i knew no more until i woke to find you all in my room and agstone is dead ended the barrister trembling agstone is dead and agstone said bruge significantly is the chief witness for the prosecution chapter viii a private explanation shepworth made no reply to the insinuation contained in the remark of the inspector his brain was still dazed with the fumes of the white smoke and after telling his story he sat indifferently in his armchair prelice watched him closely recognising the mental confusion then laid his hand on the poor fellows arm you had better come and lie down he said gently and glanced at thornton certainly certainly answered that gentleman briskly and in reply to the unspoken query of prelice a few hours sleep will cure mr shepworth completely can i stay with my friend demanded prelice turning to bruge the inspector nodded absently as he was evidently following some train of thought will it be necessary to make a further examination of this he inquired looking at the dead body and at thornton no nonot at present when it has been removed to the deadhouse i will see to a further examination i have seen the body before rigor mortis has set in so that is all that is necessary the man has been stabbed some time between ten and eleven and he is as dead as a coffin nail thornton drew on his gloves goodnight goodnight replied the inspector allow me to see you to the door and he conducted both the medical men out of the room leaving prelice alone with his still dazed friend but shepworth was not so dazed as he pretended to be for the moment the door was closed he sprang to his feet dorry dorry he gasped swaying the knifelook for the knife then he dropped back again in the chair too weak to stand what do you mean demanded prelice sharply and much puzzled shepworth clutched him i did not tell all he stuttered hurriedly it would not have done to tell all listen dorry agstone came back again alonealone i tell youbefore he brought the lady i was still conscious although unable to move in any way he held the knife in his handthe jadehandled papercutter with which sir oliver was murdered i had it as you know it was concealed in my deskin my study agstone must have found it agstone must have used it no agstone is dead i forgot but someone must have used it to kill agstone oh my head my head he grasped his hair and rocked to and fro then with an effort look for the knifeunder the table perhapsunder the before he could end the sentence prelice realising its importance sprang forward and lifted a corner of the tablecloth which trailed on the ground at the same instant inspector bruge appeared again unexpectedly his keen eyes immediately fixed themselves on prelice what are you doing my lord he asked imperatively making a search retorted the other bluffly he did not know what else to say and hoped that his ready and natural explanation would lull any newly aroused suspicions entertained by the officer it did to a certain extent you must allow us to do that my lord i think you had better take mr shepworth to his bed and we may as well cover this thing until it is taken away added bruge gathering up the folds of the tablecloth to lay them over the starkdead creature staring at the ceiling shepworth moved at the same moment as bruge but prelice guessing that he wished to interfere held him down with an iron grasp when the lifted cloth exposed the bare legs of the table both the young men caught sight of an object lying underneath bruge stepping back espied it also with his trained faculty of instant observation and stooped to pick it up the jadehandled papercutter lay just where the feet of the dead man had rested before the body had been shifted on to the table the wonder was that it had not been discovered before but then it had been concealed by the drooping cloth the weapon with which the crime has been committed murmured bruge in a complacent tone after stabbing his victim the assassin must have allowed the knife to fall under the table or perhaps threw it there intentionally a jade handle hm it looks like a dagger tooan eastern dagger where have i seen itwhere and the inspector fell into a brown study turning and twisting the papercutter slowly prelice pressed shepworths shoulder to keep him quiet and cleared his throat to answer it is the knife used to kill sir oliver he said and felt shepworth jerk his body in surprised remonstrance at this unnecessary frankness bruge glanced up in amazement why so it is he remarked wonderinglythe very dagger i remember now that i read the description given of this in the newspaper report of the inquest at hythe hm so that is how i fancied that i had seen it before he balanced the knife on the palm of his hand a very good piece of description it must have been to so enable me to recognise this but you he glanced suspiciously at prelice how did you know the young man shrugged his square shoulders that is easily explained he replied suavely i went to hear the case at the new bailey today as i thought that my friend here he again pressed shepworths shoulder significantly was to speak in defence of miss chent at the court i heard the knife described it is quite simple you see i wonder how it comes to be here mused bruge nodding acquiescence to this lucid explanation odd isnt it not at all rejoined prelice easily the assassin of sir oliver lanwin brought it here to kill agstone but miss chent is in prison remonstrated the inspector she could not have she never did in any case interrupted shepworth faintly but rousing himself sufficiently to defend his promised wife she is innocent it is natural that you should say so remarked bruge with polite scepticism then added significantly did you expect agstone shepworths eyebrows went up wearily i no why should i have expected a witness for the prosecution to call upon me i have told you all that happened until i entirely lost my senses the first i saw of agstone was when he crawled from under that table then the smoke had rendered me not unconscious but unable to speak or move can this smoke you mention do that i speak from experience mr inspector and miss chent if you remember told the same story oh i see that the two crimes are connected said bruge hastily the circumstances are the same as regards this mysterious smoke and its curious power but you say he added turning to prelice you say my lord that the assassin of sir oliver brought the knife to kill agstone yet we see he waved his hands towards the corpse that agstone himself is a victim quite so but he may have brought the knife for all that then you imply that agstone murdered his master i imply nothing retorted the young man restively but the knife could not have got here unless someone brought it and as it was missing from the lanwin grange library only the murderer who used it could have possessed it moreover prelice pressed shepworths shoulder to make him particularly note the next sentence moreover mr shepworth saw the knife in agstones hand bruge wheeled swiftly towards the barrister you did not say that not when the doctors and you were in the room said shepworth languidly i am only beginning to recover my senses remember but i told lord prelice that agstone after he left this room returned and looked in to see if i was insensible i suppose before he brought in the lady then he had the knife in his hand and what do you infer asked bruge pointedly there can only be one inference drawn said prelice before shepworth could speak agstone must have had the knife in his pocket then agstone must have murdered sir oliver said bruge triumphantly shepworth shrugged his shoulders and staggered to his feet i feel too dizzy to give an opinion he said leaning heavily on his friend we know that agstone was devoted to sir oliver why should he have murdered him besides he accuses miss chent naturally cried the inspector who followed eagerly the scent of the red herring which prelice had drawn across the trail if agstone is guilty himself he naturally would throw the blame on another person and if he was possessed of the knife he must be guilty it was missed from the grange library and reappears here the masked lady might have brought it suggested shepworth bruge extremely pleased with his own theory shook his head sapiently mr shepworth saw the knife in agstones hand before he became insensible you can swear to that he asked the barrister yes said shepworth truthfully i can swear to that and you can swear that the masked woman killed agstone no i cant say that when she waved the bronze cup before me i became entirely insensible the inspector looked more knowing than ever of course said he in a complacent way she did not wish you to see her stabbing agstone but why should she have stabbed him we cant say until we know the lady did you recognise her no she was masked and cloaked a green domino i think you said and a green mask supplemented shepworth she must have been at mrs rovers ball mused bruge not necessarily interpolated prelice but as many people masked and cloaked were ascending and descending the stairs she may have taken advantage of the ball to get into this flat unobserved quite so assented the inspector but who admitted her agstone must have done that said shepworth probably but who admitted agstone the barrister shook his head i cant say he replied in a tired tone i heard a noisethree heavy blows struck in this roomas i told you when seated in the drawingroom i did not know that anyone was in the flat what time did your servants go to assist at the ball shortly before nine oclock when the dinner was over you had dinner then oh yes i came from the court worn out and slept for a long time i then had a light dinner agstone could not have been at the table thenunder it i mean i think not said the barrister slowly it is not a large table as you see i would either have heard him or i should have felt him with my feet your servants may have left the outer door ajar shepworth nodded perhaps you can question them but after dining i returned to the drawingroom before nine oclock and you did not reenter this room until you came to see what the three heavy blows meant no i did not they must have been struck to make you enter the room i think so mr inspector agstone wished to be smothered with the smoke that was why the bronze cup was smoking on the table where is the bronze cup bruge looked about him i cant say i last saw it when the lady waved it under my nose the inspector meditated its a queer case altogether he mused and undoubtedly it is connected with the lanwin murder he mused again and then looked up abruptly i believe that this second murder will exonerate miss chent he said quietly i hope so rejoined shepworth walking towards the door heavily and still leaning on prelices shoulder if she is condemned for murdering her uncle i should certainly be arrested and tried for murdering agstone i had every reason to kill him since on his evidence hangs the fate of miss chent you may as well speak in the past tense mr shepworth seeing that the man is dead for my part i believe that agstone murdered his master and was ready to throw the blame on miss chent so as to save his own skin only the assassin of sir oliver could have been possessed of the knife am i to consider myself arrested demanded the barrister no rejoined bruge promptly and held open the door but of course we must keep an eye on you he added smiling ambiguously shepworth nodded languidly and went out with his friend come into my study prelice he said almost in a whisper that knife hush prelice gripped the barristers arm hard he quite understood what shepworth wished to do not so loud but he need not have been so cautious for the door of the diningroom had been closed by bruge who was now probably searching the clothes of the dead man for more evidence the two young men went into the study which was at the end of the passage and there found that the desk had been forced openthat is all the three drawers on each side six in allin a most dexterous manner agstone had apparently come provided with housebreaking tools so as to gain possession of the dagger but how did he know that i had it asked shepworth perplexed i daresay he was watching through the grange window and saw you take it from miss chent suggested prelice shepworth nodded let us put the room tidy he said hurriedly and closing the door i dont want the police to fuss about here the room really was untidy for in searching for the knife agstone had scattered the loose papers lying on the desk all over the carpet the young man collected these and placed them in order then shepworth closed the drawers of the desk carefully in a few minutesafter replacing a chair that had been kicked over and smoothing a rug that had been rucked upthe study looked quite in order nevertheless shepworth stared anxiously at the now innocentlooking desk i hope the police will not examine it he said nervously i dont think so since you have explained so much ned their attentions will be confined to the diningroom wherein the murder took place will you go to bed no shepworth sat at his desk i dont want this examined let us sit here and have some strong coffee prelice shook his head dont he advised better let us steal to your bedroom and say nothing about having been here if the police examine the desk you can pretend ignorance and express surprise on the other hand if bruge comes in and makes the discovery while we are here he will naturally demand why we kept silence and inquiries would lead to difficulties leave the thing to chance shepworth agreed with this reasoning since it was useless and even dangerous to create difficulties at the present juncture the two walked silently to the bedroom and here the barrister stripped to put on his dressinggown then lying down outside the bed he placed his hands behind his head and stared at the ceiling while prelice lounged in an armchair close at hand why did you tell bruge about the second entrance of agstone with the dagger asked shepworth suddenly because he had already seen the dagger rejoined prelice promptly it is as well to tell the truth when possible and just as well that the inspector should think agstonewho cannot now contradictbrought the dagger you heard what he said yourself about agstones possible guilt our frankness will probably save miss chent as the murder of sir oliver will be attributed to agstone because he possessed that papercutter shepworth groaned but if bruge knew that i took it from mona then there would be serious trouble let things remain as they are ned we know that miss chent is innocent and must save her but we dont know that agstone is guilty he certainly is not on the reasoning of bruge no seeing that we know agstone did not bring the dagger here but the man is dead and if he can be made to act as scapegoat for an innocent woman so much the better the barrister sighed we are environed by difficulties he murmured then added significantly and unexpectedly jadby called to see me this evening what prelice was startled i thought that you had quarrelled so we hadso we didand with fists too but when i was reading in the drawingroom and thinking of my poor girl shut up in prison i heard a ring at the front door the servants had gone to the ball as you know so i had to open the door myself captain jadby was there and after a stiff greeting he asked for an interview i took him into the drawingroom and one moment did you close the outer door of course why do you ask that i fancied that you might have unconsciously left it open and that agstone might then have entered to conceal himself no said shepworth decisively i am certain that i closed it with jadby i went to the drawingroom and there he frankly expressed his regrets that we had quarrelled he wished to make it up and to join forces with me to save poor mona because he loves her quite so he makes no secret of the fact that he is madly in love with mona our handtohand fight at lanwin grange rose solely from the fact that he would insist upon forcing his attentions on her she appealed to me as her lover so i tackled jadby and knocked him down however he seemed to be sorry that he had behaved like a bounder so we shook hands and then sat down to consider how we should act with regard to monas position hm prelice looked sceptical from the glimpse i caught of jadby i should not think he was the sort of man to forgive a punch in the eye much less the loss of the girl he loves he might have come here with the intention of trapping you he might have admitted agstone no replied shepworth quickly i was with him all the time i opened the outer door to admit him and closed it when he departed as he was under my eyes while in the flat he had no chance of admitting agstone secretly i dont know how the man managed to enter and conceal himself under that table but jadby had nothing to do with it moreover added the barrister decisively jadby told me that he was as ignorant as everyone else of agstones whereabouts oh a blighter like jadby would say anything shepworth protested i think we have judged jadby wrongly my dear ned you are altogether too good for this wicked world i dont trust jadby for one instant he plays for his own hand i know he does he admits that he intends to claim the estate of sir oliver and that he loves mona but he swears that he will take no steps until she is set free then she can marry me if she chooses prelice laughed ironically and you believe him he seemed to be in earnest about setting miss chent free oh yes i am sure of that but he intends to marry her you may be sure jadby is very philanthropic how does he propose to save miss chent by finding agstone and sending him out of the kingdom and agstone appears shortly after that proposal hm hm hm i must have a personal interview with captain jadby and ask him ask him what if he has ever visited easter island what on earth do you mean demanded shepworth curiously but lord prelice refused to explain further chapter ix dr horace next day everyone from the man in the street to the lady in her drawingroom was talking about the murder at alexander mansions as a rule those in society talk very little about such horrors but on this occasion people more or less fashionable felt that the crime had been committed so to speak on their very doorsteps mrs rovers ball had been broken up by the discovery of the crime and many of the guests crowding down to shepworths flat had seen a murdered man for the first time in their frivolous lives no wonder the tragedy made a sensation moreover the second crime in london was connectedno one knew exactly howwith the first crime at lanwin grange hythe sir oliver had been murdered by his niece who was now being tried for the offence the victim had been a baronet and the prisoner was a wellknown figure in the social world now the missing witness upon whose evidence was supposed to hinge the condemnation or acquittal of miss chent had been violently done away with andhinted gossipin spite of appearances the barrister to whom the flat belonged must have killed the man so that damaging evidence might be finally suppressed thus the two crimes had much to do with society as a whole and the newspaper placards informed the lower orders of a tragedy in high life stump orators in hyde park chose the placards and the moment to talk of the decay of the upper classes and of the need of a revolution to sweep away tyrants born in the social purple finally there was another thing which interested fashionable folk many guests at the masked ball had been robbed of valuable jewellery and the police were entirely at a loss to trace the thieves undoubtedly what mr simon haken had prophesied jokingly to his host had come cruelly true swell mobsmen and lightfingered ladies had taken advantage of the use of masks at the ball to mingle with the legitimate guests and appropriate gems and gold of great value bracelets earrings chains brooches and even ringsmany of these had vanished and scarcely a single woman had escaped the rapacity of the unknown thieves this in itself was sufficient to make mrs dolly rovers entertainment notorious and that a terrible murder should cap the climax of such roguery was almost too much for belief next day the journals sold like hot cakes and the one topic of conversation with high and low had to do with this astounding criminality lord prelice returned to his rooms in halfmoon street just as the dawn broke over an astonished and indignant mayfair and threw himself on his bed to recuperate tough as he was with travel and adventure he needed sleep very badly after the exciting events of the dark hours and as he dropped off into slumber it struck him forcibly that the time of superabundant leisure had gone by for ever formerly an idler who took comparatively little interest in life and certainly none in the doings of other people he found himself committed through friendship to a strenuous career ever since lady sophias visit on the previous morning he had gradually become entangled in other lives and until the crooked ways of these had been made straight he saw no chance of reverting to his happygolucky existence prelice having a high ideal of friendship resolved to help shepworth and through him miss mona chent with all the brain power and physical power and social power at his command and the opportunity of doing so was not unpleasing to an activeminded man who had hitherto fritted away his intelligence in butterfly pursuits he woke at noon to receive a telegram which his man brought in with an apology for disturbing him it proved to be from shepworth and contained the amazing news that the barrister had been arrested for the murder considering that inspector bruge had assured shepworthand in prelices presencethat there was no chance of any suspicion being cast upon him in any way the young man had to read the wire twice or thrice before he could fully grasp its sinister significance it seemed absurd dozens of people including bruge and two medical men had seen the insensible form of the accused man and were content at the time that he could not raise a hand much less execute a crime which needed clearheadedness and strength and it was the more ridiculous to arrest shepworth because the barrister had given a plain account of what had happenedso far as he rememberedwhich was similar in most respects to what had taken place at hythe of course prelice recollected the way in which he and ned had concealed the true story of the knife but it was impossible that shepworth now quite in possession of his wits should have told an unnecessary truth if he had prelice believed that he would be arrested also as an accessory after the fact the thought made him uncomfortable until he brushed it away ned was not exactly an idiot and on whatever plea he had been arrested it certainly could not have to do with the story of the knife but it was necessary to learn what had taken place and also to bail ned out so that they might work together to elucidate the mystery this would be difficult considering the charge was one of murder but prelice indulged in a cold bath to freshen his physical powers and after dressing rapidly took a hansom back to alexander mansions here he was confronted at the door by the same burly police constable who had prevented shepworths servants from reentering their masters flat some hours before he treated lord prelice in the same way you cant come in my lord inspectors orders i wish to see mr shepworth argued prelice vexedly its against orders my lord is he within yes my lord but he isnt allowed to see anyone will you take a note in from me no my lord i cant do that can i see inspector bruge he is at the police station my lord prelice stamped with vexation at the obstacles placed in his way he did his best to argue this official machine into something resembling reasonable humanity but without success shepworth he learned was to be taken to prison later in the day and the constable hinted that since the charge was so serious there would be no chance of the barrister being let out on bail there was no other course open but to see inspector bruge so prelice drove to the kensington police station only to find that the man he wished to see had gone to scotland yard presumably about the case apparently there was nothing to be done at the moment in connection with this new trouble so prelice was half minded to repair to the new bailey and listen to the further progress of the charge against miss chent now that agstone was dead he did not think that she would be convicted also the repetition of the circumstances of the hythe crime in alexander mansions would assuredly strengthen her position since the jury would now be compelled to believe her story of the stupefying smoke which formerly had been regarded as absurd and it was when the thought of the smoke entered his mind that prelice recollected that dr horace lived in the neighbourhood he therefore walked to rutland square and asked at number twenty for his former fellowtraveller chance stood the young mans friend for the doctor was within and saw him at once this is an unexpected pleasure prelice said the doctor beaming i thought you were in the west indies i returned only a few days ago are you busy my friend i am always busy and horace indicated a case of beetles and butterflies with which he was dealing when his guest entered the room was a large one with two broad windows looking out onto the quiet square but all available space was taken up with records of the doctors travels the floor was carpeted with wildbeast skins for horace was a noted hunter the walls were decorated with polynesian warclubs with zulu assegaies with redskin wampum belts and beaded moccasins also there were japanese gods chinese jars of grotesquely decorated porcelain hindoo swords persian tiles reft from mosques and african canoe paddles rudely carved as horace never allowed any servant to meddle with his treasures the room was extremely untidy and dusty and generally neglected with the exception of a gigantic diningtable of mahogany and two chairs there was no civilised furniture yet the place was so crammed with barbaric curiosities that prelice could scarcely find a clear place to stand in finally he stumbled through a narrow passage of egyptian mummies and gigantic maori idols to an uncomfortable cane chair near the window here he sat down and looked at his host with some disgust why the dickens cant you live like a civilised being when you are in london he asked lighting a cigar to dispel the frowsy smell of the room i am perfectly comfortable said horace clearing a place on the table to sit on this is my home i live here you camp here i think i never saw such a messy place in my life huh grunted the doctor filling a german pipe with strong tobacco you shouldnt come here in a bond street kit well what is it are you longing to be on the trail again i am on a sort of trail certainly admitted prelice slowly and inspecting the ash of his cigar a manhunt ah your eyes light up at that you bloodthirsty old pagan a manhunt repeated horace meditatively and in londonslow business well i dont know horace it is one requiring a great deal of subtility i have come for your assistance huh said the doctor again and nodded im with you prelice reflected for a few moments before beginning an explanation of his errand he did not know how much to tell and how much to withhold horace saw his hesitation and ascribed it to the right cause i must know everything prelice he said quickly else i do not assist i have no notion of working in the dark and failing through ignorance you can read my thoughts as usual i see commented the visitor some more of that clairvoyant business i expect well i have a case to lay before you which will tax your occult powers to the utmost fire away said horace and placing his hands on the table rocked to and fro looking absurdly like a monkey the missing link they called him in the wilds and certainly the name was deserved horace was a small man with a long body short legs and lengthy arms very powerfully built and very shaggy in appearance prelice looked at the doctors large head covered with tangled red hair at his beard and moustache of the same hue untrimmed and untidy concealing nearly all his flat face and at his big hornrimmed spectacles which hid the brightest and keenest of blue eyes he wore an old pair of flannel trousers and a still older flannel shirt the sleeves of which were turned up over two hairy wrists encircled with matabele wire bracelets to complete his barbaric looks his large ears furry as those of a faun were adorned with gold rings a more quaint or a more extraordinary figure was not to be met with outside a freak museum and dr horace should have been exhibited in one if only on account of the beautifully executed tattooing which prelice could see on his sunburnt arms and on his chest through the unbuttoned shirt no one would have taken this manmonkey to be a clever and learned scholar with a heart of gold and a fund of knowledge second to none prelice knew and esteemed him and had fought with himfor the doctor was obstinateand beside him in the naked lands at the backofbeyond when both held their lives in their hands all the same being fastidious he sincerely wished that when the doctor returned to civilisation he would leave behind him in the wilderness his uncouth manners and shabby dress and general appearance of being a prehistoric man of lady sophias favourite stone age go on go on said horace impatiently dont keep me waiting i have lots to do and cant waste time you have lots to do in the way of dress i think come and have a turkish bath and visit the nearest barber then i can take you to my tailor to be clothed properly and horace interrupted characteristically by throwing his pipe at the young man it was deftly fielded and returned do you remember easter island asked prelice when the doctor was again smoking then in reply to a consenting grunt i see you do and the sacred herb eh horace scowled how do you come into the matter he growled into what matter queried the other oliver lanwins murder its in all the papers quite so but why should my remark about the sacred herb make you think that i referred to lanwins murder is there any need of an explanation asked horace coolly if you didnt guess as i did that the sacred herb was used to make that smoke why do you talk of the matter at all then you think that the herb course course growled horace beginning to rock again lanwin haunted the south seas i knew him there he must have got the herb from easter island as it is the only place it grows in when i read the girls yarn of the smoke i guessed straight off that lanwin had been trying to induce a trance with the burning herb do you think that miss chent murdered him no the library was filled with the smoke of the herb anyone not used to the fumes would go down like a shot as she did then you believe miss chents story asked prelice eagerly horace nodded she could not have made up such a clever yarn then why in heavens name questioned the young man rising did you not volunteer your evidence to save her will it save her assuredly everyone regards her story of being stupefied with the smoke as absurd if you tell what we saw on easter island in front of the statues tell it yourself i intend to i am going to the court now and you said prelice with emphasis you are coming with me horace knocked the ashes out of his pipe why should i he demanded with a stolid air thats a long story retorted prelice restlessly i can give you ten minutes dont talk through your hat knowing his man the visitor did not waste time but bluntly detailed how he came to be drawn into the lanwin murder case but he naturally suppressed his feelings for the beautiful prisoner and put down his interest with some emphasis to pure friendship for shepworth on reaching the end of the hythe portion of the story he paused to draw breath is that all asked horace grimly the first part only replied prelice promptly and narrated the events of the previous night from the time he went to mrs rovers bal masqu to the time he left the kensington police station to call upon his listener during this latter part of the history dr horace became restless and wandered about his untidy room stumbling over obstacles and softly swearing with a wonderful command of language he appeared to be inattentive but in reality had not lost a single word when prelice stopped he came to a halt before the young man ill go with you to the court he declared the first thing to do is to save the girl after that we can consider how to get shepworth out of his difficulty he is innocent of course observed prelice trying to read the rugged face of his new ally never said he wasnt grumbled the doctor then reflected for a few moments raking his long beard with outspread fingers see here he burst out finally will you allow me to engineer this business i shall only be too glad are you going to use occult methods i dont need to i have my own ideas having read the newspapers then you think that agstone murdered lanwin no more than i think shepworth murdered agstone on your own showing your barrister friend brought the knife to the flat and it is on the false evidence of the knife which you and shepworth supplied that inspector bruge seems to judge agstone still oh dont talk poppycock interrupted the little man impatiently you are not polite horace was i ever polite demanded the other scornfully no to do you justice you are always consistently rude then why expect the impossible retorted horace and again stumbled about the crowded room swearing softly when again abreast of prelice who was sorely puzzled by this strange conduct the doctor thrust out a large hairy paw shake said he brusquely prelice did so promptly and inquired why because you are giving me pleasure in allowing me to help you his friend looked at the odd creature perplexedly i dont understand what you mean he declared frowning never mind returned horace with a chuckle when it is necessary for you to understand ill straighten out things then you have a theory i have more than that i have certain knowledge of what in heavens name high cockalorum snip snap snorum was the jocular and enigmatic reply come to my bedroom and we can chatter while i dress well said prelice as he sauntered after his friend i am glad that you are not going in that rigout it isnt the fifth of november silly ass snapped the traveller get a dressedup doll to help you all right come to a toyshop and help me to choose one dr horace began to laugh why cant you talk sense he growled i shall do so if you will set the example very good i have some of the sacred herb here shall i take it to the new bailey and give judge and jury and counsel a practical illustration of how miss chent and shepworth went into trances you can if you like by the way did you give any portion of that herb away horace the doctor who was plunging his hairy face in water gurgled and grumbled but made no reply prelice was nettled why cant you be plain with me confound you all right horace began to dry his face vigorously i dont believe that miss chent is guilty or that shepworth killed agstone i knew that before said prelice dryly you tell me nothing new oh retorted horace mockingly you want to hear something new like an athenian of st pauls period very good do you know why i take so deep an interest in this case no i dont unless it is to help me and ned i dont care a red cent about you and ned but i care a trifle about agstone poor devil prelice sat up straight and stared in heavens name why because said dr horace slowly and looking at prelices puzzled face in the glass because steve agstone is my brother chapter x the verdict here was a surprise indeed prelice knew that dr horace had worked his way up from a humble position and laid no claims to being of gentle blood but he had never referred to the existence of a single relative and the young man had always believed him to be alone in the world now it seemed that agstone was his brother and when prelice recollected that agstone was the same hirsute redhaired uncouth animal in appearance it flashed across his mind that the brothers were twins the extraordinary thing was that he had not noted the close resemblance before since he had seen agstone dead and horace alive within the last few hours but the idea of connecting a common sailor with an eminent scientific man had never entered his mind in the cab on the way to the new bailey horace gruffly gave his companion a few facts to substantiate his statement but prelice observed that he said as little as he could my full name is horace agstone explained the doctor bluntly but as i got on in life and rose in the world i dropped the last and kept to the first steve is my elder brother by one year and we are the sons of a suffolk labourer i had the brains of the family and in one way and another managed to cultivate those same brains with the resultno very great oneyou see steve went to sea and we did not meet for years and years when he returned to england with old lanwin he went down to suffolk to look up the family our parents were dead and buried but steve learned my name and address from the vicar he came to look me up but as we did not hit it off very well we considered it best to live our lives apart as formerly thats all prelice threw his cigarette out of the cab and stared at the horse in a meditative way strange that you should be connected with this case also he remarked dreamily the doctor grew red and looked fierce what the devil do you mean by that i have nothing to do with the case your brother i have nothing to do with my brother he and i were born of the same mother but beyond that we arei mean we were seeing he is deadnothing to one another if he chooses to kill people and be killed that is his affair no one can connect steve agstone with dr horace save the vicar of burfield in suffolk unless you betray me not that i care mark you prelice i learned that fable of the old man and his ass very early in life and never trouble about people and their opinions i dont intend to betray you said prelice coldly but flushing all over his freckled face you can be brother to satan for all i care moreover i have given confidence for confidence if i know about your relation to agstone you know about the knifes evidence which i and shepworth suppressed right right dont get your hair off said horace gripping his companions knee in a painful manner you and i are chums of the wild old son and those of that breed dont go back on one another he released prelices knee and leaned back thoughtfully of course it was a shock for me to learn of agstones death didnt you see it in the morning papers no i have more to do than to read riffraff rubbish you were the first to inform me well horace leaned his arms on the splashboard calmly steves gone to see father and mother on the astral plane i expect he will quarrel with them as usual they never got on together prelice suppressed a smile at this odd unchristian way of viewing death and nodded i quite understand why you dont believe agstone to be guilty he remarked after a pause meaning that im a born fool retorted horace genially make no mistake old son if steve were guilty i should not defend him in any way but he was too devoted to old lanwin to murder him besides the doctor suddenly checked himself but thats neither here nor there my son what isnt asked prelice alertly never you mind ask no questions and youll be told no lies here we are at the door of the temple of falsehood get out prelice alighted with his companion sorely puzzled to know what this enigmatic remark meant that horace knew of something which had to do with the lanwin case he was perfectly sure that the something implicated the late mr agstone he was also certain but prelice knew his friend sufficiently well to be satisfied that he would not explain unless it appeared to him needful to do so all that could be done was to trust blindly to the rugged old sinner and perhaps he would be able to lead those concerned in the case out of the labyrinth of crime he certainly appeared to hold a clue dr horace more brusque and domineering than ever pushed his way into the crowded court eliciting comments the reverse of complimentary of these with characteristic cynicism he took no notice but secured good places for himself and prelice in a few minutes he scribbled a note and sent it to cudworth kc the counsel read it with a puzzled air glanced at the writer across the crowded court and whispered to the usher shortly dr horace was requested to go to the lawyers table and was soon in deep conversation with the big barrister while this was taking place prelice stared at miss chent who looked weary and sad as she sat in the dock the strain of her perilous position was beginning to tell upon her which was scarcely to be wondered at again her roving eyes caught sight of prelice and again she blushed this time drawing a corresponding signal from him apparently the natures of these two were sympathetic the case was rapidly drawing to a close as the witnesses for the prosecution had been examined and now those for the defence were giving evidence from a solicitor at his elbow the young man learned that cudworth had succeeded in proving the destruction of the will in mona chents favour this had been done by the production of half burnt and minutely torn scraps of paper rescued from the grate in the library these pieced together had revealed the mention of the prisoners name and of the ten thousand a year and of the love and affection felt by the testator for his niece as the will could not be found and it was certain that sir oliver had framed no new testament the presumption was that the burnt document was the will in question and despite all efforts the other side could not prove otherwise this was assuredly a great point in the prisoners favour as had she murdered her uncle she would certainly not have destroyed a deed which made her wealthy it was with great surprise that prelice saw shepworth placed in the witnessbox to give evidence since he had left him practically imprisoned in his own flat possibly inspector bruge had received instructions from scotland yard on detailing what had happened in alexander mansions to afford the judge and jury the opportunity of seeing how similar the murders of agstone and his master were to one another shepworth was perfectly cheerful and composed much more so than he had been on the previous day so apparently he had no fear that his arrest would lead to his conviction indeed he was so clearly innocent that prelice expected he would be set free after the inquest proceedings on agstones body had taken place meanwhile he caught his friends eye and smiled after which he smiled again encouragingly at mona shepworths evidence was to the effect that miss chent loved her uncle and would never have harmed him in any way sir oliver in the course of an occult conversation had referred to a certain herbhe did not give it any namewhich when burned produced trances apparently when prisoner entered the library to make up her quarrel with sir oliver the baronet had been testing the herb and the fumes had reduced miss chent to an unconscious state then shepworth went on to detail his own experience and narrated the same story as he had told to prelice to the two doctors and to inspector bruge finally he mentioned that agstone had reentered the diningroom before returning with the masked lady holding a knife as shepworth naturally was not asked if the knife was concealed in his desk there was no need for him to commit perjury which he would have been unwilling to do even to save the girl he loved while the barrister was giving his evidence lord prelice was called to cudworths side and introduced by dr horace he learned that the counsel wished him to appear as a witness and substantiate shepworths story which the young man was perfectly willing to do it thus happened that when shepworth retired cudworth examined prelice and heard from him how shepworth had been found unconscious and how many people including captain jadby had seen him in this helpless state this evidence induced the recall of jadby and he reluctantly swore that the barrister was indeed unable to strike the murderous blow which had slain the old sailor both shepworth and prelice had given evidence as to the finding of the knife under the table by inspector bruge and that officer himself next appeared to say how he had picked it up mrs blexey madame marie eppingrave and two of the grange servants were then called to depose that the papercutter with the jade handle found in the flat by bruge and produced in court was the same that had lain on sir olivers writingtable in the library wherein the crime had been committed thus the jury and indeed everyone else believed that agstone had murdered his master and then had brought the knife up to alexander mansions presumably to kill shepworth but of course the question as to who had killed agstone was not touched upon the final witness was dr horace and he dealt entirely with the questions of the perfumed smoke alluded to by the prisoner and by shepworth producing a grotesque brown root and several stems covered with purple leaves more or less withered the doctor deposed that it was a certain plant growing in easter island and nowhere else so far as he knew the natives gave it no name but termed it the sacred herb and it was used by their priests to induce trances in which the spirit was supposed to leave the body and appear before the gods incarnateso to speakin the gigantic statues of the island belmain for the prosecution did you give any portion of this herb to sir oliver lanwin witness emphatically no i was acquainted with sir oliver in the south seas but i never met him in england we did not get on well together and were better apart belmain then how did sir oliver become possessed of this herb which by your own showing is to be found only in easter island witness i cannot say how sir oliver got the herb of course he was sailing the south seas for years and probably went to easter island if he did he certainly would have secured a portion of the herb from the native priests seeing that he took so profound an interest in occult matters belmain then you think that sir oliver was experimenting with the herb when prisoner entered the library witness i think it extremely likely considering the presence of the white smoke and the tuberose perfume which is exactly the kind of scent given off by the herb when burnt the fumes of the herb would choke prisoner in the way she stated and reduce her to unconsciousness belmain significantly to complete unconsciousness witness i think so seeing that she was not accustomed to the smoke of the herb a slight smoke would place anyone in a cataleptic state merely but a dense smoke would take away all consciousness it did so apparently in the case of miss chent and although mr shepworth was simply cataleptic at first the waving of the bronze cup under his nose plunged him into the deeper state belmain how did agstone become possessed of the herb to burn in alexander mansions witness i really cannot tell you perhaps he went to easter island with his master and got some leaves of the herb or it might be that when taking the knife away from the library he also secured the leaves which were lying on sir olivers desk belmain quickly how do you know the leaves were there witness coolly i am only surmising if lanwin was experimenting with the herb he must have got out his packet of leaves and roots i expect not being used to the herb he was reduced either to catalepsy or to unconsciousness and while thus helpless was murdered belmain by steve agstone witness i am not prepared to say very dryly a very improper question rebuked the judge and belmain sat down feeling that he had not scored off this rugged witness before dr horace left the witnessbox the judge prompted by the foreman of the jury requested him to burn some leaves of the herb at once but do not reduce us to a state of catalepsy said the judge with a smile we have to finish our business you know a china plate was brought and on this horace gravely laid two or three leaves of the sacred herb on applying a match a thick curl of pungent white smoke arose like a summer cloud and the odour of tuberoses was perceptibly indicated in the heavy atmosphere of the court prelice who was standing near the witnessbox and so smelt the perfume very strongly suddenly felt sick and swiftly pushed his way into the fresh air he was inclined to faint being susceptible to odours and but that a good samaritan addicted to alcohol had produced a flask of brandy he would have become unconscious when quite restored he thought how very powerful the herb was when even so slight a breath of the smoke could muddle his senses no wonder that miss chent and sir oliver and shepworth had become unconscious when the full power of the burning purple leaves was poured through the rooms prelice did not feel inclined to reenter the court and sat outside in the vestibule smoking a cigarette here he was joined by captain jadby which rather surprised the young man as he thought that the sailors love for mona chent would have kept him in the court also prelice was surprised when jadby approached him in quite a friendly way and with an apology i hope you have forgiven me for my rudeness last night lord prelice was his ingratiating remark i never gave it another thought retorted prelice brusquely pray do not apologise again you did so last night thank you said jadby smiling all over his smooth feline face i am glad that you take it in such a spirit by the way i never knew that you were acquainted with dr horace prelice stared at this impertinent remark very probably he said stiffly but then you know nothing about me i know that you went to easter island lord prelice i heard of your visit when i went there myself oh said prelice alertly then you visited the island also i have just said so rejoined jadby coolly but i did not bring away any of the herb if that is what you mean it is not what i mean said the other wondering why jadby should say such a thing i dont accuse you of murdering sir oliver even though you inherit the property he was thus pointed and rude to get rid of the smiling man before him as he felt the same antipathy to jadby as he would have done to a cat the one animal which prelice could not endure but the sailor was not at all annoyed or if he was did not show it rather did he smile in a very satisfied way yes i do inherit the property he remarked and there is a good reason why i should really observed prelice considering what the reason might be but unwilling to ask yes really retorted the captain still smiling of course i am sorry for miss chent but when she marries me all will be well you forget sir she marries mr shepworth they are engaged replied jadby with a shrug but i do not think that they will ever be married mrs rover prelice interrupted imperiously what do you mean by mentioning mrs rovers name in this connection he demanded flushing oh said jadby with his hateful smile i understood that you and mr shepworth were intimate friends goodday and before prelice could stop him captain jadby had vanished amidst the crowd leaving like the wasp he was a sting behind him prelice frowned he recollected shepworths blush lady sophias remarks and now considered captain jadbys hint it would seem that his friend was either in love with mrs dolly rover or was entangled in some way if that was the case he could not possibly love mona and if he did not prelices face grew crimson and his eyes brightened then he shook himself free of the thought jadby was implying that shepworth was behaving dishonourably and prelice could not bring himself to believe that such was the case he had known ned too long to doubt him all the same he felt that an explanation would clear the air and concluded to ask shepworth for one as delicately as possible upon that explanation would depend his future movements lord prelice walked up and down the vestibule musing on mona on her perilous position on shepworths possible entanglement with mrs rover late miss constance newton and on the enigmatic hints of dr horace dealing with the mysterious cases in which friendship had involved him thus thinking he lost all note of time and it was only when a court official came to turn on the electrics that he became aware of the passing of time glancing at his watch he found that it was several hours since he had left the court and he determined to enter again and hear the speeches of the counsel for the defence and prosecution but just as he turned in the direction of the court he heard a cheer and an excited throng of people poured out in two minutes prelice was in possession of the news and learned that mona chent had been acquitted she was free chapter xi dr horaces warning when london was made acquainted with the verdict the majority of people were satisfied that justice had been done miss chents behaviour while in the dock the open sympathy of the grange servants the occurrence of the second murder so similar in all respects to the first and the evidence of horace with regard to the ansthetic properties of the sacred herb of easter island went far to enlist the public in favour of the accused girl perhaps also her youth and brilliant beauty had something to do with the loudly expressed pleasure of those who read in the newspapers that she had been set free of course there were the usual malcontents who agreed with no one and wrote to the journals stating that the verdict was wrong a communication to the daily telegraph insisted that miss client must have lied declaring that she fell senseless while unfastening the window for fresh air if it had been the case captain jadby would have found her lying near the window whereas she was discovered in the armchair near the fire some distance away but a supporter of the late prisoner replied to this by pointing out that the murderer of sir oliver undoubtedly had picked up the girl while she was insensible and placed her in the chair the first correspondent retorted that sir oliver was dead and his murderer conspicuous by his absence when miss chent entered the library and so could not have shifted her from the floor on to the chair to this the defending writer wrote that there was no proof of sir oliver being dead when miss chent entered as it was apparent that the fumes of the herb had drugged him into insensibility and therefore the murderer must have entered later to kill the baronet and remove his niece from the place where she fell by her own showing to the chair in which she was discovered by captain jadby and so the war of letterwriting went on and although mona was free from the danger of hanging her character was still stained in the opinion of some people with the blood of her uncle prelice was furious when he read this correspondence but on the face of it did not see how he could defend mona since he had no evidence to bring forward in her favour on the testimony of the knife it was generally considered that agstone had murdered his master and then had come to alexander mansions to kill the barrister but of course both shepworth and his friend knowing the true story of how the knife came into agstones possession were by no means certain that the old sailor was guilty the mystery of sir olivers death was no longer one to the publicas everyone had been misled by the suppression of the evidence dealing with the knifebut it continued to be one to those who had suppressed that same evidence but of one thing lord prelice was certainnamely that monas character would have to be completely cleared by the discovery of the real criminal with this idea in his mind he went next day to alexander mansions and learnedsomewhat to his surprisethat shepworth was within inspector bruge informed him of this at a chance meeting on the stairs and affably told the constable guarding the door of number forty that lord prelice was to be admitted to see the prisoner not that he is a prisoner said bruge nodding we are merely detaining mr shepworth until the inquest is held on the body of agstone when does the inquest take place asked prelice lingering to ask necessary questions tomorrow at three oclock in the afternoon at the greyhound hotel kensington beyond the fact that the jury will bring in a verdict of wilful murder against some person or persons unknown i dont think that wethe police that is my lordcan give any evidence to indicate the assassin of agstone then why accuse mr shepworth i dont accuse him if you dont why arrest him it is best to be on the safe side said bruge dryly and notwithstanding what mr shepworth may have written to you my lord the arrest has not taken place he is merely detained pending the inquest and under suspicion flashed out prelice loyally the inspector shrugged his square shoulders if you like to put it in that way he said indifferently but it is absurd to suspect mr shepworth cried prelice excitedly many people saw him insensible in the same way that miss chent was insensible if she is guiltlessand a competent jury have acquitted hermr shepworth also must be innocent the evidence of dr horace quite so my lord interrupted bruge with rather a bored air but all that will be discussed at the inquest we need not enter into it now considering we have insufficient premises to go upon if anyone murdered agstone which they certainly did since no man can stab himself in the back it must have been the lady seen by mr shepworth finished prelice hum that might have been a hallucination and the moon may be made of cream cheese retorted prelice heatedly it may be assented bruge gravely i know no reason to the contrary my lord but this talk leads to nothing and i am very busy go in and see your friend you will find dr horace with him dr horace echoed the young man staring inspector bruge nodded so you may guess that when thus permitted to see his friends mr shepworth is not a legitimate prisoner by the way added bruge formally as he took his leave i am delighted that miss chent has been acquitted of course she is innocent entirely innocent in my opinion and very beautiful also mr shepworth is a lucky man my lord goodday the inspector descended the stairs leaving prelice somewhat puzzled the young man could not quite determine whether bruge believed shepworth to be innocent or guilty at one time he said one thing again he hinted at another however it was useless to ponder over the enigma so prelice entered the flat after a word or two with the uniformed cerberus who guarded the door and was conducted by a somewhat pale parlourmaid to the library here he found dr horace looking more uncivilised than ever in deep conversation with ned the latter sprang up when his friend entered shepworth had lost some of his ruddy colour and his eyes had dark circles under them otherwise he appeared to be quite composed and not at all like a man accused of a serious crime and in spite of bruges protestations prelice believed that the inspector did so accuse him mentally at all events you are just in time prelice cried shepworth grasping the newcomers hand warmly in addition to the mysteries of these murders we have another to solve in the person of our friend here theres no mystery about me said horace gruffly i merely advise you to leave matters as they stand prelice looked as astonished as shepworth but i say he cried you wanted to take a hand in the game yourself horace i have taken a hand retorted the doctor coolly and i have won my aim was to save miss chent from being unjustly convicted for whomsoever murdered lanwin i am convinced that she is innocent as she is now free and the prevailing opinion seems to be that agstone is guilty why stir up muddy water and waken sleeping dogs you forget said shepworth rather tartly that i have to be cleared myself bruge says that i am innocent but the fact that he has practically arrested me proves that he thinks the contrary horace who was smoking his ungainly german pipe shook his shaggy head vigorously when the inquest takes place you will be discharged without a stain on your character that being the case my advice to you is a speedy marriage with miss chent who is also free dont bother your head further about these two murders when horace mentioned marriage with mona so pointedly prelice darted a side glance at his chum bearing in mind the hints of captain jadby and lady sophia as he expected shepworth coloured and looked confused at present i am not rich enough to marry mona he said in a halting way and by the burning of the will she loses the property horace chuckled silently which goes to captain jadby yes the earlier will comes into force now that the latter one has been destroyed in that case observed horace complacently puffing at his pipe i should advise her to marry captain jadby shepworth still looking uneasy went to stare out of the window and it was prelice who replied im hanged if shell do that why not inquired the doctor with a keen glance jadby has the money by shepworths showing he isnt badlooking and he loves her devotedly also it was sir olivers wish jadbys a cattish ruffian cried prelice warmly and with a sudden access of colour we dont know where he comes from or from the south seas my old son or who he is continued prelice impetuously it would be a shame that so delightful a girl should marry a shady buccaneer ned you are engaged to miss chentwhy dont you speak there is nothing to say replied the barrister somewhat coldly if miss chent will take me a pauper as i am i shall only be too charmed to make her my wife prelice raised his eyebrows a conviction was forcing itself upon him that ned had no real love for the girl but if that was the case why had he become engaged to her why had he so vigorously defended her of late then there was mrs dolly rover but prelice knew nothing about that mysterious lady as he had not seen her since returning to london he had half a mind then and there to demand an explanation from ned but the presence of dr horace restrained him and with an afterthought of wisdom he determined to interview mrs rover herself before coming to an understanding with the barrister as it was therefore unnecessary to pursue the subject and as already horace was asking him mutely why he should take such an interest in an engaged young lady prelice changed the subject by an attack on the doctor himself i cant understand why you should wish to abandon the search into these cases when you were so keen yesterday to run the show on your own horace quite understood the slang of the concluding remark i merely quoted a proverb about letting sleeping dogs lie he said coolly why are you afraid for a certain person questioned prelice meaning agstone and the listeners relationship with agstone oh no retorted the doctor quite aware of what prelice was referring to the person you hint at is dead and everyone believes him guilty of the first murder it doesnt matter who killed him as shepworth here is sure to be acquitted i dont care a damn one way or the other as you will respect my confidence what confidence asked the barrister suddenly one that i made to prelice here said the doctor dryly then heaving up his squat figure from the armchair he waddled towards the door there he paused and addressed himself to prelice if you go on prying into this matter he said with uplifted finger you will be very very sorry my son what do you mean gammon and spinach said horace again enigmatic and hurled himself out of the room still smoking his unwieldy pipe the two young men stared at one another is he mad asked shepworth mad like hamlet southsouwest rejoined the other in a vexed tone unless he is in league with that jadby bounder whom he knew in the south seas i dont know what he means by backing out but surely you dont suspect jadby asked ned startled why not he was at mrs rovers ball nonsense she doesnt know him remember the jewel robberies said prelice dryly a great number of people unknown to host or hostess were at that ball but jadby shepworth bit his fingers perplexedly you cant suspect him he came and saw me and then went away it was a woman whom agstone brought in she must have killed agstone prelice shrugged his shoulders and sauntered about the room perhaps he remarked carelessly sauntering about the room i certainly have no reason to suspect jadby save that he was at the ball how do you know he was one of the crowd that rushed in to see you insensible and he wore a domino and mask as did the rest of them then how did you spot him he unmasked that shows his innocence declared shepworth quickly for if he had come to the ball to slip down and murder agstone he would not have revealed himself hum hum perhaps not prelice threw himself into a chair however i shall keep an eye on jadby then you are still searching into the case into both cases corrected the other lighting a cigar i want to learn who killed lanwin and who murdered agstone out of friendship for me cried shepworth grasping his chums hand you are a brick dorry prelice returned the grasp but blushed a trifle he knew that love for mona prompted the desire to search as much as friendship for the man before him if he could only understand shepworths attitude towards the girl and towards mrs rover again it was on the tip of his tongue to ask a leading question but he suppressed the desire and kept to his earlier resolution to see the lady in the flat overhead by the way said prelice carelessly have you seen miss chent no answered shepworth rather ruefully i wish i could have seen her but bruge hurried me away from the court to keep me as a kind of state prisoner here however mona wrote me a short note thanking me for all i had done and said that she was going down to lanwin grange but if that belongs to jadby the will isnt proved yet interrupted the barrister quickly and until it is mr martaban thinks mona should stop at the grange mr martaban the late sir olivers lawyera kind clever old chap he has taken mona down to the grange and mrs blexey who is devoted to her will look after the poor girl until i am free to visit her youll go down of course said prelice nervously oh yes as soon as the inquest is over and bruge sets me free i do not see how i can be arrested but meanwhile dorry you could do me a great favour prelice raised his eyes what is that go down at once to hythe and see mona but i dont know her said prelice taken aback although his face grew hot and his heart bounded at the idea of meeting this adorable girl with whom he now knew himself to be in love ill give you a card of introduction tell her that im all right and will be down as soon as i can all right assented prelice feeling a guilty joy in thus yielding to a delightful temptation but the case that can look after itself until the inquest is over then when i have seen mona and her future is settled by martabanher living and income and all that i meanwe can look into matters i am as keen as you are to get at the truth of these two murders dorry we can dispense with horace i wish i knew exactly why he backed out muttered prelice thoughtfully it is so unlike horace to jib perhaps he has something to do with the matter himself seeing that he possessed the sacred herb said shepworth jocularly nonsense horace would kill one man and a dozen men in fair fight but hes not the chap to stick anyone in the back by the way tell me one thing ned this lady who came in with agstone and waved the cup under your nose to make you insensibleshe wore a green mask you said yes and a green domino also prelice nodded did you catch a glimpse of her frock by any chance or did your senses fail you they did not fail me too quickly i did see her frock it was a white dress with thin lines of red running horizontally across it many lines asked prelice breathlessly it seemed to be ruled like a page of music said shepworth why what is the matter matter echoed prelice who had risen and was dancing round the room like a schoolboy what you say gives me a clue i saw that dress at the ball the lady who wore it was scented with tuberoses with tuberoses or with the sacred herb i must find out who she is how can you i dont know i cant say but if we can find her we may learn if she killed agstone and why she did it that discovery will lead to learning who murdered lanwin it is the beginning of the end give up the case indeed cried prelice exultantlywhy its the only thing that renders life in london bearable but do you think that this lady is guilty asked shepworth doubtfully of course i do otherwise why should she be scented with the perfume of the sacred herb which has to do with both crimes shepworth shook his head unable to answer this question chapter xii mrs dolly rover shortly after the reference to the unknown lady lord prelice took a hasty leave there was nothing more to be said as matters up to date had been threshed out thoroughly between them until the inquest had been held on the body of agstone and shepworths immediate future was decided no move could be made towards elucidating the mysteries moreover prelice was mortally afraid lest shepworth should alter his mind about making him ambassador to miss chent at hythe strongwilled as the young man was when he chose to exercise that same will he could not deny himself the pleasure of being in monas company if only for ten minutes besides he very much wished to learn if she truly loved ned for by this time he felt sure that ned had no very deep affection for her in his hurry to catch a train to hythe prelice quite forgot his determination to see mrs rover and learn how matters stood between her and the barrister but the powers that direct the actions of men and the lives that are made by such actions brought about a meeting with the lady almost immediately after shaking hands with the pseudoprisoner prelice left the flat to find mrs rover arguing vehemently with the constable posted at the outer door she wished to enter and see shepworth the constable pursuant to strict orders was trying to point out that his duty lay in stopping her a point which mrs rover obstinately refused to see i wish to enter she kept repeating it is necessary that i should see mr shepworth and will i do instead said prelice suddenly appearing at the open door dorry cried mrs rover giving him the pet name of his youth what are you doing here i am talking to you said the young man shaking hands but just now i have been chatting with ned then why cant i chat with him also demanded the lady prelice shrugged his shoulders ned is allowed to see no one unless inspector bruge gives permission what rubbish let me go in and mrs rover in a flaming temper tried to push past the policeman you cant maam he said firmly and respectfully adding to the pale parlourmaid who still lingered out of sheer curiosity close that door straight away ill report you cried mrs rover when she saw the door practically banged in her angry face all right maam but dooty is dooty constance constance whispered prelice touching her arm dont make an exhibition of yourself before the servants the man is only doing his duty come upstairs and we can have a chat what about demanded mrs rover swiftly and prelice saw or thought he saw a glint of fear in her eyes well he answered smiling i have not had an opportunity of talking to you since i returned to town so it is natural that i should wish for a short conversation mrs rover who apparently was an extremely obstinate woman paused irresolutely looking at the stolid policeman with a battle light in her eyes but the constable met her gaze firmly so finding that feminine persistence could do nothing in the face of an official barrier she turned away biting her lip come upstairs dorry she said beginning to ascend i can do nothing with that fool prelice smiled at this parthian arrow and slipped a florin into the constables hand to pacify him for the parting insult then he ran up after the lady and reached her on the next landing you ought to be pleased constance he said slyly youve had the last word i should like to have had the last halfdozen she retorted putting a yale latchkey into the lock i think that you have even achieved that replied prelice dryly it is extraordinary that women never will learn that the law is stronger than sheer temper i am not in a temper snapped mrs rover sweeping into her flat i never was calmer in my lifenever never never i am quite content to believe that said her companion acidly for as constance newton mrs rover had not been noted for imperturbability it was all the better in prelices opinion that her temperament should be thus fiery as he would discover from her rash tongue much that a more cautious and composed woman would withhold moreover constance and her visitor had been friends for many a long yearwitness her calling him dorryand she was accustomed to speak frankly to him about her troubles had prelice been in england when the stockbroker was courting the lady it is doubtful if constance would ever have become mrs rover and prelice strongly suspected that mr rover found ned shepworth an inconvenient third in his married state you are looking very well constance said prelice when the two were seated in the drawingroom which was more gorgeous than artistic im not well then im nearly worried to death so sorry tell me all about it ill do nothing of the sort i beg your pardon let us chat about the weather do you think that i have time to waste in discussing barometers she rose impetuously dont know im sure replied prelice keeping his temper admirably well then i havent would it do any good if i gave you a thorough shaking yes it would if dolly shook me i should respect him but he lets me lead him the life of a dog and doesnt even bark much less bite i see you prefer a bulldog to a poodle ned isnt a mrs rover stopped in the centre of the room grew red and could have bitten out her tongue for so incautious a speech what rubbish you talk she said trying to smile carelessly prelice looked at her gravely i hope you are talking rubbish too i wish i were dead and buried whispered mrs rover and once more sat down to burst into violent tears expert in the handling of the sex prelice knew better than to offer a single word of consolation he lay back in his chair quietly watching the progress of the storm mrs rover was going through the usual programme of upset woman she had raged now she wept and would shortly be offering an apology for her conduct on the plea of nerves constance had certainly grown into a handsome woman when prelice had left england seven years before she was merely a schoolgirl very gawky and very awkward now she appeared tall majestic and beautiful after the voluptuous style of juno queen of olympus her hair and eyes were dark her features delicate and regular and her figure was finely formed even if a trifle inclined to stoutness as it assuredly was prelice had somewhere seen an old print of catherine ii of russia and it struck him that mrs rover greatly resembled the empress although she was undeniably a more lovely woman it was unfortunate that her face should have been marred by a sullen expression hinting at a superlatively bad temper but many peopleunobservant as most people arenever noted this defect they only saw before their ravished eyes a handsome wellbred graceful woman perfectly dressed and quite able to hold her own in the most exacting society yes constance had improved greatly prelice admitted that but he wished to find out if she possessed the same beauty of character as of person from what he had heard and what he had seen he had grave doubts on this point pray excuse me said mrs rover offering the expected social apology in a faint voice im rather upset my nerves are out of order the season has been trying and then that horrid ball bowled me over with its robberies and murders not to speak of dolly who iswho is oh i dont know what he is do you think it is good taste to discuss your husband with me asked prelice rather tartly you are the only true friend i have in the world dorry then you have made no acquaintances since i left england seven years ago constance oh acquaintances she echoed contemptuously rolling her damp handkerchief into a ball i have hundreds of these but a friendoh dorry there isnt a single person id trust with a shoelace he or she would not thank you if you did replied prelice smiling a shoelace is not good security for anything thats just it wailed mrs rover dabbing her red eyes with the handkerchief people like one for what they can get out of one but there isnt a soul to help mepoor me wont ned asked her companion very deliberately mrs rover darted a keen glance at him and rose to alter the position of her hat in front of the mirror over the fireplace prelice knew quite well that she was watching him in the mirror and carefully smoothed all expression out of his goodhumoured face ned repeated mrs rover patting her back hair oh yes ned of course do you think they will hang him she demanded wheeling round rather white and breathing hard good heavens no what put that into your head he isnt allowed to see me the arrest ned hasnt been arrested the fact that he was seen insensible by heaps of people proves his innocence bruge is simply detaining him as a necessary witness although i admit that bruge is taking a somewhat high hand in the matter dont bother your head about ned constance hell soon be free to marry that girl mona chent mrs rover clenched her hands and breathed still harder while prelice anxiously watched the effect of his deliberate introduction of the name oh yes she went off into a meaningless trill of laughter shes free isnt she lucky girl for i quite believe that she killed her uncle why do you believe that demanded prelice everyone says so everyone does not say so the majority of people think that the verdict is a just one i do myself do you know her no what has that to do with it you wont like her when you do know her said mrs rover spitefully shes a horrid girl i never liked her thats a pity you wont be able to visit neds wife she isnt his wife yet breathed mrs rover trying to keep her temper in check perhaps she never will be oh prelice spoke with calculated daring and cruelty do you then think that mr rover will die you cowardyou she broke off what do you mean by that i would rather you explained constance i have nothing to explain did you come here to insult me of course replied prelice rising and now that i have done so i may as well take my leave she seized him by the lapels of his coat before he could reach the door dont go dont go she panted i do so want a friend ill tell you all you shall know everything if it is against your husband i shant listen you shall sit down and hear what i have to say prelice was a strong young man but for the moment her feminine strength prevailed and he found himself forced into his former seat i wouldnt say what im going to say to everyone panted mrs rover who was very strongly moved but even though we have been apart for so many years i still regard you as my best friend you and i were boy and girl together dorryyou remember ned also interposed prelice pointedly yes yes of course i always loved ned constance what are you saying she rose and beat her hands together the truththe truth i liked you dorry i always liked you but i loved ned and i shall love him until i die she looked like a tragedy queen prelice grew impatient being a very matteroffact young man dont be melodramatic constance sit down and explain quietly with that wonderful adaptability of women at which man never ceases to marvel mrs rover sat down and composed herself with a violent effort when next she spoke it was in so cold and icy a tone that prelice had his eyes been closed could have sworn that another person had joined in the dialogue you know that my father the general was not rich and that my mother was extravagant i was the only child and my parents wished me to make a wealthy marriage so that their affairs might be put right that is my mother wished it for my father dear old man desired me to consult my own heart i did and it told me to marry ned we were half engaged my father was willing in spite of his difficulties but my mother would not consent ned was poor you know he had only five hundred a year of his own and has not yet made a success at the bar then dolly rover came along she stopped and bit her lip while her hands moved restlessly as though boxing her husbands ears what about mr rover asked prelice soothingly then the natural woman came out and she rose in a rage i hate dolly like poison she cried pacing up and down the room twisting her hands together hes a horrid sneaky little cur who dont abuse your husband constance interrupted prelice impatiently it does no good you married him of your own free will i did nothing of the sort i married him to save my father from going through the bankruptcy court it would have broken his heart dear old father and he would have died dolly knew that i hated him and that i loved ned but he demanded his price like the mean dog that he is my mother was on his side too and i could not bear to see my father suffer i parted with ned and married dolly that is i sold myself on condition that fathers debts were paid i kept to my part of the bargain and didnt your husband keep to his no mrs rover stamped violently he paid a portion of the debts enough to avert bankruptcy merely but he left father the worry and of that worry father died my mother has married againa rich manso she is happy and here am i tied to dollyugh the namewhile my heart is breaking for ned it is a hard case said prelice sorry for the miserable woman still your selfrespect constance that is rightpreach preach preach so like a man she mocked i have kept my selfrespect as you term it i am a good wife to dolly although i detest him i have never said a word against him to anyone and i wouldnt to you but that i must speak or suffocate i can trust you dorry and you understand how i feel and what i feel i love ned i want to marry ned and here im tied toto prelice interrupted it is hard on you constance i admit he said but you must make the best of it you say that you lead your husband the life of a dog of a pet dog of a poodle hes so meek and mild and sneaky that i cant respect him he merely sniggers when i grow angry and chuckles how he got the best of me over the marriage by not paying all fathers debts oh what is the use of talking i love ned and ned loves me prelice jumped up i cant believe that he declared growing angry for ned is engaged to miss chent if he loves you why is he dont ask questions interrupted mrs rover angrily or if you must ask them go to ned or better still to mona chent herself what can i ask miss chent demanded prelice sharply its very warm weather mocked mrs rover and i think there will be a thunderstorm the young man looked at her and saw her mouth set obstinately he knew as well as if she had spoken that there was nothing more to be got out of her for the time being but what she had said made him all the more determined to see miss chent and learn the truth about the engagement to shepworth meanwhile he took the wind out of mrs rovers sails by falling in with her humour it will be a good thing if it does thunder and rain he remarked glancing out of the window it will clear the air mrs rover looked as though she would have struck him but being unable to parry his thrust threw herself sulkily on the sofa prelice took up hat and gloves to depart but halted at the door with premeditated craft a sudden thought had struck him constance he said in a natural tone i am in love indeed she said indifferently yes with a lady who was at your ball the remark made her rouse herself and she sat up with a look of curiosity who is she i want you to tell me that i could not see her face and very little of her figure owing to the domino but she seemed to be so charming when we talked togetherthis was a lie to gain informationthat i quite lost my heart its easy lost said mrs rover curling her lip the woman may be as ugly as sin under her mask how was she dressed in a green mask and domino mrs rover stiffened and with a white dress streaked with lines of red velvet why do you laugh he asked for mrs rover was trying to suppress her mirth why she cried shaking with merriment because i wore that dress and mask and domino you prelice looked horrified yes why do you look at me like that you prelice backed to the door in silent horror he could not trust himself to speak and finally disappeared leaving mrs rover petrified with amazement perhaps with dread chapter xiii lanwin grange in the exercise of his profession a legitimate detective would have waited to question mrs rover since she had said so much he would have forced her to say all in order to get at the truth as speedily as possible but lord prelice was new to the business and his emotions were not entirely under control on leaving alexander mansions he felt that he was in possession of a most dangerous and perilous secret the publication of which would cause even a greater sensation than that produced by the crimes themselves the shock of learning that mrs rover was the woman who had been brought by agstone into number forty was very great and quite confused prelices usually strong brain he did not dare to call again on shepworth lest he should say too much it will be seen that prelice being an untrained detective jumped somewhat hastily to a conclusion mrs rover had admitted that she wore the dress the mask and the domino which shepworth had seen on the unknown lady but constance did not know that ned had so described her appearance and if she had would probably not have admitted that she had assumed such a costume at her bal masque but the mere fact that even in ignorance of shepworths description she had as the saying goes given herself away should have proved to lord prelice that she could not be guilty had mrs rover entered number forty in agstones company and had she struck the blow she assuredly would not have incriminated herself so unthinkingly rather would she have denied that the frock mentioned by prelice belonged to her after the first shock and while prelice was in the train going to hythe he began to revise his earlier opinion on the abovementioned grounds his commonsense came to his aid and told him that if guilty mrs rover would not have confessed even to a halftruth certainly had she not done so her maid knowing what dress her mistress wore at the ball might have blurted out the secret but then so far as the world knew no inquiry would have been made about the wearer of that especial frock of course assuming that in a thoughtless moment mrs rover had foolishly confessed the truth prelice could find a motive for her behaviour in committing the crime it might be that agstone wished to kill ned and that mrs rover to save the life of the man she loved had struck down the sailor unawares having committed the deed she could easily slip back to her own flat and mingle with the masked crowd but then again as prelice further argued while the train drew near to the coast mrs rover must have known that in murdering agstone she was not only securing the freedom of mona chent whom she hated but also was placing her lover in a dangerous position agstone was a necessary witness for the prosecution whom shepworth of all men did not wish to see placed in the box so the supposition would be were the man found dead in number forty that shepworth had killed him to save mona chent as a matter of fact this is exactly what had taken place and in saving ned from the sailors knife mrs rover always presuming that she was guilty had simply condemned her lover to a death on the scaffold but that prelice had been clever enough to admit the crowd of guests so that all might see the barristers helpless position it is certain that the man would have been arrested and probably sentenced to death since it would have been extraordinarily difficult for him to clear his character in the face of circumstances therefore on these assumptions for that they were and no more prelice after much reflection decided that mrs rover was innocent finally the young man recollected that a woman dressed as described by ned and in the costume which mrs rover confessed to wearing had passed down the stairs while he was waiting for entrance to number forty and immediately before the discovery of the crime she could scarcely have been mrs rover for as that lady could have easily proved an alibi by returning to her guests and casually unmasking at the right moment it would have been useless for her to leave the mansions of course the ladywhether mrs rover or a strangercertainly might have followed prelice down to the door knowing that he would be certain to discover the tragedy and might merely have descended to return to the ballroom overhead when the young man entered shepworths flat but then again the person in question could not have known that prelice masked and unknown was going to enter number forty so there would be no reason to track him there and to conclude the murderessif a woman was guiltymust have known that shepworth being in a cataleptic state must have seen and remembered her very peculiar frock on the whole prelice arrived at certain conclusions by no means inimical to mrs rover by the time he alighted at hythe station he believed that constance was innocent for four reasons firstly if guilty she would not have confessed to wearing the dress since such a confession would necessarily lead to her detection secondly by killing agstone she would not only have placed shepworth in a dangerous position but by getting rid of an inconvenient witness would have enabled mona to escape possible condemnation thirdly she would not have followed an unknown manas prelice was by reason of his mask and dominodown the stairs with the intention of seeing what took place fourthly and lastly she would not have sought safety in an incriminating flightas the similarly dressed woman on the stairs apparently hadwhen she would have been much safer in her own ballroom and amongst her own guests only by such a course could she have provided an alibi no mrs rover in spite of her startling admission was innocent and the sole conclusion that prelice could arrive at was the existence of a doubleoutwardly at all events he remembered the extraordinary ubiquity of the green domino in the redstreaked white dress and decided very naturally that there was another woman in the field but what woman possessed a motive sufficiently strong to urge her to murder agstone as prelice felt quite worn out with arguing in mrs rovers defence he decided to leave the answering of this new question to the portentous moment when further evidence might reveal the identity of the unknown lady meanwhile on arriving at hythe he rested himself at a quiet hotel and soothed his troubled brain with an hours necessary sleep later on after an invigorating bath and an excellent dinner he started to walk towards lanwin grange it was summer and romance was in the airat least prelice scented its presence by some sixth sense he was going to see the girl he lovedthe girl with whom he had not as yet exchanged a single word therefore although past the peacock age he was particularly attentive to his appearance when assuming his evening clothes as he strolled inland along the leafy lanes through the july warmth of the twilight this somewhat premature wooer looked as comely and well groomed a swain as any damsel not demanding an apollo could desire and it was a great proof of prelices infatuation that in looking forward to meeting mona he almost forgot that he was merely the emissary of the man to whom the girl was engaged the whole position was extraordinarily queer he adored this girl without being personally acquainted with her she was affianced to his best friend and yet he could not be certain if that same best friend really loved the girl herself even a palais royal farce could offer no more fantastic complication than this prelice felt that after running round the wild world in search of the unusual he had returned to find romance sitting on his doorstep the way to the family seat of the lanwins twisted inland and uphill through deep lanes and umbrageous woods on emerging high up from the belt of trees prelice found himself on a wide unshaded road snaking over bare downs for some distance he toiled upward then the road mounted a rise to slip down into a cupshaped hollow brimmed with cultivated woods in the midst of these he saw an old grey house seemingly prevented from falling to pieces by the ivy which covered its mouldering walls from the lips of the hollow stretched the rolling grassy downs dotted with nibbling sheep grey in the shadows of the coming night but it was not yet night for the sky was filled with a luminous light allpervading yet emanating from no certain point a breathless peace brooded over the vast treeless uplands and an even deeper peace seemed to enwrap the ancient mansion it appeared to be the veritable palace of the sleeping beauty set amidst enchanted woods and prelice thrilled with the idea that beauty herself awake and unkissed awaited some prince in the seclusion of her faery castle following the road which here grew somewhat narrower lord prelice descended into the hollow passed under the shade of overhanging trees and came out into a kind of artificial glade smooth with carefully tended lawns and brilliant with flowers the grange itself was somewhat sunken in the ground entirely level with the lawns and looked like part of the woods themselves so clothed was it with darkly green ivy there appeared a weatherworn escutcheon over the great doorway and lights gleamed from oriel windows in the east wing but to the left prelice saw the three tall french windows opening on to a wide terrace which had been referred to at the trial these windows appeared quite out of keeping with the tudor architecture of the mansion but the visitor eyed them with great interest it was through one of those windows that agstone and jadby had looked to see the tragedy of sir olivers death and had that not taken place prelice might never have been brought into contact with the most charming girl in the world his heart beat loudly as he rang the bell afterwards lord prelice never could explain clearly how he had first come into the presence of his goddess in a bewildered manner he waited in the antique hall after delivering his card to a pompous footman and in a bewildered manner was led into a long low wide drawingroom with oriels at the farther end brilliant with family crests in stained glass so far as he could recollect he did not look at the cumbersome georgian furniture or at the aggressively modern grand piano which seemed to be out of place or at the portraits of cavaliers and their ladies decking the mellowhued walls or even at the painted ceiling or the carpet tinted with rainbow colours subdued by time to grateful sobriety he had no eyes save for a tall slim girl arrayed in a white dress with a somewhat pale worn face who welcomed him in the sweetest of voices and with the most grateful of smiles i am glad to see neds best friend she said and her voice sounded like faery music in the newcomers ravished ears and to thank him to thank me muttered prelice staring at the lovely face in the mellow lamplight i saw you in that terrible court she said swiftly and the way in which you looked at me gave me comfort other peoplemy friends they call themselvesstared as though i were a wild animal but you lord prelice she threw out her hands with an eloquent gesture full of grace ned wrote and told me that you were his friend i am here to be yours also stuttered prelice suppressing a wild desire to kneel and worship we are friends already it does not need words to confirm a friendship offered and accepted mutely and with gratitude prelice felt more bewildered than ever here was a girl so entirely unconventional that she defied the usages of society which prescribed the etiquette for a primary meeting between bachelor and maid it was marvellously sweet to be thus greeted but prelice must have revealed his delighted surprise too clearly for miss chent laughed i am afraid that my proffer of unaskedfor friendship surprises you she said smilingly but you see my poor uncle instructed me somewhat in psychology and i look at the inner rather than the outer you said yourself miss chent that the friendship was asked for in court said prelice earnestly and it was as neds best friend i claim to be yours also i bring a message from ned you shall deliver it presently said mona turning to a stout whitehaired gentleman with a genial face who was standing near the window silently just now you must allow me to introduce mr martaban another loyal friend also she waved her hand towards a spindlelegged versailles table as the two men shook hands you must have some coffee prelice accepted gratefully as he would have taken poison from the hands of this delightful girl so long as she served it as she did the coffee with her own white hands martaban took a cup also and resumed the seat from which he had arisen when prelice entered miss chent pointed out a chair to her visitor and herself reclined on a louis treize sofa then the three began to talk on immediate and earthly matters and prelice was forced to descend from transcendental heights in that room at that hour and in the presence of such an angel it seemed desperately hard to abandon romance for reality but there was no help for it neds message questioned mona anxiously he is all right and will be down as soon as he can get away replied the emissary delivering the exact words of his friend then you dont think that he is in danger of being accused of this second crime no no interposed martaban in a genial but authoritative voice i have told you before and i tell you again that under the circumstances no one can accuse mr shepworth and that added the solicitor bowing towards the young man is due my lord to your wise action in admitting the crowd to see mr shepworth insensible prelice nodded his thanks ned is perfectly safe he said quietly mona clasped her hands with a thankful gesture i am so gladi am so thankful she whispered softly he has been a dear good friend in standing by me when i so sadly needed help oh prelice was rather indignant seeing that he is something more than a friend to you miss chent he could scarcely fail to lay himself and his life at your feet it is only what an english gentleman would do to any lady he respected much less loved mona coloured and turned aside her face rather embarrassed by the impetuous outbreak of her lovers friend both english gentlemen and english ladies held aloof when i was in danger she said simply so you can understand how much i prize the friendship both of ned and of mr martaban here seeing that they never believed that i was guilty no one could believe that cried prelice still impetuous and throwing his usual discretion to the winds the moment i set eyes on your face i knew that you were innocent miss chent coloured again and rather retreated from the confidential attitude she had assumed prelice was going ahead too fast and her womanly nature in spite of occult training was taking alarm i must say that seeing you did not know me the belief was somewhat rash she rejoined coldly however i thank you and you will allow me to help you asked prelice eagerly but timidly help miss chent said the lawyer looking keenly at the young mans glowing face in what way prelice laid down his cup crossed his legs and delivered himself of his opinion it was just as well that both mona and martaban should learn of his determination to enter into their lives everyone is delighted with few exceptions he said somewhat incoherently to the girl that you have been acquitted but some insist that you must be guilty forgive me for inflicting pain he added rapidly but it is necessary so that you may entirely understand me you are safe from the law miss chent but with some idiots your character is not yet clear also ned in spite of the absurdity of the thing may be accused of making away with steve agstone in your interests in order to set everything right it is necessary for us to make certain who killed your uncle and who killed the sailor but agstone killed sir oliver said martaban quickly the evidence of the papercutter which quite so quite so interrupted lord prelice hurriedly and skating quickly over this thin ice but we cant prove agstones guilt beyond all doubt without further evidence for miss chents sake the truthwhatever it may bemust be made public and what do you think is the truth demanded martaban puzzled prelice bearing mrs rover in mind shuffled again i am not prepared to give an opinion offhand he replied politely but what i wish you and miss chent to understand is that ned shepworth has accepted my services towards hunting down the author or authors of this double crime i wish miss chent if she will to accept them also willingly and with gratitude said mona extending her slim hand prelice contrived to press it in a friendly way and not kiss it as he felt strongly inclined to do but the effort was great then we can go ahead he said easily and as i am now admitted to the inner circle as it were i should like to know exactly how matters stand about you miss chent for instance do you remain here the girl flushed and glanced rather embarrassed at her lawyer yes replied the latter captain jadby who undoubtedly inherits now that the second will has been destroyed has made no move towards assuming possession of his property moreover there are certain legal formalities to be gone through before he can become the legitimate master of the grange until everything is straight i suggest that miss chent remains in her home it is not my home but captain jadbys answered the girl colouring painfully i would much rather go away but she added piteously yet with a proud effort of selfrestraint i have nowhere to go to uncle oliver has disinherited me and my parents died insolvent if i leave the grange i go into the world penniless and alone prelice winced at the picture she drew there is always ned he remarked lamely miss ghent shot a swift glance at his distressed face and answered coldly in his own words yes there is always ned the young man felt more puzzled than ever her voice did not sound like that of a girl in love and as he had gathered from constance the man mona was engaged to had not given her his heart but if this was the caseand it was beginning to appear obviouswhy had the two agreed to marry prelice did not know what to say so miss chent seeing his embarrassment explained in a somewhat embarrassed fashion herself ned is poor she remarked with deliberate selfcontrol he has his way to make in the world it would never do for me to burden him with a pauper wife two are stronger than one miss chent there is strength in unity not in this case she retorted and quietly dismissed the subject will you come to my house my dear said martaban who seemed to be devoted to his luckless client my wife will be glad to have you so will aunt sophia interposed prelice quickly and struck with a brilliant idea you know my aunt miss chent lady sophia haken she is a friend of yours save yourself mr martaban and ned i have had no friend since i was put on my trial for murder said mona in a level voice i decline to trouble any person until my innocence is proved it has been proved at the trial said prelice and mr martaban echoed the speech legally but not socially she rejoined rising i accept your services lord prelice learn who killed my uncle and who stabbed poor agstone and earn she falteredand earn mymy gratitude prelice looked disappointed yet what else could the girl say chapter xiv mrs blexeys opinion despite the threatening clouds on the horizon which hinted at coming trouble the days passed very quietly at the grange as an elderly male chaperon mr martaban remained to look after his client and the very respectable mrs blexey was also useful in this necessary capacity prelice unable to tear himself away from the too dangerous society of monaand dangerous it was considering his feelings and her engagement to nedlingered at the hythe hotel shepworth strange to say did not put in an appearance its odd remarked prelice when strolling over the lawns on the third day of his arrival its odd that ned doesnt come down he put the observation in the form of a query and so mona who strolled beside him was forced to reply but she did so unwillingly and as briefly as was possible very odd she said indifferently lord prelice cast a puzzled side glance at her beautiful face which looked ethereal and rosy under a red sunshade even as yet he could not understand what were her feelings towards his friend and as he was more in love than ever the situation was perplexing from its very vagueness in sheer desperation he tried to make her talk of ned which she did very rarely by continuing the topic ned said the young man eyeing the trees the lawns the sky and the house with a fine affectation of indifference ned has been acquitted at the inquest and the jury gave a verdict of wilful murder against some person or persons unknown in the orthodox style agstone has been buried and here am i waiting for an interview with ned to settle some course of action towards elucidating these criminal problems yet he has not come down and has not even replied to my letter miss chent shifted her sunshade from one shoulder to the other i expect hell come down when he is ready said she calmly oh jerusalem excuse the swearword miss chent but if i were ned i should have come here ages ago you did lord prelice but if you are so anxious to interview nedand i quite admit the necessitywhy not go up to london her companion wriggled uneasily and searched his brains for an excuse to remain in his uncomfortable paradise well you seeerthat is my dear young lady i amto put it plainlyermy aunt you know lady sophia is coming to folkstone she arrived there last night lord prelice ehwhatyou donteryou dont say so mona laughed and the young man was glad to hear her laugh she gave way rarely to merriment during the undecided present why did you write about me to lady sophia asked the girl gently i prelice was quite prepared to lie but decided not to when he saw the expression of her face well you seethat is you understandthat an aunt is an aunt i never thought that she was an uncle course not but there you see my aunt expected me to write and i have written you neednt have made me the subjectmatter of your letter who said that i did asked prelice growing scarlet lady sophia herself i received a note from her this morning and considering my position a very kind note it seems that you wrote asking her to stand by me and she has come to folkstone to do so loud cheers cried prelice shamelessly i always thought that aunt sophia was a brick she never believed you were guilty you know he went on confusedly said all manner of nice things about you to me whenever we met now shell take you under her wing and make things hot for any society fool that dares to say a word against you why do you do this for me lord prelice asked mona in rather a faltering tone and averting her toospeaking face i amthat iswellneds friend you know oh monas voice became steady and she turned to look at him squarely so you enlist your aunt on my behalf for neds sake was there ever such a perplexing girl a moment ago and she seemed pleased at being championed by lady sophia now her looks and her voice were cold prelice in sheer desperation blurted out the truth in a blundering manner a little bit for my own sake also i am glad of that are you this time it was the young mans voice which became unsteady for he did not know whether he was on his head or his heels thats all right a sentiment of honour towards the absent shepworth who would not look after his own interests made him end thus lamely mona laughed again and was as enigmatic as the sphinx it is extremely good of you lord prelice she went on in a guarded manner lady sophia can help me greatly to recover my position in society you have never lost it blurted out prelice crossly i did lose it and i have lost it she answered sadly and i shall never recover it entirely until the murderer of my uncle is discovered lady sophia who really likes me loves you loves you no no she likes me let us say that she has an affection for me that is a greatlytobeappreciated state of mind for one woman to be in towards another thats rather a german sentence isnt it i dont know what you mean muttered prelice beginning to find out that after all his experiences in the four quarters of the globe he was but a neophyte where women were concerned i mean that lady sophias liking or affection for me will do a great deal to rehabilitate me but that the punishment of uncle olivers assassin will do more and your marriage with ned will do most of all mona mocked him marriage covers a multitude of sins doesnt it prelice clutched his head but his hair was too closely cropped for him to grip im to be best man he said feebly and found a delight in torturing himself oh has ned selected you for that post he did when we were at eton i see then he was engaged when at eton how precocious the young man groaned and glanced at her despairingly quite unable to understand her moods lately she had been sad now her eyes were dancing with merriment i am glad you are happy he said in a surly tone for this mystery of her engagement tortured him i am she assented swiftly and for three reasons may i hear them certainly in the first place you and ned will find out who killed my uncle and poor old steve so as to clear my character in the second place lady sophia is coming over today and thus begins the necessary whitewashing for me to reenter the world and in the third place she ended seriously throughout all this trouble i have had a firm conviction that god would help me he has helped me by saving my life from a legal death and he will help me to clear my character some dayperhaps in the near futurethere wont be a single stain on my name now dont speak she held up her hand you are about to say that there is not a stain now but there is to remove it i trust in god first and in you second what about ned asked prelice restlessly oh in ned also she rejoined and looked at him quietly as he made no observationand he could not out of sheer perplexityshe turned on her louis quinze heel i am going in to get ready for the visit of lady sophia she said abruptly prelice watched the red sunshade vanish into the house then dug his stick into the turf and swore volubly he had a considerable command of language in this respect but rarely exercised his vocabulary on this occasion he did since ordinary words failed to soothe him and even as it was swearing did little good so prelice started to walk violently and aimlessly only desirous of restoring his temper to its usual state of cynical calm by abnormal exercise he could not make monaas he called her mentallyout in any way whatsoever she was certainly engaged to ned and yet she spoke of him quite unemotionally as she would have done ofwell not of an acquaintance perhaps but of a friend she could not possibly love him and if she did not should certainly not be engaged to him ned had no money and no position so she assuredly could not be seeking to better herself by the marriage certainly gratitude might induce her to become his wife since he had stood by her but thenand here prelice swore againshe had been engaged to him some time before the death of sir oliver and when no gratitude could possibly have entered into her acceptance and if she was merely grateful ned would not marry her on that account especially since on the authority of mrs rover he loved another woman for the third time prelice swore over the problem and determined to throw all delicacy to the winds so far as shepworth was concerned the moment ned arrived at the grange he would ask him plainly what he meant and what she meant and what the whole infernal complication meant it was quite impossible that a young aristocrat with a large income and a healthy frame and a loving heart should sit on thorns any longer blanketyblanketyblank raged prelice and looked up on hearing an exclamation of horror at his elbow his aimless walk had led him to the kitchen garden and to a bed of potherbs which mrs blexey was laboriously picking being stout and like hamlet scant of breath the housekeeper wheezed like a creaky wheel as she stooped to gather some sage and thyme but she retained enough breath to cry out with horror when hearing this handsome young gentleman swearingas she afterwards described itlike the late mr blexey who had been a skipper of renown in the way of bad language i beg your pardon said prelice showing his white teeth in a smile which won mrs blexeys heart im a little put out didnt know any lady was within earshot bless you my lord im not a lady and never laid claim to be one so swearing though not proper dont worrit me overmuch it calls back old times sir really did you swear yourself me mrs blexey looked indignant why i belong to the united inhabitants of the celestial regions what its my religion said mrs blexey simply what you might call my sect my lord theres very few of us but we all go to heaven theres nothing like being certain of your destination said prelice dryly and was about to move on when the housekeeper stopped him your pardin my lord but ive been trying to catch your eyes ever since you came here but never managed it till now in a kitchen garden too ended mrs blexey mournfully which dont seem to be the place for a lord of high degree to speak in it suited him to swear in it however murmured prelice frivolously then added in louder tones what do you wish to speak to me about not about him that is gone remarked mrs blexey referring to her lost spouse though his languagebegging your lordships pardinwas as like yours as beanpods and because of such talk hell never come backnever them as has him will keep him indeed are theywhomsoever they may befond of him i dont think so my lord you see heswell hes dead my lord prelice put up his hand to twirl his moustache and hide a smile then you think that im sorry for blexey interrupted the housekeeper firmly but he didnt belong to the united inhabitants of the celestial regions so he she pointed stealthily downward let us hope it is not so bad as that said prelice choking with suppressed laughter you wish to speak to me he repeated politely to catch your lordships eyes as it were that has been accomplished what next mrs blexey groaned and made an effort its about miss mona the young mans merriment died away and he looked keenly at the redfaced shapeless old woman whats that he demanded in the imperious tone which formerly he had used towards recalcitrant soldiers mrs blexey being timid dropped with a thud on to the sage and thyme and placed a podgy hand on her ample breast gasping like a fish out of water the heart my lordmothers sideit aint strong if your lordship would speak less like a gun going off certainly interrupted prelice in his most silky tones what have you to tell me about miss mona it aint about her exactly my lord but theres the will you know and that madame eppingrave as she called herself though i dont believe it is her name for all her airs and graces and she nearly as old as me and as stout too for all her tight lacing prelice leaning against the mellow brick wall where the nectarines grew stared at the fat woman who was still prostrate amidst the herbs if you knew of such things mrs blexey why didnt you explain in court because i dont believe in courts or in them as is in courts said mrs blexey fanning herself with a pink sunbonnet they got me to give what they called evidence and say things against my dear pretty miss mona i nursed her sir i was born in the grange and have served the lanwins all my life when mrs chent went away with her husband i followed and when she and him died i came back here with miss mona as sir oliver wished to be the housekeeper prelice nodded sympathetically i know that you are devoted to miss mona he said approving of this devotion you are too my lord aint you asked the old woman pointedly the young man grew as red as the brick wall against which he was leaning but mrs blexey seeing this sign of anger went on hastily i dont mean boldness my lord indeed i dont but miss mona does need a friend sadly my lord and she tells me that you are one i am said prelice firmly and flushing again and i am glad that she spoke thus of me but about this madame marie eppingrave i never liked her my lord an oily flatterer she was with a gimblet eye and a buttery tongue she was always trying to get the better of sir oliver and gave him that nasty thing that made the smoke prelice naturally looked startled why sir oliver brought the herb from easter island himselfat least i fancy he did i dont my lord and whats more he didnt i went into the library to ask master what hed have for dinner and madame eppingraveif that is her name the old bagoragswas showing master a lot of dry stems and purple leaves and talking about trances and suchlike rubbish that was just a week before sir olivers death what do you make of that mrs blexey asked prelice thoughtfully i dont make anything of it sir but it was strange that the nasty smoky weeds she gave master should bring about his death madame marie had no reason to wish sir oliver dead oh no my lord why she lost a good friend in him and often must have desired him to be alive and kicking all the same sir she gave him them withered leaves and through them master came by his end prelice nodded absently he required time to think over the matter and turned away to be alone then a thought struck him and he returned to the housekeeper what about the will he demanded it wasnt burnt you must be mistaken the court much them lawyers knew about it cried mrs blexey struggling to her feet i never said it to them because they said as it would help miss mona to get out of their nasty clutches if the will was proved to be burnt so i said what i was told for miss monas sake but sir oliver was writing out another will how do you know asked prelice sharply and much disturbed i saw him writing it said mrs blexey firmly it was never signed to my knowledge but you can take my word for it my lord that the unsigned will was burnt and that miss mona is entitled by the other to the property chapter xv jadby plays a card mrs blexeys communications certainly afforded lord prelice ample food for reflection what she had said about madame marieas the young man mentally termed herimplied that the fortuneteller was somehow implicated in the tragedy of sir olivers death yet he had been a good friend to the lady and by his death she lost a valuable client it was impossible to think that she had killed the baronet herself or had been a consenting party to his death but undoubtedly according to mrs blexeys firm asseveration she had given lanwin the roots and leaves of the sacred herb and from using these in the prescribed way to induce a trance sir oliver had been rendered helpless had he not been chained hand and foot by the fumes of the herb he could not have been killed as in spite of his lost leg he was no despicable antagonist the herb therefore was the main factor in the tragedy and madame marie had placed the same in the mans hands of course it was just possible that someonename unknownhad found sir oliver helpless and so had taken the opportunity to kill him madame marie may have discovered the guilty person and to recompense her for the loss of a wealthy friend had been bribed by the same person to silence this pointed to the guilt of captain jadby who might have been anxious to get rid of the baronet so as to enter into his heritage but the assertion of the housekeeper about the new unsigned will went far to show that the sailor was innocent captain jadby assuredly would have destroyed the will which gave the property to mona and not an unsigned document which mattered nothing to him much puzzled by the new aspect of the case prelice sought out mr martaban and related what he had heard in the kitchen garden the solicitor at first scoffed at the idea of the unsigned will being destroyed but later cautiously ventured the remark that there might be something in it though mind you he remarked thoughtfully mrs blexey does not prove her case as we say in legal circles she states that sir oliver made a new will in his own handwriting but she cannot prove that this was the particular will which was burnt but sir olivers handwriting would be recognised urged prelice it was replied martaban tersely the will leaving the property to miss chent was in my late clients handwriting also he always preferred to write out his own testaments to draw them up you mean not in this especial instance my lord the will leaving all to captain jadby and made in the south seas years ago is a personal document since i have seen it the unsigned will also was personal as so far as i know sir oliver did not employ any lawyer to draw it but i drew out the document by which miss chent inherited and sir oliver copied it himself and had it signed by mrs blexey and agstone so you see that we cant actually say which will was burnt as there is not sufficient remaining of the document from some of the scraps found which alluded to miss chent as my dear niece it would seem that the will in her favour must have been destroyed since sir oliver when angered would not have spoken kindly of her in the document alluded to by mrs blexey prelice nodded absently i presume that the new will would also have been signed by mrs blexey and agstone as witnesses i think so since sir oliver trusted both but according to the housekeeper the will was not witnessed for all we know it may not even have been signed mrs blexey says that it wasnt i think she is right said martaban thoughtfully since the testator has to sign in the presence of the witnesses and mrs blexey would probably have been one what about captain jadby he was absent on many occasions and had he signed as a witness he would not have benefited madame marie eppingrave humph martaban considered she and agstone might have signed certainly but in that case she would have come forward to state to whom the new will left the property it could not have been jadby since the old will held good if the second was destroyed madame marie may have been bribed by jadby to hold her tongue about the third will so that the first could stand which points to the fact that the second must have been destroyed yet mrs blexey says that it was not i agree admitted prelice but as you say she does not prove her case martaban nodded the sole way in which the case can be proved is by the production of the second will or of the third remarked prelice quietly the assassin of sir oliver burnt one willwe know not whichand holds the other he will produce it when he is ready and so lay himself open to arrest ended martaban neatly he paused and went on deliberately i advise a waiting game a waiting game martaban nodded let the other side move first do you mean captain jadby asked prelice abruptly and this unknown assassin who holds one of the last two wills jadby we know retains the first which gives the property to him he will probably come down to insist upon his rights i shall refuse to let him have the grange or the income until the other wills are proved to be destroyed or at least until he proves that the burnt will is the one giving the property to miss chent that was proved at the trial quite so but mrs blexeys story requires that the case should be reopened not for the trial of miss chent cried prelice in alarm martaban laughed heartily you can make yourself easy on that score my lord no one can be tried twice for the same offence well i agree with you that it is best to wait and see what jadby does and then we can checkmate him as you suggest meanwhile i shall go to london and call on madame marie in new bond street she may know of something likely to elucidate the mystery of the lanwin grange crime if she does said martaban with a chuckle she certainly will not speak out a clever woman madame marie i can deal with clever women said prelice rather conceitedly deal with miss chent then finished the lawyer and the conversation ended for the time being it was all very well for martaban to suggest dealing with mona but that young lady was much too feminine for prelice to tackle he could make nothing of her sometimes she was kindness itself to him and then she would hold him at arms length with freezing politeness even as yet he could not determine her relations to ned otherwise than that an official engagement existed she gave him no chance of learning the exact truth when he praised ned she would assent cordially to the most enthusiastic eulogiums and yet when he hintedand being in love he could not help hintingthat ned did not behave as a lover should she entirely agreed in desperation he would have spoken to her about constance rover but a feeling of loyalty to his absent friend prevented his doing this once or twice prelice determined to leave for london and wash his hands of all these mysteries of which miss chent was not the least but he was so deeply in love that awkward as the position was he could not tear himself away yet like a true gentleman prelice never revealed by word or deed or even look that he was at monas feet it was with a feeling of relief that prelice came one day to the grange and found lady sophia officially established as monas friend all day long the young man had been walking off his feelings on the downs trying by violent exercise to calm his agitated nerves he tore along at top speed for miles cursing himself for a fool in submitting to be lured by a willothewisp since seeing how matters stood between mona and ned he could not hope to make the girl lady prelice but however far he went the loadstone of the grange magnetised by miss chents mere presence always drew him back to her dainty feet there to sigh hopelessly for the moon on this occasion he arrived back to afternoon tea and was greeted effusively in the drawingroom by his aunt though i cant say that you look well prelice said lady sophia putting up her lorgnette what have you been doing with yourself late hours and indigestible suppers no doubt ask miss chent replied prelice somewhat sulkily she knows what a rake i am mona who was presiding over a wellprovided teatable glanced at the dark circles under the young mans eyes at his lack of colour and noted his cross looks the survey for some reason appeared to give her a large amount of satisfaction i dont know lord prelices character she observed demurely hes a dormousealways asleep said lady sophia sipping her tea so ned told me and his nickname also but hes a very energetic dormouse surely in exploring the world as he has done humph it would be much better if he stayed at home and married prelice could not stand this observation in monas presence that is entirely a personal matter aunt sophia he snapped not at all answered the lady coolly as you are the head of the house its members should have some say in your marriage unless you marry a nice girl i shant call on her have some more tea lord prelice said mona sorry to see how very annoyed he was yet secretly pleased heaven knows for what reason thank you he passed his cup i am glad to see you aunt sophia and surprised he ended with emphasis lady sophia put up her lorgnette again one is always surprised to find virtue in unexpected places she remarked coolly i plagiarise that from molire my dear yes i am virtuous coming over into these wilds on a hot day and i want the reward of my virtue what reward do you want asked prelice gruffly the right to look after this dear girl lady sophia patted monas arm i propose that she shall come abroad with me for a few months then next year we can return and i can present her again at court i never believed the rubbish that people talked my sweetest mona so you can safely trust yourself under my wing i shall be delighted said mona giving the elder ladys arm a little affectionate squeeze but dont you think i ought to remain here until the truth is found out you silly child the truth has positively been shouted from the housetops everyone knows that you are innocentnot added lady sophia in her usual inconsequent fashion that i should blame you if you were guilty i never liked sir oliver he was very kind to me said mona impetuously he meant well that condemns him people one doesnt like always mean well however hes dead so well say no more about him but youll come to germany with me my dear im going to some badi cant tell you the name exactlyits too long and sounds too much like swearing but its a new bad that has to do with the new disease and have you got the new disease aunt sophia i never was healthier in my life my dear boy but theres a cave near this bad with bones and skulls of the stone age i want to see what like the poor dear things were in those happy times they wont look pretty as merely bones said prelice dryly perhaps not only dogs like bones but i daresay there will be some dear little axes with which they cut off the heads of animals that lived before the flood and beads too perhaps fancy beads it brings the poor dear things so near to us to think they wore beads while lady sophia rattled on thus talking about everyone and everything to set mona at her ease the girl herself was listening i hear a fly she said starting to her feet expectantly where asked lady sophia looking up at the ceiling what sharp ears you must have child hark miss chent walked to the drawingroom door opened it and passed through a moment later they heard her voice raised in joyful welcome and prelice tried hard to suppress his jealousy he did not need lady sophia to tell him that it was that shepworth man all the same he contrived to be fairly amiable when ned entered with greetings how do you do lady sophia dorry i am glad to see you what a hot day it has been thank you mona i shall be glad to have a cup of tea prelice stared as ned sat down in a comfortable chair near miss chent for he could not understand shepworth who had so lately escaped peril chatting in this silly fashion the barrister did not look well either as his face was pale and his eyes sunken i expected you down here before growled prelice after a pause i could not get down rattled on ned stirring his tea another lump of sugar please mona there was much to do but now that agstone has been buried and my character cleared i have come down to circumvent our friend captain jadby mona started nervously oh ned is there anything wrong not at present but jadby will try and put things wrong he will be here in a quarter of an hour here mona rose in dismay are you sure shepworth nodded and cast a hasty glance at prelice he came to me yesterday and said that he was coming down to see you for a certain purpose as prelice is here and i know very well what jadby wants to say i thought it best to come down too by watching at the station i found what train he was going by and nipped in also at hythe i secured the only fly and so have got ahead of him shepworth glanced at his watch hell soon be here and then he paused and then queried lady sophia astonished bless me mr shepworth what then how mysterious you are you surprise me captain jadby will surprise you more rejoined shepworth dryly and so i am glad that you are here dorry why demanded that young gentleman who was as astonished as his aunt shepworth merely nodded mysteriously and whispered to mona who nodded in reply with very bright eyes and with another glance at the puzzled prelice he could not understand even in the presence of the engaged couple if they really were in love shepworth was certainly attentive and mona was extremely amiable but there was something wanting in their behaviour they had not kissed for one thing as engaged lovers surely would do but perhaps that sign of future marriage had taken place in the hall lady sophia also puzzled would have asked questions which her more diffident nephew was afraid to put but that the footman brought in a card captain jadby said mona reading the same ned must i see him it will be as well rejoined shepworth significantly and in the presence of martaban he has gone out for a walk and wont be back for some time explained the girl nervously but i feel safe with you and lord prelice why with me prelice asked when the footman departed to usher in the south sea sailor you are always so kind she observed in a low voice and cast down her eyes blushing scarlet much to prelices amazement he really did not know what to make of all this but monas sudden colour ebbed from her cheeks when captain jadby entered for she appeared to be rather afraid of the buccaneer jadby halting and bowing on the threshold did look rather lawless in spite of his civilised flannel garb he had arrayed himself in white and wore a scarlet cummerbund and a scarlet tie these touches of too vivid colour added to his smooth dark face with fiery black eyes and curly black hair and general hint at foreign blood bespoke him the buccaneer from the fringes of the empire his manners also left something to be desired for after bowing to lady sophia and miss chent and greeting prelice with a sullen nod he turned towards shepworth then his eyes flashed and his mouth grew hard you have stolen a march on me he declared coming forward as you see replied shepworth very coolly after what you told me yesterday it was necessary i wonder that you are not afraid to come said jadby sneering viciously why should mr shepworth be afraid demanded mona catching at lady sophias hand to keep up her courage ask him snarled the captain posing picturesquely why should you be afraid mona reiterated turning to her lover captain jadby can explain replied shepworth suavely and may i suggest said prelice politely that in explaining captain jadby might remember that there are two ladies present the buccaneer shrugged his shoulders and pointedly turned his back on prelice a rudeness which that young gentleman noted carefully intending to rebuke jadby later for the same you are i understand miss chent engaged to mr shepworth he said to mona insolently she glanced at shepworth but kept her temper everyone knows that news it is common property and i love you he went on steadily rather a public place to speak like that to me captain jadby i am true to you and he pointing to shepworth is false he loves another woman and i forbid you to mention that womans name cried shepworth meaningly then you admit it cried the sailor triumphantly he does said mona unexpectedly because i know it what jadby recoiled in dismay his thunderbolt had fallen and failed my engagement pursued miss chent is merely official chapter xvi dr horace intervenes in the dead silence which followed monas enigmatic announcement a pin could have been heard to drop prelices head was whirling here at last was the explanation and he would now know the true relationship between the girl he loved and ned who apparently cared nothing for her shepworth stood quietly beside miss chent with a perfectly calm face but his eyes were fixed threateningly on captain jadby who appeared to be much amazed at the calm way in which mona received his news lady sophia glanced from one man to the other and having a shrewd idea of what was coming made up her mind to depart so as to spare herself a scene and shepworth an awkward explanation most interesting she said rising and shaking out her skirts but i have so much to do that i really cannot wait mona child you must come and see me at folkstone the piccadilly hotel you know though why piccadilly by the seaside i really dont know will you not wait and hear what i have to say asked jadby who seemed desirous of having as many listeners as possible so as to cast shame upon shepworth no my good man rejoined lady sophia with all the polished insolence of a grand dame other peoples affairs do not interest me you had better go back to the south seas where i am sure you will be much more at home prelice help me on with my dustcloak she pointed to a grey silk mantle which her dutiful nephew duly adjusted on her shoulders now mona child dont forget goodbye mr shepworth prelice you had better come with me she ended sailing towards the door the young man hesitated and looked at mona doubtfully she interpreted his look promptly lord prelice will stay at my request my dear lady sophia at the door sunk her voice so very awkward if you really know what that creatureso she designed jadbyis going to say it has to be said sooner or later whispered mona and i want lord prelice to hear oh a new thought seemed to strike lady sophia she glanced from her hostess to her nephew and then pursed up her lips guessing in a flash what was coming you had better come with me prelice she repeated raising her voice and at the sound of it mona shrank away but prelice looked dogged and declined to come i must stop and support miss chent he said mr shepworth can do that cried captain jadby insolently he can said the barrister taking a step forward and he can support the cause ofwith emphasisany lady the advocate of the stone age standing at the open door raised her lorgnette and surveyed the group most interesting she said with cool impertinence quite a comedy let us hope that it will not merge into a tragedy and biting her lip she departed with a glare at her obstinate nephew guessing that lady sophia was offended and pretty certain of the reason mona did not dare to follow the motor car of lady sophia was heard whirring down the avenue in the hot sunshine and only when the sound died away did miss chent return to the three men what more have you to say captain jadby she asked politely it seems to me that there is little need of an explanation he answered with another shrug and compressing his lips none at all that i can see rejoined shepworth in a cool voice i think captain jadby had better go not until i receive monas answer from her own lips he snarled and looked a very ugly customer in his impotent wrath miss chent to you said the girl equably mona mona vociferated the captain i have a double right to call you by your christian name i did not even know that you had a single right she retorted i have sir oliver wished us to marry quite so and for that reason i became engaged to mr shepworth prelice gave a gasp and turned to his friend ned nodded it is true dorry said the barrister when i was stopping here during the lifetime of sir oliver this man he indicated captain jadby with contempt pestered miss chent with his attentions sir oliver was on his sidewhy i cant saybut i can tell you now interrupted jadby hoarsely i am sir olivers son and mona is my cousin there was a second silence i dont believe it said prelice decidedly and his opinion was echoed by miss chent and shepworth jadby threw back his handsome head scornfully it matters little what you believe he said violently since what i say is the truth and no denial can make it anything else my mother was the daughter of a great chief of tahiti oh broke in prelice impulsively then you are a halfcaste yes admitted the captain his nostrils working and his native origin becoming more and more apparent as he lost his temper my father was married to my mother in native fashion but that i learn does not entitle me to inherit my fathers title and property which it should do however my father made a will in my favour before leaving the south seas he never had much love for me and therefore i dreaded lest he should change his mind and leave his property to someone else i came to england to look after my interests and then learned that a new will had been made leaving the money to mona my father to give him his due was ashamed of himself and proposed that the affairs should be settled by marriage so that both mona and i should benefit i loved her and agreed to the arrangement but she scorned me and so and so her uncle died ended prelice looking sharply at the captain jadby whirled round furiously and stamped my fathers death has nothing whatever to do with my engagement to mona i never was engaged to you she interposed swiftly it was because you persecuted me that i asked ned to stand between us i have known ned for years and he is a loyal gentleman very loyal sneered jadby with quivering lips to love one woman and become engaged to another shepworth would have spoken but mona prevented him there is no need for you to excuse yourself ned she said coldly and addressed herself to the fuming captain when i asked mr shepworth to pretend to be engaged to me so that your worrying might be stopped he told me that he loved another woman a woman who is shepworth threw up his hand if you dare to say a word he cried menacingly i shall break your neck there is no need said mona again while prelice keenly observant held his peace i can explain to captain jadby and then he can go i have heard enough said the sailor hoarsely and glared to fool your unclemy father he added with emphasis and to fool me you pretended to engage yourself to this man you have stated the position accurately said mona with great calmness mr shepworth and i have paid you out we have played a comedy by which you for your insolence have been deceived mona the man took a step forward imploringly miss chent receded i am not afraid of you now she declared in a clear voice although you did your best to frighten me and i do not allow anyone to call me mona save those i love you may be my cousin for all i know but i dont like you and i shall have nothing to do with you my fictitious engagement with mr shepworth is at an end she concluded slipping off a ring and passing it to ned who put it in his pocket and you i understand have the property since the will in my favour has been destroyed there is no more to be said there is this to be said shouted jadby the veins on his forehead swelling dangerously that this house is mine and you shall leave it mona faced him coolly mr martaban looks after my interests she declared quite composed as soon as he tells me to leave i shall do so but until then i am mistress here and i order you to go jadby would have disobeyed as he was furious at the failure of his two thunderbolts he had hoped to overwhelm mona by stating that he was her cousin and he had hoped to separate her from shepworth by telling of the latters infatuation for mrs dolly rover having failed he looked like a fool and would have tried to recover his ground by insisting upon remaining but that prelice rose to his feet and shepworth took a step forward jadby was no coward for the drop of white blood in him came from a brave old stock but the odds were too great moreover he really and truly loved his cousin and his soul was torn within him at the thought of losing her with a sudden revulsion of feeling the tears sprang to his dark eyes although he was by no means a tearful individual putting out his hands blindly he groped his way to the door monas generous heart smote her when she saw the man brought thus low and she sprang forward to lay her hand on his arm do not go in anger felix she pleaded using his christian name as sir oliver had often done if you are my cousinand i believe that you have spoken the truthlet us part in peace shake hands jadby dashed the tears from his eyes and her hand from his arm her appeal brought back the original devil to his semicivilised heart fiercer than ever will you be my wife he demanded savagely no i cannot do you love anyone else mona drew herself up quivering you have no right to ask that perhaps not raged the captain with contempt because you love a man who is in love with a married woman and shepworth ran forward his face white and his eyes bright silence he exclaimed and took jadby by the shoulders i shall not be silent shrieked the halfcaste becoming feminine and abusive in his towering passion you and your mrs rover who what else he would have said neither mona nor prelice knew for the barrister becoming suddenly silent after the manner of the angered white man ran jadby swiftly out of the room the semipolynesian kicked and shrieked and swore and even tried to bite but shepworth with set teeth and grim eyes forced him along the hall and out of the front door the next moment jadby was lying on his back some distance away with shepworth blocking the door of the house he claimed you devil yelled the halfcaste and he leaped up to slip his hand behind him the barrister flung himself down while three shots rang out from the captains derringer then sprang to his feet on hearing no more apparently only three chambers had been loaded for shepworth filled with wrath at this treachery dared the worst and ran blindly down the steps jadby flung away the still smoking weapon with an oath and sped down the avenue as though the fiend himself was after him for some little distance shepworth followed until he lost him on the wide downs and then returned to the grange to meet prelice coming down the avenue at top speed are you hurt ned shouted his friend one of the bullets ripped my arm but its nothing to speak of was shepworths reply wheres mona she ran upstairs to see mrs blexey ill send up and let her know that you are all right i say ned you have made a dangerous enemy oh damn the danger growled shepworth who was furiousthe low mean sulking hound he insulted me before on account of constance and that was why we fought he hadnt a revolver then and i gave him a black eye the brute and are you really in love with constance asked prelice doubtfully yes said ned gruffly and not seemingly inclined to talk about the matter just then ill tell you all about it some day meanwhile let us reassure mona and get my arm bathed its only a scratch but one moment ned said prelice holding him back from entering the house you are not actually engaged to monai mean miss chent no i only agreed so as to save her from jadbys insolence and sir olivers persecution then miss chent is heartwhole entirely so far as i know replied shepworth dryly and then wheeling to face his friend why do you ask these questions ill tell you all about it some day said prelice echoing the former speech of the barrister halloa heres monathat is miss chent herself it was indeed mona who appeared at the top of the steps with mrs blexey and two footmen behind her she looked pale and hurried forward are you hurt ned she asked anxiously i heard the shots its only a fleabite said ned quickly dont bother about it ill go to my room and bathe it let me do that sir said mrs blexey and shepworth nodding a faint assent for he had lost some blood went into the house and up the wide oaken stairs prelice lingered behind with mona i am so glad he said meaningly that ned has been shot how cruel of you no no no you must be aware that i am glad because i havent time to listen now said mona her face crimson and her eyes very bright i have to send a telegram to whom demanded prelice as she disappeared through the hall to dr horace came back the reply and then the young man in addition to his other puzzled thoughts had this new one concerning his former fellowtraveller i wonder what she wants with horace he asked himself the answer came at dinner when mona was in the safe presence of ned and prelice could make no demonstration of the feelings he had for herfeelings which she had guessed long since existed shepworths wound which was worse than he admitted had been bound up and he was in very good spirits mona startled by the events of the afternoon looked pale and was rather restless but prelice said nothing in the first place he could not in the presence of a third party even though that party was his schoolchum and in the second he was too happy to speak much all he could do and did do was to fill his eyes and heart with the pale beauty of mona chent after all the gods had been very good to him by removing an apparently impassable barrier it was shepworth who asked why mona had sent the wire to dr horace and prelice listened with great interest to her reply after the case explained the girl more to martaban than to the young men dr horace sent and congratulated me on the verdict also he wrote a note saying that if jadby proved dangerousthose were his wordsthat i was to wire to him and he would draw jadbys teethhis own words again mr martaban do you know dr horace asked the solicitor looking puzzled no i never set eyes on him until he stepped into the witnessbox to give evidence about the herb but when i heard the shots i knew then that captain jadby was becoming dangerous so i sent off a telegram to dr horace just before dinner a reply came and the reply asked shepworth also puzzled dr horace will be here by ten oclock tonight prelice stared it must be something very important to bring horace down so promptly have you any idea of what he means no replied mona quietly all i know i have told you but if this dr horace can stop felix from shooting people it will be as wise to have him down felix muttered prelice discontentedly mona shot a smiling glance at him not ill pleased to see how openly jealous he was even though he had no official right to be so he is my cousin you know she said sweetly i dont believe it said shepworth sharply i do and if you will look at uncle olivers portrait up there she turned to point at the wall you will see that there is a likeness between him and felix only felix is darker finished mona prelice did not argue but sat restlessly in his seat when mona left the three men over their wine they had a long discussion concerning the present aspect of things and formed a committee of three to decide what was best to be done lord prelice insisted upon going up to london for an interview with madame marie while shepworth was equally certain that the trail of jadby ought to be followed as to mr martaban he openly bewailed the loss of the will which would have placed mona in possession of the lanwin property as the dinner was late the three men lingered for a considerable time talking of what was best to be done and the stable clock struck ten before they were aware of the passing of time at once prelice jumped up and walked into the drawingroom there to his surprise he found dr horace more shaggy and uncouth than ever sitting comfortably beside mona chent the two looked like titania and bottom the weaver how on earth did you come here asked prelice amazed walked retorted horace gruffly i caught an earlier train and so got here before the time mentioned in my wire goodevening shepworth so youve been killed eh oh im alive yet laughed the barrister and then dr horace was introduced to mr martaban to whom he immediately addressed himself im glad that you are here he said in his usual growling tones i mean you sir the landshark ive some business for you is this the time to talk business said martaban somewhat annoyed as after a good dinner he did not feel able to give advice judge for yourself said horace fishing a blue envelope foolscap size out of the breastpocket of his shabby coat look at that martaban did so and so did prelice and shepworth peering over the shoulder of his dresscoat martaban uttered a cry of amazement why its the missing will he almost shouted chapter xvii the old old story on hearing martabans surprised cry everyone stood still and silent out of sheer amazement the unexpected had happened with a vengeance and dr horace quite delighted with the sensation that he had produced rubbed his hairy hands with a grim chuckle quite dramatic isnt it said horace martaban drew a long breath and clutched the document as though he feared that it would vanish into thin air like macbeths witches i am surprised he confessed staring at the doctor how did you become possessed of this sir and in asking that very pertinent question he anticipated the speech of the others horace did not answer immediately without requesting permission he produced his immense german pipe already stuffed as full as it would hold with strong tobacco and lighted it calmly prelice looked annoyed at this breach of good manners and would have stepped forward to remind horace that he was not in his native wilds but that mona guessing his intention made a little gesture to stop him seeing what dr horace had done she was prepared to forgive him everything besides the great traveller was such an eccentric person that no one could be angry when he behaved like a bear it seemed natural that he should meanwhile the lawyer becoming impatient repeated his query how did i become possessed of it said horace lying back luxuriously and puffing out white clouds of smoke well i might say that i murdered lanwin mightnt i yes you might remarked mona smiling but you will not no sighed horace with an odd expression on his large face it would be an anticlimax oh hang your dramatic instincts said prelice crossly why cant you answer the question i am about to if you will hold your tongue and sit down you always did have too much chinmusic prelice well he looked round with a grin like a somewhat malicious monkey if you must know i got that will from agstone mona dropped back into the seat whence she had arisen and her example was followed by the three men horaces calm announcement took their several breaths away and their individual legs could support them no longer it seems to me cried prelice much annoyed that you are presuming on our credulity no i am telling you the truth but did you know agstone demanded shepworth staring oh yes he was my brother what what what quacked martaban like an excited duck go slow old son of a gun said the doctor smoking calmly i told lord prelice yonder of my relationship and there is no need for me to explain the same to you beyond stating the fact that steve agstone was my brother he knew of my address in london and came to see me on the day after the murder why didnt you give him in charge asked the lawyer horace surveyed the red face turned towards him in an aggravatingly calm way for two reasons he gruntedfirstly agstone was my brother and dog doesnt eat dog secondly i had no reason to believe that he had anything to do with the death but the knife which he brought to mr shepworths flat oh yes horace glanced at the two young men and chuckled but you see there was no mention of the knife when steve came to see me still i must admit that he feared lest he should be accused of the crime oh cried mona sitting bolt upright then he did not accuse me again not to me answered the doctor promptly in fact steve seemed to be rather friendly inclined towards you no no no cried mona earnestly he never liked me he was jealous because my uncle loved me well horace looked at his pipe rather than at the speaker i should not say that if i were you in my opinion steve was not so very devoted to lanwin as was made out but i thought never mind what you thought said horace rudely and rose to walk up and down the room i am here to tell you facts when i have explained as much as is possible for me to explain im going wont you stop here for the night asked mona surprised no retorted horace abruptly i wont now listen as my time is valuable and i cant remain here chattering nonsense and and behaving rudely finished prelice with sarcasm oh youre there my son with your monkeybrand manners there there he went on teasingly as prelice jumped up flushing dont get out your little gun theres a lady present i wish you would remember that oh so i do theres a lady present who wishes to hear how i became possessed of a document which gives her ten thousand a year very good dont interrupt or horace broke off with a gruff laugh what bad manners you civilised people have prelice looked despairingly at shepworth it seemed impossible to bring this uncouth person to the point but mona was laughing at the bearlike antics of the traveller although mr martabans indignant face showed how his feelings were outraged this cried the lawyer is quite intolerable cockadoodledoo crowed horace derisively then unexpectedly whirled a chair round between his stumpy legs and sat down leaning his arms over the back to address his audience as it were from an imaginary pulpit listen said horace gravely and the smiles gave place to watchfulness on every face my brother came to see me on the day after the murder i had already read of lanwins death in the papers and asked steve how his master came by his end steve swore that he did not know but stated that he quite expected to be accused he then lugged that blue envelope which mr martaban is holding out of his pocket and passed it along to me before i could open the envelope he was out of the house and i never heard of him again until prelice yonder brought me the report of his death in shepworths flat when alone i opened the envelope and found the will why didnt you bring it forward at once fumed the lawyer because i thought that its production might implicate steve and i didnt wish to have steve hanged for a crime which he did not commit are you sure that he did not asked shepworth meaningly one is sure of nothing in this old ramshackle world said horace philosophically but what i want you all to understand is that steve told me nothing why he should bring me the will i cant say and he did not wait to tell me how he became possessed of it i should have brought it forward at the trial but that the papers hinted at the burning of this will being a point in miss chents favour i therefore waited until miss chent was acquitted and resolved only to use the will when jadbywhom i dont liketried to secure this property miss chent sent me the wire tonight saying that jadby was making himself disagreeable so i came down with the will you have it mr landshark he added looking at martaban so that is a present for you miss chent he pulled out a small white paper packet from his breastpocket and flung it dexterously across the room you will find that useful should captain jadby prove to be troublesome as he will now that he has lost the money that is all my mission here he jumped away from his chair unexpectedly and trotted to the door where he turned to survey the company goodnight stop stop cried mona running to the door through which he had so promptly vanished and the others following echoed her urgent cry but by the time they reached the hall the door was wide open and horace had disappeared as completely as though the earth had swallowed him up beyond was the darkness which veiled him is he mad asked mona turning an amazed face to the three men mad or not he has done you a service said martaban looking down at the will which he still held this is undoubtedly your uncles last testament which was not burnt it is signed by sir oliver in the presence of stephen agstone and emma blexey what a facer this will be for our south sea friend ended the lawyer actually becoming slangy in his delight ought we to follow horace shepworth asked no replied prelice who was frowning at horaces manners even if we caught up with him he would say nothing we must wait to see if he will again intervene in the case he seems to have washed his hands of it said ned sauntering back to the drawingroom he did so before yet when miss chent wired he came down i wonder prelice paused and bit his fingers you wonder what if horace killed sir oliver and agstone shepworth stared thats a rotten bad shot dorry why should he oh i can assign no reason but my dear old chap it is absurd i know you are thinking of the will being brought here by horace but why should not his story be a true one since agstone is his brother well prelice threw out his hands with a despairing gesture i cant understand the whole business it passes my powers of comprehension before ned could reply mona summoned both the young men along with martaban she had been opening the parcel which horace had thrown across the room and was now exclaiming at its contents ned lord prelice here is the sacred herb they hurried over to have a look and there sure enough was the yellowish stalk of the herb from easter island bearing seven or more purple leaves in addition there was a written paper which mona read aloud use the enclosed when jadby comes to close quarters and makes himself unpleasant she read in a bewildered manner also it will be as well for you to use your power over lord prelice to prevent his searching further in this case if he meddles with what does not concern him it means sorrow and perhaps a public scandal there was a dead silence now what does that mean asked mona no one knew no one dared to suggest an explanation prelice was the first to speak i advise you miss chent to obey horace and keep this herb constantly in your pocket he is not the man to give a warning without some grave reason he has saved you once from jadby and this herb as he plainly says intimates that it will save you again but why should oh prelice shrugged his shoulders i can explain nothing and with your leave i shall go back to hythe ned i remain here for the night replied the barrister all right i shall see you in the morning and prelice sauntered to the door after bowing to miss chent he did not dare to take her hand for fear he should never let go of it again but she hurried after him and spoke anxiously in the hall as he put on his light summer overcoat this hasty departure annoyed her as she showed plainly why will you not remain and talk over this strange matter she asked no no answered the young man averting his eyes and quickly opening the door himself since no footman was at hand but if you will permit me i shall come here at five in the morning at five why at five then is the breaking of a new day whispered prelice in a somewhat tremulous voice and in the gardensin the light of the dawnyou can then sayyou can then say he repeated the phrase raised his eyes to meet hers and left with a hurried goodnight mona stood where she was amazed and confused what did he mean she asked herself and immediately her heart explained a light broke over her lovely face and she whispered to herself at fivein the gardensin the light of the dawn meanwhile prelice rushed downward to hythe through the darkness of the night there was no moon but the purple sky scintillated gloriously with stars a warm wind laden with the fragrance of wild flowers was blowing with strange murmurings over the bare spaces of the downs and the young mans spirits thrilled to the beauty and peace of the night he should have thought of the case of horaces queer warning repeated for the third time and of the behaviour of captain jadby now converted from a secret foe into an open enemy but he considered nothing of these pressing matters which had to do with the everyday world rather did he think of mona and her starry beauty rather did he recall with joy the great truth which he could scarcely realise that he was free to woo her without being disloyal to his bosom friend mona was not engaged to ned her heart was free to receive a loving occupant and prelice striding through the leafy lanes swore inly that he would be that occupant lady sophia would be hostile he knew that from the way in which she had taken leave of the girl but what did that matter so long as mona received him at dawn in the enchanted gardens of the secluded grange all that night prelice slept soundly as a lover the tumult of his heart should have kept him wide awake but the transcendental heights to which his thoughts raised him so drew him away from earthly matters that he lost consciousness of physical surroundings lying on his bed the sound of the breaking waves on the rugged beach below the hotel lulled him to sleep and then his spirit soared to a higher world spiritual and pure in which there was no pain or sorrow or weary misunderstandings when he awoke with the rosy lights of sunrise streaming through the curtainless window his spirit told him little of what it had seen in the superphysical world but prelice was conscious that somewhere in the vast spaces of the unknown he had met with mona and had talked with her for endless periods of time true according to the clock he had slept but a few hours but living in eternity as a true lover should he took no count of earthly timemans measure of the eternal he had lived for thousands of years during the dark hours kneeling at the feet of mona crowned queen of dreams of kisses and now he was to see her again in the flesh gracious and lovely andas he knew she would betruly kind the spirit of the man having bathed in the fountain of sleep rose therefrom pure and undefiled it seemed meet to prelicealthough he was not usually so imaginativethat he should wear a suit of pure white as symbolic of the coming interview and as he passed uphill clothed in spotless flannels with the purity of the dawn stealing into his soul he felt as though he had been reborn into a fairer and more perfect world passing swiftly over the grassy uplands his eager feet bore him down into the hollow through the ancient woods and on to the birdhaunted lawn and there in the cold searching chaste light of the dawn hours he beheld his lady standing amidst the dewy grass waiting for his coming and she also was clothed in white as prelice came across the lawns his eyes far off met those of mona which shone like twin stars in the rosy flushing of her face according to precedent he should have raised his hat he should have greeted her with a handshake he should have explained his desire for this unconventional meeting but he did none of these things neither did she desire that he should do them without a words without a pause he came to her swiftly and clasped her in his arms their lips met in one long kiss and the awakened birds sang joyfully in the rustling trees so might adam have greeted eve in paradise when god presented him with the helpmate who was to be the mother of all mankind and you knewyou knew all the time murmured mona on his breast no i did not know more shame to me i really thought that you were engaged to ned i dont mean that but surely you knewyou guessed that i loved you and you only no how could i when i showed my love in a hundred ways she said with a playful laugh oh lord prelice how very little you know of women i know more than is good for me he murmured smiling what that is lord prelice does he protested hedging but george is an innocent boy who knows nothing who is george i am and he kissed her again victoriously mona laughed happily i am afraid that george is not so innocent as he makes himself out to be teach him to be good my darling a hard task you set megeorge she lingered lovingly over the name and oh what you must think of me who take so much for granted i think that you are an angel he cried fervently dear i loved you from the moment i first saw you in that cruel court and i loved you she whispered i thought that it was merely friendship until we met again and thenthen i knew she gave a delighted little crow of laughter which stirred the young mans heart to its depths impulsively he dropped on his knees and kissed her hands alternately scarcely able to speak i am not worthy of you he muttered dear she stooped and raised him to her breast let me find out your imperfections by myself i have many he said humbly and i love you for them i marry a man in the world of men and not an archangel in the same way as you take a faulty woman and not a spirit of light but we are spirits although clothed in coats of skin she ended gently and when the hour strikes we shall know each other do we not know each other now no that is mona chent knows george prelice the young man jumped gaily to his feet enough for the day is the delight therefore he cried i am quite content to know mona chent until she becomes mona prelice when will you marry me so like a man laughed the girl you wish to settle an important future in five minutes we must wait wait oh no no why should we because mona laid a gentle hand on his shoulder your wife must be like csars above suspicion you wish me then to go on looking into the case i do unless you accept the warning of dr horace prelice threw his panama over the hedge i accept no warning since you make me strong to dare it i shall go on with the casetomorrow why tomorrow oh mona let me enjoy paradise for twentyfour hours no you must act and at once lest we lose our paradise altogether i dont understand what dr horace means but in spite of his hints i wish you to look into matters in order to find out who murdered poor uncle oliver and in order to clear my name you must go up to london today and begin your search it is a sacrifice i ask of you no doubt but then lovetrue lovemeans sacrifice very good said prelice sedately i shall go up by the midday train and interview madame marie eppingrave why her particularly she gave the herb to your uncle mrs blexey mistrusts her now he closed her mouth with a kiss not a word more the gates of paradise will close in a few hours until then yes yes until then let us play at being adam and eve in a garden and they did chapter xviii the power of the herb it had been prelices intention to ask ned about his love for constance rover before leaving the grange but on second thought he resolved to wait until he learned more concerning the murders before putting shepworth in the witnessbox nevertheless he was somewhat upset to think that his best friend was entangling himself with a married woman prelice was no prude and had not been a sir galahad himself all the same he did not think that ned was acting rightly of course the case was a hard one since the two truly loved one another constance had been sacrificed on the family altar and to a man who took advantage of her sacrifice to play the tyrant as much as he dared the poor woman was very unhappy and it was to be presumed that the man who loved her was unhappy also it said a great deal for shepworth and mrs rover that they had not long ago defied conventionality and eloped since they had not gone this length prelice argued that they were trying to bear their several burdens as honourably as possible but how long would such endurance last according to shepworth himself mona knew of his love for constance since he had explained the same when the pretended engagement was made to save the girl from jadbys wooing and sir olivers persecution but prelice in the first flush of his love shrank from questioning her about so distasteful a subject and on her side mona was loyally silent until ned chose to speak thus it came about that although prelice met his friend at breakfast he made no remark about this very private business and shepworth did not volunteer an explanation rather did the conversation turn on the unexpected appearance of the lost will and martaban explained his future actions these included an immediate journey to london with mrs blexey who had to make an affidavit as to the authenticity of the document under these circumstances as shepworth could scarcely remain at the grange when both martaban and the housekeeper were absent he arranged to go to london with them by the ten oclock train prelice would fain have lingered in those delicious gardens with mona but as he knew her views he kept to his determination however when the trio drove away to hythe prelice had a golden hour or so all to himself and very wisely made the most of it it was with great regret that he took his way to the station at hythe and to the train which was to bear him miles away from his goddess but the memory of the last kiss which she gave him cheered his somewhat despondent mood all the way to charing cross and on stepping on to the platform of the metropolitan station prelice shook off his dreams and addressed himself to the task in hand as the day was fine and prelice as usual felt the need of exercise to tame his exuberant spiritswhich had quite recovered during the journeyhe walked to new bond street and somewhere about three oclock found himself reading a brass plate inscribed madame marie eppingrave and afterwards he entered a narrow and dark passage to mount a steep flight of stairs and finally came to the second floor of the building where the fortuneteller received clients a darkcomplexioned lad of fourteen dressed in white robes with a blue scarf round his waist received the newcomer and informed him that madame marie was engaged for ten minutes or so prelice therefore sat down and glanced over some papers lying on a round table these mostly dealt with occult matters up to date and he speedily grew tired of reading much which he could not understand the room was small and commonplace and even ugly in its adornments the table aforesaid a few cane chairs and an old horsehair sofa completed the furnishings and two dingy uncurtained windows overlooked bond street there was nothing of the mystical about this very ordinary apartment and prelice concluded that madame marie certainly did not spend her earnings on magical frippery in order to impress those who called upon her after a glance round he spoke to the lad who was seated crosslegged at the door and asked him if he was a hindoo no answered the boy in very good english and with a flash of snowwhite teeth i come from the south seas indeed answered prelice in his turn and somewhat astonished has your mistress been in the south seas yes sir she brought me from tahiti but i want to go back again prelice reflected tahiti was the home of captain jadby and the former haunt of sir oliver lanwin he wondered if madame marie had met the baronet there but the lad was not likely to know that so he asked him another question does your mistress know captain felix jadby the effect on the boy was somewhat strange he leaped to his feet and muttered some words in his native tongue which apparently were not complimentary to the captain judging from the savage expression of his face madame does know him he said at length and he comes to see her here very often i dont like him he kicked me i would kill him if i were in tahiti but here the boy shrugged his shoulders to show that the english law was much too particular madame loves the captain and wants to marry him went on the boy apparently so carried away by his hate that he said more than was wise considering his dependent position but he loves another and here the sound of the inner door opening made the lad aware of his folly in speaking secrets to a stranger he cringed and caught prelices hand you will say nothing to her he implored no no prelice assured him and slipped halfacrown into his hand but later you must tell me more i also dislike captain jadby ill tell you what i can to harm him said the boy viciously he kicked me and struck meme the son of a chief but dont tell her he added pointing with a trembling hand to the inner door oh my soul dont tell her for she can send the spirits to torment me the young man promised again thinking that the lad in a way was somewhat like caliban in his fear of spirits and looked upon madame marie as a sort of female prospero who could have him pinched black and blue but he had little time to think about this new ally who might be of assistance in undermining jadbys schemes for a lady fashionably dressed and holding a handkerchief to her face emerged from the inner room the lad showed her out and prelice waited for his reception a silver bell sounded within and the boy returned to point meaningly at the door laying his finger on his lips in token of silence prelice nodded reassuringly and stepped into the shrine if the approach to this holy of holies was commonplace the shrine itself certainly was not prelice beheld a room of no great size furnished very oddlythat is to say it was not furnished in the ordinary acceptation of the word the ceiling was painted a dull red and a plain carpet of the same hue was spread over the floor two windows looking on to bond street were filled in with painted glass representing various mystical signs and the four walls were hung with lustreless black stuff which made the place look like a chapel during a funeral service but the odd thing was that the red carpet was strewn with perfectly white cushions and there was neither table nor chair tall pillars of black marble stood in the four corners each bearing a glass ball on its summit and between the windows was placed a bronze tripod in which smoked a perfumed fire what with the dim religious light the black walls the red carpet and the snowy cushions of silk prelice felt somewhat dizzy all this theatrical parade was evidently designed to produce a confusing effect and unseat as much as possible the reason and judgment of madames dupes annoyed that he should give way so easily the young man pulled his wits together and looked at the priestess who had conceived this artful mise en scne madame marie clothed in a long white silk robe made perfectly plain kneltjapanese fashionon a cushion in front of the tripod and with her back to the painted windows she was a stout heavylooking woman of apparently no great height with a colourless face very large and smooth and with masses of snowy silvery hair which tumbled down her back in waves of white what her figure might be prelice could not judge because of the robe but he noted that her hands were slender and beautiful and also ringless indeed she did not wear a single ornament of any description and kneeling perfectly motionless with closed eyes looked like an idol carved out of alabaster it was cleverly done and prelice the sceptical could quite understand how the majority of people yielded to the carefully prepared spells of this managing woman but it was when madame marie opened her eyes that prelice became aware of the true secret of her power over weaker minds these were large and blue and clear looking from under white eyebrows in a penetrating way fathomless as the sea and as mysterious prelice met this mystical gaze calmly but felt his skin prickling and his will power growing weak aware that the seeress was trying to hypnotise him as she doubtless hypnotised her other clients the young man concentrated his will to meet and baffle hers for some time they stared at one another prelice looking down from his height and madame marie gazing upward from her cushion then the woman closed her eyes again with a somewhat annoyed expression you are not a weak man she said in a deep melodious voice like the sound of a mellow bell no answered prelice calmly i am not and he sat down crosslegged on a cushion directly in front of the sibyl then why do you come to me she asked looking at him steadily only weak persons wish to know the future the man who is strong and selfwilled and sceptical as you are need learn nothing of the future which lies in his own hands in the hands of god rather corrected prelice do you know who i am you are lord prelice how do you know i might say by magic but you would not believe that i always suit myself to the nature of those i meet therefore i shall give a commonplace explanation i saw you in court when you gave evidence during the trial of miss chent for murder prelice nodded i might have guessed that do you know why i have come madame marie folded her hands calmly before her and replied equally calmly you have come to solve the secret of the murders that is a very clever guess and i rather think that you can solve the secret madame why should you think so she asked with absolute calmness you gave the sacred herb to sir oliver i did the sacred herb of easter islandbut i need not explain to you since you heard what dr horace said in court the herb induces trances and sir oliver wished to go into a trance by its aid i therefore gave him a few twigs why did sir oliver wish to go into a trance he desired to explore the astral plane if you understand that i quite understand i have studied theosophy well there is nothing more to be said rejoined madame marie with a little shrug which hinted at french blood he went into a trance and while his spirit was absent from his body he was murdered who by i cant tell you even with my powers and they are great i am not permitted to know who killed sir oliver lanwin it was his karma and he had to bear it since he reaped only as he sowed the karma of his murderer has nothing to do with me therefore my sight is veiled and i cannot read the truth and if i could added the woman with emphasis you must be aware if you have studied the occult that i would not be permitted to tell without permission from those who rule the lords of karma asked prelice wondering if she was talking in earnest or merely wriggling out of an awkward position madame marie bowed solemnly i see you understand somewhat but may i ask you to be more open with me regarding the purpose of your visit you can hardly have come to accuse me of these crimes no said prelice studying her face carefully i think that you are innocent let us leave the murders alone for the moment i want you to help mehe paused to add effect to his next wordswith captain felix jadby the womans hands moved restlessly and she began to lose her calmness when the name was pronounced i know nothing about captain jadby beyond the fact that i met him at lanwin grange but he is not guilty of sir olivers death if that is what you mean oh dear me that is not what i mean at all rejoined prelice in his most airy manner and resolving to be very plain but the fact is that captain jadby is my rival madame marie rose as though moved by a spring and he then saw that she was little but tremendously dignified your rival she repeated and her marblewhite face became crimson with angry blood at length he had managed to break through her calculated calm i understood that miss chent was engaged to mr shepworth oh the whole world knows that replied prelice still airy in his manner but that was merely an official engagement to prevent jadby from worrying miss chent sir oliver was in favour of the engagement with jadby for reasons i know those reasonsi know that felix she let slip the name forgetting that she had disclaimed intimacythat felix is his son his illegitimate son said prelice with emphasis yes by the daughter of a chief to whom he was married in native fashion lord prelice of course captain jadby she had the name stiffly by this time remembering her slip came home to look after his interests and wished to marry another woman forgetting cried madame marie beginning to pace the room that he was engaged to marry another womanmyself lord prelicemyself remembering what the native boy had said prelice expressed no surprise but rapidly resolved to work on her jealousy i congratulate captain jadby more than i do you he remarked gravely oh i know that he is not a good man she cried now quite the woman and kicking several cushions out of the way but i loved him i have always loved him and he owes much to me he promised when we met in the south seas that he would make me his wife not that i am young or beautiful but because he found in meso he saida good comrade i gave him the money to come home and see his father and to secure his inheritance if possible but he saw that girl and loved her oh how i hate that girl who stole his heart you need not said prelice very dryly miss chent dislikes jadby immensely and pretended to be engaged to shepworth so as to escape his clutches otherwise sir oliver might have worried her into consenting to a marriage which she hated but jadby came down the other evening to lanwin grange and knows now that the engagement was a false one what he does not know ended prelice emphatically is that miss chent is now engaged to me to you madame marie stopped in sheer surprise then went on pacing the room talking half to herself but why should i be astonished i saw her look at you in court i noted how you glanced in her direction i told jadby that you loved her and that she loved you oh you couldnt be certain cried prelice blushing i have occult powers which enable me to read hearts said madame marie coldly believe or disbelieve as you like i shall believe if you will read my heart now there is no need of my exercising occult powers for that she replied waving her beautiful hands you wish to learn the truth about the murders so that miss chents name may be cleared and felix thwarted yes said prelice coolly you are right and you can help me to clear miss chents name to discover the truth as i can help you to marry jadby how can you do that by marrying miss chent myself madame marie nodded and thought pressing her hands to her head i can help you by the power of the herb she said rapidly listen i shall go into a trance induced by the herb do whatever i say but do not attempt to waken me simply listen to what i say and then leave the room i shall send my spirit to seek out the truth but first she said slipping down on to the cushion again tell me how much you know prelice saw no objection in being thus clear even if madame marie wished to work against himand seeing that her love for jadby was at stake he did not think that she wouldall that he told her would do little to harm his own schemes he therefore made no demur but detailed everything from the time lady sophia had first drawn him into the case by sending him to the new bailey madame marie listened intently nodding at intervals it is useless for felix to strive she said when he ended and with an air of triumph the fate of yourself is mingled with that of the girl you love so speedily now because you loved before in previous incarnations her karma is your karma felix can never marry her nor can mr shepworth marry her even if he did not love mrs rover pardon me cried prelice quickly i made no mention of mrs rover beyond the fact that she wore the green domino and the scarletembroidered dress and she as i explained is innocent you have no right to talk of mr shepworths love for a married woman lord prelice said madame marie quietly and moved towards the wall my knowledge of these affairs is greater than you imagine mrs rover has consulted me and felix learnedhow it matters notthat she loved mr shepworth however we can talk of these things another time i will go into a trance and search in alexander mansions for what i can find only as i said after i have spoken and have become silent leave this room at once in due time i shall come out of the trance when the power of the herb is exhausted prelice nodded in silence and madame marie drawing aside a portion of the black hangings revealed a small recess from this she took some purple leaves and moving towards the tripod threw them on the perfumed fire lie down on your face she commended else the fumes will send you into a trance quick the smoke rises it certainly did in a thick white cloud madame marie stood over it letting the odour flow into her nostrils not wishing to experience the power of the herb as he had witnessed its results before prelice lay full length on the red carpet the smoke was circling so high up that he could not breathe it although a sickly whiff of tuberose perfume came to his nostrils perhaps the draught sweeping from under the door neutralised the powerful scent at this lower level but be this as it may prelice lay perfectly flat and as in a dream heard madame marie speak after the manner of the tranced in an unemotional voice and very distinctly i leave this room she said in her mellow tones i rise high i pass across london the streets are under me i see the park and now i poise above alexander mansions i sink i pass through the roof i am in mrs rovers flat search for the dress commanded prelice softly there was a pause and then the calm voice sounded again i search in mrs rovers room the dress she wore is there in a wardrobe together with a green domino search for another dress said prelice risking the chance another dress of the same style again there came a pause i am searching said the voice and a silence ensued for quite two minutes it endured then madame spoke again still with the same awful calmness a mans dressingroomin the flat across the landing i see a cupboard in which many clothes are hanging up mens clothes they are behind them is a green domino with a scarletembroidered dress sewn to it who wore it asked prelice his heart beating i cannot tell it is not permitted by the powers then came a long silence chapter xix circumstantial evidence it was with extraordinary feelings that lord prelice emerged from that mystic room into the everyday world of bond street after the refusal to declare the name of the person who had worn the dress madame marie had become silent and prelice raised his head to see her standing rigid and white between the painted windows the white smoke had disappeared into thin air and save that the strong tuberose scent still lingered behind there was nothing to show what had placed her in the trance obedient to instructions the young man left the still figure in the lonely room and passed through the outer apartment on his way down the stairs the boy crosslegged in the corner looked up anxiously as he went out you have said nothing he breathed apprehensively nothing answered prelice softly and descended the stairs when he stood in the street again he removed his hat and drew a long breath of the smoky london air impure as it was it dispelled the slight dizziness which the odour of the sacred herb had produced then the young man chartered a hansom to reach his rooms in halfmoon street but not until he was in his very own den and seated in an armchair with a brandy and soda within reach did he find time to reflect his reflections were considerably aided by a firstclass cigar a queer adventure thought prelice meditatively what am i to do next i should like to know of course the answer to this was obvious he should go at once to alexander mansions and learn if what madame marie said was correct a very difficult errand to go upon prelice thought as it would be hard to induce mrs rover to explore her husbands dressingroom in search of evidence which might bring him into trouble and what excuse could he make without telling the whole truth then again mrs rover might scoff at madame maries astounding statement made under such astounding conditions yet on reflection prelice did not think that she would scoff considering that she had consulted the fortuneteller herself and believed in the occult there was a considerable vein of what the vulgar call superstition in constance rover that the dress was there prelice had not the least doubt of course on the face of it an ordinary mortal would laugh at the idea of evidence being procured in such a way but prelice had travelled too widely and he had seen too much to make him a sceptic in cairo in the west indies in south america and in the south seas he had witnessed occult ceremonies and doings which proved clearly the existence of that unseen world at which many people laugh and of which all people are afraid drink drugs music rapid movement and even absolute stillness are all aids to open the psychic senses as prelice knew very well madame marie had used the fumes of the sacred herb to rend the spirit from the body and he quite believed that she had gone to alexander mansions to make the strange discovery when she woke from the trance she would beaccording to psychic lawsquite unconscious of what she had said but here lord prelice began to doubt madame marie had admitted that she knew more than prelice imagined seeing that she had been at the grange during the tragedy and was closely connected with jadby it seemed very probable that she was aware of much which it was necessary to learn before the actual truth could be made manifest so far as prelice could judgeand he was a shrewd reader of characterthe fortuneteller was entirely honest in her dealings with him if she wished to gain jadby as her husband it was necessary that she should be so since only by the marriage of lord prelice could the girl whom the buccaneer loved be removed from her path it was not worth her while to play prelice false since his aims and hers were identical prelice desired to marry mona and madame marie wished this also she was anxious to make the sailor her husband and prelice was quite willing that this should be so since it would put an end to jadbys troubling and might perhaps take him out of england therefore prelice believed in madame marie eppingrave he credited her powers also for she had the true eyes of one who can see into the astral world but he could not be certain if she had used her occult powers on this occasion she may have known beforehand of the dress and might merely have used the trance as a means of communicating it without arousing jadbys wrath if the dress was found and evidence therefrom was forthcoming likely to solve the mystery of agstones death the captain wishing to keep mona in uneasy terror for her reputation would be much annoyed but then madame marie could explain that she had only gone into a trance for prelice as an ordinary client and was unaware of what she said under these circumstances the buccaneer could say nothing well said prelice stretching himself and talking aloud a habit which he had contracted when travelling in silent places its rum business altogether if the dress is in dolly rovers wardrobe what then i cant accuse him as he certainly had no reason to kill agstone humph i wonder if this is what horace meant when he said that i would be sorry if i searched further into the case i certainly dont want dolly to be hanged but if he were i am quite sure that ned would console the widow ugh prelice shivered what a horrible thought rover is a bounder and a blighter and a cad but i honestly dont think that he is a criminal of this sort i dont believe that he has the pluck for one thing and for another he had no motive hum he reflected id best get along and see constance on glancing at his watch prelice learned that it was halfpast five and concluded that probably mrs rover would be at home sipping tea after the manner of women worn out with shopping he decided to give her halfanhour and then catch the seven train from charing cross to hythe come what might the young man intended to get back to hythe that night in order to walk over and see mona he assured himself that she would be anxious and would wish to learn how he had sped but he might as well have confessed the truth to himselfnamely that he pined hungrily for a sight of her face and that every moment passed away from her side was spent in the outer darkness where there is wailing and gnashing of teeth said prelice to himself quite ready to wail and gnash if he missed his train as fate would have it mrs rover was at home and came forward to greet her friend in a wonderful teagown which suited her queenly figure the rosehued blinds were down and the room looked like the grotto of the venusberg but in spite of these softening aids mrs rover appeared somewhat haggard nor was her greeting of prelice very friendly indeed it was so harsh that he congratulated himself on finding her alone but then had anyone else been present she would have been all smiles and gentle words how dare you come and see me after leaving as you did last time was mrs rovers polite salutation and i know why you went too yes you may look and look lord prelice but i know i explained your conduct to ned and he told me how he had described the dress to you which means asked prelice calmly and unflinchingly means she cried in stormy tones it means that you believed me to be the woman who came in and waved the bronze cup under neds nose i did believe it for one minute confessed her friend making a clean breast of it in view of what was coming but of course on reflection i saw how ridiculous it was to suspect you it wasit wasit was retorted mrs rover sitting down and tapping her foot i have not many friends lord prelice but i did think that dorry was one of them dorry is he assured her a fairweather friend pooh to suspect me she went on angrily me of all people as if i would have hurt ned had it been that chent girl you might have had some cause speak gently about miss chent said prelice quietly i shant why should i because i am engaged to her you mrs rover started to her feet in delighted amazement but ned neds engagement was merely an official one to prevent jadby oh yes yes i know all about that but i didnt believe that ned was speaking the truth i thought that he was throwing me over for that horrid girl no no dont look at me like that she isnt a horrid girl now that she is engaged to you i shall love lady prelice much more than i loved mona chent engagedengaged mrs rover made a ball of her handkerchief and tossed it in the air what a rage lady sophia will be in she is in it already said prelice dryly i dont care of course you dont youre a mana man oh how i love a man not that my married life gives me any experience she ended bitterly constance said prelice seriously sit down and let us talk quietly about your married life i dont wish to talk of it she retorted but nevertheless took the seat he pointed to you must i am your friend as you very truly say i admit it now that you are engaged to mona but i say dorryyes ill call you dorry nowi say isnt it rather sudden you have only known her a week or two it was a case of love at first sight said the young man very earnestly pooh pooh i dont believe in such a thing i didnt either until i experienced the sensation but i really did love mona from the moment i saw her in the dock and it was only honour which held me back from speaking even earlier honour what honour asked mrs rover contemptuously she was supposed to be engaged to ned you know only when i learned that the engagement meant nothing was i able to speak out you have very many scruples said mrs rover with a shrug and evidently forget that all is fair in love and war thats a purely feminine view constance had ned really been in love with mona and really engaged to her i should have left england without saying a word so like a man retorted constance scornfully why if a dozen women loved ned i shouldnt give him up constance you forget that you are married i dont dolly never gives me a chance of forgetting constance prelice spoke sharply you are a foolish headstrong woman do you want to be disgraced there is no chance of that cried mrs rover in a fury how dare you talk to me like that because i see you going headlong to ruin you see nothing of the sort i am a loyal wife to dolly ned knows that i love him now as i loved him before my marriage and you know dorry as he does how my marriage came about i know but you ought to make the best of it i am making the best of it cried constance rising to stamp her foot in a royal rage there is not a breath of scandal against my name no one can couple my name and neds together we scarcely ever meet but we cant prevent our feelings still urged prelice in rather a futile manner since you have elected to become mrs rover you must consider your husband let him consider me first i made a bargain with him and he accepted knowing that i loved ned and not him he has broken that bargain in the meanest manner and my father died of sheer worry through the breaking of it now i have to stifle my deep love for ned and act the part of a loving wife i feel like a hypocrite i dont think you need constance people say that you treat rover badly it is as well that you should know i do know i have heard that before but dolly himself put that story about i dont love him and i dont pretend to but i am as obedient and kind as i can be i told you that i treated him like a dog so i do like a pet dog a dog that is fed up and smoothed and cosseted and given cream and meat and all the things poodle dogs like but dolly goes about posing as a husband that is badly treated he does not dare to say that i have deceived him however she added drawing a deep breath he would suffer for it if he did miserable as i am i abide by the bargain which he broke but what is to be the end of it i dont know i dont know wailed mrs rover pacing the room and holding her hands to her head i really believe that dolly wants to see me disgraced he took these flats above neds in spite of my protestations i want him to go away but he wont oh said prelice thoughtfully so mr rover took these flats above neds did he purposely i dont know constance paused looking startled why do you ask lord prelice considered constance i want you to do me a favour yes mrs rover spoke softly and with an effort do you think that your husband wishes to get ned into trouble constance put her hand to her head he hates ned she said at last in a strained voice because he knows that ned loves me and i do ned but for all his jealous watching he cannot find anything wrong between ned and myself because she added drawing herself up to her full height there is nothing wrong and never will be you have not answered my question repeated prelice quietly do you think that rover wishes to get ned into trouble yes i believe that he would be glad to see him dead well then constance answer me another question would you like to see your husband get into trouble no she said with a startled air dolly is a fool and cruel and i can scarcely endure him all the same i dont wish him any harm that is all right said prelice rising then i can trust you to hold your tongue about what why are you so mysterious my poor girl i would rather hold my peace than tell you what i am about to tell but it is necessary that you should know if i do not move in the matter someone less friendly to you and rover may do so and then only god knows what would happen dorry constance caught his hand and passed her tongue over her dry lips slowly what do you mean i have gone through so much that im quite able to face the worst you wont scream no im not a fool oh what is it she blazed out with a stamp clenching her hands and clenching her teeth also prelice raised his hand i must tell you as i best can he said in a peremptory tone which quietened her after all i may be mistaken is that dress you wore at your ball in your room for answer constance pressed the bellbutton and when the footman appeared gave an order tell my maid to bring me the frock and domino i wore at the ballat the masked ball she said then faced prelice when the man went out are you about to accuse me no dont ask questions constance i am sorry to keep you in suspense but i cant help it the whole thing is so extraordinary what thing what thing but prelice perhaps mistakenly would not tell her the maid entered with the domino and dress which prelice at once recognised as the masked ball costume he simply cast one glance at it and then you can tell her to take it away again he remarked mrs rover did so wonderingly and waited to hear what he had to say next take me to your husbands dressingroom in the other flat what for she asked and how do you know that dollys dressingroom is in the other flat never mind take me there said prelice impatiently he wished to get the things over as speedily as possible as he saw how strung up she was and yet until he was certain how could he accuse rover in his heart of hearts lord prelice wished that he might be spared the disagreeable task of accusing rover at all but if he did not do so it was not improbable that jadbyto further his own endsmight intervene and it was much better that jadby at all costs should be kept out of the business since he was not likely to spare either constance or her husband come come cried prelice impatiently and seeing that she did not move take me to your husbands dressingroom and constance led him thither like a woman in a dream they left one flat and crossed the landing to the other when in the dressingroom which was luxuriously furnished mrs rover remained silent and observant at the door while her friend examined the sanctum of her husband so mysterious were his words and movements that she began to wish that she had not admitted him since she did not desire to harm dolly objectionable as she found him but if she could not trust dorry in all ways who could she trust meanwhile prelice peered into a wardrobe and shook out the many suits it contained he searched a large wooden press wherein shirts and underlinen and handkerchiefs and collars were neatly laid out but in each case he failed to find that for which he hunted and drew a long breath of relief perhaps after all madame marie was wrong in spite of the magical powers to which she laid claim when at his wits end prelice turned to constance isnt there a cupboard he asked over there she said pointing to the hither side of the fireplace you must be blind not to see it oh it is unlocked she added noting that he hesitated dolly has no secrets there is nothing in it but old clothes and rubbish which trimmerthis was mr rovers valetstows there look into the cupboard by all means the young man made no reply to the sarcasm but opened the cupboard of bluebeard it was deep and wide with many pegs at the back and round the sides upon which hung many clothes out of date and slightly worn on the floor was a heterogeneous pile of shabby slippers discarded boots sundry medicine bottles tin boxes of polish and many odds and ends showing that this was a bagorags receptacle for sheer rubbish prelice speedily pulled out all the clothes and threw them on the floor while mrs rover shrugged and stared at his zeal suddenly he came upon a green silk domino inside which was sewn the front of a white dress streaked with thin lines of red velvet the whole made one garment easy to slip on and off which when worn would look both like a dress and a domino this very ingenious garb was hidden behind the discarded clothes which apparently had not been disturbed for some considerable time and only by removing all as prelice had done could the domino and its clever fixings have been discovered there said the young man holding it up for mrs rovers inspection with staring eyes mrs rover drew near and handled the fabric an imitation of the frock and domino i wore at my ball she gasped then added after a pause a woman never wore this ned said that the person who waved the bronze cup under his nose to make him insensible was a woman said prelice significantly oh gasped constance taking his meaning at once dolly its a lie chapter xx mr rover explains its a lie repeated constance seeing that prelice did not say a word dolly is a little cruel fool who tyrannises to the full extent of his weak powers but i dont believe that he killed agstone well drawled prelice reflectively on the face of it there appears to be no reason and yet this sham frock is in this rubbish cupboard dolly can explain breathed mrs rover hopefully can he explain why he entered neds flat to he didnt he didntits impossible i tell you constance declared the other seriously you said yourself that mr rover would be glad to see ned dead out of sheer jealousy i quite believe that and i believe also that he had not the pluck to kill him but he did his best to get ned into trouble by killing agstone what rubbish cried mrs rover feverishly if he killed the one he would have murdered the other and would have chosen ned in preference humph perhaps with a refinement of cruelty rover wished ned to be hanged and so slaughtered agstone in the hope that ned would be accused and accused ned would have been cried prelice decisively but that i brought in your guests to see him helpless mrs rover twisted her hands in her hair its impossible i tell you she lamented hoping against hope dolly is a fool he never would be a murderer he hasnt the pluck heaven knows that i have no cause to love him and that he stands in the way of my happiness but i tell you dorry that i would have cut off my right hand sooner than have brought you in here to spy out his shame i am glad to hear you say that constance returned prelice quietly for it shows that you have honour if not love and that even to secure your happiness with ned you will not stoop to injure the man who is your husband but think my dear girl is it not better that i should find this than jadby jadbythe man who loves mona what has he got to do with it everything said prelice tersely he wishes to secure mona as his wife and will stop at nothing you may wonder how i came to guess that your husbands dressingroom was in this flat and how i came to know that this sham dress was hidden behind these clothes i can explain very shortly i consulted madame marie eppingrave that fortuneteller gasped constance staring i have consulted her myself and she told me a lot of rubbish surely you do not believe what she says in that shoddy room of hers i am bound to believe said prelice dryly seeing that the domino with the attached frockfront is here as she stated but she may not have told me so by means of occult power in spite of her claim to exercise the same in some earthly wayi know not howshe knew where this he touched the domino was to be found she will tell captain jadby to whom she is much attached and then he will come here to make what trouble he can therefore you can understand that it is better for rover that i should be the discoverer yes i see i see murmured constance and tottered towards a chair to fall into it oh horrible horrible but there must be some explanation dorry think of onethink of one women as prelice reflected at the moment were most extraordinary here was a wife who avowedly hated a husband of the tricky effeminate sort yet when chance placed a weapon against him in her hand she refused to use it despite the temptation of thus ridding herself for ever of a marital incubus rover had practically killed her father he had cheated her into a match which she loathed and he was doing his best to make her unhappy in the face of it all his deceived wife defended him and this against the strong desire which she had for the man who truly loved her truly women were strange however it was not prelices business to analyse mrs rovers feelings what he had to do was to learn the meaning of rovers hiding the domino in his cupboard and this he proceeded to do was jadby at your ball he asked abruptly i never asked him i dont know him she replied clasping her hands tightly but you know that owing to the masks many peopleshady people toowere there captain jadby might have come also he did come said prelice quickly for he was one of the first to unmask when seeing ned insensible and to blame me certainly he may have come up the stairs opportunely but since he wore a domino and mask i am sure that he was at the ball what colour was the domino blue light blue rejoined prelice promptly there were many blue dominos murmured constance i wonder why this man came to my ball ah that is what we have to find out but another question prelice cleared his throat presuming as we must that your husband wore this madeup thing did he know what you would wear yes assented mrs rover then started up with a cry and a very pale face oh dorry dorry are you going to say that my dress was imitated by him so that i might be accused it looks like it said prelice reluctantly what else could he say but i cant believe that dolly would be so wicked said the poor wife anxiously and yet the dress is the same there is only a front to be sure but when worn anyone would have mistaken him for me a man always looks taller in womens clothes these are hardly womens clothes sufficiently like them to deceive anyone but you said that you spoke to someone wearing a dress like mine it was not me dorry i should have remembered was it dolly i never spoke to you or to anyone dressed like you said prelice quickly i only told you that to get at the truth but i never expected to hear you say that you had worn the dress one thing i may tell you he added that the green domino seemed to be ubiquitous i saw himpresuming your husband is the persontalking and drinking and dancing all over the place i was dancing also said constance and if dolly wore a similar dress it is natural that you should see the frock and domino often dolly received my guests unmasked you know i remember but later he vanished and then might have prelice touched the domino significantly still there is one thing to be said he added how did your husband enter neds flat dont you remember she said raising her head agstone brought in the ladydolly i supposewhen ned was in that cataleptic state i forgot that but who admitted agstone what is the matter he asked this because constance rose suddenly to her feet with a cry of astonishment mr haken was at the ball she said alarmed i know i saw himthat is i recognised him by his chuckle well mrs rover sat down again you know that mr haken is my godfather she remarked and when prelice nodded went on he was much distressed over my preference for ned seeing that i was married and came to remonstrate with me on the night of the ball humph said prelice coolly i wondered why he was at the ball a most unusual festivity for a dryasdust old man like uncle simon to be at i gave him the key said constance in a low voice the key what key the key of neds flat constance how did you become possessed of the key with a bent head and a hurried low voice she explained dolly was very cruel to me at times he even struck me and i could not strike back at a little rat like that i told ned who was furious and wanted to frighten dolly i prevented him so that there might be no scandal ned then gave me the key of his flathe had an extra keyand told me if dolly ever struck me again to come to him i should not have thought of doing so but to quieten ned i consented to take the key what an injudicious thing to do breathed prelice alarmed if your husband knew he might do a lot of damage but how did uncle simon get the key out of you i told him about it the night of the ball he got me into a quiet corner to remonstrate so i explained everything mr haken was angry at ned for having given me the key he was quite right interposed prelice ned ought to have had more sense than to do such a mad thing go on mr haken insisted upon having the key and then said that he would go down and see ned prelice turned suddenly pale was this what horace had warned him against when he advised him to leave the case alone did uncle simon go he asked in a stifled voice i dont know he certainly said that he would go down and give ned back the key and talk to him about his folly in letting me have it prelice felt very uncomfortable and his thoughts flew to his aunt with her merry ways it would be terrible for lady sophia if haken were involved in this dreadful case and indeed if he wereas seemed apparent from constances storyprelice wished that he had taken the doctors advice and had left it well alone while he was puzzling over this new problem and trying to find reasons against his uncles complicity he heard constance cry out and looked up to see rover standing in the doorway the little stockbroker dressed to perfection and overdressed at that looked more dapper and neat than ever his face was more colourless his eyes more plaintive and blue than they had been in the artificial light in which he had received his wifes guests such a meanlooking bloodless man could scarcely get into a rage yet a venomous look crept into his eyes as he surveyed his wife and her visitor what is the meaning of this he demanded trying to assume the dignity of an injured husband which sat very badly on him before constance could speak lord prelice stepped forward with the domino over his arm and spread it out this is the meaning of my being in your dressingroom mr rover he said sharply and perfectly cool i found this behind some clothes in yonder cupboard how dare you search into my private affairs cried dolly standing on tiptoe and growing red is it not better that i should do so than the police mr rover the little man looked genuinely puzzled the police what do you mean by mentioning the police this dress this domino both are an imitation of the dress and domino which your wife wore at the ball and the lady who was introduced by agstone to make shepworth insensibleif you remember the casewas arrayed in this way instead of turning pale dolly became redder than ever and turned like a snake on his wife you he said savagely you entered shepworths flat you dared to i never was near the flat said constance coming very close to him and looking down contemptuously from her great height and if you dare to hint at such a thing i shall leave you for ever i have put up with enough from you dont drive me too far mr rover has enough to do to defend himself without troubling you constance said prelice quietly dolly started what do you mean he asked nervously this sham dress was hidden in your cupboard i never saw it before i didnt know it was there dolly gasped for he was beginning to scent danger the presumed woman introduced by agstone was dressed in this went on lord prelice mercilessly you hated shepworth you wished to get him into trouble and so prelice stopped i leave you to draw your own inferences he ended dolly trembled as well he might for the visitor had drawn up a very good case against him i tell you i never saw the dress before he quavered and how did you find it that is neither here nor there said prelice wishing to shield constance from the mean wrath of the little man later on the police can explain the policethe police dolly grew as white as a sheet constance laid her hand on his shoulder dont be afraid dolly i do not believe that you killed that man agstone dolly brushed her hand away with the snarl of a terrified cat keep yourself to yourself he snapped showing his teeth you hate me so you need not defend me i dont love you answered constance bitterly i have small cause to considering the way in which you tricked me all the same i do not wish to see you get into trouble over a crime which i truly believe you had not pluck enough to commit you are quite right retorted her husband shamelessly i never did have pluck enough to kill a fly much less a human being i should have stabbed your lover long ago if i had shepworth is not mrs rovers lover said prelice quietly he is she is always howling after him taunted the venomous little man but she sold herself to me and and you did not pay the price said constance scornful and still no dolly chuckled i got the better of you there but you are my wife now and ill make you pay shepworth can marry that criminal girl whenever he likes i hope he will so as to torment you mrs rovers eyes flashed ned shall never marry she began when prelice made a sign to her to keep the secret of the new engagement and spoke himself coldly and sternly miss chents character has been perfectly cleared by her acquittal mr rover and if you dare to say a word against her i shall throw you out of the window how brave you are in defending shepworths bride said dolly wincing at the flash in prelices blue eyes i am replied the other not contradicting the mistake under which he saw dolly laboured but as yet you have not proved your innocence there is no need to prove it rovers voice whimpered unsteadily it is ridiculous to accuse me this dress was hidden in your cupboard insisted prelice what of that this room was used as a place for the coats and hats of the men who came to the ball any one of them might have hidden the domino and frock there i did not i received my guests unmasked and afterwards put on a black silk domino ah prelice took a step forward then it was you who appeared in shepworths diningroom and who gave the alarm yes it was me i came down to see shepworth and to make it plain to him that he was not to make love any longer to my wife he never did make love since our marriage flashed out constance with scorn ned has been true to honour as i have been prelice raised a hand to stop a promising quarrel between the illmatched couple only you rover knew what kind of a dress your wife was to wear at the ball he said judicially only you could have had a similar one madeso as to get her into trouble i expect another person knew cried dolly with a flash of triumph in his chinablue eyes yes i asked haken to come to the ball to remonstrate with constance about her love for shepworth he is godfather to constance as you know i was aware that constance would try to dodge haken as she didnt want to be scolded so i described her dress to him that there might be no mistake haken was at the ball lord prelice why dont you accuse him the young man sneered although he felt distinctly nervous at the many proofs accumulating against his uncle haken had no reason to get shepworth into trouble you had nothing would have pleased me better but i should have stopped short of putting my neck into a noose and i did i tell you again that i dont know how that dominofrock thing came to be in my cupboard that i never entered shepworths flat as i certainly could not do so without a key and that i was the man in the black silk domino who gave the alarm and when i entered the flat then you had left the door open all this explanation was perfectly natural and dolly gave it with such an air of truth that prelice was reluctantly obliged to believe him the young man threw the domino over his shoulder and moved to the door i shall take this with me he said curtly and see the police asked rover with twinkling eyes no not at present not at any time if you value your uncles liberty what do you mean prelice faced round sharply i mean nothing as i know nothing but there is as much evidence against haken as against me and if you accuse me i shall accuse him how will lady sophia like a scandal of that sort eh prelice turned away without vouchsafing a reply i shall see you again constance he said coldly you shall not see her until shepworth marries mona chent snapped the venomous little husband and i shall move heaven and earth to bring that about you will need to retorted prelice remembering his engagement and thinking how angry dolly would be when he learned the truth and let me tell you rover that if you illtreat your wife i shall make it my business to thrash you dolly drew back and snarled but seemed distinctly afraid prelice with a nod to the unhappy wife passed from the room and out of the flat he felt distinctly nervous about simon haken chapter xxi a possible scandal after all lord prelice did not return to hythe on that night much as he desired to in view of this new complication which threatened the domestic peace of lady sophia haken her nephew decided to remain in london and give all his energies towards solving the problem he could not think that haken had anything to do with the murder of agstone in the first place he had no reason to kill the man in the second he did not possess any leaves of the sacred herb with which to make shepworth unconscious certainly it was agstone who had kindled the leaves in the bronze cup but he must have obtained them from mr hakenpresuming he was the disguised ladysince he could have obtained them in no other way sir oliver had possessed a portion of the plant but had used it in the library when he was murdered so the old sailor could not have procured the leaves in that direction prelice began to wonder if haken had got the leaves from madame marie eppingrave to execute his purpose but then so far as prelice knew his uncle was not acquainted with the bond street fortuneteller and again he was well acquainted with dr horace who admitted to possession of the leaves and more than this had actually burnt the sacred herb in the new bailey lord prelice decided first to call upon his uncle in the city and lay the facts discovered before him and then to interview dr horace in these two several ways he might get at the truth also somewhat later he decided to again speak with madame marie and if possible see her in the presence of captain jadby when that buccaneer learned that mona was engaged to another man and that she had inherited the property he might bow to fate and leave things alone finally prelice knew that he had a powerful ally in the fortuneteller from what he had seen of her strongwilled character he guessed that she would stick at nothing to secure as her husband the man with whom she was infatuated bearing all these circumstances in mind prelice sent a wire to mona stating that business detained him in london and also went to his club to write his first love letter in this he carefully refrained from mentioning the case and merely poured out his heart in a passionate dithyramb in honour of his goddess mona for the moment felt some disappointment when she noted the absence of information regarding madame marie but later confessed that her lover was right it would never have done for the first letter which had passed between them to be soiled by the sordid tragedy in which she had been implicated all the same much as she appreciated prelices slightly turgid prose her heart hungered to learn of his doings relative to the case she felt that she would not know a happy moment until the truth were made manifest then she could become lady prelice with a light heart the next day prelice went into the city to see his uncle and learned that mr haken had gone to paris for a few days he was expected back on the morrow as he already had been absent for some time so all that his eager nephew could do was to possess his soul in patience prelice returned to his club rather disappointed and there found a telegram waiting for him it had been sent to his hythe hotel and had been repeated on to his club since it was marked urgent it proved to be from horace and asked prelice to come up at once be at my house at three in the afternoon important said the wire i wonder what this means prelice asked himself uneasily and fretted over the matter until the time came for him to go to rutland square there was no getting over the fact that the mystery of this case was telling on prelices strong nerves nor was his uneasiness diminished when he found that dr horace was not alone with him were captain jadby and madame marie eppingrave both of whom appeared to be on very good terms with their host as usual the room was untidy with its litter of curiosities but prelice managed to find a seat with his back to the light this he did so as to keep his face well in the shade as he had a premonition that there was about to be a duel of words indeed the first whispered remark of horace hinted at a storm about to break you silly ass grumbled the doctor in his beard as he went forward to welcome his guest why couldnt you leave things alone as i told you to now all the fat is on the fire with a vengeance prelice shrugged his shoulders with a carelessness which he was far from feeling and saluted madame marie with a bow of captain jadby who stood fidgeting by the window he took no notice the buccaneer noticed the omission and resented it english manners i suppose sneered the halfcaste pointedly prelice sat down calmly and took up the challenge considering our last meeting when you treacherously fired on my friend you can hardly expect me to behave courteously i wish i had killed him flashed out jadby viciously i quite believe that but you did not harm him in the least retorted prelice lying bravely to defend ned and to annoy the captain i wounded him in the arm snarled jadby didnt i marie i certainly saw that mr shepworth was slightly hurt replied the fortuneteller in a trance of course ah replied prelice negligently your trances are not always reliable madame i think you have found that one is at least she replied in her turn and very significantly what does captain jadby think asked prelice genially he felt sure that the woman had not dared to risk the buccaneers rage by explaining what she had said madame marie told me that she went into a trance on your account said jadby taking a chair sullenly but of course she did not remember what she said and could not explain to me since madame is certain that this especial trance is reliable was prelices retort she must remember something oh the deuce take your chatter shouted horace ruffling his shaggy red hair in a high state of irritation i didnt ask you here to waste my time in drivel in that case as my time is also valuable i had better go no no confound you said horace crossly and seeing that prelice knew well how to treat his humours madame here and jadby wish to speak to you seriously i fail to see upon what subject upon the subject of miss chent cried the buccaneer savagely i decline to discuss an absent lady said prelice coolly you are engaged to her am i indeed but you shant marry her wont i see here prelice rose very tall and very straight and very coolheaded if you persist in going like this captain jadby i shall be compelled to twist your neck english manners sneered the halfcaste again not at all colonial manners south sea manners if you will and very necessary manners for dealing with a ruffian such as you are ill kill you for this muttered jadby sinking back into his chair with your little gun taunted prelice pleasantly i hope youll shoot straighter i never saw so rotten a shot i can do more than shoot yesyou can bark and bite too see here i asked you here to tell you in the presence of horace that if you dont stop meddling with things which do not concern you ill disgrace your uncle prelice never winced he had a kind of idea that something of this sort was forthcoming and merely laughed aggravatingly which uncle said he calmly i have two or three mr simon haken oh indeed prelice turned to horace are you on my side or on the side of these blackmailers he demanded madame marie arose furiously i am not a blackmailer she cried and her deeptoned voice became shrill with anger i did not want to say anything and if felix does not swear to give up this girl i shall refuse to speak out no snapped jadby with a fierce glance at which strange to say the courageous woman looked cowed you shall speak as i direct are you on my side or on theirs prelice asked horace again on yours hang you snarled the ugly little man and if i were not you would find yourself in queer street i can tell you prelice took no notice of this outburst but turned to the woman are you against me he demanded i am neutral she retorted uneasily i see and jadby there is an open enemy well now that i understand the situation perhaps you will let me know how mr haken can be disgraced by you two or you three we can accuse him of murder said jadby choking with anger at the exasperating coolness of the young aristocrat good go on of two murders spat out the halfcaste better and better ha i understand then that you captain jadby and you madame marie accuse mr haken of killing sir oliver lanwin and steve agstone yes snapped the captain and yes breathed the woman very pale prelice looked quietly at them prove these charges he said one moment said dr horace getting out his german pipe remember prelice that this business is none of my bringing about i warned you against meddling in the case and you would not take my warning you have only yourself to thank for what is coming i am perfectly ready to take the responsibility of my actions was the stiff retort of the young man and he turned to jadby go on the captain bursting with venom was only too pleased to relieve himself in a torrent of words before my father sir oliver died he frequently talked to me about the estatesought my counsel in fact i thus learned that mr haken although supposed to be a wealthy man was in difficulties owing to disastrous speculation he asked sir oliver to lend him fifty thousand pounds to tide over a crisis and this my father refused to do naturally mr haken was very angry probably put in prelice coolly but what you say does not prove that mr haken killed sir oliver let me speak now said horace rapidly i was the sole possessor of the sacred herb which if you remember prelice i brought from easter island i gave some to haken who desired to get the same for sir oliver you see pursued the traveller haken knew that lanwin was much interested in occult studies so thought to tempt him to lend the necessary fifty thousand pounds by getting him this rare herb which as you know produces a trance i see prelice nodded then mr haken confessed to you that he desired the loan of this money he did saying that his affairs were in a bad way with the gift of the sacred herb he hoped to soften sir olivers heart which was somewhat hard where money matters were concerned i never knew that mr haken was aware of lanwins inclination to the occult said prelice quietly he was in a way said madame marie suddenly and taking up the story but of course i told him more being very friendly with sir oliver as you know mr haken was superstitious himselfas the saying goesand frequently consulted me about stocks and shares what prelice looked incredulous do you mean to tell me that a hardheaded man like mr haken consulted you he did and i was enabled to serve him by my powers i understood lord prelice that you believed in the occult world i do rejoined the young man dryly because i have had considerable experience and possess imagination but mr haken he believed also interrupted the fortuneteller quickly and came to me for advice it was i who recommended him to apply to his old friend sir oliver for the fifty thousand pounds when sir oliver refused i told mr haken that he should get some of the sacred herb from dr horace and give it to sir oliver in the hope that the gift would make sir oliver hand over the money how did you know that dr horace had the herb asked prelice sharply madame marie and i were acquainted in samoa put in the traveller and when we met in london i told her that i had succeeded in getting the famous trance herb of easter island she asked me for some leaves to use in her business and i declined why when you gave the same to sir oliver inquired prelice because i wished to keep the herb to myself said horace his rugged face growing dark but when haken asked me for it to get money out of lanwin i gave it readily i hated lanwin he thwarted me in tahitiit matters not howand he treated my brother steve like a dog i knew that haken would lose the fifty thousand and wished lanwin to see the last of the cash i would have ruined lanwin if i could this is quite a new light on your character horace said prelice with uplifted eyebrows however i understand that for your own purposes which you have so kindly set forth you gave the herb to lanwin not personally retorted the doctor scowling i gave it to haken and he passed it to madame marie and it was i who presented the herb to sir oliver after retaining some leaves for my own use said the woman coolly it was on the night of the murder that mr haken came down to see sir oliver can you swear to that demanded prelice watching her i can she assured him emphatically mr haken knew that i was to give the herb to sir oliver on that night and came down so as to strike the iron while it was hot by explaining how he had procured the herb from dr horace mr haken came in quietly by the window when i was conversing with sir oliver in the library that was about nine oclock agstone entered to close the windowsthey were not shuttered rememberand also saw mr haken at five minutes after nineif you recollect the evidence i gave in courti went to bed leaving mr haken alone with sir oliver she paused and then questioned prelice there is nothing more to say she replied coldly mr haken was in the library with a man from whom he desired to get money it was i believe refused and then mr haken murdered sir oliver afterwards burning the sacred herb about the time miss chent entered the room needless to say before she entered mr haken had gone a very pretty story said prelice quite unmoved that is one crime no doubt but the other i can explain said jadby enraged at the young mans coolness from madame marie i learned that mr haken was going to mrs rovers ball to see his goddaughter and shepworth and how did you know that asked prelice turning to the woman mrs rover consulted me occultly about her marriage and confessed amongst other things that mr haken was her godfather i saw that mrs rover was in that reckless state which might lead to a scandal and i told everything to mr haken he resolved to go to the masked ball and remonstrate with mrs rover and afterwards with mr shepworth i told captain jadby and i went there said the captain quickly because i knew that haken had killed sir oliver and wished to see him in order to get some money to blackmail him in fact said prelice coolly so you were the continental individual whom my uncle was to meet yes but he was too clever for me he came in an ordinary domino and afterwards changed to a green one with a dress similar to that of mrs rovers how can you be sure because i was hunting for mr haken and heard him chuckle for the moment i fancied that he was mrs rover owing to the dress but when he chuckled i guessed it was mr haken he eluded me however but not before i had smelt the perfume of the tuberose which the sacred herb gives out when you discovered the crime lord prelice i guessed that mr haken disguised as mrs rover so as to implicate her with shepworth should there be trouble had gone down and murdered agstone how did agstone come there how did mr haken know he would be there jadby leaned back coolly i cannot answer either of those questions he said calmly perhaps mr haken can there was a few moments of silence which prelice broke well he asked rising and what are your terms for silence you must give up miss chent to me said the captain with a glance of gratification for he fancied that prelice was yielding i shall marry her and then we shall live at the grange ah but you see it will not be your property said prelice politely jadby sprang to his feet not my property no i fear that dr horace has not informed you that agstone brought the will leaving everything to miss chent to him and that he has restored it to the lady you are a pauper captain jadby miss chent has the money and shortly she will have me as her husband jadby took scarcely any notice of prelice important as was the matter he talked about horace he cried glaring viciously you have played me false i never intended to play you true said horace contemptuously then i shall ruin haken cried jadby at his wits end with sheer rage do so said prelice walking to the door i decline to be blackmailed goodday and he walked out after him came madame marie before he could descend the stairs she gripped him by the arm earnestly and looked into his face prelice could hear the captain and horace quarrelling desperately in the room he had left but waited patiently until the woman spoke swear to me panted madame marie that jadby will never never marry that girl and i will help you in what way for one thing i shall stop felix from denouncing your uncle pooh thats bluff indeed indeed it isnt said the woman passionately what i have told you is perfectly true your uncle will be in great danger if felix speaks but swear to save him from that girl and i shall stop all trouble about mr haken i swear said prelice quietly especially as it is the dearest wish of my life to make miss chent my wife bewareoh be careful implored madame marie clinging to prelice i know that felix is desperate he is dangerous i am not afraid of him he cannot hurt me but he may hurt her cried madame marie if anything goes wrong come to me i can help you i shall do so but why do you work against the man you love because i can secure him in no other way i want him to leave england to marry me while he stops here and is infatuated with miss chent there is no hope hark felix is calling remember we are outwardly enemies but inwardly friends you promise on this she produced a small golden crucifix considering the exigencies of the case prelice was willing to promise anything even to a doubtfully good woman such as madame marie appeared to be but the production of the crucifix took him aback i give you my word he said stiffly i want your oath she retorted swear on this to aid me to marry felix or i do nothing there was no help for it and prelice had to make allowance for madame maries flamboyant foreign way of exaggeration i swear to help you he said and kissed the crucifix chapter xxii the unexpected dont talk nonsense to me cried lady sophia rapping the dinnertable with her lorgnette the idea is too ridiculous for words to marry a girl out of gaol monstrous your father would turn in his grave and he wasnt very particular lord prelice was dining with his lively relative when this speech was made at the tailend of a very excellent meal haken had duly returned from paris on the day after the interview of prelice with dr horace and his two friends on finding a note from his nephew stating that he desired to speak on an important subject mr haken had responded with a wire inviting the young man to dinner lady sophia had also arrived in town from folkstone and explained to prelice when he appeared that she would do nothing for mona this remark led to a request for explanations which lady sophia was only too anxious to afford and the presence of footmen and butler at the dinnertable alone kept her from raging at prelice all the time he was eating haken looking more driedup than ever sat at the foot of the tablehis wife invariably took the topand chuckled at intervals he had not yet heard what prelice wished to speak about and was waiting until lady sophia retired to the drawingroom a thing she seemed disinclined to do at present so rabid was she against her nephew having made the above remark she waited for a reply but as prelice merely crumbled what was left of his bread and said nothing she launched out again with a peremptory question do you or do you not wish your father to turn in his grave my dear aunt replied prelice very distinctly i wish the corpse to take the position it finds the most comfortable oh cried lady sophia outraged in her deepest feelings oh that i should live to hear my late brother called an it have you no reverence prelice not so much reverence as i have patience he replied very bored ah lady sophia hugged herself i might have expected that you never never will face the truth what is the truth asked haken his eyes twinkling and putting the question of pilate the truth said his wife majestically is that prelice must have been changed at nurse he has not the feelings of his ancestors i have their gout however said prelice humorously what possible objection can you have to my marrying aunt sophia its not the marriage itself i object to prelice but to the bride you choose you know that well there wont be a prettier bride in the three kingdoms than mona i am quite sure there wont said his aunt spitefully if she only gets as far as the altar the communionrails you mean ill do my best to bring her there not in my presence prelice all right well have a quiet wedding a quiet wedding raged lady sophia and with such a notorious girl as the bride why all the aunt sophia interrupted prelice growing restive under these insults permit me to remind you that miss chent is to be my wife and that i am quite capable of managing my own affairs lady sophia rose and swept to the door im sorry for you i am truly sorry for you said she with scorn and throwing back her head thank you replied her nephew meekly and politely holding open the door the same to you and many of them oh prelice how i should love to box your ears and unable to say anything worse lady sophia disappeared in a royal rage prelice did not feel very amiable himself for having been baited unnecessarily and closed the door with a bang which said volumes then he returned to the disordered dinnertable poured himself out a glass of port caught his uncles twinkling eyes and laughed in spite of his irritation haken nodded approvingly thats better than banging the door he said stretching his legs in a genial fashion have a cigar prelice accepted one of the best and lighted up while his host followed his example when the blue smoke was curling round the old head and the young and the glasses were full they dismissed the trouble of lady sophia by common consent haken looked interrogatively at the young man well he demanded quietly and what have you to say to me if i know anything of young men you wish to borrow money and ended with a chuckle at his joke knowing the wealth of his nephew and if i know anything of old men said prelice coolly i should advise them to borrow from their relatives instead of from strangers haken was somewhat startled by this speech which was as rude a one as prelice could well have made but he felt irritable and wished to smash rather than break the ice what are you talking about asked the elder man cautiously about fifty thousand pounds a very tidy little sum said haken quite composed i required that precise sum myself a month or so ago to tide over a crisis did you get it not from oliver lanwin retorted the city man dryly prelice jumped up from his chair and let his cigar fall he was far from expecting that haken would own up so quickly leaning forward he placed his hands on the table and looked straight into the withered face before him what do you mean dont burn the carpet with your cigar said haken irrelevantly and when prelice stooped to pick it up he continued i should rather ask you that my boy you know something or else you wouldnt talk of my borrowing and of the exact sum which i required i know a great deal said the young man and sat down haken settled himself luxuriously in his chair let us hear all about it my boy said he is your glass filled your cigar all right good fire away i am in a mood for listening are you in the mood to face danger questioned the other man astonished at this coolness haken wrinkled his brows as a monkey does danger he repeated and from whom from madame marie from captain jadby and from dr horace i agree as to the first two said haken perfectly calm but i am sure that the lastnamed will not harm me in any way prelice reflected you are right he said thoughtfully horace is your friend and mine but the others yes i know all about the others interrupted haken in a level voice they have their own fish to fry and are not particular how big a blaze they make to fry them of course i expected you would find out did you and why why haken pushed back his chair and rose with a chuckle didnt sophia inveigle you into helping young shepworth and the girl he was engaged to you could scarcely do that and not cross my trail why didnt you confess to me asked prelice much vexed confess what that i murdered lanwin and that you stabbed agstone the deuce haken started at this last remark they accuse me of that do they i didnt know that they would go so far well he looked very straightly at his nephew and with very bright eyes you have no doubt heard what these people have had to say and no doubt they have manufactured good fiction out of certain facts my character i take it is as black as a crow blacker if anything no doubt well and what do you say i say that jadby and madame marie and possibly horace are liars haken walked round the table and placed his hand on his nephews shoulder do you believe that i am guilty certainly not why on what grounds prelice laughed he had always doubted the guilt of his uncle ever since the telling of it in rutland square now he was sure that however cleverly the story had been put together simon haken would be quite capable of reconstructing it so as to prove his innocence he therefore answered with a laugh on the grounds that you are much too clever a man to commit a murder without making things much safer than they appear to be in this instance thank you said haken simply and after a friendly squeeze of prelices shoulder he returned to his seat a weaker man would have required a more emotional denial but haken was too strong and too businesslike to trouble about sentiment you see he remarked when again in his chair it would not have suited me to murder lanwin no assented prelice tickled by the remark murder in this country is attended with certain disadvantages haken chuckled and drank a second glass of port in spite of his nonchalance he was more nervous than he chose to admit now tell me how our friends bring home the crime to me and why they told you about the business i shall tell you the whole case from the beginning said prelice after a pause my connection with it began when aunt sophia came to bully me into doing something haken nodded sympathetically when your aunt interferes there is generally trouble well prelice settled himself to work and recounted the whole story ending with his parting from madame marie on the stairs of horaces house and the oath upon the crucifix haken smoked quietly while the narrative proceeded merely raising his eyebrows when he heard how ingeniously the fortuneteller and jadby proved his guilt when prelice concluded haken chuckled and passed the port have another glass my boy he said quietly you must be dry over that talking all the same prelice noted that the perspiration was beading the old mans brow and that he was exercising considerable will power to keep himself in hand while prelice sipped his fresh glass of wine haken walked up and down the length of the diningroom keeping silent after quite five minutes he began to talk still walking steadily i should have come to you for that money he said in a conversational tone only that i dont like taking advantage of my wifes relatives i needed fifty thousand pounds badly and when lanwin refused to lend the money i scarcely knew what to do however the cash turned up unexpectedly although i had to make a sacrifice to get it i calculate that i shall have to pay cent per cent for that money however it is worth it the worst is over and everything is going swimmingly i shall have no further trouble so dont look glum prelice oh im not afraid of your finances said the young man quickly as i know your head for figures and know also that the soundest men in the city have their money troubles on occasions but i am thinking of your being in the power of these wretches that is added prelice correcting himself in the power of jadby i dont think that madame marie is so bad and horace is gruff but honest oh horace is all right but marie is as bad as they make them nonsense she wants to help me selfishly in order to secure jadby she must make use of you otherwise you could go hang but i must tell you that portions of her story and jadbys story and that of horace are correct i got the herb in the way you heard and i did go down to hythe to see lanwin were you in the library when madame marie went to bed i was admitted haken coolly but by that time lanwin had not commenced his hankypanky with the herb i asked him straight out to lend the money he refused with a word or two of abuse so i walked away and back to folkstone where i was stopping there was no row as i disdained to reply to lanwins coarse language madame marie left the library at five minutes after nine by fifteen minutes past i left it also and by the window on my way to folkstone what happened after i left i cannot say what was lanwin doing when you left fiddling with his herbs he came and shut the window after i had gone and shouted out a word or two as i departed do you suspect anyone of the crime haken shrugged his shoulders unless it was jadbyno he replied thoughtfully jadby was in london and did not return until later you heard his evidence in court then agstone must be guilty agstone certainly hated his master said haken why prelice looked astonished i understood that agstone was devoted to sir oliver so lanwin said and everyone believed but the fact isas i learned from madame mariethat agstone was lanwins slave sir oliver knew something about him which he used as a threat and so kept him in bondage lanwin was not a pleasant character ended the city man twirling his cigar oh prelice sunk his chin in his breast and thought he knew well enough that so far as the evidence of the knife was concerned agstone could not possibly be guilty nevertheless since agstone had brought the missing will to his brotherand the assassin could only have procured that willit would seem that the old sailor after all had struck the blow but why had he tried to put the blame on mona both by placing the knife in her hand and by accusing her did madame marie say that agstone hated mona asked prelice raising his head no on the contrary i understand that agstone liked miss chent because she was kind to him sir oliver however was of a jealous disposition and agstone was afraid to display his liking do you suppose that madame marie herself killed lanwin certainly not she had nothing to gain by doing so and moreover lost a valuable client by lanwins death marie is fond of money too she wants to make all she can so as to marry jadby she is strangely infatuated with that rascal jadby is goodlooking in a way replied prelice humph it seems to me that we are as far as ever from learning the truth no doubt assented his uncle still one thing is certain that i did not kill lanwin as to agstone he hesitated you are not going to confess that you killed him said prelice with a wry smile haken chuckled no i never tell unnecessary lies but i certainly saw him dead and shepworth insensible oh prelice was quite unmoved so you did make use of that key no said haken again and unexpectedly there was no need to i went down intending to remonstrate with shepworth on behalf of rover and found that the door was unfastened i entered and sawwhat you sawso at once i came upstairs reclosing the door as i had found it why didnt you give the alarm what with jadby hanging about already intending to blackmail me for lanwins death i should have given myself into the hands of the philistines with a vengeance had i raised the alarm i see so jadby was the continental swell whom you told me that you were to meet yes he insisted upon seeing me at the ball why he chose such a place i dont know and how he got to the ball i cant imagine oh that was easy remember the masks jadby had only to assume a mask and domino and could slip in easily but this dress i didnt wear it interrupted haken quickly womans disguise is the last thing i should think of assuming with my figure and face to say nothing of my age its my opinion he paused well well questioned prelice impatiently that madame marie wore the dress herself but how could she come to the ball constance never invited her you answered that question yourself a few minutes ago with reference to jadby madame marie could easily have slipped on a mask and domino and have come to the ball to meet jadby probably she wore that dress to implicate constance and concealed it in rovers dressingroom to bring him into the matter remember madame marie herself told you where the sham dress was to be found yes assented lord prelice thoughtfully but how did madame marie learn what kind of a costume constance would wear rover told her yes he came to me about constances love for shepworth and told me that in his efforts to gain his wifes love he had gone to see if madame marie could give him a philter of sorts infernally silly to act in that way nowadays madame marie told him to learn the exact costume which constance would wear at the ballyou see constance was keeping her style of dress a secret even from her husbandso that rover could watch if she went down to see shepworth rover learned about the dress from constances dressmaker and told me and also told madame marie it was easy then for madame marie to get the frock imitated and slip down to shepworths flat by doing that she managed to kill agstone to implicate young shepworth and to throw the blame on constance a confoundedly clever woman is marie eppingrave ended haken chuckling lord prelice rose thoughtfully the further we go into this case the more complicated does it become he remarked certainly agstone knowing madame marie would bring her into the room while not knowing constance he would not then again madame marie knew about the herb and constance did not it would seem he stopped and walked abruptly to the door i must sleep on this he said wearily but you know that i am innocent now that i have explained said the old man following and speaking anxiously he liked prelice and did not wish him to have a bad opinion of his uncle by marriage prelice grasped hakens hand i believed in your innocence before you gave the explanation he replied wish my aunt goodnight for me uncle simon i am going home to think over things your aunt will be annoyed not so much as i will be if i listen to her scolding goodnight haken grumbled a trifle at being left to explain to lady sophia but on going to the drawingroom he found that his wife had gone to a concert in park lane thus he was saved the trouble of making things smooth and went to bed very thankfully haken was not a young man and the interview with prelice had shaken him greatly meanwhile prelice himself had driven straight to his rooms and had gone immediately to bed thinking that he could better argue out the case as it stood when lying down than when sitting or standing but he was so weary with talk and with the strain of the last few days that he fell sound asleep before he could arrive at any conclusion regarding the guilt or innocence of madame marie it seemed to him that he had only been resting for five minutes when his valet woke him in the morning at nine oclock woke him also in a most unpleasant manner by presenting a telegram prelice half awake tore open the orangehued envelope but he was wide awake when he finished reading the news it contained the wire proved to be from mrs blexey miss mona has disappeared that was all the wire said but it was quite enough chapter xxiii helpless at lanwin grange all was confusion about twelve oclock on the previous day mona had left the house with the intention of going to folkstone to interview lady sophia she was unaware that this formidable personage had returned to london and wished to explain how much she loved lord prelice so that lady sophia might offer no opposition to the marriage from the time that she had left the grange she had not been seen mrs blexey was not alarmed until her young mistress failed to return to dinner as she had promised then the housekeeper had sent a groom with a dogcart over to the folkstone hotel at which lady sophia was supposed to be stopping the man had returned with the information that miss chent had not been seen at the hotel and that lady sophia haken had gone back to london it was then that mrs blexey grew terrified whatever will his lordship and mr shepworth say she wailed they will be fit to take the skin off me the butler advised an immediate wire to both the young gentlemen but mrs blexey hoping to save the situation refused to listen alleging that perhaps miss mona walking across the downs towards folkstone had lost herself but when the night passed and still the girl did not put in an appearance the housekeeper was compelled to send telegrams to prelice and the barrister the two friends oddly enough met at charingcross station to go down by the same train naturally they secured a firstclass carriage in order to talk over the disappearance of miss chent what do you think about it asked shepworth anxiously it is a new move on the part of that blackguard jadby replied the other between his teeth but would he dare he would dare anything to gain his ends he tried to shoot you and now he has kidnapped mona are you sure of that dorry what other explanation can there be ned mona has not returned and she never went near the piccadilly hotel in folkstone where my aunt has been staying i expect after our meeting at horaces this scoundrel came down and watched for an opportunity to get mona by herself then he kidnapped her but he could not do that alone and in england no doubt he had help of some sort and the downs are lonely besides he threatened at horaces to do me an injury and what greater one could he inflict than to carry off mona also madame marie hinted that jadby would strike at me through the girl i love by the way i have sent a special messenger to bring that lady down to hythe for what reason dorry madame marie said prelice quietly may be a bad woman uncle simon says that she is all the same she loves that jadby beast and will move heaven and earth to secure him if he has carried off monaas i suspectmadame marie will help me how can she she can go into a trance and see where mona is hidden shepworth raised his eyebrows dorry do you really believe in these magical things there is no magic about them retorted lord prelice bluntly save to people who cant see farther than their noses everything works under welldefined laws both in the seen and in the unseen worlds it only needs a person to learn and understand these laws to work what the unthinking call miracles and you believe that this woman yes i do interrupted prelice impatiently you have only to look into madame maries eyes to see that she has the sight she may be a bad lot as uncle simon says but there are black magicians as well as white ones but there he ended abruptly i am only talking in high dutch to you i confess that i am not superstitious said shepworth thoughtfully occult powers have nothing to do with superstition said prelice in a calm and decisive way everything is law as i tell you and when the law is known certain things can be done by means of the sacred herb the spiritthat is the astral bodycan part from the flesh and go where it will when madame marie arrives at the grange i shall make her help me in that way she will be quite willing if only to thwart jadby but there prelice again brushed away his words with a gesture i have explained enough to a sceptic such as you are let us talk of other matters what do you intend to do about constance shepworth coloured and looked out of the window at the landscape which was flying past dreamfashion i do not like to discuss mrs rover even to you prelice he said stiffly ned answered his friend dont be a fool if you had confided in me when we first met in geddys restaurant a great deal of trouble might have been avoided besides you told mona why should you not tell me and prelice waited for a reply i only told mona that i loved constance said shepworth after an uneasy pause naturally i didnt like to say too much i quite understand but the fact remains that you love constance and that constance loves you she is a married woman unfortunately for me said shepworth bitterly and unfortunately for her also seeing that she is tied to a man who hates her more than he loves her rovers pride is wounded ned by his wifes preference for you and hell make trouble i see that and i wish to avoid trouble for constances sake but what can i do you can move from alexander mansions for one thing and take a trip to the colonies for another rover may die there is no chance pooh said prelice contemptuously the mans a bloodless little rat and look at those dilated eyes of hislike those of a fierce rabbit if there is such a thing in nature i shouldnt be at all surprised if rover pegged out unexpectedly he doesnt motor nor golf nor bicycle nor shootin fact he avoids all excitements so aunt sophia told me that shows how weak his heart is depend upon it no no said shepworth impatiently even for constance i do not want to build my future happiness on a mans death i shall take your advice and go to australia for a few years it will be better for me and for constance since here we can only look at one another and dare not meet much less speak save in the presence of others but there has been no scandal since rovers marriage and so far as im concerned there shall be no scandal there we have talked enough poor old chap said prelice leaning forward to shake shepworths hand youre having a deuce of a time your karma oh hang your theosophy very good one wastes words in speaking to the deaf besides the matter of monas rescue is more important than anything else hang it how slow this beastly train is this was hard on the engine driver who was doing his best and actually was sending along the train at top speed but had prelice been mounted on a flying bombshell he would have found its speed too slow since his thoughts outstripping all other means of locomotion had flown long since to the house in the hollow however the longest rivers get to the sea in the end and the young men found themselves on hythe platform a motor carordered in advance by wirewaited them and they were soon buzzing upward to lanwin grange on arriving at the great mansion they were met by mrs blexey all tears and lamentation but prelice in his stiff military manner soon reduced her to commonsense talk and learned that although every inquiry had been made and every possible place searched as yet mona had not been found she had disappeared as completely as a dewdrop does in the ocean even the local police could do nothing which is just like the local police growled prelice i say ned you take the car and scout over the downs somewhere about there jadby may hold her prisoner oh sir wailed mrs blexey do you think that such a nasty man has run away with miss mona it is the sole solution of her disappearance that i can think of mrs blexey there there dont talk any more ned you go round the downs and use the car for speed ill wait until the arrival of madame marie and then search folkstone humph prelice looked sharply at ned do you know if jadby has a boat or a yacht or a steamer of any sort yes said shepworth starting to his feet now you mention it i did hear him say to sir oliver that he had a small steamer anchored in the thames but i cant give particulars never mind ill set the police to work on this possible clue if that steamer has been brought round to folkstone harbour you may be sure that mona is held prisoner on board but if this is so and jadby has gone off to the south seaswhich is just what he would doill borrow uncle simons yacht twin screw triple expansion and a devil to go ill follow jadby to polynesia and to hell if necessary ended lord prelice grimly arrangements being thus made shepworth went off in the car with a policeman who knew the neighbourhood and with the chauffeur who was a magnificent driverand driving of the best was needed on the rolling uplands of the downs prelice left behind waited for madame marie and in the meantime asked mrs blexey about the herb which horace had given to the girl was it a small white parcel asked the housekeeper yes it contained some roots and leaves miss mona took it with her explained mrs blexey she asked me to make a linen bag and then sewed it inside her dress good said prelice adding to himself if she has the herb and can make use of it she may render jadby insensible and escape the reflection that mona had this means of protection quietened him somewhat but his anxiety rose again to fever heat when madame marie appeared on this woman and on her occult powers depended the chance of saving mona but had prelice told this to the police he would have been jeered at however he had his own methods of going about things and it was not needful for him to expose himself to ridicule he watched anxiously for the fortuneteller and was amazed when she arrived in the unexpected company of mr dolly rover what the devil are you doing here asked prelice rudely i shall tell you said the little man very deliberately and looking at the other with his dilated blue eyes this morning i went to see madame marie about my wife she loves shepworth and i want shepworth removed out of her path and mine did you propose murder to madame asked prelice coolly no replied rover with a shudder while the fortuneteller sat down but i wished captain jadby to marry miss chent the deuce you did to shepworth that is i fancied that jadby could manage the business and i offeredthrough madame marie herea sum of money if the marriage could be brought about oh indeed and did madame marie tell you i told him nothing interrupted the woman in her deep voice i never intended to without your permission as i said that i was your friend your wire came while mr rover and myself were talkingthat is your messenger cameso i brought mr rover down with me and i came to help to find miss chent said rover hurriedly i want her to be found and married to shepworth any money i can offer to help in the search i have ample money to deal with the matter said prelice pleased to find that the fortuneteller had respected his confidence about the new engagement but i dont see why you need have applied to jadby to bring about this marriage because i know that jadby loves miss chent and wants to marry her lord prelice as you know that would not remove shepworth beyond my wifes reach i wished to bribe jadby into letting shepworth marry miss chent as was arranged then my wife all right all right cried lord prelice irritably dont worry your head rover ill see to this and you had better clear off back to london jadby is a rough customer and if we get involved in a row it will be bad for your heart my dear lord prelice yes anyone can seeoh pooh dont worry me my heart is weak said rover with dignity and my wifes behaviour is not likely to make it strong nevertheless i shall wait and help in the search for miss chent and bribe jadby as i said he must not marry this young lady he wont madame assured him coolly he shall marry me prelice turned to the fortuneteller will you go into a trance and see where mona is i have already been in a trance before leaving bond street then you know madame looked at him unflinchingly i could see nothing but clouds and clouds and clouds she responded only one thing i am certain of and that is that miss chent is hidden somewhere amongst these downs prelice shrugged his shoulders much good that information does i quite believe it but where i cant say but added madame marie with animation i can tell you that the steamer which felix owns is coming round to folkstone harbour this afternoon felix asked me two days ago to tell his captain to take the boat round i didnt know why he wished that i can understand now so can i rejoined lord prelice quickly jadby intends to take miss chent to the steamer at nightfall and do a bunk yes replied the fortuneteller breathing hard leaving me in the lurch but he shanthe shant ill kill him first the young man looked at her curiously and wished to ask her if she had killed agstone but he did not think that it was wise to irritate her at so critical a moment so merely asked what is the name of the steamer the kanaro that is the name of one of the easter island statues which are worshipped by the natives jadby seems to be very closely connected with easter island he certainly has made good use of the sacred herb what do you mean asked madame marie angrily nothing replied prelice wondering why she should grow so angry but i think that we have talked enough mr shepworth is exploring the downs in a motor car so you and mr rover here can go also if you like yes yes said the fortuneteller eagerly and with very bright eyes we can do that but i would rather go alone no said dolly piping out his decision i wish to aid in finding miss chent i must get her married to shepworth very good said prelice with a short laugh go and hunt i shall go into folkstone and see after the kanaro describe her madame the woman did so at once and prelice left the house an hour later with a full knowledge of what kind of a boat jadby owned walking to hythe he took the train to sandgate and then used the funicular to reach the leas here he swept the horizon and the harbour with his marineglass to seek for the steamer in which jadby intended to fly with mona chent but he could see no sign of the boat had prelice been absolutely wise he would have gone to the police station to engage a couple of constables to board the vessel but he preferred to trust in his own strong arm and in his own wits which had hitherto served him excellently also unless the constables had a warrant they could not board the yacht if refused permission it was better thought the young man to go alone and interview the captain if jadby was not open to argument the captain might be and an intimation that the law would be put in force if miss chent was kidnapped might prevent the commander of the kanaro from risking his own liberty and the liberty of his crew so prelice went down to the harbour and watched for the coming of the steamer to his surprise he found that she had arrived an hour since and was anchored some distance away from the land there was no doubt that this was the kanaro as not only did she correspond to the description given by the fortuneteller but by means of the glass he saw the name on her stern lord prelice acted promptly and engaged a boat to be rowed on board the steamer when he climbed up the rope ladder hanging over the side he was greeted unceremoniously by a roughlooking man in a nondescript sort of uniform in reply prelice handed his card upon which the officers manner changed to one of courtesy he conducted lord prelice to a richly furnished cabin and removed his cap with an explanation i know your name my lord he said politely madame marie mentioned it to me i am captain brisson in command of this yacht it belongs to captain jadby brisson shrugged his heavy shoulders so he says my lord but i think that it is the property of madame marie herself still as captain jadby is to marry her they can both own it captain jadby wants to marry a young lady whom he is kidnapping was prelices sharp reply and if you aid him to do so the law stop sir said brisson rising my first mate said something of this today ill bring him in and he tramped heavily out prelice waited but the man did not return then he tried the door of the cabin and found it locked it flashed across him at once that he had been trapped chapter xxiv the beginning of the end after a strong word or two prelice sat down philosophically to consider his position a weaker man might have raged aimlessly and have wasted his strength in battering at the closed door but lord prelice was too wise to kick against the pricks he had been trapped sure enough and he did not see any way out of the trap no one knew where he was save the boatman who had brought him and even as this thought came into his mind he heard the raucous voice of brisson telling the man that his passenger would remain on board more than this brisson paid the waterman and sent him away until the hue and cry was raised the owner of the boat would say nothing so it was absolutely certain that prelice would have to remain in durance vile without hope of immediate rescue the situation however was not devoid of certain consolations without doubt jadbys plan was to bring mona on board the kanaro and steam away with her to polynesia prelice at all events would be on the same boat as the girl and if it came to fighting with jadby he felt certain that he could hold his own moreover if as brisson declared the yacht belonged to madame marie he as her captain owed fealty to her rather than to jadby and the fortuneteller certainly would not allow her steamer to carry mona chent to the south seas to be the bride of her precious felix no things on reflection were not so bad after all in any case prelice felt that he was in the thick of the whole villainous business and soon would be within arms length of mona when she was dragged on board by her scoundrelly kidnapper it would then be the time to act prelice lovingly fingered a revolver which he had strapped behind him and wondered if it would be necessary to use it the weapon formed a strange addition to the very civilised suit of tweeds which he wore and was out of place in sober lawabiding england but then danger and murder and sudden death had entered into his life and it was necessary to prepare for emergencies i am not a bloodthirsty man said prelice while seeing that his gun was well loaded and worked without a hitch but i should like one clean shot at felix jadby and it may be mentioned that if the shooting took place prelice would probably hit the bulls eyes represented by the buccaneer he was a clean shot and very quick with his weapon as those who inhabited uncivilised parts knew from experience the afternoon wore on to six oclock and still prelice was left alone in his floating dungeon probably brisson did not desire a personal explanation knowing that he could not make any very pertinent reply to this breaking of the law and it was possible that he preferred to leave the explanation to jadby when he arrived with his prey personally prelice cared very little he knew that mona was safe though in the power of a scoundrel for she was a brave girl and a religious girl who firmly believed in god so did prelice and he was quite content to think that god who was slightly stronger than felix jadby would look after his angel this being so and the young man knowing that god would bring everything to pass for the best in his own good time prelice quietly smoked cigarette after cigarette throughout that weary afternoon then he stretched himself on the divan and went to sleep wondering how ned was getting on with his search and what madame marie and rover were doing he was awakened about eight oclock by a bright light and a sense that someone was looking steadily at him with a yawn he opened his eyes and saw that a steward was lighting the swing lamp over the central table and that captain brisson was looking down upon him the sailor had a rugged but somewhat goodnatured face and possessed an extraordinary athletic figure which promised well for fighting purposes well said prelice swinging his legs on to the floor are you going to starve me brisson burst into a horselaugh while his unwilling guest blinked and rubbed his eyes youre a plucky chap my lord said he approvingly thanks awfully but i prefer food to compliments im just about to eat myself hurry up steward then when the man had gone out brisson threw his cap on a chair and resumed you wonder maybe why i keep you here no said prelice stretching himself its all in the game what game asked brisson abruptly the very dangerous one you are playing along with jadby and your mistress with dr horace too for all i know i never met horace whoever he may be retorted brisson gruffly but all i know of the game is that i have to obey orders if you break owners finished prelice remembering the saying and you will break them before youve done none of your larks my lord ive got a gun so have i answered prelice loaded in all six chambers but you need make no mistake brisson i intend to stop here and see the game out to the end captain jadby and i have to settle accounts what sort of accounts well jadby is kidnapping the lady to whom i am engaged you cant expect me to stand that i guess not assented brisson agreeably im hitched up with a girl of spirit myself and if anyone dare to he clenched his huge fist looking pistols and daggers and maxim guns thats the proper spirit brisson by the way prelice got out a cigarette you might tell me how much you know of this business very little i reckon answered the captain more and more puzzled by the young mans coolness jadby and madame came to london some months ago and she started the fortunetelling racket while he went to see his uncle i anchored the boat in thames river and went a loaf round the coast at times to keep the barky in trim then the other day madame sends a message that im to bring the kanaro round here which i have done now im waiting for further orders when jadby comes on board with miss chent brisson nodded but i dont take any orders from any son of a seacook you can bet your boots madames owner and she wants to run in double harness with jadby rum though her taste may be if hes skipping with a girl thats madames lookout i dont sail until she gives the office prelice nodded his approval in that case jadby will get left he remarked coolly for hes trying to play low down on madame marie by the way if you know so little of the game why detain me well said brisson scratching his head madame visited the yacht at times when we were swinging off gravesend she told me there was some trouble over these murders you know about them only what i read in the papers but madame said that you were taking a hand in the meddling way and that shed like to keep you out of the whole business as i like madamewho is a dandy fine woman with a temperi put you in quod the moment i heard your name you must stop here my lord until madame comes on board you have acted in a somewhat highhanded manner and without any instructions to go upon said prelice calmly if i wanted to make a row i could not in this ship growled brisson oh i think so yonder is the porthole and there isnt very much distance between this boat and the shore also there are other steamers lying at anchor close at hand not to speak of my boatman having been in a position to be spoken to from the porthole i could fire a shot or two and rouse the harbour and i could have hailed my boatman before you sent him away i did none of these things and why because i am in the very position i wish to be in jadby is coming on board and i want to meet jadby and to rescue the girl to rescue the young lady corrected prelice coldly if you attempt to clear out with miss chent ill make it hot for you what can you do what i said i have my revolver see prelice whipped out his weapon before brisson could move i have you covered what is to prevent me from shooting you and racing on deck to swim ashore the captain did not move a muscle you can put the gun down my lord said he with a note of admiration in his voice i promise you that i wont steam for the southern cross until madame gives the word madame wont come on board then i wait until she does retorted brisson will you put that gun down or am i to be shot you are more use to me alive than dead said prelice and slipped his derringer behind him handy for the grip but i see the tea is on the table im infernally hungry brisson smacked his great thigh and looked at prelice with much admiration guess youll come home on the winner said he as they sat at table and i should just love to see you get the bulge on that son of a seacook meaning jadby meaning jadby assented brisson gravely have some salt tack the hungry guest assented very readily and ate a decent meal of extremely bad sea food prelice was not fastidious when in the wilds and passed over the table like a prairie fire at the conclusion of the meal brisson mixed him a tot of rum and handed along a box of very good cigars which had never paid duty then to pass the time until jadby arrived they chatted amongst other things prelice learned that brisson had met sir oliver lanwin and did not like him the baronet had a bad record in the south seas i was in his service once growled brisson cutting up tobacco with a claspknife but he gave me the chuck cause i wouldnt pile up a schooner which hed insured for wrecking agstone did it though and he filled a dirty little pipe with the rank tobacco humph you knew agstone brisson nodded he was a fairytale pirate was agstone said he lord i could put in the night yarning about his doings murder amongst em too and he spat sir oliver knew of that and got the hang of aggy no wonder aggy got square with him do you mean to say that he murdered sir oliver you can hold on to that my lord sir oliver treated aggy like the old devil treats a holy man course i wouldnt swear to aggys knifing him in a court o law but it sounds like aggy wonderfully quick with his sticker was aggy and who do you think murdered agstone brisson leered youve got me there he confessed i cant lay my hand on the son of a gun that did that prelice nodded possibly agstone had turned on his tyrant to send him below but it was impossible to say who had sent agstone to join the baronet about madame marie now is that her real name he inquired oh yes marie eppingrave shes the daughter of a tahiti merchant and a french lady theres no halfcaste rubbish about madame you bet shes got cash toothis yacht and a slapup island all to herself why she wants to collect jadby into her life i dunno but there you cant understand womenfolk you like madame marie seeing she nursed me through a yellow fever bout and gave me this command i do said the man of the sea a good sort is madame with a temper of sorts of course as every woman should have shed knife a man as soon as look at him and nurse him square after her temper had busted wish shed knife jadby hes a rotten beachcomber humph prelice thought for the space of half a cigar and madame maries fortunetelling well i guess theres no explanation of that my lord shes got piles of cash but maybe her hearts in them hocuspocus things ive seen her do some rum business on occasions when she looks at you you feel cold water freezing your spine cant say id like to have her to be mrs brisson even if i put my old gal into her wooden overcoat but madame maries a dandy fine woman no mistake about that in suchlike conversation did the two wile away the time until ten oclock then they went on deck brisson was quite willing to allow prelice to accompany him as he had grown to like the young man and moreover was ready to take his word that he would not try to escape but prelice warned him that he would make trouble to save mona if needful and brisson being on the side of madame marie was agreeable that it should be so besides he had a sneaking liking for prelices somewhat stormy wooing and wished to help him perhaps a strong dislike for jadby had something to do with brissons attitude it was a perfect night lighted by a brilliant moon and countless stars a warm wind was blowing from the land and far up on the heights twinkled the innumerable lights of folkstone the kanaro rocked at anchor a stones throw from the shore and many other vessels of a less piratical nature were anchored in the harbour the water shone like a sheet of silver and the green and red ridinglights of the ships glittered in the sheeny depths prelice leaned over the side of the boat and strained his eyes to see if any craft was approaching the kanaro but for quite halfanhour he beheld nothing however he was tolerably certain that jadby would come carrying mona with him and felt if his revolver was ready in his hippocket if need be he was resolved to shoot the buccaneer and who can blame him considering how basely jadby had acted it was when the clock from the church tower boomed out eleven that the trouble came brisson laid his big hand on prelices arm and pointed to a boat which was putting off from a somewhat deserted part of the shore three figures were in it two rowing and one seated holding the tillerropes the rowers were labouring hard to reach the kanaro and prelice saw through his glass that other figures on the land were launching another boat to follow theres going to be a holy show swore brisson under his breath i wish he fingered his revolver but did not dare to use it the place was too civilised the first boat came on swiftly and prelice discerned that jadby was rowing with the other man and that madame marie was seated in the stern he could see nothing of mona and his heart thrilled as he thought from the presence of the second boat which had now put off that the girl had been saved and that her kidnapper was now being pursued brisson watched the race between the two boats and then ran on to the bridge prelice heard him shout to the engineer to start the enginesfor the boat had steam upand a minute later he heard the steady throbbing of the screw while a rush of men hastily pulled up the anchor apparently brisson saw that the only chance of safety for madame marie and jadby was to have the boat ready to start and risked the engines going before the anchor was up indeed this latter took so much time and time was so precious that he shouted out to let the anchor slip and the roar of the chain showed that his orders had been obeyed meanwhile many people were rushing to and fro on the shore it was apparent that everyone knew something untowards was going on and that there was intense excitement already other boats were putting off and brisson was cursing like the old salt he was at the danger of his beloved mistress the first boat swung near the side of the yacht and brisson raced from the bridge to the side to shake out the rope ladder madame marie rose to grip the rope but in a moment jadby was on his feet and catching her round the waist had thrown her into the sea brisson gave a cry of wrath and as jadby placed his hand on the ladder he leaned over fumbling behind with his hand the next moment there was a clear sharp crack of a revolver and jadby with a wild cry fell off the ladder into the sea the boatman cowered in his craft and prelice could see the head of madame marie appear some distance away as she came to the surface and drifted with the tide on witnessing the sudden catastrophe the second boat rowed towards the drowning woman brisson uttered a shout of rage as madame marie was pulled into the boat and ran up again on to the bridge damn it theyve got her he yelled and twirled the dial to full speed ahead then he sprang to the wheel and wrenched it out of the steersmans hands prelice soon saw what he meant the kanaro bore straight down on to the boat brisson was evidently prepared to kill his mistress rather than let her fall into the hands of her enemies a shout of dismay arose from the boat as the great bulk of the yacht swung forward in a flash prelice took his choice and poised his revolver at the mad captain there was a crack of the revolver a cry from brisson and he went down like a shot while the boat swung helplessly in the harbour the engines working powerfully but the wheel swinging idly two or three sailors seeing that prelice had shot the skipper came towards him with a rush the young man did not lose time he jumped on the taffrail and dived straight into the silver tide as he rose to the surface the crew flung belayingpins and spars and bits of coal lying on the deck at him one man with a straighter aim than the others hit prelice with a lump of hard coal the young man uttered a gasping cry and flinging up his hands went down his last look was at the yacht and he saw that she swung round and was heading full speed for the entrance to the harbour chapter xxv explanations when lord prelice recovered his senses he opened his eyes in a comfortable room on a comfortable bed and saw as in a dream that ned was seated beside him his head felt confused and sore but he regained sufficient command of his wits to recognise his friend where am i ned he asked in a feeble voice and put up a weak hand to his head which was bandaged at lanwin grange replied shepworth quietly thinking it best to explain reasonably and glad to think that prelice was sane the knock on his head had been a nasty one who pulled me out of the water one of the boats that followed us picked you up when you rose for the second time you have had a narrow escape from death dorry mona asked prelice closing his eyes she is all right but somewhat shaken after her experiences with that blackguard jadby what of him deadshot through the heart his body was found and now lies at folkstone awaiting the inquest and brisson the man who shot him oh brisson did that did he said shepworth hes got a good eye and saved us a lot of trouble well brisson and the kanaro have gone into the wide world i expect hes on the high seas making for polynesia and wont be caught i hope not for after all he only saved jadby from the hangman why what did jadby do he murdered dolly rover ned do you mean to say i mean to say nothing just now try and go to sleep here drink this first you are still weak hang it dorry you have been unconscious for twentyfour hours and heaps has happened one last question and then ill sleep said prelice who felt that he was weak from loss of blood madame marie dead she killed herself after confessing confessing what many things go to sleep dorry i tell you prelice did not answer but closed his eyes with a groan feeling very stiff and sore and wonderfully weary but sleep the great healer soothed his too restless brain and mended his broken body so that he woke again after hours of slumber feeling hungry and refreshed and eager to learn all that had taken place it was candlelight when he closed his eyes but the sun was shining into the room when he opened them again and beside his bed ned had been replaced by mona she was hanging over him like a mother over her firstborn and uttered a coo of satisfaction when he looked at her and smiled monadarling said the sick man thrusting out one weak hand she kissed it and tucked it again under the clothes go to sleep prelice feeling ever so much stronger objected to being treated like an infant sweet though it was when mona was the nurse i have had enough sleep he said yawning one can overdo laziness my dear girl besides i am hungry ah mona laughed you cant live on love no said prelice ruefully i am too earthly now breakfast is waiting come let me place this pillow behind you and smooth the clothes so and and kiss me so said the invalid suiting the action to the word the future lady prelice tapped his cheek in pretended displeasure and went to the door in another minute she returned followed by mrs blexey bearing a tray which she placed before the hungry young man coffee and cream two lightly biled eggs thin bread and butter and honey from our own bees said mrs blexey arranging the tray i hope that your lordship is better my lordship is starving mrs blexey and no wonder sighed the housekeeper placing one fat hand on her ample breast you aint had anything for hours and hours my dear if youll excuse my boldness in calling you so and to think of all the terrible things that had happened while you were lying there as pretty and neat as though you were in your coffin and blexey youre a ghoul go away said mona imperiously im a united inhabitant of the celestial regions said mrs blexey with dignity but i see that you want to feed him my dear lady may the dear lord bless your marriage and happy i am that i should have lived to see this day she waited for a reply but mona was too busy assisting prelice with his breakfast to answer and the young man was too busy admiring mona to worry about the stout housekeeper so she heaved a sigh and retired in a flood of tears as she thought how happy they would be it was an odd way of showing her joy but mrs blexey after the manner of her class wept indiscriminately for a wedding or for a funeral mona dearest and best said prelice when half way through his second egg i am a selfish beast you are looking tired and here i am letting you feed me i am not tired at all denied the girl vigorously but my nerves are a trifle out of order after what i have undergone hush eat your breakfast you tiresome boy will you give me a kiss if i drink another cup of coffee no ill give you a cigarette then you can sleep and get up at midday mr shepworth and mr martaban want to see you on business why do you speak of ned so stiffly mona i am engaged to you now she replied demurely that doesnt mean poor ned is to be left out in the cold he wont i expect that hell marry mrs rover after her months of mourning are over ah yes ned mentioned that jadby had murdered dolly how did it happen mona my dear the girl shuddered and took away the tray i dont think captain jadby meant to kill him she said in a low voice madame marie denies that he did but mr rovers heart was weak and so give me that cigarette and tell me all about it from the beginning dear said prelice coaxingly mona did as she was asked as he really now looked much the better for the food and the nights rest in fact prelice was in such good spirits that he apologised for his untidy appearance i must look a regular bill sikes with this rough chin he said passing his hand over his face oh how delicious this cigarette is well ill tell you all as quickly as i can said miss chent sitting beside him and allowing him to hold her hand on the principle that sick people must be humoured you know that captain jadby carried me off in a motor car infernal insolence hush george the poor wretch is dead so i forgive him everything all right ill try and be a christian such as you are although it is not easy fire ahead i started to walk to hythe to catch the train to folkstone in order to see lady sophia explained mona slowly i did not know that she had returned to london just as i got into the belt of woods between hythe and the downs a motor car met me coming up captain jadby was driving it didnt know he could drive growled prelice restlessly oh yes uncle oliver talked of having a motor and asked his son to learn driving so that he might take him about with him and in fact i think that uncle oliver presented this motor to captain jadby when he learned how to handle the machine didnt your uncle tell you that he did no and yes that is he let slip a word or two but what does it matter captain jadby had this motor and a very good one it wasat least ned says so ned and not mr shepworth thats right darling and prelice patted her hand go on sweetest i cant if you keep interrupting said mona severely well then captain jadby got out and said that he was coming up to see me and while he was speaking to me he lighted a cigarette hang himconfound him but it wasnt a cigarette after all as i found went on miss chent hurriedly he had twisted up a leaf or two of the herb into the form of a cigarette and when it was lighted he suddenly seized me and held it smoking under my nose i screamed but no one was near to hear me and then i became rigid and helpless owing to the scantiness of the smoke i did not become quite insensible but fell into a cataleptic state as mr shepworth did and as you did in the library no for then i became quite insensible of course had not captain jadby tricked me by twisting the leaves into a sham cigarette i should have run away as it was the smoke seized me before i could do anything i became cataleptic as i said and could move neither hand nor foot although i was quite conscious all the time captain jadby put me into the car and arranged the rug round me then hemona hesitated and coloured hehe kissed me damn himhang himcurse him raged prelice banging on his pillow i wish he was alive that i could horsewhip him the beast the hush hush mona placed a cool hand over her lovers mouth he is now dead leave his punishment to god but you can fancy my feelings when owing to the herb i had to suffer his kiss faugh she passed a handkerchief across her mouth then while prelice swore under his breath she continued quickly so as to prevent another outbreak of anger captain jadby drove the motor up the hill and over the downs as i was conscious though helpless i carefully noted the way so that i might return if i escaped did you see anyone on the road or on the downs not a soul she replied we went far inland and then turned to one side captain jadby drove the car off the road and across the grass for over a mile it swayed and bumped but he is a wonderful driver and managed to prevent the car from overturning at last we came to a small hut in a hollow quite concealed from the surrounding country no one would have noted it for the side and chimney were built of turf and the roof was thatched with green rushes it looked quite like a part of the hollow itself and great grey stones were lying about on all sides captain jadby drove the car into some bushes and carried me into the hut he then sat me down and talked what did he say asked prelice frightfully pale and grinding his teeth i am bound to acknowledge said mona quietly that after the one kiss he behaved like a gentleman he told me that he would keep me here until the next evening when he intended to take me on board madame maries yacht and steam for the south seas i heard all he said but could not reply until the effects of the drug had worn off captain jadby had evidently prepared the place for my prison the door was strong and the one window was barred and then there was a girl to wait on me a girl prelice stared in great surprise yes i was astonished and thankful to see one of my own sex after captain jadby had explained that he intended to carry me off in the kanaro he went out and brought in the girl she was a native of the south seas very handsome and dark called vavi but could speak very little english captain jadby told me that the girl was madame maries maid and that he had brought her here to be my companion then he went away and i never saw him again until eight oclock the next eveningat least added mona correcting herself i fancy it was eight oclock but it might have been six or seven i lost all count of time so that was how i was kidnapped it was cleverly done said prelice caustically go on in about an hour i came out of the cataleptic state and tried to escape but the girl showed me a knife and intimated in her broken english that she would stab me if i did i tried to bribe her but she would not be bribed i had therefore to make the best of it as i was alone midst those lonely hills with a halfsavage woman for a companion all the same george i was not afraid i knew that you would look for me and that god was watching over me dear i thought the same prelice kissed her hand then i remembered the sacred herb which dr horace had given me i got it ready and when captain jadby came the next evening with the car to take me on board the kanaro which he told me was at folkstone i waited my opportunity vavi had been cookingthere was plenty of good food said mona in parenthesis and the fire had smouldered to red ashes when captain jadby entered he sent vavi away where she went i do not know but captain jadby sat by the fire and made me sit also we had two stools then he talked a lot of rubbish about loving me and of the necessity of getting away from madame marie he said that she was an old fool who loved him but that he intended to make use of her yacht and run away with me he finally said that by the time madame marie found him again in the south seas i would be his wife after that he called you names and i can guess the stuff he spouted said prelice contemptuously what about the herb did you make use of it yes when captain jadby was not looking at me but bending over the fire stirring it with his cane i dropped all the leaves on to the ashes a thick white smoke arose i got up quickly and sprang on captain jadbys shoulders to hold his nose over the smoke it caught him in a second and he received the full volume in his face i felt dizzy myself but managed to pull him back out of the fire and ran to the door it was not locked since vavi went out so i escaped into the open it was growing dark and i ran up the hill to get out of the hollow as quickly as i could and vavi with her knife asked prelice excitedly i never saw her i dont know where she went i ran without a hat or cloak up the hills and over the downs then i saw the road and struck out for that it was very late when i reached the grange and i fainted in mrs blexeys arms no wonder muttered prelice but thank god you tricked the beast and with the sacred herb too prelice chuckled you paid him out in his own coin but what happened next i cant tell you myself i can only repeat what ned told me he gathered a lot from madame marie when she confessed what did she say wait and ill tell you in an orderly manner george after i ran away vavi came back to the hut she found that i was gone and captain jadby insensible with the smoke instead of hunting for mevery luckilyshe set to work to revive him but could she seeing that the herb vavi said mona quickly came from easter island and knew all about the herb the priests there have a way of reviving those who go into such trances how vavi did it i dont know but she managed in an hour to bring captain jadby to his senses as soon as he got them he rushed out still half dizzy to search for me just as he left the hut he came upon madame marie and mr rover who had been searching on the downs for me yes yes i remember they started out well captain jadby thought in his dizziness and in the twilight that mr rover was you and seized him by the throat saying he would kill you rather than let you marry me madame marie tried to pull him off but captain jadby held on tight then vavi helped by madames command and they released mr rover he was dead prelice nodded i quite understand the poor devil had a weak heart and should not have mixed himself up in this business i told him that jadby was a rough customer strange how jadby has been the means of removing an obstacle from neds path well then what happened madame gave captain jadby something to revive him entirelysome drugsome antidote he became quite himself and was terrified when he saw what he had done madame insisted that he should fly with her from england lest he should be hanged for the murder of mr rover and made him get the car it was ready to take me to the kanaro if you remember but instead it took madame marie and vavi and captain jadby when they reached the road they met the car with mr shepworth who had been searching for me and were recognised perhaps ned took vavi for you perhaps he did in the twilight assented mona at all events neds chauffeur followed and then there was a race to folkstone harbour captain jadbys car was the best and he gained about ten minutes in the harbour he and madame seized a boat and leaving vavi on the shore they offered the boatman twenty pounds to row them to the kanaro he did and thenwell you know yes said prelice slowly and with a sigh jadby tried to kill that poor woman who loved him too well and brisson shot him i shot brisson when he tried to run down the boat in which ned was following and into which he had pulled madame marie i wish i had killed brisson but unfortunately i only winged him ended prelice regretfully i daresay hes all right now and sailing for the southern cross oh my dear dear angel he cried gathering mona into his arms what an escape let us thank god darling she said reverently and they both did with full hearts it was a very excellent beginning to the new life chapter xxvi a confession that afternoon prelice was up and dressed and seated in the drawingroom talking earnestly to martaban and ned shepworth his head was perfectly clear although still a trifle sore and he wore a picturesque bandage round it which added to his pale and interesting looks but the colour was gradually creeping back to his cheeks and he was well enough to hear further what had taken place since he had been rendered unconscious shepworth was lounging in the windowseat under one of the painted windows and it might have been the rosy light which came through this which made him look so happy and healthy on the other hand it might have been the consciousness that fate had opened the way to his marrying the woman he loved and who loved him he could not find it in his heart to regret rovers timely death the man had always behaved badly to his wife and had done his best to make her life a martyrdom now poor victim of a family sacrifice she would have a chance of being happy for the rest of her life mr martaban seated at the table with a few sheets of foolscap before him also looked happy and no wonder his beloved client miss mona chent had inherited the lovely old house and ten thousand a year and shortly was to become lady prelice a great change this from the time not so long ago when she had stood in the new bailey dock accused of murder and again the sheets of foolscap with which the lawyer fiddled contained a confession by madame marie eppingrave which entirely cleansed the name of miss chent from the stain of crime this is not the original document explained the delighted mr martaban to the anxious lord prelice inspector bruge has the original which was signed by marie eppingrave in his presence how did she come to make the confession i think it was because captain jadby was dead put in shepworth from his end of the room she held up until it was proved beyond all doubt that he had been shot through the heart theni supposeshe saw that life was not worth living without him and so decided to put an end to herself how did she manage it seeing that she was in custody oh she had some phial filled with poison about her i expect she had everything prepared to make away with herself should jadby have succeeded in kidnapping mona to the south seas however we stopped that thank heaven and madame marie confessed i wonder she did said prelice reflectively i think it was because she had a sneaking regard for you dorry said the barrister after a pause to the last she declared that she was your friend and hoped that you would be happy however she did confess and yonder is the copy of her confession what does it say questioned the other man i am about to read it to you said martaban gathering up the sheets skilfully or else if you prefer it i can give you a shorter account in the form of a story i should prefer that said prelice gravely i havent patience to wait to the end of that long screed to know the exact truth who murdered sir oliver tell me at once steve agstone inspired and coerced by madame marie humph so brisson was right after all commented prelice and who got rid of agstone captain jadby the deuce prelice raised himself on his couch did he wear that sham frock he did said shepworth quickly and being as you know slimly built i quite mistook him for a woman seeing how clever was the disguise martaban waved his hand impatiently as shepworth drew breath to continue his speech let me speak he said leaning back in his chair lord prelice you know of course that madame marie eppingrave was deeply in love with this man jadby yes brisson told me so and so did madame herself to make a long story short said martaban gathering up the papers and speaking with much deliberation this woman wished to marry jadby and as she was rich he was willing to do so then he decided to go to england and see if sir oliverhis father rememberwas keeping to his promise of leaving the money to his natural son madame marie supplied the cash for jadby to live in london and brought him there in her yachtthe kanarocommanded by captain brisson and the yacht was anchored in the thames until madame sent it round at jadbys request to folkstone for the kidnapping said prelice i know all that mr martaban continue the lawyer did so very willingly for some reasoni know not why seeing that she was wealthymadame marie took to telling fortunes in the bond street establishment jadby on the other hand came down to see his father in this house and here fell in love with miss chent he kept this secret from madame marie naturally fearing what she would say but she suspected something and insisted upon coming down to see sir oliver whom she had known in the south seas madame learned that lanwin was in favour of the match and therefore set herself to work to thwart it by every means in her power she implored sir oliver to allow miss chent to marry shepworth here thinking that we loved one another because of the sham engagement said the barrister quickly quite so quite so said mr martaban annoyed by the interruption i hinted at that before however sir oliver was bent upon his natural son inheriting the property and marrying his cousinas miss chent truly was miss chent refused and sir oliver drew out a new will of which madame marie knew it confirmed the will made in jadbys favour but what was the need of that asked prelice surprised wasnt the first will good enough oh yes but as it had been made in the south seas sir oliver thoughtvery wrongly in point of factthat there might be some flaw now lord prelice you can see that if jadby married miss chent the elder woman would lose him madame marie you mean yes yes i speak plainly do i not well then if jadby inherited the property madame marie lost him all the same as while he had money he would never marry her she therefore decided to destroy the third will which had not been signed andto have sir oliver murdered why didnt she stick him herself asked prelice a strange woman said the solicitor meditatively she would do much to gain her ends even employing a third person to commit a crime but for some feminine reason she would not stain her own hands with blood rather a quibble it is my lord it is however to continue as mr haken wished to borrow money from sir oliver and consulted madame marie about the same she used his confidence as a lever by which to obtain the leaves of the sacred herb from dr horace before that time he had refused her but he gave the herb to mr haken i dont know why i do said prelice below his breath and thinking of the openly expressed hatred which horace had proclaimed towards the dead man martaban took no notice of the interruption mr haken got the herb and gave it to madame marie who handed it to sir oliver on the day of the murder as you know jadby and shepworth quarrelled on that day yes said shepworth vigorously jadby learned about my love for a certain ladythrough madame marie i believeand threatened to make himself disagreeable i gave him a black eye and myself a sprained ankle then the murder took place yes said martaban and mr haken was in the library when i know interrupted prelice sharply my uncle told me but how did madame marie induce steve to murder his master it seems that she knew how agstone was wanted for certain other murders in the south seas said martaban glancing at the papers so she threatened to have him extradited unless he did her bidding he was i regret to say quite willing to do so as he hated sir oliver who treated him like a slave that said prelice emphatically i also know from brisson and then then when mr haken retired sir oliver burned the herb in a shallow bronze cupthe same as mr shepworth saw in his flatand went into a trance madame marie had arranged with agstone that he should watch at the window until sir oliver was insensible and then kill him the man did so with the jadehandled paperknife why wasnt agstone stifled with the smoke fumes because the smoke had died away when sir oliver was dead agstone heard a step and after setting fire to some more leaves he ran out of the window not the one opened by miss chent but another one he watched and saw miss chent enter saw also how she fainted with the acrid smoke he entered and placed her in the armchair where she was found it was then that madame marie came downstairs and into the room she snatched up the third will at which sir oliver had been looking before manipulating the herb and tearing it up flung it into the fire then she gave the will leaving everything to miss chentwhich lanwin had also been looking at to destroy i presumeto agstone and told him to take it up to his brother dr horace what for asked prelice surprised madame marie said she had no grudge against miss chent explained martaban and wanted the will placed safely out of jadbys way so that miss chent might inherit and that jadby might be kept poor one for mona and two for herself said prelice grimly but who placed the knife in monas hand agstone who hated her did a step was heardthat was shepworth coming downso madame marie ran out of the window and got back to her room by another door which agstone had left open the man waited to smear miss chents dressinggown with blood and to place the knife in her hand then mr shepworthso he sayssecured the knife and i know all that said prelice and understand the why and the wherefore of the first crime but the second that arose out of jadbys hatred for shepworth and his love for miss chent jadby learned the truth about the crime from agstone whom he found hiding in london under the protection of madame marie he threatened to denounce him to the police to save miss chent and then resolved to make use of him to incriminate shepworth and at the same time to kill him so that he might not come forward to give evidence against miss chent which agstone wanted to do but surely he would not have accused mona of a crime which he had committed himself said prelice indignantly yes he would said ned quickly he hated mona and sir oliver and madame marie and jadby and everyone the man was a caliban and to tell you the truth added shepworth candidly i dont think that his brother is much better ah said prelice suddenly did agstone confess the truth to horace no he did not he simply came and handed over the will as madame marie had instructed him and then cleared out he had to do what he was told or else he would have been hanged well i see now the alexander mansions crime martaban went on again glancing at the sheets madame marie learned about mrs rovers dress and told captain jadby so that he could get a double made which he did was she in favour of this second crime oh no for then miss chent would be set free to marry jadby she liked miss chent in a way but did not intend her to be an obstacle i dont believe that she liked mona at all snapped prelice irritably she saved the second will so that jadby might be made penniless and would have stopped the second crime from being committed so that mona might be condemned on agstones evidence a wicked woman she was all that assented martaban but allow me to proceed madame marie merely thought that jadby wished to be disguised to meet haken and told him about the dress knowing that haken intended to remonstrate with shepworth about his conduct which was perfectly correct cried ned indignantly but why in a dress like mrs rovers asked prelice puzzled martaban scratched his head i am not quite clear on that point he declared all i know is that madame marie wished to mix up things i believe that she had some clearly defined scheme in her head but what it was she did not explain nevertheless you can see how jadby came to the ball disguised yes but how did agstone enter i can tell you that said shepworth rising with a yawn jadby as you know called to see me early in the evening i opened the door to him as the servants were out he entered and i preceded him into the drawingroom he went back for his handkerchief which he said he had dropped in the hall and then must have set the door ajar while i talked to him agstone entered and concealed himself under the diningtable then jadby went to the ball in his disguise agstone set the herb burning and stifled me and afterwards admitted jadby in his disguise i was incriminated you see and jadby to make me quite insensible lest i should see too much waved the bronze cup under my nose when i was completely insensible he stabbed agstone with the knife which agstonehaving taken it from my deskhad intended to use on me finally jadby returned to the ball and concealed his dress in the cupboard in rovers dressingroom which was used on that night as a cloakroom afterwards he came down in a plain blue domino to clinch the fact that i had murdered agstone but you had bowled him out by then dorry there was a silence a strange story said prelice thoughtfully does inspector bruge know it yes and a carefully prepared account suppressing certain facts has been sent to the newspapers said martaban folding up the sheets you can be certain now lord prelice that in two days all london will learn the truth and that miss chent will be looked upon as a martyr quite so but i trust in a month or so she will be looked upon as my very dear and loving wife loud cheers cried ned adopting prelices favourite expression chapter xxvii alls well that ends well the title of shakespeares comedy quite suited the present state of affairs at the grange seeing that the worst was over within a week everything was put straight the inquests on madame marie on dolly rover and on felix jadby lead to a disclosure of the whole strange story in the newspapers luckily owing to strong influence being brought to bear the painful love story of shepworth and mrs rover was suppressed and it was supposed that merely the desire to save miss chent had led dolly to that lonely hut where he met with his death indeed the little man became somewhat of a hero andas the saying goesnothing in life became him better than his manner of leaving it the public followed his body to the grave with eulogistic comments and dollys spirit must have smiled at the irony of the semipublic funeral jadby and the miserable woman who had loved him so dearly were buried quietly in the folkstone cemetery as to brisson he disappeared into the unknown and nothing was ever heard of him again which was just as well as prelice had punished him in a measure by shooting him in the shoulder but the whole affair was a nine days wonder and those connected with it were glad when the excitement began to simmer down it was annoying to have photographs of the grange appearing in numberless illustrated papers and still more annoying when the said pictures sent trippers across the downs to the lonely hollow they came in shoals in charabancs in motor cars in traps and carts and riding on bicycles but martaban who was taking charge of everything until his dear client became lady prelice instructed the police to keep the sightseers out of the grounds therefore these could only stare from the smooth heights of the downs into the woody hollow and that was unpleasant enough to a couple of ardent lovers who found their wanderings in the enchanted gardens overlooked by kodak fiends though heaven knows what kind of a picture these creatures hoped to obtain at such a distance however unless mona and prelice took refuge in the woods or in the house they had nowhere to go for the lawns girdled by trees were quite open to the gazers from above i feel like a christian martyr in the colosseum said prelice when the sight of three bicycles with three dismounting riders sent them hastily into the drawingroom what an infernal nuisance it is to be kodaked to make a british holiday never mind darling said mona taking his arm to lead him to a most comfortable windowseat let us sit here and talk i have something to show you mrs rover sent it down look prelice glanced at the near table and saw a shallow bronze cup of a somewhat graceful shape is that the cup he asked examining it yes mrs rover found it in the cupboard i expect captain jadby left it there along with the dress it is rudely made but pretty it was indeed quaint being of rough bronze carved with hideous heads twined round with wreaths of some strange plant prelice examined it closely by jove mona he said i believe these faces are wreathed with imitations of the sacred herb see the same spearshaped leaves with the serrated edges i wish we had some of the herb to compare i have said mona going to a cabinet and pulling out a drawer i have just one leaf left and she brought forward the purple withered leaf which as prelice had pointed out exactly resembled the chasings of the cup it must have come from easter island said mona while the two bent their heads over it i never wish to hear of easter island again said prelice putting down the cup it has brought such misery do you call me misery said mona reproachfully hasnt it brought me to you yes in a way but lady sophia is really responsible jerusalem just fancy mona dearest she sent me to the new bailey to find an interest in life and and you have said mona blushing and smiling prelice said nothing but kissed her twice with a look which spoke volumes but i wish aunt sophia would be agreeable to the match sighed the young man i am fond of aunt sophia although she is such a worry besides i want her to present you at court after our marriage do you indeed said a complacent voice at the door and the two looked up in great amazement to behold lady sophia standing there in the best of spirits and the most perfect of summer dresses i have stolen a march on you said the lady coming forward and waited for a dramatic moment upon which to enter your speech my dear prelice was a happy one but i am not a worry aunt sophia how did you come here in a motor car along with dr horace who will soon be in we left the car at the lodgekeepers because the creature would insist that we were trippers wanting to see the house do i look like a tripper and lady sophia spun round for inspection you are a prelice stopped and glared i shant say what you are until you tell me if you come in peace or war for answer lady sophia turned to mona and took her to her breast my dearest girl she said smiling when you marry george prelice you must really try and put some sense into his head do you wish me to marry him asked mona rather scared of course i do cried lady sophia with asperity what else am i here for you dear silly pretty sweet angelic darling hurrah aunt sophia i endorse all the unnecessary adjectives save the second you can take that to yourself prelice now what am i a weathercock said her graceless nephew promptly although she quite expected him to say something else you bullyragged me about my marriage and now you oh i say ended prelice in dismay for lady sophia had burst into tears whatever is the matter im so wicked sobbed the old lady clinging to mona simon has told me all and how very nearly he was being accused of murder it was so lucky that his connection with this horrid herb thing was kept out of the papers or else i never never never should have held up my head again oh that i might have lived to see my husband in a nasty dock dont trouble whispered mona leading the old lady to the sofa it is all right mr haken is in no danger and that being so cried prelice indignantly he might have held his confounded tongue and not worried you my dear george said lady sophia wiping her eyes he did it for your sake i was raging against the marriage and he told me how nearly he had been an old bailey thing or a new bailey creature i forget which i saw then how very easily one can be accused of things they hadnt the slightest intention of doing and soi am here kiss me my love cried lady sophia again embracing mona you are much oh ever so much too good for prelice and i was too good for her some time ago laughed prelice aunt sophia you are a weathercock but he added shaking hands i am glad that a kind wind has blown you round to being pleased you are an angel ive been very horrid said lady sophia penitently but i have made it up with everyoneeven with constance poor thing although she did behave badly with that silly poodle creature he is dead so let him rest aunt sophia and constance has been punished so dont blame her any more i am not blaming her how silly you are prelice dont i tell you that ive called to see her she looks so well in her mourning and so very happy mr shepworth is keeping away from her for a time but they quite understand each other and marry in a year it will be a good match for mr shepworth for constance will have all that poor things money she wont have any bridesmaids though being a widow lady sophias discontented chatter was ended by the entrance of dr horace still gruff and untidy and aggressive oh here you are said lady sophia looking more like a man out of the stone age than ever i take him about as an illustration of the time when people lived in sweet little caves and wore sables all the year round day prelice said horace taking no notice of lady sophias babble how are you miss chent i have come to say goodbye i cant stand this london rot so im off again to the other side of the world go to polynesia and ask brisson how his arm is said prelice but i say you treated me rather badly over this case bosh pickles and faldelal snorted the traveller why i gave you back the will and did my best for hakens sake to keep you from going into the case yes yes said mona jumping up to take horaces hand i wont have him scolded horace grunted and disengaged his arm in no wise impressed by the beauty of mona such a dear delightful cave bear sighed lady sophia on seeing this but dr horaces eyes were fixed greedily upon the bronze cup i see that you have the sacred herb burner of easter island said he fingering the bronze lovingly how do you know i saw it there i expect jadby stole it this cup said horace raising it aloft is thousands and thousands of years old it is a remnant of lemurian civilisation see how like these heads are to the heads of the easter island statues and the leaves of the herb are indicated give me this prelice and ill take it back to those poor priests on the island they will be delighted to see it again it is used in their sacred ceremonies prelice glanced at mona what do you say he asked mrs rover sent it to you my darling take it away take it away cried the girl shuddering and spreading out her hands i never wish to see or hear anything of the sacred herb again it has been a terrible time all through but she added looking tenderly at prelice it has led to happiness i should like to see the herb said lady sophia coming forward with her lorgnette raised dr horace can you show it to me no i cant growled the doctor i gave all i had to your husband there is one leaf left said mona picking up the same give me the cup dorry have you a match dont send us into trances said prelice jokingly i should love it above all things said lady sophia mona laid the leaf on the bronze cup and lighted it a thin stream of white smoke curled into the air and while the two women and the two men stood back to avoid the fumes a sickly scent of tuberoses spread through the room the leaf frizzled into nothing and dr horace slipped the still warm cup into his capacious pocket thats the last of the sacred herb in england said he and without saying farewell trotted towards the door there he stopped to wave a friendly hand and departed en route to polynesia and to easter island lady sophia fell back on to the sofa i declare this smell makes me quite giddy she said sniffing its like funerals and coffins i dont wonder people go into trances with it and see things she bent forward with her lorgnette to her eyes and laughed i am in a trance now she said gaily i seei seethe prettiest bride in the three kingdoms and the happiest bridegroom said prelice slipping his arm round monas waist and i seei see you see this said mona and laying her arms about her lovers neck she kissed him fairly on the mouth i think trances are quite improper said lady sophia rising my dear if you will ask me to remain to dinner ill stop and talk over your weddingdress the end
