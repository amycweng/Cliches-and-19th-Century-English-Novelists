stout knees slowly and repeating the exact words of the clerical suitor s thet she may be yer handmaiden an yer spouse and yer sealed fountain es y put it in yer flowery pulpit lingo jus so jus so and shifting the quid which bulged his weatherbeaten cheek he stared with hard blue eyes jus so mr pence the young minister and the elderly skipper discussed the subject of marriage in a shabby antique room of small size which had the appearance of having been used to more aristocratic company the darkoak panelled walls the grotesquelycarved ceilingbeams the dutchtiled fireplace with its ungainly brass dogs and the deep slanting embrasure of the lozengepaned casement suggested georgian beaux and belles dancing buckram minutes or at least hardriding country squires plotting jacobite restoration but these happenings were in the longago but this stately essex manorhouse had declined woefully from its high estate and now sheltered a rough and ready mariner who camped rather than dwelt under its roof captain huxham seated on the broad low windowsill thrust his hands into the pockets of his brassbuttoned peajacket and swung his short sturdy legs which were enveloped in wide bluecloth trousers he was a squat man with lengthy arms and aggressively square shoulders and his large flat face was as the winter sun for redness cleanshaven save for a fringe of white hair which curved under his stubborn chin from one large ear to the other his tough skin was seamed with innumerable wrinkles accumulating particularly thickly about his eyes he had gold rings in his ears and plenteous grey hair hung like seaweed from under a peaked cap pushed back from his lined forehead he looked what he truly wasa rough uneducated imperious old seadog whose knowledge of strong drink and stronger language was only exceeded by his strenuous grip of the purse which held the savings of many rapacious years in this romantic room he looked entirely out of place nevertheless it was his own property and while considering his answer to mr pence he examined it mechanically to the left he beheld a large open fireplace which gaped under an ornate oak mantelpiece carved with the crest and motto of the dispossessed family a door appeared on the right leading to the entrance hall and this also was elaborately carved with wreaths of fruit and flowers and with fat foolish cupids entangled in knots of ribbon the fourth wall was unbroken and faced the window but against it stood a common deal table covered incongruously with an embroidered indian cloth above this and leaning forward was a round convex mirror surmounted by a napoleonic eagle this was flanked on one side by an oilskin coat and a souwester and on the other by a sextant and a long brass telescope a louis quinze sofa with a gilt frame and covered with faded brocade fitted into the space between the fireplace and the casement in the opposite corner with its back to the outer wall stood a large modern officedesk of mahogany with a flexible curved lid which was drawn down and fastened because a visitor was in the room captain huxham never received anyone in his sanctum unless he first assured himself that the desk was closed and a small greenpainted safe near it fastlocked there were three or four rushbottomed chairs which looked plebeian even on the dusty uncarpeted floor on the mantelshelf stood a lyreshaped clock bearing the sun symbol of louis xiv several cheap and gaudy vases and many fantastic shells picked up on south sea beaches here and there were japanese curios polynesian mats and war weapons uncouth chinese idols stuffed birds indian ivory carvings photographs and paintings of various ships and all the flotsam and jetsam which collects in a sailors seachest during endless voyages the deal table was littered with old magazines yellowbacked novels and navigation books with ragged covers while the fireplace was a species of dustbin for matches cigarends torn papers orange peel and such like everywhere the dust lay thick it was an odd roomat once sumptuous and dingy markedly chaotic yet orderly in an untidy way it reflected more or less the mind of its present owner who as has been before remarked camped rather than lived amidst his surroundings in the same way do eastern nomads house in the ruined palaces of kings silas pence who was the minister of the little bethel chapel in marshely village curled his long thin legs under his chair and looked anxiously at his meditative host that portion of the light from the casement not intercepted by huxhams bulky figure revealed a lean eager face framed in sparse fair hair parted in the centre and falling untidily on the coat collar the young preachers features were sharply defined and somewhat mean while a short and scanty beard scarcely concealed his sensitive mouth his forehead was lofty his chin weak and his grey eyes glittered in a strange fanatical fashion there were exceptional possibilities both for good and evil in that pale countenance and it could be guessed that environment would have much to do with the development of such possibilities mr pence was arrayed in a tightlyfitting frock coat and loose trousers both of worn broadcloth he wore also a low collar with a white tie bowfashion white socks and lowheeled shoes and every part of his attire although neat and wellbrushed and wellmended revealed dire poverty on the whole he had the rapt ascetic gaze of a mediaeval saint and a monkish robe would have suited him better than his semiecclesiastical garb as a nonconformist preacher but if pence resembled a saint huxham might have passed for a grey old badger sullen and infinitely wary having taken stock of his worldly possessions recalling meanwhile a not altogether spotless past he brought his shrewd eyes back again to his visitors attentive face still anxious to gain time for further consideration he remarked once more so y want t merry m gel bella mr pence jus so jus so the other replied in a musical but highpitched voice almost feminine in its timbre i am not comely i am not wealthy nor do i sit in the seat of the rulers but the lord has gifted me with a pleading tongue an admiring eye and an admonishing nature with isabella by my side brother huxham i can lead more hopefully our little flock towards the pleasant land of beulah what says isaiah dunno confessed the mariner aint bin readin isaiahers log lately thou shalt be called hephzibah quoted mr pence shrilly and thy land beulah for the lord delighteth in thee and thy land will be married didnt know es isaiaher knew of m twenty acres growled huxham with another turn of his quid course ef it be es y merry bella th land goes with her when i fits int m little wooden overcoat y kin take yer davy on thet mr pence fur ive a conscience i hevlet em say contrary es likes it must have been an uneasy conscience for captain huxham glared defiantly at his visitor and then cast a doubtful look over his left shoulder as though he expected to be tapped thereon pence was puzzled as much by this behaviour as by the literal way in which the sailor had taken the saying of the prophet isaiah spoke in parables he explained lamely maybe grunted huxham but y speak sraight nough mr pence touching this merrage y love bella es i take it i call her hephzibah burst out the young minister enthusiastically which being interpreted meansmy delight is in her jus so jus so but does th gel love you mr pence the face of the suitor clouded i have my doubts he sighed seeing that she has looked upon vanity in the person of a man from babylon damn your parables snapped the captain put a blamed name t him mr cyril lister began pence and was about to reprove his host for the use of strong language when he was startled by much worse and huxham grew purple in the face when using it it is unnecessary to set down the exact words but the fluency and originality and picturesqueness of the retired mariners speech made silas close his scandalised ears with many adjectives of the most lurid description the preacher understood huxham to say that he would see his daughter grilling in the nethermost pit of tophet before he would permit his daughter to marry thisadjective double adjectiveswab from london i aint seen th blighter bellowed the captain furiously but ive heard of his blessed name bella met him et thet blamed miss ankers the schoolmistress house she did sh wanted him t kim an see this old shanty cause he writes fur the noospapers cuss him but i up an tole her es id twist her damned neck ef she spoke agin with the lopsided stop stop remonstrated pence feebly we are all brothers in the lubber aint no relative o mine hang him an y too fur sayin so oh lister lister huxham swung two huge fists impotently i hate him why why why babbled the visitor incoherently the surprise in his tones brought huxham to his calmer senses like the cunning old badger he was cause i jolly well do he snorted wiping his perspiring face with a flaunting red and yellow bandana but it dont matter nohow and i arsk yer pardon fur gittin up steam my gel dont merry no lister y kin lay yer soul t thet mr pence lister lister he slipped off the sill in his excitement i hates the whole damned breed of em seacooks all es oughter t hev their silly faces in the slush tub do you know the lister family then asked pence openmouthed at this vehemence this remark cooled the captain still further shut yer silly mouth he growled rolling porpoisefashion across the room and wait till i git m breath back int m bellers being a discreet young man pence took the hint and silently watched the squat ungainly figure of his host lunging and plunging in the narrow confines of the apartment whatever may have been the reason it was evident that the name of lister acted like a red rag to this nautical bull pence ran over in his mind what he knew of the young stranger to see if he could account for this outbreak he could recall nothing pertinent cyril lister had come to remain in marshely some six months previously and declared himself to be a journalist in search of quiet for the purpose of writing a novel he occupied a tiny cottage in the village and was looked after by mrs block a stout gossiping widow who spoke well of her master so far as pence knew captain huxham had never set eyes on the stranger and could not possibly know anything of him or of his family yet from his late outburst of rage it was apparent that he hated the young man lister sometimes went to london but for the most part remained in the village writing his novel and making friends with the inhabitants at the house of the boardschool mistress he had met bella huxham and the two had been frequently in one anothers company in spite of the captains prohibition but it was evident that huxham knew nothing of their meetings pence did however and resented that the girl should prefer listers company to his own he was very deeply in love and it rejoiced his heart when he heard how annoyed the captain was at the mere idea of a marriage between lister and his daughter the preacher was by no means a selfish man or a bad man but being in love he naturally wished to triumph over his rival he now knew that his suit would be supported by huxham if only out of his inexplicable hatred for the journalist meanwhile huxham stamped and muttered and wiped his broad face as he walked off his anger finally he stopped opposite his visitor and waved him to the door y shell merry m gel bella he announced hoarsely m conscience wont let me merry her t thetthetoh cuss him why carnt he an the likes o he keep away he paused and again cast an uncomfortable look over his left shoulder kim up on th roof he said abruptly driving pence into the entrance hall ill show y wot ill give y with m gelon conditions conditions the preacher was bewildered huxham vouchsafed no reply but mounted the shallow steps of the grand staircase the manorhouse was large and rambling and of great age having been built in the reign of henry vii the rooms were spacious the corridors wide and the ceilings lofty the present possessor led his guest up the stairs into a long broad passage with many doors leading into various bedrooms at the end he opened a smaller door to reveal a narrow flight of steep steps followed by the minister huxham ascended these and the two emerged through a wooden trapdoor on the roof silas then beheld a moderately broad space running parallel with the passage below and extending from one parapet to the other on either side of this walkas it might be termedthe redtiled roofs sloped abruptly upward to cover the two portions of the mansion here joined by the flat leads forming the walk aforesaid on the slope of the left roof looking from the trapdoor was a wooden ladder which led up to a small platform also of wood built round the emerging chimney stack this was captain huxhams quarter deck whither he went on occasions to survey his property he clambered up the ladder with the agility of a sailor in spite of his age and was followed by the preacher with some misgivings these proved to be correct for when he reached the quarterdeck the view which met his startled eyes so shook his nerve that he would have fallen but that the captain propped him up against the broad brickwork of the chimney oh me moaned the unfortunate silas holding on tightly to the iron clamps of the brickwork i am throned on a dangerous eminence and closed his eyes open em open em commanded the captain gruffly an jes look et them twenty acres of corn es yll git with m gel when im a deader pence slipped into a sitting position and looked as directed he beheld from his dizzy elevation the rolling marshland extending from the fardistant stream of the thames to the foot of lowlying inland hills as it was july and the sun shone strongly the marshes were comparatively dry but here and there pence beheld pools and ditches flashing like jewels in the yellow radiance immediately before him he could see the village of marshely not so very far away with redroofed houses gathered closely round the grey square tower of the church he could even see the tin roof of his own humble bethel gleaming like silver in the sunlight and here and there dotted indiscriminately were lonely houses single huts clumps of trees and on the higher ground rising inland more villages similar to marshely the flat and perilously green lands were divided by hedges and ditches and fences into squares and triangles and oblongs and rectangles all as emeraldhued as faery rings the human habitations were so scattered that it looked as though some careless genii had dropped them by chance when flying overhead far away glittered the broad stream of the thames with ships and steamers and boats and barges moving outward and inward bound on its placid surface the rigid line of the railway shot straightly through villages and trees and occasional cuttings across the verdant expanse with here and there a knot representing a station smoke curled from the tall chimneys of the dynamite factories near the river and silvery puffs of steam showed that a train was on its way to tilbury all was fresh restful beautiful and so intensely green as to be suggestive of early spring buddings when i took command of this here farm ten years back observed captain huxham drawing in a deep breath of moist air it were waterlogged like a derelict es y might say cast yer weathereye over it now mr pence an wots yer lookout a gardin of edin smilin with grain yet its a derelict still remarked the preacher struggling to his feet and holding on by the chimney let me examine your farm of bleacres bleacresa corruption of bleakacresconsisted of only twenty acres not at all bleak but a mere slice out of the wide domains formerly owned by the aristocratic family dispossessed by huxham it extended all round the ancient manorhouse which stood exactly in the centre and every foot of it was sown with corn on every side waved the greenishbluish crop now almost breast high it rolled right up to the walls of the house so that this was drowned so to speak in the ocean of grain the various fields were divided and subdivided by waterways wide and narrow which drained the land and these gave the place quite a dutch look as fancy might picture them as canals but the corn grew everywhere so thick and high in contrast to the barren marshes that the farm looked almost aggressively cultivated bleacres was widely known as the solitary farm for there was not another like it for many miles though why it should have been left to a retired sailor to cultivate the soil it is hard to say but huxham for many years had sown corn on his twenty acres so that the mansion for the most part of the year was quite shut off from the world only a narrow path was left which meandered from the front door and across various waterways to marshely village one mile distant in no other way save by this path could the mansion be approached and as guardian of the place a redcoated scarecrow stood sentinel a stonethrow from the house the bit of brilliant colour looked gay amidst the rolling acres of green the domain of ceres said pence dreamily and recalling his meagre classical studies here the goddess might preside yet he added again with a side glance at his rugged host a derelict still mr pence dont know the english langwidge apparently said huxham addressing the landscape with a pitying smile a derelicts a ship abandoned and a derelict insisted pence can also be described as a tract of land left dry by the sea and fit for cultivation or use you will find that explanation in nuttalls standard dictionary captain live an larn live an larn commented huxham accepting the explanation without question but i aint got no use for dixonaries mself made m dollars to buy this here farm without sich truck in what way captain asked silas absently and looked at the view had he looked instead at huxhams weatherbeaten face he might have been surprised the captain grew a little trifle paler under his bronze an uneasy look crept into his hard blue eyes and he threw another anxious glance over his shoulder but a stealthy examination of the ministers indifferent countenance assured him that the question although a leading one had been asked in all innocence and in all innocence the captain replied for the momentary pause had given him time to frame his reply i arned m dollars mr pence es an honest man should by sweatin on th high an narrer seas these forty year ran away fro m father es wos a cobbler added huxham addressing the landscape once more when i wos ten year old an a hopmethumb et thet es y could hev squeezed int a pint pot cabin boy ab mate fust an second and a skipper by m own determination t git tophole likewise hard tack cold quarters kickins an brimstone langwidge es would hev made thet hair of yours curl tremenjous mr pence i made nough when fifty an more t buy this here farm an this here house th roof of which ive walked quarterdeck fashion es y see these ten yearsme bein sixty odd so t speak waitin now fur a hail t jine th angels an mrs arabeller huxham who is a flier with a halo an expectin me aloft es she remarked frequent when chokin in her engine pipes asthma et wos finished the widower spitting out some tobacco juice es settled her hash this astonishing speech delivered with slow gruffness did not startle silas as he had known captain huxham for at least five years and had before remarked upon his eccentric way of talking very interesting very commendable he murmured and returned to the object of his visit and your daughter sir y shell hev her an hev this here the captain waved his hand to the four points of the compass when i jine the late mrs arabeller huxham ef yef ythet is he halted dubiously if what demanded pence unsuspiciously ef y chuck thet lister int one of them waterways said huxham what cried the preacher considerably startled i want him dead growled huxham gruffly drown dead an buried perhaps his sojourn in distant lands on the fringes of the empire had familiarised the captain with sudden death and murder for he made this amazing proposition in a calm and cheerful voice but the minister was not so steeled to horrors what he repeated in a shaking voice and with dilated eyes all fur you murmured the tempter persuasively every blamed acre of et t say nothing of bella es is a fine gel an no no no cried silas vehemently spreading his hands across his lean agitated face how dare you ask such a thing jus a push went on huxham softly he bein on the edge of one of them ditches es y might say wot th water gits th water holds hed go down int the black slime an never come up it ud choke him cuss me murmured huxham softly id like t see the black slime choke a lister pence gasped again and recalled how the evil one had taken the saviour of men up to an exceedingly high mountain to show him the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them all these things will i give thee said satan if no shouted silas his eyes lighting up with wrath get thee behind me before finishing his sentence and before huxham could reply he scrambled down the ladder to rush for the open trap the captain leaned from his quarterdeck scornfully y neednt say es i gave y the chance fur no one ull believe y he cried out coolly an a milksop y are twenty acres a house an a fine gelyd be set up for life ef yd only push pence heard no more in a frenzy of horror he dropped through the trapdoor inwardly praying that he might be kept from temptation huxham saw him vanish and scowled blamed milky swab he grumbled then turned to survey the bribe he had offered for wilful murder he looked at the corn and across the corn uneasily as though he saw danger in the distance no cause to be afeared muttered the exmariner he cant get through the corn it keeps me safe anyhow but who the he referred to might be huxham did not say chapter ii the wooin ot imagine a man wrapped from infancy in the cotton wool of civilisation suddenly jerked out of the same into barbaric nakedness deprived of the strong protection of the law brought suddenly face to face with the mightisright theory he would have to fight for his own land even to the extent of slaying anyone who thwarted his needs such a man amazed and horrified at first would gradually become accustomed to his ishmael existence since habit is second nature silas pence felt sick when he reflected on the offer made by captain huxham and to him of all peoplea minister of the gospel a follower of the prince of peace for the first time in his guarded life he became aware of the evil which underlies the smiling surface of things and it was as though an abyss had opened suddenly at his feet but although he did not know it at the time the seed had been sown in his heart at the right moment and would germinate almost without his knowledge in a few days silas could look back at the horrifying suggestion with calmness and could even consider the advantages it offered but just now he felt sick physically sick and descending with trembling limbs to the ground floor of the house staggered towards the hall and door all he desired was to get away and put the cornfields between himself and the evil atmosphere of bleacres but his legs failed him as he laid hands on the latch and he sank whitefaced and shaking into a chair in this state he was discovered by mrs coppersley the captains sister and housekeeper she was a buxom amiable woman with a fixed smile meaning nothing the expression of her rosy face changed to one of alarm when she saw the heap in the chair save us mr pence whats wrong pence was about to break forth into a denunciation of huxhams wickedness but a timely recollection of the captains last wordsthat his story would not be believedmade him pause after all huxham was well known as a decent man and an openhanded friend to one and all so there was nothing to be gained by telling a truth which would certainly be scoffed at the preacher changed his mind in one swift instant and replied nervously to mrs coppersleys inquiry i have been on the quarterdeck and it made me dizzy i am not accustomed to drat that brother of mine interrupted mrs coppersley angrily he got me up there once and i thought id never come down here mr pence you hold up while i get you a sup of rum no no strong drink leads us into desperate ways protested the preacher but mrs coppersley was gone and had returned before he could make up his mind to fly temptation silas was not used to alcohol but the shock he had sustained in learning so much of huxhams true nature prevented his exercising his usual selfcontrol with his highly strung nerves he was halfhysterical and so when forced by kindly mrs coppersley readily drank half a tumbler of rum slightly diluted with water drink it all theres a good soul entreated the housekeeper forcing the glass to his lips no he pushed it away i feel better already and he did for the strong spirit brought colour to his cheek and new strength to his limbs he stood up in a few minutes quite himself and indeed more than himself since the rum put into him more courage than came by nature wine maketh glad the heart of man said silas in excuse for his unusual indulgence rum isnt wine said mrs coppersley with a jolly laugh its something much better mr pence now you go home and lie down oh no i feel as though i could charge an army said pence valiantly then wait in the study she indicated the panelled room with a jerk of her head jabez will be down from his quarterdeck soon no pence shivered in spite of the rum at the thought of again having to face his tempter i must go now my presence is required in the village then you can take a message for me to mr vand said mrs coppersley with a slight accession of colour to her already florid face say that i am coming to marshely about seven oclock and will call at the shop this request changed pence into the preacher and the leader of the godly people who called his chapel their fold vand was the son of the woman who kept the village grocery shop and a cripple who played the violin at various local concerts he was at least ten years younger than mrs coppersley who confessed to being thirtyfivethough probably she was olderand the way in which the widow ran after him was something of a scandal as both mrs coppersley and henry vand were members of little bethel silas felt that he was entitled to inquire into the matter you ask me to take such a message sister he demanded austerely the widows face flamed and her eyes sparkled there is no shame in it that i am aware of mr pence she declared violently if i choose to marry again thats no ones business but mine i take it oh so you desire to marry henry vand said pence amazed its not a question of desiring said the buxom woman impatiently henry and i have arranged to be married this summer he is a cripple i know that she snapped and therefore needs the care of a wife his mother looks after him protested pence weakly does she inquired mrs coppersley i thought she looked after no one but herself shes that selfish as never was so dont you go to defend her mr pence henry poor boy who is an angel if ever there was one is quite neglected so i am going to marry him and look after him so there and mrs coppersley placing her hands akimbo defied her pastor henry has no money said pence finding another objection as to that remarked mrs coppersley indifferently when my brother dies ill have money for us both and this house into the bargain you will have nothing of the sort said silas surprised into saying more than was wise your brothers daughter will inherit this oh will she cried mrs coppersley violently and much you know about it mr pence when my late husband who was a ships steward and saving died ten year ago i lent my brother some money to add to his own so that he might buy bleacres he agreed that if i did so i should inherit the house and the land i promised to look after bella until she got married and mrs coppersley said pence with an effort at firmness your brother told me only lately that if i married bella he would give her the farm and the house when he died so ho indeed interrupted mrs coppersley wrathfully pretty goings on im sure you call yourself a pastor mr pence and come plotting to rob me of what is mine i take everything and bella nothing so you can put that in your pipe and smoke it though you aint man enough to smoke even a penny cigar you marry bella why shes as good as engaged to that young lister who has got more gumption about him than you have i advise you said pence and his voice sounded strangely in his own ears not to tell your brother that his daughter is engaged to mr lister i never said that she was but there is no but the mere mention of such an engagement would send captain huxham crazy in heavens name why gasped mrs coppersley looking the picture of stout amazement and sitting down heavily because for some reason he hates mr lister and would kill him rather than accept him as his soninlaw mrs coppersleys florid face turned quite pale evidently she knew what her brother was like when roused why should jabez hate mr lister she asked you had better ask him said pence opening the hall door then to soften his abruptness he added ill tell henry vand that you will see him after which he departed leaving mrs coppersley still pale and still gasping after all there was no reason why the ship stewards widow would not marry the young man vand was handsome in a refined way and very clever as a musician he was only slightly crippled too and could get about with the aid of a stick all the same he needed someone to look after him and as his own mother did not do soas was notoriouswhy should he not become mrs coppersleys husband the disparity in age did not matter as vand in spite of his good looks was clubfooted and poor but pence doubted if mrs coppersley would inherit bleacres after captain huxhams death in spite of the arrangement between them unlessand here was the chance for the housekeeperunless bella married lister notwithstanding her fathers opposition in that event huxham would assuredly disinherit her ill point this out to her said the preacher as he left the manorhouse and urge my suit commonsense will make her yield to my prayers moreover i can plead and here he smiled complacently as he thought of his pulpit eloquence besides the unaccustomed spirit of the rum was still keeping him brave pence sauntered in the glowing sunshine down the narrow path which ran between the standing corn the path was not straight it wound deviously as though huxham wished to make the approach to his abode as difficult as possible indeed it was strange that he should sow corn at all since corn at the time was not remunerative but every year since he had entered into possession of bleacres the owner had sown corn and every year there had only been the one meandering path through the same the very path which pence was now taking there was evidently some purpose in this sowing and in the fact that only one pathway was left whereby to approach the mansion but what that purpose might be neither pence nor indeed anyone else could guess not that they gave it a thought huxham was presumed to be very wealthy and his farming was looked upon more as a hobby than a necessity the preacher brushed between the breasthigh corn and walked over two or three narrow planks laid across two or three narrow ditches but where the corn ended was a wide channel at least ten feet broad which stretched the whole length of the estate and passed beyond it on its way under the railway line to the distant river the waterway ran straightly for some distance and then curved down into the marshes at its own will to spread into swamps on one side sprang the thick green corn but on the other stretched wastelands up to the outskirts of the village one mile distant there was no fence round bleacres at this point apparently huxham deemed the wide channel a sufficient protection to his corn which it assuredly was as no tramps ever trespassed on the land but then marshely was not a tramp village the inhabitants were poor and had nothing to give in the way of charity the loafer of the roads avoided the locality for very obvious reasons before crossing the planks which were laid on midchannel supporting tressels over the waterway pence looked from right to left the evening was so very beautiful that he thought he would prolong his walk until sundown and it wanted some time to that hour he was still indignant with captain huxham for his base offer and came to the conclusion that the exmariner was mad when he made it pence in his simplicity could not think that any man could ask another to kill a third in cold blood all the same the offer had been made and silas found himself asking why huxham should desire the death of a stranger with whomso far as the preacher knewhe was not even acquainted huxham had always refused to permit bella to bring lister to bleacres and indeed had forbidden her even to speak to the young man he therefore could not be cognisant of the fact stated by mrs coppersley that lister and the girl were on the eve of an engagement thus thinking pence mechanically wandered along the left bank of the boundary waterway and found himself near a small hut inhabited by the sole labourer whom huxham habitually employed he engaged others of course when his fields were ploughed and sown and reaped but tunkssuch was the euphonious name of the handymanwas in demand all the year round he resided in this somewhat lonely hut along with his grandmother a weird old gipsy reputed to be a witch and it was this reputation which set mr pence thinking remembering that mrs tunks was of the romany he thought and blushed as he thought that it would be worth while to expend a shilling in order to learn if his suit with bella would really prosper the temple of fate was before him and the sibyl was probably within since the smoke of cooking the evening meal curled from the chimney it was only necessary to lift the latch lay down a shilling and inquire but even as the temptation drew him he was seized with a feeling of shame that hea preacher of the gospel and the approved foe thereby of witchesshould think for one moment of encouraging such traffic with the evil one pence blushing as red as the now setting sun turned away hastily and found himself face to face with the very girl who was causing him such torment how are you mr pence said bella huxham lightly a lovely evening isnt it and she tried to pass him on the narrow path probably she was going to see the witch of endor the preacher placed himself directly before her wait for one moment the girl did not reply immediately but looked at him earnestly trying to guess what the usually nervous preacher had to say bella looked more lovely than ever in pences eyes as she stood before him in her white dress and bathed in the rosy glory of the sunset she did not in the least resemble her father or her aunt both of whom were stout uncomely folk of true plebeian type bella was aristocratic in her looks as tall and slim and willowy as a young sapling her hair and eyes were dark her face was a perfect oval of ivorywhite delicately flushed with red like a sweetpea and if her chin was a trifle resolute and hard her mouth was perfect she carried herself in a haughty way and had a habit of bending her dark brows so imperiously that she reminded pence of judith who killed holofernes judith and jael and deborah must have been just such women well asked bella bending her brows like an empress what is it iilove you miss huxham she could not be angry at so naive a declaration and one coming from a man whom she knew to be as timid as a hare i am somewhat surprised mr pence she replied demurely are you not making a mistake no he stuttered flushing with eagerness for amorous passion makes the most timid bold i have loved you for months for years i want you to be my wifeto share with me the glorious privilege of leading my flock to the land of beulah and stop stop she flung up her hand i assure you mr pence that it is impossible forget that you ever said anything i cannot forget why should i forget you must not ask a woman for her reasons mr pence she answered drily for a woman never gives the true ones bella miss huxham to you mr pence she spoke in a chilly manner no he cried wildly to me you are bella i think of you by that sweet name day and night you come between me and my work when i console the afflicted i feel that i am talking to you when i read my bible your face comes between me and the sacred page to me you are hephzibahyes and the shulamite the angel of the covenant the joy of my heart oh bella i love the very ground that you tread on can you refuse me see he threw himself on the path heedless of the fact that mrs tunks might be at her not far distant window i am at your feet bella bella the girl was distressed by this earnestness rise mr pence someone will see you you must not behave like this i cannot be your wife why not oh why not because i am not fit to be a ministers wife the young man sprang to his feet glowing with passion let me teach you bella avoided his extended arms no no no she insisted you must take my answer once and for all mr pence i cannot marry you but why he urged despairingly i have a reason she replied formally dont ask me for it i have no need to i know your reason bella flushed but overlooked the bitterness of his tone because she guessed what he suffered in that case i need not explain she said coldly and again tried to pass again he prevented her you love that man lister he said between his teeth that is my business mr pence mine also he cried undaunted by her haughtiness your fathers business too mrs coppersley said that you were almost engaged to this man lister but you shall not marry him you will not even be engaged to him who will prevent me asked bella angrily your father he hates this man lister how can my father hate a man he has never even seen she demanded you are talking rubbish miss huxhampence detained her by laying his thin fingers on her armif you marry this man listerhe kept to this sentence as though it were a charmyou will be a pauper she flashed up into a royal rage and stamped how dare you say that i dare tell the truth it is not the truth how can you tell if your father told me insisted the preacher hotly bella withdrew a step or so her eyes growing round with surprise myfathersaidthat yes yes yes cried silas feverishly i went to him this very afternoon to ask permission to present myself to you as a suitor he consented but only when he heard that you loved this man who you told him that demanded bella her breath coming quick and short yes said pence trying to be courageous and it is true who says that it is everyone in the village the village has nothing to do with my business she declared imperiously and even if i do lovebut let that pass you told me that my father said i should be a pauper if you married the man lister he reminded her yes he did say so and declared also that he would give me the manorhouse and the farm when he died if i made you my wife bella shrugged her shoulders my father does not mean what he says she remarked disbelievingly as i am his only child the solitary farm as they call it comes to me in any case and i see no reason why i should discuss my fathers business with you stand aside and let me pass no silas was wonderfully brave for one of his timid soul you shall not pass until you learn the truth you think that i am a fool and weak i am not i feel wise and strong and i am strongstrong enough to withstand temptation even when you are offered as a bribe bella grew somewhat alarmed she did not like the glittering of his shallow grey eyes you are mad i am sane you know that i am sane but you think to put me off by saying that i am crazy i have had enough to make me so your fatherhere his voice took on the singsong pulpit styleyour father took me up to an exceedingly high mountain and showed me the kingdoms of the world all of them he offered me together with you if i murdered lister what bellas voice leaped an octave youyoumurder cyril yes cyril the man you love and if i dared mr pencebella saw the necessity of keeping herself well in hand with this hysterical youth for he was nothing else and spoke in a calm kind voicemy father has not seen mr lister and cannot hate him go and ask him what he thinks said pence fiercely i tell you that today i was offered everything if i would kill this man lister you are talking at random she said soothingly go home and lie down i am talking of what may come to pass your father wishes it so why not when i love you so deeply i offer you the heart of an honest man and yet you would throw that aside for this profligate cyril is not a profligate interrupted bella and could have bitten out her tongue for the hasty speech he is he comes from london the city of evil that shall yet fall like babylon the great but your soul shall not be lost you shall not marry him i shall cried bella indignantly and becoming rash again in her anger and what is more i am engaged to him now so there let me pass she slipped deftly past him and walked swiftly homeward silas pence stood where he was staring after her unable to speak or move or to follow then the sun sank leaving him in the twilight of sorrow chapter iii a tardy lover miss huxham did not credit for one moment the story which pence had told her it was ridiculous to think that her father would even hint at the murder of an unoffending man whom he had never seen and to hesitating timid silas of all people bella remembered that months previously when she had mentioned a chance meeting with listerthen a strangerat the cottage of the marshely schoolmistress captain huxham had not only forbidden her to bring him to bleacres which the young man desired to see but had ordered her to discontinue the acquaintance evidently the retired mariner deemed this prohibition sufficient for he made no further mention of the matter that he gave no reason for his tyrannical edict did not trouble him but because of this very omission his daughter took her own way by stealth it is true lest huxham should exhibit annoyancefor annoyance with him meant wildbeast rage now the girl felt puzzled according to silas her father knew that she had disobeyed him and she returned to the manor in a somewhat nervous state of mind quite prepared to do battle for her lover but to her surprise captain huxham made no remark and behaved much the same as usual save that at odd times he was more observant of her comings and goings in the face of his newlyacquired knowledge this very unusual demeanour should have made bella more circumspect but being highspirited she did not change her life in any way also she believed that silas had greatly exaggerated the captains anger and argued from his quietness that he cared very little what she did she had reason to take this view for huxham was not an affectionate parent and save when things interfered with his own comfort usually ignored his daughter and on her side bella could not subscribe to the fifth commandment it was impossible to honour king log who had an unpleasant way of becoming king henry viii when contradicted several times bella needing sympathy was on the point of reporting pences conversation to mrs coppersley so as to learn her opinion as to the truth of the preachers preposterous statement but the buxom widow was too much taken up with her own loveaffairs to trouble about those of her niece for whom she displayed no great affection she attended to the housekeeping cajoled her brother into a good humour when necessary and nearly every evening slipped out to meet henry vand who usually awaited her arrival on the hither side of the boundary channel he did not dare to venture nearer to the lions den as captain huxham aware of his sisters desire to contract a second marriage discouraged the idea the captain being aggressively selfish did not intend to lose mrs coppersley whose services were necessary to his comfort besides as she managed everything connected with the domestic arrangement of bleacres assisted by bella huxham was spared the necessity of paying a servant it was better from the captains point of view to have two slaves who asked for no wages and who could be bullied when he felt like playing the tyrant to a young girl in the first strong flush of womanhood life at the solitary farm was extremely dreary captain huxham rose early and strolled round his wealthy acres until breakfast which for him was a gargantuan meal he then shut himself for the whole morning in his den where he laboured at his accounts with a locked door in the afternoon he ordinarily walked to marshely and conversed over strong drink with cronies at the village publichouse he returned to walk around the farm again and after supper again sought his room to smoke and drink rum until bedtime at ten oclock the routine of the captains life never varied in any particular even to seeking the quarterdeck once a day for the purpose apparently of viewing the results of his lifes work also from his eyrie the captain armed with a long telescope could gaze at outward and homewardbound ships and so enjoy vicariously the sealife he had abandoned these ten years of bella he took scarcely any notice it was indeed a dull life especially as bella was intellectual and felt that she required food for her active brain for some odd reason which did not suit with his rough nature huxham had given his neglected daughter a firstclass education and only within the last two years had she returned from a fashionable hampstead school to live this uneventful unintellectual life on an essex farm she possessed a few books and these she read over and over again huxham was not actively unkind and gave her plenty of frocks ribbons hats gloves and suchlike things which he presumed were what the ordinary girl wanted but he overlooked the fact that bella was not an ordinary girl and that she hungered for a more moving life or at least for one which would afford her an opportunity of displaying her social abilities bella sang excellently and played the piano unusually well but her uncouth father did not care for music and mrs coppersley scorned it also the girl therefore allowed her talents to lie dormant and became a silent handsome image of a woman moving ghostlike through the dreary mansion but her chance meeting with the clever young man aroused all her disused capabilities aroused also her womanly coquetry and stimulated her into exhibiting a really fascinating nature warned that her father would have no strangers coming to the manor by his own lips she kept secret the delightful meetings with lister and only when the two met at the cottage of miss ankers could they speak freely bella thought that her secret attachment was unknown whereas everyone in the village watched the progress of listers wooing it came as has been seen to pences jealous ears and he reported the same to captain huxham knowing this bella was more perplexed than ever that as time went on huxham did nothing and said nothing at one time he had been peremptory but now he appeared inclined to let her act as she chose and the mere fact that he did so made bella feel more than ever what an indifferent father she possessed for quite a week after his interview with the captain and his futile wooing of bella the lovesick preacher kept away from the farm and attended sedulously to his clerical duties in connection with little bethel the truth was that he felt afraid of huxham now knowing what use the captain desired to make of him for this reason also silas did not report that bella was engaged to lister he feared lest huxham in a rage at such disregard of his wishes should slay the young journalist and perhaps might in his infernal cunning lay the blame on silas himself at all events pence was wise enough to avoid the danger zone of the farm and although after reflection aided by jealousy he was not quite so shocked at the idea of thrusting lister to a muddy death he yet thought it more judicious to keep out of huxhams way the old mariner as pence knew possessed a strong will and might force him to be his tool in getting rid of the journalist silas was wiser than he knew in acting so discreetly for the sailorturned farmer was a more dangerous man than even he imagined despite the glimpse he had gained of huxhams possible iniquity things were in this position when bella rendered reckless by her fathers indifference actually met cyril lister in a secluded nook of the cornfield and on the sacred ground of bleacres itself usually the lovers met in miss ankers cottage or in mrs tunks hut but on this special occasion the weather was so hot that lister proposed an adjournment to the open field you will be ruth and i boaz suggested the young man with a smile bella shivered even in the warm air into which she had stepped out of the malodorous gloom of mrs tunks hut what an unlucky comparison she said leading the way along the bank of the boundary channel ruth left her people and her home to go amongst strangers and earn her living as a gleaner but she found a devoted husband in the end cyril reminded her peace and happiness also i hope sighed bella i have plenty of peace but very little happiness save of the vegetable sort when we are married began lister then stopped short biting his moustachewe shall be very happy he ended lamely seeing that bella looked inquiringly at him that is obvious since we love one another she said somewhat tartly for his hesitation annoyed her why did you change the conclusion of your sentence lister threw himself down on the hardbaked ground and under the shadow of the tall bluegreen corn stalks it just struck me that our marriage was very far distant he said gloomily bella sat beside him shoulder to shoulder and hugged her knees why should it be far distant she inquired if i love you and you love me no power on earth can keep us apart your father i shall disobey my father if it be necessary she informed him serenely lister looked at her through halfshut eyes and noticed the firmness of her mouth and the clear steady gaze of her eyes you have a strong will i think dear he murmured admiringly i have cyrilas strong as that of my father when our two wills clashshe shruggedthere may be murder committed bellathe young man looked startledwhat dreadful things you say it is the truth she insisted quietly why shirk obvious facts for some reason which i cannot discover my father detests you by jove cyril sat up alertly and why he has never seen me as i have kept well out of his way after your warning but i have had a sly glimpse of him and he seems to be a jolly sort of animali beg your pardon for calling him so man is an animal and my father is a man said the girl coolly a neolithic man if you like you are a man also cyrilthe kind of firm bold daring man i like yet if you met with my father i wonder she paused and it flashed across her brain that her father and her lover would scarcely suit one another both were strongwilled and both masterful she wondered if they met who would come out topdog so she phrased it in her quick brain then abruptly she added before cyril could speak be quiet for a few minutes i wish to think lister nodded and leaning on one elbow chewed a cornstalk and watched her in silence he was a slim tall smallboned young man of the fairskinned type with smooth brown hair and a small drooping brown moustache his present attitude indicated indolence and he certainly loved to be lazy when a pretty girl was at his elbow but on occasions he could display wonderful activity and twice had been chosen as war correspondent to a london daily when one or two of the little wars on the fringe of the empire had been in progress he was not particularly goodlooking but the freshness of his fiveandtwenty years and the virility of his manner made women bestow a great deal of attention on him much more than he deserved in fact as until he met with bella he had given very little attention to the sex he had flirted in many countries and with many women but this was the first time he had made genuine love or had felt the genuine passion and with a country maiden too unsophisticated and pathetically innocent so he meditated as he watched her until struck by the firm curve of the chin and the look of resolve on the tightlyclosed lips he confessed privately that if this country maiden were placed in the forefront of society the chances were that she would do more than hold her own there were joanofarclike possibilities in that stronglyfeatured face but upon my word i am quite afraid he said aloud following up his train of thought and speaking almost unconsciously of what asked bella turning quickly towards him of you such a determined young woman as you are if i make you my wife i know who will be master my dear she said quietly in marriage there should be neither a master nor a mistress its a sublime copartnership and the partners are equal one supplies what the other lacks and two incomplete persons are required to make one perfect being lister opened his brown eyes who told you all this no one i have ample time to think andi think you asked me to be quiet so that you could think he remarked lazily may i ask what you have been considering she surveyed him quietly you may ask but i am not sure if i will reply see here my dearestcyril struggled to his knees and took her hand firmly within his ownyou are altogether too independent a young woman you always want your own way i perceive it will never clash with yours said bella smiling why not because you will always wish to do what i desire and i will always be anxious to act as you indicate you have your line of life and i have mine but the two are one humph at school i learned that two parallel straight lines never met ah euclid was a bachelor and ignorant they meet in marriage for then the two lines blend into one whats the matter she asked this question because cyril suddenly let go her hands and swerved blinking his eyes rapidly a sudden flash almost blinded me some one is heliographing hereabouts he stood up considerably taller than the already tall corn and stared in the direction of the manor shading his eyes with one slim hand theres someone on the roof there and bella pulled the sleeve of his coat with a stifled cry oh sit down do sit down she implored it must be my father on his quarterdeck the flash perhaps came from his telescope and if he sees youdo sit down cyril laughed and relapsed into a sitting position dearest your father cannot harm me in any way i have heard of his quarterdeck i suppose he has it to remind him of the bridge of a steamer when he was skipper i hope he hasnt seen you said bella anxiously for then he would come straight here and let him come and then i shall ask him to let me marry you he will refuse he wants me to marry mr pence what lister frowned that halfbaked psalmsinger what nonsense and what cheek the idea of that pence creature aspiring to your hand i wish we could marry at once but he paused and shook his head lines appeared on his forehead and a vexed look in his eyes its impossible he said with a deep breath why is it impossible asked bella imperiously and very directly my dear i am very poor and just make enough to keep my head above water besides there is another reason what is it i cant tell you he said in low voice and becoming suddenly pale no one but the wearer knows where the shoe pinches you know cyril bella wreathed her arms around his neck you have a secret i have noticed several times that you have been worried sometimes you forget everything when we are together and your face becomes like that of an old man i must know your secret so that i can help you god forbid lister removed her arms and grew even paler than he was the kindest way i can act towards you bella is to go out of your life and never see you again cyril how can you when i love you so would you love me if you knew of my troubles try me try me she implored clasping his hand warmly there are some things which cant be told to a woman he said sternly tell them to a comrade then i wish to be your comrade as well as your wife and i love you so that anything you say will only make me love you the more tell me cyril so that i can prove my love upon my soul i believe youd go to hell with me said lister strongly yes i would i demand by the love which exists between us to be told this secret that troubles you so greatly lister frowned and meditated i cannot tell you everythingyet he remarked after a painful pause but i can tell you this much that unless i have one thousand pounds within a week i can never marry you one thousand pounds but for what purpose you must not ask me that bella and his mouth closed firmly trust me all in all or not at all she quoted then i trust you not at all oh she drew back with a cry of pain like a wounded animal in a moment he was on his knees holding her hands to his beating heart my dearest if i could i would but i cant and i am unable just now to give you the reason save that i am a journalist and your devoted lover you know nothing about me later i shall tell you my whole story and how i am situated then you can marry me or not as you choose i shall marry you in any case she said quickly do you think that i am a poor weak fool who demands perfection in a man whatever your sins may be to me you are the man i have chosen to be my husband we are here in the cornfields and you just now called me ruth then like ruth i can say that your people will be my people and your god will be my god dearest and best he kissed her ardently what have i done to deserve such perfect love but do not think me so very wicked it is not myself so much as another then you is it a woman she asked drawing back lister caught her to his breast again no you jealous angel it is not a woman the thousand pounds i must have to savebut that is neither here nor there you must think me but a tardy lover not to carry you off forwith and he rose with bella in his armsoh its impossible do carry me off she whispered clinging to him let us have a sabine wedding as your wife you can tell me all your secrets bella bella i cannot i am desperately poor so am i and if i marry you my father will leave all his money to my aunt for he told mr pence so but what does poverty matter so long as we love one another with all our hearts and souls oh cyril clenched his hands desperately do not tempt me only one thousand pounds stands between us if i had that i could make you my wife within a week i would steal or murder or do anything in the world to get the money and remove the barrier buthe pushed her away almost brutally and frownedyou are making me talk rubbish we must wait until when cyril she asked sadly until destiny is kinder you will tell me i tell you nothing give me one kiss and then goodbye for he bent to touch her lips but was caught and hurled back bella uttered a cry of astonishment and dread for between cyril and herself stood captain huxham purple with anger chapter iv sudden death y shell not kiss m gel or merry her or hev anything t do with m gel said captain huxham in a thick voice oh i saw y fro th quarterdeck with m gel jus y git or he made a threatening step forward while cyril waited him without flinching what would have happened it is hard to say for captain huxham was in a frenzy of rage but bella recovering from her first surprise threw herself between the two men father she cried passionately i love him oh y do do y growled the fireside tyrant turning fiercely on her an arter i told y es yd hev t leave the swab alone did i or did i not yes but you assigned no reason for asking me to avoid cyril so cyril cyril the captain clenched his huge hand and his little eyes flashed with desperate anger y call him cyril yyslut he raised a mighty fist to strike her and the blow would have fallen but that lister suddenly gripped huxhams shoulder and twitched him unexpectedly aside if you blame anyone sir you must blame me ill break yer neck cuss y raged the older man cyril shrugged his shoulders indifferently you can try if you like but i dont propose to let you do it come captain huxham let us both be reasonable and talk matters over yre on m land git off m land shouted huxham swinging his fists like windmills go cyril go implored bella who was terrified lest there should be a handtohand struggle between the two men that was not to be thought of as if lister killed the captain or the captain killed lister there would be no chance of her becoming the wife of the man she loved i am quite ready to go said cyril keeping a watchful eye on huxham but first i should like to hear why you sir object to my marrying bella he spoke quietly and firmly so that the level tones of his voice and the admirable way in which he kept his temper had a cooling effect on the enraged sailor huxham born bully as he was found that it was difficult for him to storm at a man so cool and calm and selfcontrolled y aint m chice said he in lower but very sulky tones m gels goin t merry th skypilot silas pence oh no shes not said lister smoothly she will marry me if she does she dont get no money o mine that will be no hindrance said bella who was rapidly regaining her colour i am willing to marry cyril without a penny y shent then grumbled her father savagely i have yet to hear your objections sir yer names lister and the objection was so petty that bella quite expected to see cyril laugh but in place of doing so he turned white and retreated a step whatwhat do you know of my name he asked with apparent nervousness thets my business snapped huxham seeing his advantage an i shent tell y m business y git off m land or he suddenly lunged forward in the attempt to throw lister when off his guard but the young man was watchful and unexpectedly swerving dexterously tripped up his bulky antagonist huxham with a shout or rather a bellow of rage like a wounded bull sprawled full length amongst the corn bella pushed her lover away before the captain could regain his feet go go i can see you tomorrow she said hastily y shell never see the swab again roared huxham rising slowly for the fall had shaken him and he was no longer young ill shut y in yer room an feed y on bread an water if you dare to say that again ill break your head cried lister suddenly losing his temper at the insult to the girl he loved oh will y huxham passed his tongue over his coarse lips and rubbed his big hands slowly apparently nothing would have given him greater pleasure than to pitch this man who dared him into the boundary channel but he had learned a lesson from his late fall lister was active and young the captain was elderly and slow therefore in spite of his superior strengthand huxham judged that he had thatit was risky to try conclusions of sheer brute force the captain therefore being a coward at heart as all bullies are weakened and retreated y git off m land was all that he could find to say an y git home bella es m daughter ill deal with y i am quite ready to go home said bella boldly but you are not going to behave as though i were one of your sailors father ill do wot i please growled huxham looking white and wicked bella laughed somewhat artificially for her father did not look amiable i dont think you will she said with feigned carelessness cyril go now and ill see you again tomorrow ef y come here again shouted huxham boiling over once more ill kill ythet i will take care you arent killed yourself first retorted lister and was surprised at the effect the threatan idle onehad on the exsailor huxham turned pale under his bronze and hastily cast a look over his left shoulder why do you hate me so asked the young man sharply i never met you before you have never set eyes on me why do you hate me ef id a dog called lister id shoot it if id a cat called lister id drown it and if id a parrot named lister id twist its blamed neck same es i would yours ef i could bella come home and casting a venomous look on the astonished cyril the captain moved away it was useless to prolong the unpleasant scene since huxham declined to explain his objection to the young mans name and again as she took a few steps to accompany her father bella noticed that cyril winced and paled at the coarse taunts of his antagonist what is the matter with your name she asked sharply lister strode forward and caught her in his arms i shall explain when next we meet he whispered and kissed her goodbye while huxham grated his strong white teeth at the sight indeed so angry was the captain that he might again have assaulted his daughters lover but cyril walked rapidly away and without even a backward glance bella watched him with a heavy heart there seemed to be something sinister about this mystery of the name huxhams inexplicable hatred appeared to be foolish but lister undoubtedly took it seriously kim home breathed the captain furiously in her ear you an me hes t hev a talk it will be a last talk if you do not behave properly retorted bella walking proudly by his side even though i have the misfortune to be your daughter that does not give you the right to treat me so rudely ill treat y es i blamed well like y hussy yll go t yer room an eat bread an drink water t cool yer hot blood bella laughed derisively there is law in this country father she said quietly i shall go to my room certainly as i have no wish to remain with you but there need be no talk of bread and water tea an dry toast then grunted huxham looking at her savagely with his hard blue eyes y shell be punished y slut because i have fallen in love nonsense because yve disobeyed me in seein this blamed lister fatherbella stopped directly before the front door of the manorhousewhy do you hate cyril what have you against his name the captain quivered blinked his eyes cast his usual look over the left shoulder and then scowled shut yer mouth he growled an go t yer room cuss y this house is mine i am master here he rolled into the doorway and suddenly turned on the threshold id ruther see y dead an buried than merried t a man of t name of lister he snarled and before bella could recover from her astonishment he plunged into his den and shut the door with a noisy bang the girl passed her hand across her forehead in a bewildered way the mystery was becoming deeper and she saw no way of solving it huxham would not explain and cyril evaded the subject then bella remembered that her lover had promised an explanation when next they met a remembrance of this aided her to possess herself in patience and she tried to put the matter out of her head but it was impossible for her to meet her father at supper and forbear asking questions so she decided to obey him ostensibly and retire to her bedroom the next day she could have an interview with her lover and then would learn why the captain stormed and cyril winced when the name was mentioned bellas room was on the first floor and in the front of the mansion so that she had an extended view of the cornfields of mrs tunks hut near the boundary channel and of the pathway through the wheat leading deviously from the front door of bleacres across the channel and to the distant village of marshely standing at the window she could see the redroofed houses gathered round the square tower of the church and the uncultivated fields green and moist spreading on all sides the sun was setting and the landscape was bathed in rosy hues everything was peaceful and restful outside but under the manor roof was discord and dread huxham in his den paced up and down like a caged bear angered exceedingly by his daughters obstinacy as he termed it and bella in the seclusion of her own room was trying to quieten her fears hitherto she had lived what she termed a vegetable life but in these ominous hints it seemed as though she would very shortly have more than enough to occupy her mind as the twilight darkened bella still continued to sit at the window vainly endeavouring to forecast a doubtful future it was certain that huxham would never agree to her marriage with lister and would probably insist that she should become the wife of pence as bella had no money and no expectations of any save by obeying her father she did not know what to do unless the captain ceased to persecute her he would possibly turn her out of doors if she persisted in thwarting his will in that event she would either have to earn her bread as a governess or would be forced to ask lister to marry hera direct question which her maidenly pride shrank from putting moreoveras she recollectedcyril had plainly told her only a few hours previously that he could not marry her unless he obtained one thousand pounds within the week it was now tuesday and it was not easy to raise such a large sum within the next few days of course bella did not know what resources cyril had to draw upon and it might be that he would gain what he wanted then he could take her away and marry her but until the unexpected happened she did not know what to say or how to act it seemed to her that she had come to the crossroads of life and that all her future depended upon the path she now chose yet there was nothing to show her how to select the direction her idle eyes caught at the vivid spot of scarlet which came from the red coat of the martial scarecrow there it stood bound stiffly to a tall pole in the midst of the cornthe sentinel of those prosperous acres bella wondered that her father having been a sailor had not arrayed the figure in nautical dress as it was the red hue annoyed her for red was the colour of blood and there lingered in her mind the ominous speeches which had been made by her father and lister when quarrelling ill kill y said the captain and take care cyril had replied that you arent killed yourself first also there was the wild tale of pence regarding the offer made by huxham to compass the death of lister these things flashed into bellas uncomfortable mind as she looked at the red and ominous figure of the scarecrow then with a shudder she rose and dismissed these evil fancies i am growing morbid she thought looking at her anxious face in the glass tomorrow when i see cyriloh come in said she aloud she broke off to give the invitation as a sharp knock came to the door and it opened almost immediately to admit the plump figure of mrs coppersley carrying a tray heres some dry toast and a cup of tea said the widow severely your father says you are not to come to supper i shouldnt come if he wanted me to retorted bella as mrs coppersley set down her burden and if he thinks to punish me in this way he is very much mistaken does he think that i am a child to submit to his tyranny he thinks that you are a disobedient daughter said mrs coppersley drily and what do you think aunt the older woman coughed she thought that her niece was much too pretty and much too independent but had no illfeeling toward her save a natural petty feminine jealousy i dont know what to think she said sitting down to gossip of course your father is impossible and always wants his own way i dont see why folks should not be allowed to choose husbands for themselves jabezthis was huxhams christian nameobjects to my marrying henry and to your becoming the wife of this lister person dont speak of cyril in that way said bella with some impatience he is a gentleman and the man i love by the way aunt you might have brought up the teapot i dislike anyone else to pour out my tea your father poured it out himself while i went to the kitchen for the toast snapped mrs coppersley he said you were to have only this one cup what a petty tyrant he is sighed bella pushing the cup away aunt what do you think of cyril he is very handsome rejoined mrs coppersley cautiously but i dont know anything about his position or disposition i know he is the dearest fellow in the world aunt but like yourself his position is unknown to me mrs coppersley rose aghast do you mean to say that you would marry a man about whom you know nothing she demanded i know sufficient to choose him for my husband retorted bella spiritedly and i intend to marry him in spite of my fathers bullying then your father will not give you a single penny cried mrs coppersley i approve of his doing so you cant marry this man oh said bella bitterly i thought you agreed that a woman should choose her own husband a woman like myself who knows life bellanot a chit of a girl like you i am twenty years of age flashed out her niece and have the sense of a babe of three scoffed mrs coppersley moving towards the door perhaps a night of loneliness will bring you to your senses my dear she passed through the door and closed it i am locking you in by your fathers wish said mrs coppersley from the other side bella white with rage at this indignity sprang to wrench open the door but almost before she reached it the key clicked in the lock and she knew that she was a prisoner and the door was so stout and strong that there was no chance of a frail girl such as she was breaking it down but bella was in a royal rage and it was in her mind to scramble out of the window and escape but whats the use she thought her eyes filling with impotent tears i have no money and no friends and no other home what a shame it is for me to be at the mercy of my father in this way i shall have to submit to this insult there is nothing else i can do but oh ohshe clenched her hands as she again returned to the window and looked out into the rapidly darkening night i shall insist upon cyril marrying me at once if he loves me he surely will not stand by idly when i am treated in this way trying to calm herself she walked up and down the room the one slice of toast and the one cup of tea were on the table but anger had taken her appetite inexperienced in the troubles of life she was like a newlycaptured bird dashing itself against the wires of its hateful cage to and fro the girl walked revolving plans of escape from her fathers tyranny but in every direction the want of money proved an obstacle impossible to surmount nothing remained but for her to wait patiently until she could see cyril the next day then an exhaustive talk might lead to the formation of some plan whereby her future could be arranged for faint and far she heard the clock in marshely churchtower strike the hour of eight and began to think of retiring to bed the night was hot so she flung up the window and permitted the fresh air to circulate in the close room the atmosphere was luminous with starlight although there was no moon visible a gentle wind bent the rustling stalks of the vast cornfields and their shimmering green was agitated like the waves of the sea white mists rose ghostlike on the verge of the farm and into them the ocean of grain melted faintly what with the mists and the luminous night and the spreading wheatfields phantomlike in the obscurity bella felt as though she were in a world of vague dreams looking down the narrow path which showed a mere thread in the semigloom she beheld a tall dark figure advancing towards the house it was that of a man and by the way in which he walked bella felt sure that he was her lover her heart beat wildly perhaps cyril had come or rather was coming to see the captain and to plead his suit once more greatly agitated by this unforeseen visit she leaned out of the window as the man came almost directly under it he was cyril she felt certain both from his carriage and from the fact that she vaguely saw the grey suit he wore during the afternoon lister had been thus dressed cyril cyril she called out cautiously the man looked up and in the faint light she saw that he was indeed cyril for the eyes of love were keen enough to pierce the obscurity and also her window was no great height from the ground but the man looked up making no sign of recognition and stepped into the house without knocking at the door bella started back in surprise she knew that the front door was always unlocked until ten when her father usually retired to bed but it seemed strange that cyril who had quarrelled with the captain that very day should choose to risk his further wrath by entering the house uninvited also it was stranger still that cyril should have looked up without making some sign he must have known who she was for failing sight he had his hearing to recognise her voice it was all very strange bella twisted up her hair which she had let down and walked to the table to take up the now cold cup of tea her throat was parched with thirst by reason of her nerves and she wished to refresh herself so that she might think of what was best to be done cyril and her father had quarrelled and again she remembered the ominous threats they had used to one another it was inconceivable madness for lister to to beard the captain in his den knowing what a vile temper the old man possessed it was not at all impossible or even improbable but what the afternoon quarrel might be renewed and then heaven only knew what might happen drinking the cup of tea hastily bella thought over these things and resolved if she could not escape by the door to scramble out of the window then she could enter the house and appear in the captains den to be present at what would probably be a stormy interview already she was straining her ears to catch the faintest sound of quarrelling but as yet she could hear nothing certainly cyril had closed the front door for immediately he had entered she had heard him do so and again the walls of the old mansion were so thick that it was impossible she could hear when shut up in her bedroom what was taking place below anxiously she tried the door but in spite of all her efforts she failed to open it wild with alarm as to what might be happening she crossed to her bed intending to twist the sheets into a rope for descent from the window but as she caught at the linen she felt a drumming in her ears and sparks seemed to dance before her eyes apparently the strain on her nerves was making her ill also she felt unaccountably drowsy and in spite of every effort to keep awake she sank beside the bed with the sheets still grasped in her hands in two or three minutes she was fast asleep the window was still open and a bat swept into the room he flitted round the motionless figure uttering a thin cry and again passed out into the starry night the silvery voices of the nightingales in the copses round marshely village came faintly across the meadows mingled with the cry of a mousehunting screechowl still bella slept on hour after hour passed and the night grew darker the wind died away the cornfields ceased to rustle the nightingales to sing it became colder too as though the breath of winter was freezing the now moist air the stars yet glittered faintly and the highpitched whistle of a steamer could be heard from the distant river but on the whole the earth was silent and weirdly gloomy for summertime during the small hours there came an ominous hush of expectant dread which lasted until the twittering birds brought in the dawn bella opened her eyes to find her room radiant with royal red light she felt sick and dizzy for over her stood mrs coppersley shaking her vigorously by the shoulder bella bella your father is dead murder murder oh come to the study and see the murder chapter v a mysterious crime murder the ominous word struck at bellas heart in spite of the fact that her dazed brain could scarcely grasp its significance with unseeing eyes she stared at her terrified aunt mrs coppersley in her usual morning dress simply made for domestic purposes fell back from the motionless girl and gripped the table in the centre of the room her face was white her figure limp and almost crazy with alarm she looked twice her age nor did the sight of her nieces bewildered gaze reassure her with a quick indrawn breath of fear she lurched forward and again shook the girl bella bella whats come to you dont you hear me dont you understand bella jabez is dead your father has been murdered hes lying a corpse in his study and ohohohmrs coppersley reeled against the table again and showed signs of violent hysteria this spectacle brought back bella with a rush to the necessities of the moment she sprang to her feet with every sense alert and ready to be used seizing the ewer from the washstand she dashed the water over the sobbing terrified woman then braced herself to consider the situation bellas thoughts reverted to the events of the previous night she remembered that cyril had come to the house and without a sign of recognition had entered she had not seen him depart becausebecauseoh yes she had fallen unaccountably asleep slumber had overtaken her at the very moment when she was preparing to descend from the window in order tototo bella uttered a wild cry and the ebbing blood left her face pearly white the interview between her father and cyril had taken place she had not been there and nowand now what do you say she asked her aunt in a hard unemotional voice mrs coppersley quite unnerved and drying her scared face with the towel gasped and stared didnt you hear whats come to you bella your father has been murdered i got up this morning as usual and went into the study hes lying there covered with blood oh who can have killed him how should i know cried bella harshly i was locked up in this room by you aunt rosamund i fell asleep afterafter she stopped aware that she might say something dangerous after what asked mrs coppersley curiously after you leftafter i drank the tea oh how could i fall asleep whenwhenah bella made a bound for the table and took up the empty cup some dregs of tea remained which she tasted they had a bitter flavour and a thought flashed into her mind you drugged this tea she cried mrs coppersley flapped her plump hands feebly and gasped again never a very strongminded woman she was now reduced to a markedly idiotic condition under the strain of the tragic circumstances i drug your tea save us bella what do you mean i drank this tea and fell asleep said the girl sharply although before drinking it i did not feel at all sleepy now i have a disagreeable taste in my mouth and my head aches there is a queer flavour about what is left in the cup i am sure this tea was drugged by you good lord cried mrs coppersley indignantly why should i drug your tea bella your father poured it out himself in the study when i was getting you toast in the kitchen i told you so last night yes yes i remember bella passed her hand across her forehead my father evidently drugged the tea to keep me quiet and so he has met with his death by violence bella mrs coppersley screamed and made for the door what do you mean again the girl felt that she was talking too freely if cyril was implicated in the crime reported by mrs coppersley she must save cyril or at least she must hold her peace until she heard from her lover what had taken place during that fatal interview it was just possible that cyril had slain the captain in selfdefence and knowing her fathers violent character the girl could scarcely blame the young man she expected that this would happen and so had been anxious to intervene as a peacemaker but the drugged teashe felt certain that it had been drugged by her fatherhad prevented her doing what she wished now huxham was dead and lister whether in selfdefence or not was his murderer the thought was agony yet in the midst of the terror engendered by her surmise bella found herself blaming her father if he had not drugged the tea in order to keep her in her room this tragedy would not have happened captain huxham had paved the way to his own death but after all there might be extenuating circumstances and perhaps cyril would be able to explain meantime she would hold her tongue as to having seen him enter the house but if anyone else had seen him she turned to mrs coppersley where were you last night she demanded suspiciously i was with henry vand from seven until after ten said the woman meekly and evidently unaware why the leading question had been put i left your father in his study and when i returned i let myself in by the back door and went to bed quietly you know jabez always objected to my seeing henry so i wished to avoid trouble this morning when i went into theugh ugh come and see for yourself and mrs coppersley gripped bellas wrist to draw her towards the doorits murder and robbery bella released her wrist with a sudden jerk but followed the elder woman down the stairs robbery what do you mean come and see said mrs coppersley hysterically we must send for the police i suppose oh my poor nerves never never shall i get over this shock disagreeable as jabez always was to me and he wasnt ready for heaven either though perhaps he did send for mr pence to talk religion to him did my father send for mr pence yes he asked me to go to the village with a note for mr pence i could not find mr pence at home so left the note for him then i met henry and returned as i told you after ten oclock did mr pence come to see my father asked bella anxiously she was wondering if the preacher had by any chance seen cyril enter the house i dont knowi cant sayoh dear me how dreadful it all is maundered mrs coppersley opening the door of the study just look for yourself bella your father lies dead in his blood oh how i hope that the villain who killed and robbed him will be hanged and drawn and quartered that i do the wretch the viper the beast i must get some rum i cant stay in this room without some rum i shall faint i know i shall whats the time seven oclock oh dear me so late i must send tunks for the police he has to be here to see your father and oh dear me he cant see your father unless he goes to heaven where im sure i hope jabez has gone but one never knows and he certainly was most disagreeable to me oh how ill i am oh how very very bad i feel and thus lamenting mrs coppersley drifted out of the room towards the back part of the premises leaving bella alone with the dead man and captain huxham was dead stone dead his body lay on the floor between the desk and the chair he had been sitting on from the position of the corpse bella judged that her father had suddenly risen to meet the descending weapon which had pierced his heart but not being able to defend himself he had fallen dead at his murderers feet with a cautious remembrance that she must not remove anything until the police came bella knelt and examined the body carefully but without laying a finger on the same the clothes over the heart had been pierced by some extremely sharp instrument which had penetrated even through the thick peajacket worn by the dead man there was blood on the cloth and on the floor and although ignorant of medical knowledge bella judged that death must have been almost instantaneous otherwise there would have been signs of a struggle as captain huxham would not have submitted tamely to death but the casement was fast closed the furniture was quite orderly at least bella judged so when she first looked round for no chairs were upset but on a second glance she became aware that the drawers of the desk were open that the flexible lid of the desk was up and that the pigeonholes had been emptied of their papers alsoand it was this which startled her mostthe greenpainted safe was unlocked and through the door which stood ajar she could see that the papers therein were likewise in disorder in fact some of them were lying on the floor strongly agitated bella constructed a theory of the murder and saw as in a visionperhaps wrongfullywhat had taken place the captain had come to his desk for some purpose but hearing a noise or perhaps suspecting that there was danger had unexpectedly turned only to be stabbed when he fell dead the criminal took the keys of the safe from the dead mans pocket and committed the robbery then he examined the pigeonholes of the desk and afterwards departedprobably by the front door since the casement was closed robbery undoubtedly was the motive for the commission of the crime the girl rose to her feet drawing a long breath of relief cyril certainly could not have slain her father since cyril would not have robbed the young man assuredly had come to the houseshe could swear to that herselfand if he had quarrelled with huxham he might have struck him in a moment of anger but there was no reason to believe that cyril would rob the safe hence there must be another person who had committed both the murder and the robbery who was that person mrs coppersley had stated plainly that huxham had sent a message to pence asking him to call perhaps he had obeyed the summons after cyril left and then had murdered the captain but there was no motive for so timid and goodliving a man as the preacher to slay and rob so far as bella knew pence did not want money andsince he wished to make her his wifeit was imperative that huxham should live in order to forward his aims and it was at this point that the girl recalled with a shudder the fact that cyril had confessed his need for one thousand pounds could lister be the culprit after all no cried bella aloud and in an agony of shame the man i love could not be guilty of so vile an act so she tried to comfort herself but the fact of cyrils visit to the house still lingered in her mind shortly mrs coppersley returned with tunks at her heels the handyman of bleacres was a mediumsized individual with a swarthy skin and beady black eyes peering from under tangled black hair lean and lithe and quick in his movements he betrayed his gypsy blood immediately to the most unobservant for there was something oriental in his appearance just now he looked considerably scared and came no further than the door of the room theres your master said mrs coppersley pointing to the dead so just you go to the village and tell the policeman to come here bella you have not touched anything have you bella shook her head i have not even touched the body she confessed with a shudder tunks were you about the house last night no miss said the man looking more scared than ever i went home nigh on seven oclock and was with my granny all the evening i know nothing about this miss i dont suppose you do rejoined the girl tartly but i thought you might have seen my father later than mrs coppersley here i left the house last night at the same time as you maam said tunks addressing himself to the housekeeper you locked the back door after me yes acknowledged mrs coppersley promptly so you did that would be at seven as i came up and saw you bella a few minutes before with the tea and toast you didnt come back tunks no i didnt retorted the gypsy sullenly you went on to marshely and i got back home i never came near this house again until this morning you can ask my granny if i wasnt in bed early last night when did you see your master last questioned bella tunks removed his dingy cap to scratch his untidy locks it would be about six just before i had my tea he wanted to reduce my wages too and i said id give him notice if he did but i suppose growled tunks with his eyes on the remains its notice in any case now never you mind bothering about yourself cried mrs coppersley sharply go to marshely and tell the policeman to come here bella she moved to the door let us leave the room and lock the door nothing must be touched until the truth is known will the truth ever be known asked the girl drearily as she went into the hall and watched her aunt lock the door of the deathroom of course retorted the elder woman one person cannot murder another person without being seen i dont know so much about that aunt rosamund you and tunks were away and i was locked in my room so anyone could enter and she glanced towards the study door and shuddered did you see anyone asked mrs coppersley quickly bella started no she replied with unnecessary loudness how could i see anyone when i was drugged drugged miss cried tunks pricking up his ears mrs coppersley turned on the handyman and stamped how dare you linger here she cried you should be half way to the village by this time miss bella was having wakeful nights and her father gave her a sleeping draught off with you and she drove tunks out of the front door why did you tell such a lie asked bella when the man was hurrying down the path eager like all his tribe to carry bad news a lie a lie mrs coppersley placed her arms akimbo and looked defiant why do you call it a lie you did complain of sleepless nights and you did say that the tea poured out by jabez was drugged that is true enough admitted the girl quietly but i merely slept badly because of the hot weather and never asked my father for a sleeping oh interrupted mrs coppersley tossing her head what does it matter i cant even say if the tea was drugged ill learn that soon replied bella drily for i have locked up the cup containing the dregs of tea my father no doubt feared lest i should run away with cyril and so drugged it the least said the soonest mended bella say nothing of the drugging at the inquest as there is no need to blacken your fathers character i dont see that anything i could say would blacken my fathers character aunt rosamund of course he had no business to drug me but if i am asked at the inquest i shall tell the truth and so your connection with that lister person will come out bella turned on her aunt in a fury what do i care she cried stamping i have a right to marry him if i choose and i dont care if all the world knows how i love him in fact the whole world soon will know well said mrs coppersley with an air of washing her hands of the entire affair say what you like but dont blame me if you find yourself in an unpleasant position bella who was ascending the stairs turned to answer this last remark promptly why should i find myself in an unpleasant position she demanded do you accuse me of murdering father god forbid god forbid cried mrs coppersley piously and with a shudder but you cannot deny that you were alone in the house and locked in my bedroom as you can testify oh ill say that willingly but youd better wash out that cup of dregs and say nothing more i have already mentioned the matter in tunks hearing so i must explain further if necessary but ill say why i believe my father acted so your story of sleepless nights will not do for me youll blacken the memory of the dead groaned mrs coppersley dismally ah you never loved your poor father did you asked bella suddenly in a way i did and in a way i didnt said her aunt evasively jabez never was the brother he should have been to me but a daughters nearer than a sister and you should have loved him to distraction in spite of the way he behaved to me he had to keep a firm hand over your high spirit aunt rosamund burst out bella at white heat why do you talk in this silly way you know that both to you and to me my father acted like a cruel tyrant and that while he was alive we could do nothing to please him i dont want to speak ill of the dead but you know what i say is true we are none of us perfect snuffled mrs coppersley wiping her eyes and i daresay jabez was worse than many others but i was a good sister to him in spite of his horrid ways im sure my lifes been spent in looking after other people first my mother then my husband and afterwards jabez now ill marry henry vand and be happy dont talk of happiness with thatbella pointed downward to the studyin the house go and make yourself tidy aunt and ill do the same we have a very trying day before us so like jabez so very like jabez wailed mrs coppersley while bella fled up the stairs he always brought trouble on everyone even as a little boy he behaved like the pirate he was oh dear me how ill i feel bella bella come down and see me faint bella bella but the girl did not answer as she knew that mrs coppersley only wished to gossip going to her own room she again examined the cup with the dregs which she had not locked up in spite of her saying so to mrs coppersley undoubtedly the tea tasted bitter and she resolved to have it analysed so as to prove to herself the fact of the drugging she knew perfectly well that her father had attended to the tea himself evidently to render her helpless in case she meditated flight with cyril and in dong so he had indirectly brought about his own death for had she been awake she could have descended from the window to be present at the interview which had ended so fatally and at this pointwhile she was locking up the cup in a convenient cupboardbella became aware that she was thinking as though her lover were actually guilty of the deed of course he could not be she decided desperately even though things looked black against him lister honest and frank would not murder an old man in so treacherous a manner however he might be goaded into doing so and yet she had assuredly seen him enter the house if she could only have seen him depart but the drug had prevented that welcome sight pence might have struck the blow but pence had no reason to do so and in fact had every inducement to keep huxham alive bella could not read the riddle of the murder all she knew was that it would be necessary for her to hold her tongue about listers unexpected visit to the solitary farm but i shall never be able to marry him after this she wailed chapter vi the inquest tunks lost no time in delivering his gruesome message and in spreading the news of the death while the village policeman telegraphed to his superior officer at pierside the handyman of the late captain huxham adopted the publichouse as a kind of st pauls cross whence to promulgate the grim intelligence here he passed a happy and exciting hour detailing all that had happened to an awestricken crowd members of which supplied him with free drinks the marshfolk were a dull peaceful lawabiding people and it was rarely that crimes were committed in the district hence the news of the murder caused a tremendous sensation captain jabez huxham was well known and his eccentricity in the matter of planting bleacres with yearly corn had been much commented upon in napoleonic times the fertile marsh farms had been golden with grain but of late years owing to russian and american competition little had been sown huxham as the rustics argued could not have got even moderate prices for its crops so it puzzled one and all why he persisted in his unprofitable venture but there would be no more sowing at bleacres now for the captain himself was about to be put under the earth and a grand funeral hell have said the rustics morbidly alive to the importance of the grim event for thirty years no crime of this magnitude had been committed in the neighbourhood and the violent death of huxham provided these bovine creatures with a new thrill meanwhile the policeman dutton by name had proceeded to bleacres followedwhen the news became more widely knownby a large and curious throng for that day and for the following days until huxhams body was buried bleacres could no longer be called the solitary farm in one sense of the word but the inherent respect of the agriculturist for growing crops kept the individual members of the crowd male and female to the narrow path which led from the boundary channel to the front door of the manorhouse when inspector inglis arrived with three or four policemen from pierside he excluded the public from the grounds but the curious still hovered in the distancebeyond jordan as it werewith inquisitive eyes fastened on the quaint old mansion to them one and all it now assumed portentous proportions as the abode of terror inspector inglis was a very quiet man who said little but who kept his eyes on the alert he inspected the body of the dead man and then sent for a doctor who delivered his report in due course the study was examined thoroughly and the entire house was searched from cellar to garret then bella and her aunt were questioned and tunks was also put in the witness box but in spite of all official curiosity backed by official power on the part of inglis he convened the jury of the inquest as ignorant of the truth as when he had begun his search he certainly found a bloodstained dagger behind the massive mahogany desk with which undoubtedly the crime had been committed but he could discover no trace of the assassin and three or four days later when the inquest took place in the manorhouse the mystery of the murder was still unsolved nor on the evidence procurable did there seem to be any chance of solution during the early part of the inquiry mrs coppersley had told inglis how her late brother had sent her with a note to marshely asking silas pence to call when questioned the preacher not without agitation and dismay stated that he had been absent from his lodgings until eleven oclock on the fatal evening and had not obeyed the summons of the deceased certainly on his return he had found and read the note asking him to call but as the hour was late he had deferred the visit until the next morning then of course the news of the murder had been made public and pence had said nothing until questioned by the inspector but he was quite frank and open in his replies and inglis was satisfied that the young preacher knew nothing about the matter from the moment when informed by mrs coppersley of the crime until the inquest bella suffered greatly at her request dr wardthe medical man who had reported on the time and manner of huxhams deathhad examined the dregs of the teacup beyond doubt as he discovered laudanum had been poured into the tea and so largely that it was little wonder she had slept so soundly even had there been a struggle as ward assured her she would not have heard the commotion and as the state of the study showed that the murderer had taken his victim unawares it was little to be wondered at that bella woke in ignorance of what had taken place during the night she was thankful to have the testimony of the young physician as to the drugging since thereby she was entirely exonerated from complicity in the crime for dreadful as it may seem there were those evilseekers who hinted that huxhams daughter having been alone in the house must be aware of the truth if not actually guilty herself but bella knew that the evidence of dr ward and mrs coppersley as to the drugging and the locking of the bedroom door would clear her character it was therefore not on this account that she suffered but because of the inexplicable absence of cyril lister since she had seen him enter the house shortly after eight oclock on the fatal night she had not set eyes on him nor had she received any communication at a time when she needed him so greatly it seemed strange that her lover should be absent since the fact of the murder now being known all over england it appeared incredible that he alone should be ignorant in spite of her desire to believe him guiltless this conduct looked decidedly suspicious if nothing serious had taken place between cyril and her father on the night in question why had lister gone away at least she surmised that he had gone away as he did not appear to be in the village and she heard no mention of his name from the many people who haunted the house try as she might bella dearly as she loved the young man could not rid herself of the frightful belief that he had struck the blow considering the circumstances which she alone knew fully he had every reason to commit the crime yet in the face of the strongest circumstantial evidence bella could not bring herself to credit cyrils guilt day after day like sister anne she climbed to the quarterdeck to see if he was coming but the day of the inquest came in due course and even then he had not put in an appearance the coroner was a grim snappy old doctor who set forth the object of the inquest gruffly and tersely the jury under his direction inspected the body and then gathered in the large and stately diningroom of the manorhouse to consider the evidence inspector inglis confessed that he had few witnesses and that there was nothing in the evidence likely to lead to the arrest of the murderer robbery said the officer was undoubtedly the cause of the crime since the desk had been rifled and the safe had been forced open mrs coppersley the sister of the deceased he went on to say could state that she knew her brother kept at least one hundred pounds in gold in the safe this was missing so probably well take things in order if you please snapped the gruff coroner at this point of the inspectors speech call your witnesses inglis was only too willing and dr ward gave his evidence which proved that in his opinion after an examination of the body the deceased had been stabbed to the heart between the hours of eight and eleven on the night in question witness could not be more precise he said a confession which brought a grunt from the coroner the old doctor lifted his eyebrows to intimate that the young doctor did not know his business over well else he would have been more explicit but dr ward avoided an argument by hurriedly stating that according to his opinionanother grunt from the snappy coronerthe wound had been inflicted with the dagger found behind the mahogany desk this remark led to the production of the dagger a footlong steel broad towards the hilt and tapering to a sharp point this was set in a handle of jetblack wood carved into the semblance of an ugly negro and the odd part about the blade was that the middle portion of the steel was perforated with queer letters of the cuneiform type and filled in with copper the coroner frowned when he examined this strange weapon and he looked inquiringly at mrs coppersley does this belong to your late brother he asked jerkily mrs coppersley looked at the knife jabez being a sailor had all manner of queer things she said hesitatingly but i never set my eyes on that he wasnt one to show what he had sir was your brother ever in africa on the west coast he was all over the world but i cant rightly say where sir why this the gruff coroner shook the weapon is an african sacrificial knife in use on the west coast from the way in which the copper is welded into the steel i fancy some nigerian tribe possessed it the members of tribes thereabouts are clever metalworkers the handle and the lettering also remind me of something mused the doctor for i was a long time out in senegal and sierra leone and sawand sawbut thats no matter how comes an african sacrificial knife here im sure i dont know sir said mrs coppersley promptly jabez as i say had all manner of queer things which he didnt show me you cant say if this knife belonged to him no sir i cant the murderer may have brought it you are not here to give opinions growled the doctor throwing the uglylooking weapon on the table are you sure he added to ward that the wound was made with this knife yes im sure replied the young practitioner tartly for the coroners attitude annoyed him the weapon is sharp pointed and fits the wound also the deceased wore a thick peajacket and only such a knife could have penetrated the cloth if the blow were struck with sufficient force snapped the coroner it was rejoined the witness have you any more questions to ask me the coroner nodded and ward gave surgical details to prove that death must have taken place almost instantaneously since huxham had been stabbed to the heart apparently deceased heard a noise and rose suddenly from his chair at the desk to face round in selfdefence but the assassin was too quick for him and struck the knife to deceaseds heart with great force as is apparent from thats all supposition contradicted the coroner rudely stick to facts boiling with rage the young doctor confined himself forthwith to a bald statement of what he had discovered and then was curtly dismissed to give place to mrs coppersley that lady was voluble and sharptongued so that the coroner quite met with his match much to the delight of dr ward smarting under much discourtesy mrs coppersley deposed that she had left the house at seven oclock by the back door with a note for mr silas pence from her brother asking him to call at the manorhouse she left the note at mr pences lodgings and then went on to the grocery shop to make some purchases and to see mrs vand and her son henry there she remained until a quarter to ten oclock and afterwards returned to the manorhouse mr vand saw her as far as the boundary channel and then went home what time was that asked the coroner making notes just at ten replied witness flushing at the smile on the faces of those who knew of the love romance the clock struck ten while i was speaking to henryi mean to mr vandand not knowing that it was so late i feared lest my brother should be angry jabez was always very particular as to the house being locked up so i thought he might shut me out i went in by the back door having the key and retired at once to bed did you not see your brother asked the coroner no sir knowing jabezs violent temper i had no wish to see him lest there should be trouble i went on tiptoe to bed after locking the back door did you hear mr huxham moving about questioned a juryman timidly no mr tatters i didnt everything was quiet as i passed the door of the study and it was closed did you see a light in the window of the study when at the boundary channel with mr vand asked the coroner no i looked too said the witness for if jabez had been up there would have been trouble owing to my being late but there was no light in the window so i fancied jabez might have gone to bed and have locked me out but he hadnt guessed i was absent and so did you see a light under the study door when passing through the hall no and that made me believe that jabez had gone to bed but i didnt think of looking into the study if i had witness shuddered oh dear me how very dreadful it all is well then i went to bed and next morning came down early to clean the study when i entered i saw my brother dead in his gore whereupon i ran up stairs and got bella to come down then we sent for the police and thats all i know the coroner looked towards ward this evidence takes an hour off your time of death doctor he said sourly you say that the man was murdered after eight and before eleven well then as this witness reached the house just after ten and saw no light in the study the deceased must have been dead when she passed through the hall on her way to bed oh groaned mrs coppersley with her handkerchief to her lips how dreadful if id looked in to see jabez weltering in his gore its a pity you didnt rejoined the coroner sharply for then you could have given the alarm and the assassin might have been arrested yes cried mrs coppersley violently and the assassin might have been in the house at the moment with only two women mind and one of them drugged i should have been killed myself had i given the alarm so im glad i didnt drugged drugged what do you mean by drugged ask bella retorted mrs coppersley ive told all im going to tell not all said the coroner was the front door locked i didnt notice at the time being anxious to escape jabez and get to bed did you notice if it was locked in the morning yes when i opened it for tunks to go for the police it was locked said bella rising at this juncture but tunks opened it while i was talking with my aunt in the hall you can give your evidence when i ask you snapped the coroner rudely humph so the front door was locked and the back door also how did the assassin escape he couldnt have gone by the front door after committing the crime since the key was in the inside and you locked the back door coming and going mrs coppersley the murdering beast said the witness melodramatically might have got out of the study window then he must be a very small man retorted the coroner for only a small man could scramble through the window i examined it an hour ago please yourself said mrs coppersley with an air of indifference all i know is that im glad i didnt discover jabez in his gore on that night and at that hour if i had youd be holding an inquest on me possibly if the assassin was in the study when you passed through the hall mrs coppersley ugh shivered the witness and thats just where he was depend upon it sir getting through the window when hed dropped the knife behind the desk oh what an escape ive had wept mrs coppersley there there dont bellow said the coroner testily get down and let the witness luke tunks be called the bleacres handyman had very little to say but gave his evidence in a straightforward manner he had left the house with mrs coppersley at seven and had gone straight home to bed as he was tired his grandmother could depose to the fact that he was in bed until the morning then he came as usual to the manorhouse and found that his master was dead he admitted that he had quarrelled with his master over a possible curtailment of wages and they had not parted in a very friendly spirit but you cant say as i did for him ended the witness defiantly no one suggests such a thing snapped the coroner had you any reason to believe that deceased expected to be murdered tunks scratched his head i have and i havent he said at length master did seem afraid of someone as he was always looking over his shoulder he said that he planted the corn so that there should be only one path up to the house then he rigged up that outlook round the chimney there witness jerked his head towards the ceiling and hes got a searchlight there also which he turned on at times the coroner nodded the late captains searchlight was wellknown but it was only put down as another freak on the part of a freakish man but the remark of the witness about the corn was new do you mean to say that the deceased planted the corn as a protection against some one coming on him unawares yes i do said tunks sturdily corn dont pay and there was always only one pathway left now my idea is we dont want to hear your ideas said the coroner get down silas pence the young preachers examination occupied only a few minutes he said that he was absent from his lodgings until eleven and then returned to find the note as it was late he did not call and went to bed as his landlady could prove he had no reason to believe that captain huxham expected to be murdered and considered that the old sailor was more than capable of looking after himself witness was very friendly with the captain and wished to marry miss huxham an arrangement to which the captain was quite agreeable witness presumed that huxham wished to see him about the projected marriage when he wrote the note asking witness to call next morning when about to pay the visit witness heard of the murder bella was the final witness and stepped before the coroner and the inquisitive jurymen looking pale but composed she gave her evidence carefully as she made up her mind to say nothing about cyrils visit on the fatal night also she was grateful that in his statement pence had said nothing of listers rivalry she noted also that pence had kept quiet about the offer of her hand as a reward for the death of cyril made by her father to the preacher more than ever she believed this wild declaration to be due to imagination on the young mans part what have you to say about this matter miss huxham asked the coroner in his usual gruff way nothing at all she replied nothing at all he echoed and the jurymen looked at one another no i had quarrelled with my father on the afternoon of the night when he met with his terrible death he refused to let me come to supper so i retired to my room mrs coppersley brought me up tea and toast and then locked me in my room by her fathers orders cried mrs coppersley rising silence said the coroner scowling but surely miss huxham you could have heard if i heard nothing interrupted bella straightening her slim figure for i was drugged hm the coroner looked at her shrewdly mrs coppersley said something of that why were you drugged who drugged you my father drugged the cup of tea brought by my aunt with laudanum said bella bravely determined to speak out yet conscious of the curious faces yes he did cried mrs coppersley i brought the tea to the study and then went to get the toast jabez had poured out the tea when i came back and giving me a cup told me to take it to bella i never knew myself that it was drugged but i can state that it was said dr ward rising miss huxham gave me the dregs to examine i can prove the coroner intervened testily all this is very much out of order he said let us proceed with caution miss huxham tell your story and then we can hear dr ward and mrs coppersley i have scarcely any story to tell said bella still apprehensive yet still brave and discreet i am engaged to be married but my father did not approve of my choice he interrupted my meeting with my future husband who is he if i may ask mr lister he is a gentleman who has been stopping here yes yes i know and the coroner did know for his wife was a great gossip and collected all the scandal for miles around in fact he had heard something of the philandering of lister after miss huxham go on bella proceeded my father would not allow me to come to supper and sent up my aunt with tea and toast to lock me in my room she did so i did not eat the toast but i drank the tea and then fell asleep half on the floor and half on my bed my aunt awoke me in the morning with the news of what had happened and you heard nothing how could she growled ward when she was drugged silence there said the coroner sharply what time did you fall under the influence of the opiate miss huxham shortly after eight so far as i can recollect did you know that the tea was drugged if i had i should not have drunk it retorted the witness it was only next morning that i guessed the truth and then i kept the dregs for dr ward to examine he says he can give his evidence himself interrupted the coroner why did your father drug you i cant say sir unless he feared lest i should elope with mr lister had you any such intention no i had not the coroner looked at her earnestly and pinched his lip apparently nonplussed the whole affair struck him as strange and he crossexamined the girl carefully when he examined mrs coppersley and ward both of them bore out the improbable storyin the coroners opiniontold by the girl finally the old doctor accepted the testimony and dismissed the witnesses i cant compliment you on the conduct of this case inspector inglis he said when informed that no more witnesses were forthcoming you have collected nothing likely to solve the mystery i cannot manufacture evidence sir said inglis stiffly the coroner grunted and made an acid speech in which he pointed out that the evidence laid before him and the jury amounted to absolutely nothing only one verdict could be brought inwilful murder against some person or persons unknown this was accordingly done and the assembly dispersed only the coroner remained to state sourly to inglis that he considered the police in general to be fools and the pierside inspector to be the king of them chapter vii cyril and bella captain huxhams death having been legally relegated to the list of undiscovered crimes his gnarled old body was committed to a damp grave in marshely cemetery there was a vast concourse of people from far and near to assist at the funeral of one who had been so mysteriously murdered so greatly had the strangeness of the deed appealed to the imagination of metropolitan readers that many london reporters came down to see the last of the case and if possible to begin it again by making enquiries but ask as they might they could learn nothing they were therefore compelled to content themselves with picturesque descriptions of the ancient manorhouse amidst its cornfields and with inaccurately lurid accounts of the late owners career as a sailor mrs coppersley went to the funeral as chief mourner as bella resolutely declined to do so she was sorry for her tyrannical fathers violent death but being very human found it difficult to forgive him for the way in which he had behaved he had bullied her and shut her in her room and finally had drugged her by stealth but as it turned out it was just as well that he had done so as thereby she was able to prove that she knew nothing of the crime even though she was alone in the house then again there was the other side of the question to takethat if huxham had not administered the laudanum he might have been alive and well at the moment it seemed to bella overstrung with nerves that some higher powers had dealt out a punishment to the captain for crimes committed but undiscovered certainly she agreed with tunks that her father had some dark secret in his mind which led him to isolate himself in the midst of the corn however he was dead and buried so all debts were paid and bella sitting in the vast drawingroom of the manorhouse with a churchservice open on her lap tried hard to forget huxhams bad traits of character and to remember his good ones this was somewhat difficult as the captain had few engaging qualities but bella recalled that he had been kind in a gruff sort of way and had never grudged her the best of food and the gaudiest of frocks huxham had been one of those socalled good people who are amiable so long as everything is done according to their liking but who display the tyrant when crossed but on the whole he might have been worse and after all as she anxiously kept in mind he was her father the room wherein she sat with the blinds down was opposite the study and was a large apartment sparsely furnished huxham did not care for a drawingroom as he preferred his den but mrs coppersley had bothered him incessantly until he provided her with furniture for the place she selected the furniture herself and what with her brothers stinginess and her own bad taste the result was woefully bad the room spacious lofty and stately was decorated as beautifully as was the study and required the most exquisite furniture to enhance its faded splendours but mrs coppersley had bought a magentahued sofa and many magentacovered chairs together with a cheap sideboard so sticky as to look like a fly catcher and two arm chairs of emerald green the inlaid floor she had covered with lineoleum diapered white and black and her artistic taste had led her to paint the mellow oak panelling with pink aspinalls enamel as the curtains of the many windows were yellow and the blinds blue the effect was disastrous and suggestive of a paintbox an artist would have died of the confusion of tints and the barbarism of destroying the oak panels but mrs coppersley was more than satisfied with the result and when seated in the drawingroom on sunday felt herself to be quite the lady at the present moment bellas nerves were less troubled than usual the blinds were down in sympathy with the funeral and a dim twilight pervaded the room hiding more or less the atrocious grandeur she sat in one of the green armchairs near the fireplace reading the burial service and listening to the solemn tolling of the bell but after a time she dropped the book on her lap and leaned back to close her eyes and reflect on her grave position if only she had not seen cyril on that night she could have married in ignorance that he had anything to do with the death of her father but enlightened as she was it appeared impossible that she should become his wife she had said nothing of his visit at the inquest but the hideous doubt remained in her mind although she strove to banish it by assuring herself over and over again that lister could have had no hand in the matter but how could she prove his innocence she was alone in that sinister house and although it was bright sunshine out of doors she felt scared the cool dim room the dreary booming of the distant bell the impressive words of the burial service which she had just been readingall these things united in a weird appeal to her psychic instincts to those mysterious senses which deal with the unseen in the armchair she sat with closed eyes strung up to breakingpoint and felt that if the psychic influence which seemed to control her became more insistent she would scream a thought flashed across her mind that her father was walking that dim chill apartment trying to communicate the truth and in her nervous excitement she could almost have sworn that she heard the heavy tread of his feet thus when she really did hear a light footstep in the entrance hall without she uttered a piercing scream and staggered to her feet the hall door she knew had been left open since the coffin had been carried down the path between the standing corn so that anyone could enter perhaps the assassin had come back to review the scene of his crime or to commit another whitefaced and panicstricken by the power of her own emotions engendered by the circumstances she clung to the back of the armchair straining her eyes towards the door at the sound of her thin highpitched scream the footsteps had ceased for a moment as though the intruder was listening now they recommenced and drew near the outside of the door unable to utter a sound bella stared through the dim lights and saw the door open cautiously a face looked in and the eyes set in the face blinked in the semigloom then the door opened widely and cyril lister stepped in oh my darling with a sudden rush of relief bella ran rapidly towards the door to throw herself into her lovers arms then a gruesome memory of that sinister visit made her falter and pause half way cyril closed the door and stood where he was holding out his hungry arms dearest he said softly oh my poor girl but bella did not move she stood looking at him as though fascinated he wore a white drill suit made tropicfashion high at the neck with white shoes and a panama hat his whiteclothed figure accentuated the twilight of the room which now looked brown and grim considering that her father was dead and even now was being laid in an untimely grave cyril might have come to her dressed in mourning unlessah unless ohshe stretched out an arm as he advanced slowlydont come near medont come near me bella he stopped in sheer surprise bella darling dont you know me ah yes i know you she gasped retreating towards the chair perhaps i know you too well because i have not been to see you before he asked surprised bella dearest i would have come but that i have been abroad during the week i had to go to paris to see aa friend of mine she noted the hesitation and shivered when did you go cyril came near and again she shrank away on the afternoon when your father found us in the cornfield its not true its not true how can you lie to me bella cyril stopped short again and in the faint light she could see that he looked thoroughly puzzled and amazed what do you mean the girls legs refused to support her any longer and she sank into the chair my father is being buried she gasped i know i know he replied sympathetically i went to the funeral but finding you were not present i came here to comfort you youyouyou went to the funeral her eyes dilated why should i not go after all even though we quarrelled he was your father and a last tribute of respect oh stop stop you can say this to meto me of all people lister frowned and pinched his lip this lonely house and this cold dull room have unnerved you he said after a pause i make every allowance for what you have gone through but but you know you understand know what understand what he inquired sharply i said nothing at the inquest i held my tongue i never bella cyril now thoroughly roused advanced and seized her wrists in no gentle grasp are you crazy talking in this way i have had enough to make me crazy she said bitterly let me go not till you explain your mysterious behaviour nohe grasped her wrists tighter as she strove to release herselfnot till you explain ah she cried out shrilly will you murder me also lister suddenly released her wrists and fell back a pace murder you also he repeated am i then in the habit of murdering people my father youyou well go on said he as the word stuck in her throat ohshe wrung her hands helplesslyi saw you i saw you saw me what his voice became impatient and almost fierce i saw you enter the housethis house saw meenter this house when on the night my father was murderedat eight oclock what the devil are you talking about cried cyril roughly i was in london at eight oclock on that night and went to paris the next morning i never heard of the murder as i saw no newspapers when i returned last night i read the account of the inquest in the evening papers and i came down this morning to comfort you i really think trouble has turned your head bella the girl stared at him in astonishment even though she had spoken so very plainly cyril did not seem to comprehend that she was accusing him of having committed a dastardly crime her heart suddenly grew light perhaps after all she was mistaken andandyou can prove your innocence my innocence of what in heavens name he cried angrily ofofthethemurder she faltered lister stared and scarcely could believe his ears you are not serious oh my dear she sobbed i wish i were not and you accuse me of murdering your father no no really i dont accuse you of actuallythat is of reallybut i saw you enter this house at eight oclock or a little after on that night i intended to come down thinking you and my father might quarrel but i drank the teayou must have seen about the tea at the inquestthat is in the report given in the papers then i fell asleep and woke to hear that my father was dead but i never betrayed you cyril god is my witness that i have held my tongue lister passed his hand across his forehead and fell helplessly into a near chair you accuse me of murdering your father he said again no no she repeated feverishly but i saw youyou looked upyou wore the grey clothes as you had done in the afternoon when father interrupted us bella bella you must have been dreaming or the drug i was not dreaming she interrupted vehemently and i saw you before i drank the drugged tea i called to you and you looked up but you entered the house without making any sign of recognition then i fell asleep andandohmy dearshe flung herself down at his feet and seized his hand what took place between my father and you im sure you did not kill him i am quite sure of that and remember i held my tongue yes i held oh groaned the young man looking down into her agitated face i am losing my reason you will shortly persuade me that i killed but you did notyou did not ah never say that you did no said lister shortly and rose so suddenly as to let her fall and if you believe me to be a murderer we had better part i dont i dont she wailed stretching out her hands as he strode towards the door oh cyril dont leave me you are all i have lister was in a white heat with rage and stood fumbling at the door but a backward glance at her pale face cooled him somewhat he recognised that he was in the presence of some mystery and that it was necessary for his own peace of mind as for bellas to probe the mystery to the bottom on the impulse of the moment he walked back and lifting her placed her again in the armchair then he knelt beside her and took her hands darling he said softly and firmly i swear to you what i would not swear to any living creature that i am innocent if anyone but you had accused me i should have cyril cyril she wreathed her arms round his neck i only fancied but i really did not think that he removed her arms you should believe in my innocence in the face of all evidence he said sternly but my own eyes she faltered he frowned that certainly is puzzling still the drug i saw you enter the house before i drunk the tea she protested i told you that before your senses were quite clear perfectly clear and i thought that you had come to try and induce my father to consent to our marriage strange muttered the young man i was not near the house are you sure are you sure oh listers tone was highly exasperated you will drive me mad talking in this way hearken he added speaking calmer when i left you and captain huxham in the cornfield i went straight back to my lodgings there i found a letter referring to the thousand pounds i wished to borrow i had to see the friend who was willing to lend it to me on that night i therefore went to london by the six oclock train my landlady can prove that i left the house the flyman can prove that i drove to the local station the ticket office there that i bought a ticket and the guard of the train shut me himself in a firstclass compartment that is evidence enough i fancy yes yes for me but but i might have sneaked back i suppose you mean he said bitterly and rising to walk the floor i can prove an alibi easily at eight oclock i was at my friends rooms in duke street st jamess as his man can swear he had gone to paris and i arranged to follow i went to the theatre and to dinner with two friends of mine and did not leave them until one in the morning when i returned to my hotel the murder took place at eleven or between eight and eleven so i can easily prove that i was not here next morning i went to paris and got the money from my friend i lingered there with him and only returned yesterday to learn that your father was dead then i came down here this morning tomeet with this reception cyril cyril dont be hard on me are you not hard yourself he retorted how can i love a woman who doubts me besides robbery was the motive for the commission of the crime am i likely to stab an old man and then rob him no i never believed and yet and yet what he asked curtly youyouwanted a thousand pounds ohhis lip curledand you believed that i robbed your fathers safe to get it unfortunately i understood from your aunts evidence at the inquest that only one hundred pounds in gold were in the safe so i must have committed a brutal murder needlessly i never said that you murdered my father cried bella despairingly you inferred as much he retorted cuttingly also that i robbed no no no she cried vehemently now thoroughly believing him to be completely innocent and trying womanlike to recover her position but cyril listen to me and you will see that as things look i was justified nothing can justify your believing me to be guilty of a double crime bella bowed her proud head i can see that now she said humbly you should have seen it before he replied harshly she raised her head and looked at him indignantly bringing into play the powerful weapon of sex you give me no opportunity of defending myself she said in the offended tone of a woman wronged i ask your pardon and give you the opportunity now he replied coldly i saw you enter the house she repeated somewhat weakly that is impossible he rejoined briefly oh she clasped her hands together what is the use of saying that it was not you since i firmly believe what you tell me all the same cyril sprang forward seized her hands and looked deep into her eyes you believe me then yes i do but if the man was not you he must have been your double was he so like me then exactly like you dont i tell you cyril that i leaned out of the window and spoke to the man i called him by your name what did he do he looked up but making no sign of recognition stepped into the house as the door was not locked i never believed for one moment that it was not you and resolved to clamber out of the window to be present at the interview then i drank the drugged tea and she made a gesture of despairyou know the rest how was the man dressed in a grey suit just as you wore in the afternoon you saw the face i saw it very plainly although the twilight was growing darker at the time but i could have sworn it was your face would i have spoken to the man had i not believed him to be you no and yetcyril stopped and tugged at his moustache his face had grown pale and he looked decidedly worried the man was of my height he was like you in every respect perhaps if i had seen him in broad daylight i might have recognised my mistake unlessoh cyril could it have been your ghost no said lister in a strangled voice dont be absurd i have an idea that he made for the door theres nothing more to say cyril will you leave me wont you kiss theres nothing more to say said lister now deadly pale and walked abruptly out of the dim room bella fell back in the chair and wept all was over chapter viii the witchwife the interview between the engaged lovers had been a strange one and not the least strange part was the termination apparently after hearing the description of the mysterious double given by bella her lover could have explained muchat least she gathered this from the hints his broken conversation gave after his departure she sat weeping until it struck her sensible nature how very foolish she was to waste time in idle regrets whether cyril felt so mortally offended by her doubts as to regard the engagement at an end she could not say but after some thought she believed that her remarks had given him a clue which he had left thus abruptly to follow up sooner or later he would return to explain and then all would be well between them and in spite of his odd behaviour she had one great consolation in knowing that he was innocent his denial of guilt had been so strong the alibi he set forth was so easy of proof and so impossible of invention that she blamed herself sincerely for ever having doubted the young man nevertheless considering the weird circumstances and the fact of the likeness of the doublewhomsoever he might beto her lover she could scarcely regard herself as having been foolish nine people out of ten would have made the same mistake and would have harboured similar doubts certainly seeing that she loved cyril devotedly she should have been the tenth but in the hour of trial her faith had proved very weak she tried to remind herself that she had never really believed him to be guilty all the same recalling the late conversation she had to recognise that her words could have left very little doubt in listers mind as to the fact that she believed him to be a robber and an assassin well if she had surely she had been severely punished as was only fair mrs coppersley returned from the funeral in a very chastened frame of mind and in the company of henry vand whom she had bidden to tea the table was furnished forth with funeral baked meats after the fashion of hamlets mothers wedding and mr vand did full justice to themwonderful justice considering his apparently delicate constitution he was not very tall and remarkably handsome with his young cleanshaven face his large blue eyes and his curly golden hair his body was wellshaped all save the right foot which was twisted and the leg of which was shorter than the other like talleyrand and lord byron the young man was clubfooted but otherwise had a very attractive personality from his delicate fingers it could be seen that he was a musician and he had an air of refinement astonishing in one of his breeding and birth bella did not like him much not that she had any fault to find with him but his eyes were shallow like those of a bird and his conversation was dull to say the least of it the sole way in which he could converse was through his violin and as he had not that with him on this occasion bella preferred to remain absent from the lavish teatable mrs coppersley did not object as she wanted her darling all to herself however mrs coppersley was very severe on her niece for not attending the funeral and had many sweet things to say regarding virtues of the deceased which she had just discovered after his death he meant well did poor dear jabez sighed mrs coppersley over a cup of tea and if he did swear it was his calling that made him profane bellaher niece was standing at the door as she spoketomorrow im going up to see the lawyer about the property oh dont trouble about that said bella wearily no thank you mr vand i dont care to eat i feel too miserable not trouble about the property cried mrs coppersley paying no attention to the latter part of this speech but i do care things must be settled somehow i must arrange my future life and she cast a tender glance on the handsome musician your future must be settled also i shall look after that said bella not liking her aunts tone you had better be sharp then said mrs coppersley in a dictatorial manner for the sooner things are settled the better im not young andshe cast a second tender glance on her swain who was eating largelyah well its useless to talk of weddings when funerals are in the air tomorrow evening bella after i have seen the lawyerand he lives in cade lane londonill tell you what i have arranged bella looked in astonishment at her aunt who suddenly seemed to have acquired the late captains tyrannical manner apparently mrs coppersley forgotas bella thoughtthat she would not inherit the solitary farm and needed to be reminded of the fact that her niece was the mistress of bleacres in fact bella was on the point of saying as much when she remembered that vand was present not being anxious to discuss family matters in his presenceeven though he was about to enter the family as mrs coppersleys husbandshe abruptly left the room mrs coppersley poured herself out a second cup of tea and remarked in a high tone of satisfaction that some peoples noses were about to be brought to the grindstone bella heard the remark as she put on her hat and walked out of the front door it accentuated her lonely feeling for she saw plainly now what she had long guessedthat aunt rosamund had very little affection for her the late captain also had never cared much for his daughter and now that cyril had vanished in an enigmatic manner the poor girl felt more wretched than ever listlessly she walked down the narrow path as far as the boundary channel and wondered how it would all end had she been a religious girl she might have sought comfort in prayer but she knew very little about true religion and did not care for the sort preached by mr silas pence in the little bethel at marshely as his name flashed into her mind she looked up and saw him standing on the opposite side of the channel so it was apparentalthough she knew nothing about such thingsthat some telepathic communication had made her think of him the preacher was in his usual dismal garb and had accentuated the same by wearing black gloves and a black tie in place of his usual white one patience on a monument might have been taken as a type of mr pence on this occasion but he was not smiling on grief in the person of miss huxham in fact he did not smile at all being shocked to see her out of doors why are you not weeping in your chamber reproved silas in his most clerical manner the loss of so good a father you have doubtless said all you had to say on that subject at the funeral mr pence retorted bella whose nerves were worn thin with worry spare me a repetition of such stale remarks it was a horribly rude speech as she well knew but pence had a way of irritating her beyond all endurance and the mere sight of him was sufficient to set her teeth on edge for the day it was intolerable that he should intrude on her privacy now when she particularly wished to be alone she intimated as much by turning away with a displeased air and walked for a short distance along the bank path leading to mrs tunks hut but silas absolutely ignorant of the feminine nature and entirely devoid of diplomacy persisted in thrusting his company upon her bella turned sharply when she heard silas breathing hard behind her and spoke with marked indignation i wish to be alone if you please she declared flushing ah no ah no remonstrated pence stupidly allow me to comfort you you cannot she retorted marvelling at his density allow me to try i was on the point of calling at the house to bella interrupted him cruelly you can call there still mr pence and my aunt will be glad to see you she has mr vand to tea so you will find yourself in congenial company your company is congenial enough for me that is very flattering but i prefer to be alone silas however declined to be shaken off and his reproachful looks so exasperated bella that she felt inclined to thrust him into the water and his speech was even more irritating than his manner let me soothe you my dear brokenhearted sister he pleaded in a sheeplike bleat i dont want soothing i am not brokenhearted and i am not your sister pence sighed this is very very painful it is bella admitted readily to me surely you are man enough mr pence to take a plain telling if you wont accept a hint i want you to leave me at once as i am not disposed to talk if i had my way i would never never leave you again perhaps but so far as i am concerned you will not get your way why do you dislike me miss huxham i neither like nor dislike you she retorted suppressing a violent inclination to scream so annoying was this persecution you are nothing to me i want to be something i wish you to be my sealed fountain your late lamented father desired you to be my spouse i am aware of that mr pence but perhaps you will remember that i refused to marry you the other day you broke my heart then go and mend it then cried bella furiously angry and only too anxious to drive him away by behaving with aggressive rudeness you alone can mend it pence dropped on his knees oh i implore you to mend it my hephzibah you are to me a rose of sharon a lily of the vale get up sir and dont make a fool of yourself oh angel of my life listen to me lately i was poor in this worlds goods but now i have gold marry me and let us fly to far lands and i thought you were desperately poor said bella suspiciously where did you get the money an aged and godfearing christian aunt left it to me said pence dropping his eyes it is a small sum but one hundred pounds in gold perhaps pence rose as though moved by springs and his thin white cheeks flushed a deep scarlet what do you mean bella could not have told herself what she meant at the moment but it had suddenly occurred to her to try and rid herself of this burr by hinting that he had something to do with the robbery if not with the murder under ordinary circumstances she would never have ventured to do this being a kindhearted girl but pence exasperated her so greatly that she was on the impulse of the moment prepared to go to any length to see the last of him i mean she said in reply to his last question that my father had one hundred pounds in gold in his safe you accuse me of i accuse you of nothing cried bella cutting him short and flaming up into a royal rage i am tired of your company and of your silly talk i only wish that mr lister would come along and throw you into the channel the red faded from pences face and he looked wickedly white his eyes flashed with sinister lights i dare say you do he said venomously but mr lister had better keep out of my way and out of the way of the police the girl felt her heart almost stop beating now it is my turn to ask you what you mean she said slowly and preserving her coolness but the preacher saw that she was shaken and followed up his advantage i think you had better make terms with me accept me as your husband or or what i shall tell the police what i saw he finished spitefully what did you see she asked in a shaking voice on the evening of the murder i came here at a quarter to eight said silas slowly his glittering eyes on her pale face i wished to adore the shrine wherein was my jewel that is i desired to gaze on the house beneath whose roof you slept oh stop talking like this and speak plainly she interrupted wearily i shall speak plainly enough now said the young man calmly while watching by the entrance through the bushes on the other side of the channel i was suddenly brushed aside by that lister person it was growing dark but i recognised his figure his insolent face his lordly air of prosperity he walked up to the house and i turned away sick at heart knowing that he had gone to see you when i looked again on my way back to marshely he had disappeared so you see he paused i see what she questioned nervously that the lister person must know somewhat of this crime if indeed he did not strike the blow himself how can you say that when you lately intimated that mr listerif it was mr lister which i doubthad come to see me i remember the evidence given by yourself and your aunt at the inquest retorted pence sharply you were locked in your room and were in a drugged sleep mrs coppersley had gone to my lodgings to deliver the note from your late father which i found on my return that lister person must have seen your father and as they were not on good terms how do you know that they were not because your late father hated the very name of lister and said that he would rather see you dead than married to him also in the note left at my lodgings your father said that he had quarrelled seriously with this lister person and had locked you in your room now if i showed that note to the police and related how the lister person had brushed me aside so that he could cross the channel he would be arrested no he would not said bella doggedly but her heart sank yes he would he hated your late father he was alone in the house with him and i believe that he killed him so that he might marry you as if i would marry any man who murdered my father said bella angrily you are talking a lot of nonsense mr pence mr lister was in london on that evening and afterwards went to paris i dont believe it who told you he told me so himself naturally he has to make the best of things but i know the lister person well by sight and i am prepared to take my oath that he entered the manorhouse about eight oclock on the night of the murder mr lister has a good alibi said bella with a carelessness which she was far from feeling and gathering up her skirts to go you can tell the police what you like mr pence i am not afraid for mr listers good name you will make no terms demanded pence annoyed by her feigned coolness no she said abruptly do what you like ill give you three days to think over the matter cried pence as she turned away if by that time you do not agree to become my wife i shall denounce that lister person to the police bella took no notice of the threat but walked swiftly away in the direction of mrs tunks hut hearing no footsteps she concluded that mr pence had not followed and a cautious look round revealed him crossing the planks on his way home bella felt sick with apprehension and when she reached the hut had to lean against the door for support but she had no time to consider matters for unexpectedly the door opened and she fell into the bony arms of mrs tunks i knew you were coming dearie croaked the old creature the crystal told me a glance along the path told you retorted bella recovering her balance and entering the hut why do you talk to me of the crystal mrs tunks you know i dont believe in such things well i know your blind eyes and stubborn heart lovey only trouble will make you see truths and you aint had enough yet theres more coming how do you know asked bella sitting down on a brokenbacked chair with a sudden sinking of the heart i know i know mumbled mrs tunks squatting on a stool near the fire who should know but i who am of the gentle romany hold your peace dearie and let me think and she lighted a dingy black clay pipe luke aint here added mrs tunks blowing a cloud of smoke so weve the whole place to ourselves lovey and the crystals ready she nodded towards a bright spark of light and bella saw a round crystal the size of an apple standing in a cheap china eggcup there was no light in the bare room but the ruddy flare of the smouldering fire and what with the semidarkness the fumes of mrs tunks pipe and that bright unwinking spot bella felt as though she were being hypnotised the hut built of turf was square and was divided by a wooden partition into two equal parts one of these parts was again subdivided into two sleeping densthey could not be called bedroomsfor mrs tunks and her grandson the day apartment which did for sittingroom diningroom drawingroom and general livingroom was small and dirty and dingy the ceiling of rough thatch black with smoke could almost be touched by bella without rising the floor was of beaten earth the chimney a wide gaping hollow of turf and there was one small window usually tightly closed beside the crazy door the furniture consisted of a deal table of home manufacture with its legs sunken in the earthen floor and a few stools together with the brokenbacked chair on which the visitor sat there also was a rough wooden dresser on which were ranged a few platters of wood and some china the whole abode was miserable in the extreme and in wet weather must have been extremely uncomfortable granny tunks as she was usually called housed like an early briton or a saxon serf but she seemed to be happy enough in her den perhaps because it was better than the rough life of the road which had been her lot in life before she had married a gorgio she was a lean grim old creature with very bright black eyes and plentiful white hair escaping from under a red handkerchief her dress was of a brown colour but tagged with bright patches of yellow and blue and crimson and she wore also various coins and beads and charms which kept up a continuous jingle on the whole granny tunks was a picturesque figure of the oriental type and this added to her sinister reputation as one acquainted with the unseen world gained her considerable respect the marsh folk still superstitious in spite of steam and electricity called her the wise woman but granny dubbed herself a witchwife quite like a norse warrior would have done bella stared at the crystal until she felt quite dreamy while granny watched her with a bright and cunning eye suddenly she rose and took the gleaming globe in her skinny hand youve put your lifepower into it mumbled the witchwife now ill read whats coming no no cried bella suddenly startled into wakefulness i dont want to know anything mrs tunks granny took no notice but peered into the crystal by the red light of the fire youve trouble yet before you dearie she said in a singsong voice but peace in the end youll marry the gentleman you love when a black man comes to aid your fortunes a black man what do you mean theres no more said mrs tunks the vision has faded a black man remember chapter ix the coming of durgo the fortnight which followed the funeral of captain huxham passed quietly enough at the solitary farm mrs coppersley went several times to london for the purpose of interviewing her late brothers lawyer who had his office in cade lane she said very little to bella when she returned and on her part bella did not ask questions had she been more versed in worldly wisdom she would have accompanied her aunt to see the solicitor for herself so that she might learn what disposition had been made of the property but bella was an unsophisticated girl and moreover was so anxiously lamenting the continued absence of cyril that she neglected needful things lister had disappeared from the neighbourhood and bella had neither seen him again nor had she heard from him considering what had taken place at their last interview she was inclined to think that cyril had passed out of her life for ever but something told her that in spite of her unjust accusations he still loved her and would return meantime there was nothing for it but to wait in patience and to busy herself with her ordinary pursuits these however had lost their savour for the girl since the whole of her mind was filled with the image of the man she loved pence did not fulfil his threat of informing the police at the end of three days bella waited in dread for the arrival of inspector inglis to ask her questions concerning lister but the officer never appeared and as the days glided by she began to think that silas would say nothing with her aunt she went on sunday to the little bethel and heard him preach but he did not seek a private interview with her even when he delivered his sermons he sedulously avoided her eye so she deemed that he was ashamed of the wild way in which he had talked what struck her most about the young man was his wan looks he seemed to be thinner than ever and his cheeks had a more hectic flush while his eyes glittered feverishly as though he were consumed with an inward fire but his discourses became more and more powerful and were greatly admired by his congregation who liked melodramatic religion mrs coppersley was especially loud in her expression of approval what a gift she said to bella when they returned home on the second sunday through the rapidlyyellowing cornfields he spares no one and that is just what i like least about his sermons retorted the girl as a christian he should be more merciful you dont know anything about it said mrs coppersley tartly i know what christ preached replied bella quietly and mr pence has not the spirit of his preaching in what way pray mr pence does not do as he would be done by i wonder how he would like to suffer the condemnation which he measures out so freely to other people silas pence is a good man and no condemnation is possible where he is concerned cried mrs coppersley fervently and bounced into the house in that case he should make allowance for those who are not good not at all said the elder woman stating her views uncompromisingly the good shall go to heaven and the wicked to hell thats scripture as translated by man finished bella neatly but the sermon on the mount aunt rosamund bella you are irreligious interrupted the lady removing her hat and placing it on the kitchentable i wont have freethinkers in my house bella raised her finelymarked eyebrows your house yes almost shouted mrs coppersley violently for she felt somewhat nervous as to what she was about to say my house i didnt tell you before as i have a kind heart but it is time we understood one another tonight i shall explain myself so that you may understand your position you shall explain yourself now said bella pale but determined i have no time said her aunt brusquely henry is coming to dinner i dont care if mr vand is coming to dinner twenty times over said bella her eyes growing hard with anger you have said so much that you must say all aunt rosamund dont bully and bounce me miss i shall act exactly as i please and it is my pleasure that you would explain what you mean i have to lay the cloth and see to the dinner you know that jane never can cook to henrys liking i daresay the meat is burnt and the mrs coppersley was about to pass into the scullery where the one small servant over whom she tyrannised slaved at the midday meal when bella caught her by the wrist how dare you bella cried the stout woman come into the drawingroom out of janes hearing whispered bella fiercely i shall not wait another minute for an explanation this house is either mine or yours very well cried mrs coppersley bouncing towards the kitchen door if you will have it you shall have it i have tried to spare you but go on to the drawingroom please interrupted bella imperiously as she saw the small servant peeping round the corner there is no need for us to discuss private matters in public the whole parish shall soon know what i am about to say snapped mrs coppersley and rolled towards the drawingroom rolled is precisely the word to use in connection with mrs coppersleys way of walking for she was an extremely stout wellfed woman largelimbed and clumsy her round chubby face was rosy and her eyes were as black as her hair she did not look uncomely but there was something coarse and plebeian in her appearance although she was in mourning for her late brother she could not altogether restrain her flamboyant taste and therefore wore a red feather in the hat she had left in the kitchen and yellow gloves which she was now impatiently removing outside it was extremely warm and brilliant with sunshine but in the vast drawingroom the air was pleasantly cool and agreeable the blinds being blue only a faint light came through them since they were down and the cerulean atmosphere was almost religious in its feeling bella ever sensitive to the unseen in spite of her ignorance of psychic phenomenon felt the grave influence but her aunt being of a coarser fibre bounced redfaced and hot into the room openly cross at having been summoned to what was likely to prove a disagreeable interview henry will be here shortly she said pettishly and he doesnt like to be kept waiting for his meals on this occasion he must wait said bella dryly it will do him good dont speak of henry in that tone miss you know he is the most amiable man in the world your speech about his impatience for dinner sounds like it however we need converse only for a few minutes i understood you to say that this house is yours aunt rosamund mrs coppersley flopped down into one of the emerald armchairs and placed her pudgy hands on her stout knees it is she said glancing round the varicoloured room with great pride the house is mine and the farm is mine and jabezs income of five hundred a year well invested is mine bella grew pale mrs coppersley spoke with such conviction that she believed her to be telling the truth and what is left to me she demanded in a low tone for the shock took away her breath your aunts love said mrs coppersley in a matteroffact way jabez asked me to look after you and so long as you behave yourself i shall do so bella passed over this petty speech do you mean to say that my father has left everything to you she asked pointedly everything assented mrs coppersley with an air of triumph jabez wasnt so rich as folk thought him and although he had enough invested to give him five hundred a year he had little ready cash when my late husband died he left me a good sum jabez borrowed this and added it to his own so that he might buy bleacres i agreed but only on condition that jabez should leave me the whole property when he died i saw that the will was made and mr timson the cade lane lawyer is now proving it when probate is obtained my dear ended mrs coppersley amiably i shall marry henry and will be happy for evermore what about me gasped bella utterly overwhelmed you can stay here until you marry said mrs coppersley coldly as i am a christian woman and wish to obey jabezs request he left you to me as a legacy so i will look after you only behave yourself do i ever do anything else asked bella bitterly oh dear me yes returned her aunt complacently you run after men bella rose with a flushed cheek that is a lie mrs coppersley rose also in a violent rage and quite glad to vent her petty spite on one who could not retaliate oh im a liar am i she said shrilly you call me a liar when i am only keeping you out of charity stop bella flung up her hand and spoke firmly you are not doing that aunt rosamund in one way or another you have persuaded my father into leaving you what is rightfully mine but i shall see mr timson and read the will you shall not have it your own way altogether mrs coppersley snapped her large finger and thumb go and see the will by all means she scoffed in a coarse voice you wont find any flaw in it as i was careful that it should be properly drawn up i have a perfect right to the farm as my money helped to buy it so be it keep the farm but give me the income that at least you have no right to retain i have the right of possession which is nine points of the law miss said mrs coppersley violently and the will is plain enough jabez did right to leave the money to me and not to a chit of a girl like you who would waste your fathers hardearned money on that wastrel from london of whom are you talking dont pretend ignorance miss for i wont have it i mean mr lister as he calls himself though i daresay he is no better than he should be you have no right to say that ill say what i like and do what i like remember i am mistress and as you depend entirely on me miss i order you to give up all idea of this lister scamp and marry silas pence who is i shall certainly not marry silas pence or anyone but cyril said bella in icy tones you have no right to interfere in mrs coppersley stamped and interrupted in her turn no right no right she bellowed furiously i have every right this house is mine and the food you eat is mine if i turned you out you would have to starve for i am certain that your fine lover would have nothing to do with you hes a bad man your father said so my father knew nothing of mr lister he knew that he was bad he said as much whymrs coppersley pointed a fat finger towards the round table in the centre of the roomtheres a photograph of him and in a silver frame too what extravagance how dare you spend my money on silver frames she dashed forward to seize the photograph of cyril which bella had brought down from her bedroom and had left unthinkingly on the table doubtless mrs coppersley would have destroyed the portrait but that bella secured it before the good lady could reach the table mr lister gave me this said bella putting it behind her back frame and all it is mine and you dare to bring into the house the picture of a wicked profligate whom your father hated roared mrs coppersley her red face shining with perspiration and her little eyes flashing with wrath my father being so good himself said bella ironically and feeling quite cool mr lister is not a profligate aunt rosamund and you are a bad woman mrs coppersley gasped like a dying dolphin me a bad woman she cried puffing out her cheeks ludicrously me when henry says that i am the best woman in the world and id have you know bella that im a lady and no woman missso there the girl in spite of her grief and dismay laughed right out even a lady must be a woman she observed sarcastically leave my house leave my house panted mrs coppersley no i shall remain here until i know if the will is correct i shall stay here as i say and shall receive polite treatment if i do not i shall dispute the will and make things unpleasant mrs coppersley snapped her fingers that for all the harm you can do she said coarsely the will stands good in law i have made sure of that by consulting mr timson who drew it up you can stay here for a week at the end of that time you pack up and go where to aunt rosamund thats your look out miss but you dont stay here to spoil my honeymoon with my darling henry bella shrugged her shoulders it really was not worth while losing her temper with a person whose methods were so crude the more enraged mrs coppersley became the cooler bella felt do you know what you are aunt rosamund she remarked coolly you are a bully and a petty tyrant while my father was alive you cringed to him because you were afraid now that you think you have the whip hand of me you vent your spite on one whom you think cannot retaliate if i had the money you would cringe to me as you have it you take every advantage of your position but it wont do aunt rosamund for i am not the girl to submit to your insults i shall stop here so long as it pleases me to stop and if you make yourself disagreeable i shall know what to do mrs coppersleys face grew slowly white and her mouth opened and shut like a codfish had bella wept she would have gone on bullying triumphantly but this cool calm scornful demeanour frightened her at heart like all bullies she was a coward and knew well that if it were known how she had ousted bella from her rightful inheritance that she would be unpopular as mrs coppersley liked to be popular and hoped by means of her marriage with vand her wrongfully obtained income and her possession of bleacres to be the great lady of the neighbourhood she did not wish to drive bella to extremes she therefore wiped her face and hedged you mustnt be angry with me bella she said in quieter tones i wish you well my girl you wish me just as much as suits yourself retorted bella coolly so far you have had everything your own way now i mean to look into things for myself you can go now and entertain your darling henry i shall not come to dinner send up jane with some food to my bedroom i shall do nothing of the sort protested mrs coppersley feebly for her late rage had exhausted her and she did not feel equal to fighting this pale steadyeyed girl i have told you what to do so go and do it said bella without raising her voice and looked mrs coppersley squarely in the eyes the mistress of bleacres tried to face down the gaze but failed and thoroughly cowed and beaten in spite of her better position she slowly retreated muttering to herself a vengeance which she was unable to fulfil left alone bella gave way pride had kept her up during the quarrel with her aunt but now secure from observation she broke down and wept never before had she felt so lonely or so helpless cyril was away and she could not confide in him for even if he had been present the terms on which they had parted forbade confidences there was dora ankers the schoolmistress certainlya good friend but a bad adviser as she knew very little of the world and there was no one else who could help her in the dilemma in which she was placed she had no home no friends andon the face of itno lover it was a terrible position for a girl who hitherto had never met with serious trouble in spite of the drawndown blinds and the cool atmosphere of the room bella could scarcely breathe so she moved to a side window drew up the blind and lifted the lower sash outside the brilliance of the sunshine was almost blinding and through the quivering heads across the still stiff stalks of the corn for there was no wind she could see the gaudy red of the scarecrow coat the mere glint of the violent hue made her head ache and she returned to the middle of the room to walk up and down wearily thinking of what was best to be done in the circumstances in which she found herself the photograph of cyril in its silver frame she replaced on the table the muchloved face smiled encouragingly on her at least in her overwrought state she thought so and the thought aided her to beat down the many fears which assailed her while musingly walking the room she became aware of a slight noise and turned abruptly towards the window to see a black face grinning at her with very white teeth at once her thoughts reverted to the prophecy of granny tunks and she felt a sudden thrill of dread as she saw that a black man actually had come to the manorhouse for one moment the negro and the fair young girl looked steadfastly at one another she filled with nervous fear and he curiously observant after an almost imperceptible pausewhich seemed hours to bellathe man leaped through the window before she could regain her voice to forbid his entrance where is my master he asked in guttural tones but in fairly good english bella did not immediately reply as her nerves fairly thrilled with the weird realisation of what the witchwife had seen in the crystal and even now she had not her voice under command the negro was tall bulky and powerfully framed coalblack from head to foot with tightly curled hair and sharp white teeth like those of a dog bella had never seen so huge and strong a man but in spite of his formidable appearance his dark eyes had a kindly look in their depths and his movements were extremely gentle apparently his bark was worse than his bite though his uncivilised looks were enough to awe the boldest plainly but roughly dressed in an old tweed suit with brown shoes and a bowler hat he was not noticeable save for his stature and enormous virility the sensation he produced on the girl was overpowering yet it was not entirely one of fear in spite of his cannibal looks and unexpected entrance and imperious demand she felt perfectly safe i am durgo explained the negro annoyed by her silence as was apparent from the frown which wrinkled his eyebrows where is my master i dont know where your master is she replied finding her tongue with some difficulty i do not know who your master is my master said the negro is my master he came here two weeks and some days ago more or less i have come to find him where is he how can i tell you when i do not even know his name asked bella sharply his name is durgo was about to satisfy her curiosity when he caught sight of the photograph in the silver frame which still stood on the table with a guttural cry of delight he caught this up in his huge hands oh my master my master he gurgled in an ecstasy of delight bella stepped back a pace with a scared look mr lister your master durgo nodded and coolly slipped the photograph frame and all into the breast pocket of his tweed coat he is here i shall find him he remarked did my master see captain huxham yes she replied mechanically did my master and captain huxham quarrel yes she replied again and still mechanically and did my master get what he wanted demanded the negro rolling his eyes i dont know what mr lister wanted said bella faintly you must explain yourself and i explain nothing until i see my master was durgos reply perhaps captain huxham knows where my master is captain huxham is dead she gasped durgo shut his strong white teeth with a click dead he repeated ahahaaha captain huxham is dead then my master no cried bella covering her eyes i dont believe that cyril killed my fatheri dont believe it cyril father repeated durgo looking at her curiously i must learn if he broke off suddenly and moved noiselessly to the window bella stretched a helpless hand to stay him but lightly vaulting out of doors he disappeared in a moment she rushed to the window and saw him running down the path towards the boundary channel there was no chance of catching him up as she saw well and therefore drew back the crystal the crystal she muttered to herself shivering granny must know what it all means i must see granny and ask about the crystal chapter x a lovers meeting having made up her mind to seek an explanation from mrs tunks regarding the vision of the negro in the crystalthat is if the old woman really had beheld the samebella lost no time in executing her purpose in two or three minutes she hastily reassumed her hat cloak and gloves which she had removed while conversing with mrs coppersley then taking her sunshade she left the manorhouse by the front door in the diningroom she could hear the refined tones of vand and the coarse voice of mrs coppersley as they laughed and chattered in the most amiable manner evidently the pair had quite forgotten the recent tragedy which had invested bleacres with so sinister a reputation with a nervous shiverfor the merriment seemed to be singularly illtimedbella closed the door softly and walked down the cornpath glancing right and left and straight ahead she could see nothing of the black man who had appeared and disappeared so mysteriously like the witches in macbeth he had made himself into thin air and had vanished bella felt remarkably uneasy and on the face of it had great cause to be so apparently and she had not the least doubt of this durgo was cyrils servant who came in search of him she rather wondered that her lover should have so uncivilised an attendant and resolved that if they married she would endeavour to get him to dispense with the services of the man but what struck her most were the questions of durgo he evidently expected cyril to meet huxham and to have a quarrel also the stated timeof two weeks and some dayscorresponded with the midnight visit of cyril to the manorhouse she recollected then that the visit was paid not at midnight but about eight oclock and saw in the mistake she had made the perplexity of her bewildered brain with a groan she tried to clear her understanding by swift movement for she felt unable to follow any regular train of thought nevertheless durgos innocent speech reawakened her old suspicions though she dreaded to recall them what if after all cyril had been the visitor of a fortnight since in that case since huxham had been found dead cyril must have struck the blow the horror of the mere idea which placed a barrier between them made her turn cold and she resolutely put it from her cyril was the man she loved the man in whom she had every reason to believe he had solemnly sworn that he was innocent of her fathers blood and if she entertained a grain of affection for him she was bound to believe his word even in the face of strong evidence to the contrary he must be guiltless he was guiltless as she assured herself his looks and words and bearing convinced her of his guiltlessness in one way or another the promised explanation would solve the difficult problem but when would that explanation be made then again mrs tunks must know somewhat of the truth since she had so truly foretold the coming of the negro bella entirely lacking the mystical sense had no belief in visions and assumed that the old woman for her own ends had played a comedy based upon actual fact taking this view the girl walked towards the hut of the witchwife resolute to learn how much mrs tunks knew concerning cyrils past life something she must know else she could not have hinted at the appearance of the negro bella herself was ignorant that her lover had so sinister a servant but it seemed that mrs tunks was better informed and since the old hag knew so much she must know more a few questions would doubtless bring forth the information and then bella felt that she would know how to act but the position was extremely difficult and the skein of life very tangled thinking in this desultory way she reached the end of the cornfield and was about to turn along the pathway leading to the hut when she heard her name called anxiously looking up she saw dora ankers on the hither side of the boundary channel oh bella i am so glad to see you sang out the marshely schoolmistress volubly i really didnt want to go to the manor and meet that horrid aunt of yours come with me dear he is waiting at my cottage who is waiting demanded bella greatly surprised by this address oh my dear as if to a girl in love there is any he but the one he in the world said dora who was sentimental and impatient do you mean to say that mr lister mr lister oh you cruelhearted girl do you call him that i mean cyril said bella hurriedly is he yes he is he wont come to the manor and cant very well see you in his own rooms as that nastyminded mrs block might say things she is such a gossip you know in despair he came to me poor dear so i asked him to wait in my sittingroom while i came for you bella drew herself up stiffly she did not desire to appear too willing to obey the summons of her lover womanlike she wished him to say that he was in the wrong so that her pride might be saved i am going to mrs tunks what for asked dora bluntly never mind replied miss huxham unwilling to confess that she was dealing with uncanny things beyond the veil i must go dora tripped lightly across the narrow planks and slipped her arm within that of her friend you shall do nothing of the sort you cold thing she declared poor mr lister is quite brokenhearted by the way in which you have treated him oh bella became stiffer than ever has he said he has said nothing he is too much a man to say anything but i saw his poor pale peaked face and does he look ill bella was seized with a sudden qualm ill miss ankers gestures and looks became eloquent dear he is dying oh dora miss huxham kilted up her skirts and fairly ran across the planks why didnt you come for me before you dont seem to be in a hurry to come now laughed dora crossing in her turn yet the poor dear fellow is dyingto see you where has he been all this time im sure i dont know dear he came straight from london last night and went to my cottage this morning to see me i was in church so he came again in the afternoon and asked me to help him oh my dear he is handsome and i felt that i could do anything for him i wish he had made love to me sighed the romantic schoolmistress but all he did was to ask me to bring you to my cottage for an interview so come dear come and save the poor darling from an early grave bella needed no urging for she was genuinely concerned over the news and sped towards marshely like a fawn with miss ankers at her heels dora had no difficulty in keeping up as she was a slim small dainty woman more like a fairy than mere flesh and blood in spite of her age and she confessed to thirtyfive she had a pinkandwhite skin golden hair and clear blue eyes dressed as she was in pale blue with many ribbons and ornaments she looked like a wellarrayed doll just out of a satinlined box but for all her innocent looks miss ankers was a stern schoolmistress and during business hours behaved with great severity out of them however she presented herself to the village world in her true colours as a sentimental airy sweettempered little creature who was everybodys friend and nobodys enemy bella was always fond of her but at this moment felt more attached to her than everas she had every reason to be seeing that miss ankers had given up her snug sittingroom for a lovers meeting and had actually brought that meeting about youre my good angel dora said bella kissing her friend as they drew near the cottage on the outskirts of marshely oh what waste remonstrated dora opening her chinablue eyes to their widest what will mr lister say to your throwing away kisses on me bella laughed for her heart had grown unexpectedly light she had a firm belief that all misunderstandings were about to be cleared up between her lover and herself also she acknowledged to herself with great and thankful joy that cyril in spite of her misgivings had returned to her seeing how she had doubted and accused him he might have departed for ever and with every reason for such a course but apparently he loved her so devotedly that he was willing to remain and explain himself it was no wonder that bellas heart leaped for joy since the cloud which had for so long overshadowed the sunshine of love was about to be dissipated she almost danced into ankers small garden mr lister is in the sittingroom dear said that archplotter pushing her companion into the cottage youll find him there i have to go to the church to run over the evening hymns miss huxham knew that this was a mere excuse but loved dora all the more for making it miss ankers was much too romantic to mar the meeting by presenting herself as an inconvenient third therefore she turned away laughing and bella anxious to lose no moment of joy entered the small sittingroom with a bright expectant smile it died away at the sight of listers sombre face the young man was seated in an armchair with a newspaper lying on his knees but he was not reading as his eyes were fixed darkly on the door through which bella had just entered for the instant he did not appear to be aware of her presence then he rose gravely and bowed even in the midst of her dismay at this reception bella was woman enough to note how spruce and trim and singularly handsome he looked certainly his face was grave and pale but beyond this she could not see the dying looks which dora had so eloquently described when they came face to face an embarrassing silence ensued bella was the first to speak are you not pleased to see me cyril she faltered i am very pleased he returned gravely and pushed forward a chair will you not be seated not until you explain why you receive me in this way she declared indignantly you send for me and i come at once only to find displeased looks our last interview explains my looks bella no it doesnt she cried up in arms at once i admitted my fault in suspecting you then and asked your pardon you left me without a kiss andand she stopped with an angry gesture it seems to me that i am the one who has the right to be displeased no said lister decidedly i love you very dearly as you know but how can i tell that you love me dearly my desire to meet you again shows that i do many a man would have left you for ever on learning as i did your cruel suspicions you have no right to be displeased as you said a moment since i am the wronged person for if you really loved me you would believe nothing against me i do not i do not but you did only for a single moment ohbella uttered a cry of despairi am only a human being and i saw youas i thoughtentering the house i knew that on my account you had quarrelled with my father so what could i think but that you had killed him i dont pretend to be an angel she broke off and sat down pressing her hands hard together then looked up with feigned selfcontrol we discussed all this before she said coldly did you invite me here to ask me to defend myself again no i asked you here to learn from your own lips that you believe me to be guiltless i do i swear i do bella rose in her excitement and i ask your pardon for my wicked suspicions bella he sprang forward and caught her hands within his own then you really and truly love me if you had gone away she breathed faintly in his ear i should have died cyril drew her closely to his breast my darling he whispered smoothing her hair i love you too dearly to leave you i ask your pardon for my harsh words on the face of it i dont see what you could do but suspect me it was unreasonable for me to ask you to do otherwise that you believe my mere word in spite of the strong evidence against me shows that you love me as dearly and strongly as i love you so far all that is right we trust one another wholly entirely to the death we trust one another that is well cyril sat down in the armchair and drew bella on to his knees unity is strength with you by my side i am not afraid then you have been afraid she asked softly of losing your loveyes but now i am satisfied on that point there is another thing that makes me afraid what is it i may be accused of this murder other people may have seen me as you saw me dear then it was you she gasped no no i have explained myself if necessary i can put forward an alibi who was the man then i cant tell you that cyril pushed her away and rose much agitated then you know bella stood back from him doubtfully i cant be sure i thinkthat is i fancybella dont ask me anything just now later i may be able to explain and you will explain if it be possible remember i said that i might be able to explain but of this i cannot be certain i do not understand sighed the girl seating herself again cyril has this matter anything to do with you the matter of the murder yes i dont mean to ask if you are guilty as i know you are not but are you connected in any way with the matter no he rejoined promptly if i were i should be an accomplice after the fact all the same he paused looking paler than ever and his face became peaked and haggard dont ask me anything yet he murmured i am willing to trust you dear said bella quietly but as you remarked yourself some time ago other people he interrupted her other people yes some one else did see you on that evening the person saw my double corrected cyril i was in london as i told you and as i can prove who is this person silas pence ah listers hands clenched he hates me because you are to be my wife he will go to the police i dont think so said bella slowly he threatened to go but as yet he has held his tongue why when he hates me so i thinki think said bella slowly that mr pence knows more about this matter than he chooses to admit cyril uttered an exclamation do you suspect him not of the murder she replied promptly he is too weak and timid a creature to commit a crime but i know that he was poor now he is unexpectedly rich and we are aware she added with emphasis that one hundred pounds was stolen from my fathers safe on the night of the murder but surely you do not connect a harmless man like pence with the crime i say nothing because i know nothing cyril but if mr pence is entirely innocent why does he not accuse you whom he hates he has no grounds to go upon dear bella shook her head he thinks that he has she answered as he believed it was you he saw when he met your double at the boundary channel since he would like to see you in trouble the very fact that he delays telling the police shows that his own conscience is not easy it is strange assented lister however if he does accuse me i can prove an alibi but what about your double the young man turned away abruptly to the window i can say nothing on that point at present when will you explain i cant say sooner or later lister with his hands in his pockets looked out of the window as though to avoid further questioning this behaviour puzzled bella as she felt sure that cyril could tell her much if inclined to do so but it was odd that he should so decline she abruptly reverted to an earlier thought in her mind you did not tell me that you had a negro servant called durgo lister wheeled sharply i have no servant negro or otherwise he said in a decisive tone why do you say that bella wondering still more gave him details which cyril heard with a perplexed frown he made no comment until she had finished you say that this man recognised my portrait in that case i can guesshe did not finish his sentence but became paler than ever chapter xi a recognition bella found the interviews with cyril eminently unsatisfactory it was perfectly plain that he entertained strong suspicions regarding the unknown person whom she termed his double but even when questioned pointblank he declined to explain himself yet if lister knew of someone who resembled him more or less closely he surely could place his hand on that someone when he did so the assassin of captain huxham would speedily be found this being the case it was strange that cyril should hesitate and again and again bella questioned him bluntly only to find him more determined than ever to keep his own counsel under these circumstances it was useless to prolong the conversation and the girl left the cottage feeling extremely despondent it seemed to her that the problem would never be solved in spite of the certainty she entertained that cyril could solve it if he so wished nor did bella feel any brighter when she returned to the manor for mrs coppersley chose to take umbrage at her nieces absence bella declined to say where she had been and dismissed the matter in a few cold words not feeling sure of her ground mrs coppersley retreated for the time being but next day returned to the attack with the evident object of making the manorhouse too hot for the girl bella was strong enough to quell open mutiny on the part of her aunt but she could not defend herself against incessant nagging since the death of her brother mrs coppersley had become as bold as hitherto she had been meek and in many skilful ways contrived to make her niece feel thoroughly uncomfortable as bella had quite enough to bear without being taxed further with these petty worries she became restive and on the third day of hostilities demanded what her aunt meant by behaving so aggressively mrs coppersley better at ambushes than in open warfare would have shirked the battle but bella forced the quarrel since it was absolutely necessary to bring matters to a head you never leave me alone aunt rosamund she complained wearily because you are a drone retorted mrs coppersley you eat yet you do not work and as st paul says i dont wish to hear what st paul says thank you it would be better if you did i have your good at heart nothing of the sort you merely wish to get rid of me mrs coppersley grew vividly red but did not make any denial why should i not she cried loudly you treat me as though i were dirt under your feet miss who are you to behave like this i should like to know i am my fathers daughter said bella very distinctly who have been cheated out of my inheritance ill make you prove those words said mrs coppersley turning from scarlet to white go and see mr timson in cade lane and you will find everything has been done to make the will legal i am quite sure of that aunt rosamund as you are too clever a woman to risk losing your spoil but you have cheated me by inducing my father to disinherit me in your favour i did not i did not mrs coppersley stamped wrathfully your father borrowed money from me to pay for the farm ten years ago i lent it on condition that i inherited bleacres i told you this before and that will do interrupted bella imperiously i shall see mr timson and learn for certain if what you have told me is correct meantime as it is quite impossible for me to remain in the house with you i shall go and stay with dora ankers she wont have you taunted mrs coppersley i have already arranged to live with her until i am married then you are going to marry that wastrel i dont know who you mean mr lister the man who was so hated by your father whether i marry mr lister or not is my business said bella drily and so far as i can learn my father had no reason to hate him do you know why he did so aunt rosamund no said mrs coppersley reluctantly for she would have dearly liked to put a spoke in bellas wheel as the saying is jabezs life before he came here was not known to me but i am quite sure that it was shady and bella interrupted again leave the dead alone you are benefiting by my fathers work whatever it might have been and have no call to abuse him i only got my own money back said mrs coppersley defiantly but if you leave my house you leave it for ever i wash my hands of you i am quite content that it should be so said bella icily but i cant leave my home penniless give me fifty pounds until such time as i can see mr timson and learn how i stand what mrs coppersley became shrill in her anger give you money to bring lawsuits against me bella looked at her very directly if everything is fair and square as you say she observed severely there is no danger of lawsuits come aunt rosamund i wish to leave bleacres this afternoon give me the money no shouted the older woman and sat down with folded arms and a dogged expression you get no money from me bella was perplexed she could not use violence and her aunt seemed very determined for the moment she was nonplussed and scarcely knew what to say but at this moment henry vand entered the conversation had taken place in the study and vand came into the room from the hall apparently he had just entered the house in fact he explained as much and also confessed calmly that he had listened i heard your voices raised he said quietly and knowing rosamunds violent temper i waited so that i might interfere on your behalf miss huxham i want no interference said mrs coppersley jealousy i can manage my own business that may be said the young man drily but you seem to forget that i am your husband husband echoed bella amazed yes said vand while mrs coppersleyor rather mrs vandlooked sullenly at the floor we have been married for three months secretly why secretly asked bella still wondering at the news thats our business said her aunt insolently pardon me rosamund said vand who was as polite as his wife was rude it is only fair that miss huxham should understand the position have it your own way then muttered mrs vand tossing her head only make her understand that i have had enough of her airs and graces she can clear out of our house as soon as she likes and leave us to ourselves she is willing to do that for fifty pounds said vand politely i shant give her that amount you are quite right rosamund you will give miss huxham a cheque for one hundred pounds are you out of your senses raged his wife starting to her feet i dont want so much as that mr vand said bella pleased to think that her new uncle by marriage was taking her part it is a mere question of justice miss huxham my wife has inherited the solitary farm so it is only right that she should recompense you mind said bella suddenly and thinking that this might be a bribe if i find anything wrong when i see mr timson i shall bring an action i told you so henry remarked mrs vand triumphantly i have seen the will and the lawyer said the man quietly and everything is correct there is no flaw with regard to my marriage miss huxham i agreed to a secret ceremony since your late father was opposed to my courtship of your aunt but the time has now come to proclaim the marriage so i have brought my luggage here today and that is why my aunt wishes me to leave the house said bella with a curling lip vand who was much the most selfcontrolled of the trio looked at her very straightly you can come or stay as you please he said gently i am quite willing that you should remain oh cried mrs vand furiously so you want her to remain perhaps you are in love with her perhaps you would like to aunt interrupted bella blushing with annoyance how can you talk so foolishly mr vand loves you or he would not have married you as for me i am going away to doras as soon as you give me the money not one penny vand gazed steadily at the furious woman in spite of his club foot he was certainly handsome and looked as refined as his wife looked coarse he must have had good blood in his veins in spite of his lowly birth and without appearing to do so managed on this occasion at least to dominate the more animal nature bella neither liked nor disliked the cripple but she could not help admiring the skilful way in which he mastered her aunt perhaps he magnetised her with his large blue eyes or the calmness of his manner may have had a soothing effect but whatever was the cause mrs vand winced under his silent gaze and lowered her voice as she consented unexpectedly to do what he suggested i shall give bella a cheque for one hundred pounds on condition that she does not trouble me again she grumbled going to the desk with an affectation of generosity you seem to hate me so much that there is no need for me to see you any more said bella bitterly but i warn you that if the will is not right i shall take steps to recover the farm which i look upon as my property it is not your property it is mine and jabezs income also said mrs vand looking up from the cheque she was writing and if you dont promise to leave things alone you shant have the money i refuse to sell my heritage for a mess of potage cried bella impetuously there is no need that you should interposed vand gently rosamund sign the cheque mrs vand scowled hesitated but finally did as she was ordered throwing it on the floor afterwards in silent fury her husband picked it up and handed it with a bow to bella there you are miss huxham he said with marked courtesy i hope you will be happy at miss ankers so far as i am aware everything has been left to my wife but later i shall endeavour to make some arrangement with rosamund by which you will be benefited and i beg of you not to leave this house in anger i shall make no arrangement now or hereafter cried mrs vand bella has received all that she will receive for my part im glad to see the back of her and with a red face and a scornful look she flounced out of the room much to the girls relief i wonder why my aunt hates me so she asked vand with a piteous look i have never done her any harm she only gives way to her temper miss huxham said the cripple soothingly and doesnt mean half she says dont trouble any more about rosamund i am your friend you will shake hands will you not bella did not hesitate to take the hand extended to her as she admitted silently that if vand had not interposed she would not have received the money besides her new relative throughout had proved himself to be so courteous and thoughtful that she had no reason to mistrust him howsoever mrs vand had become possessed of the farm and income of the late captain huxham her husband was at least innocent but i do not bind myself to take no steps if necessary to recover bleacres bella warned the young man as she shook his hand you understand that perfectly and indeed if rosamund has come wrongfully by the estate she must surrender it still miss huxham you cannot expect me to doubt my own wife especially as rosamund has been good enough to marry a cripple such as i am i think without flattery to you said bella walking towards the door that my aunt has got the best of the bargain and the last thing she saw when throwing a glance over her shoulder was vand blushing crimson at the unusual compliment but bella meant what she said as even ease and wealth were hardly purchased by marriage with a furious coarsenatured woman such as rosamund vand the girl wondered how she had ever come to have such an aunt she might have wondered also how she ever came to have a parent so common and ruffianly as her late father had been that same afternoon bella packed all her belongings and had them carried by tunks to the hither side of the boundary channel there they were placed on a handcart and wheeled to miss ankers cottage mrs vand discreetly kept out of the way when bella departed or perhaps her husband insisted that she should not drive forth the girl with insults as she certainly would have done at all events she remained invisible and it was vand alone who said goodbye to the homeless girl bella felt a pang when she looked back along the narrow path of the cornfields to see a stranger standing in the doorway she was certain of one thingthat mrs vand had found a master and that for all his quietness and polite ways her husband would not allow her to have her own way as she had hitherto done doubtless her aunt had deemed vand would be as harmless and innocuous as the scarletcoated scarecrow of which bella caught a last glimpse but there was no doubt in the girls mind as to which of the happy pair would rule the house mrs vands coarse bullying could do very little against the quiet persistence of a polite man who was determined to govern so far as bella knew from huxham her aunt had ruled her first husband with a rod of iron now she was about to be governed in her turn and much good may it do her thought bella who was much too human to be forgiving dora was delighted that her best friend should board with her and received miss huxham with open arms after tea the two arranged bellas bedroom to their satisfaction and unpacked her boxes then they had a talk as to the advisability of going to cade lane for the purpose of questioning mr timson regarding the will you should attend to the matter at once my dear said dora who was extremely practical for all her dolllike looks lose no time for i am certain that your aunt has employed some trickery in getting possession of the property i shall consult cyril first said bella wearily and little more was said on that night as the girl was quite worn out with the events of the day next morning miss ankers had to teach in school as usual and bella was left to her own devices she assisted doras small servant to tidy the rooms and make the beds after which she put on her hat and walked into the village to make some small purchases alsoand this was by doras adviceshe saw the manager of the small local bank and opened an account with him by paying in her aunts cheque for one hundred pounds the manager courteously promised to send the cheque to london and to notify bella when it was honoured miss huxham was somewhat relieved at this promise as she did not trust her aunt and knew that she was quite capable of stopping the cheque especially when she had not given it with a good grace but bella need not have troubled her head the cheque was duly honoured as mr henry vand saw to that having dispatched her business bella strolled out of the village and found herself on the common this was a vast expanse overgrown with gorse and broom and with a miniature forest of saplings springing from an undergrowth of fern and bracken through this fairy wood as some people called it narrow paths were cut so that one could wander for hours in and out of a kind of natural labyrinth the saplings were scarcely six feet in height so that an extra tall man could look over the green sea of vegetation bella loved this place as she had often sauntered therein with dora and indeed with cyril also the wonderful tangle of fern and bracken and manyhued grasses the brilliant colouring of flowers and the fecund blossoming of the golden broom made the common a home of delight bella walked meditatively through the cool green paths and emerged at intervals on to wide waste spaces where the purple heather grew thickly butterflies floated through the still air bumblebees visited the flowers and the birds sang as in an enchanted garden bella stopped to hear the silvery carol of an invisible lark for the bird raining its music lavishly from the sky was quite hidden by the dazzle of sunshine as she paused she felt a light hand touch her shoulder and turned with a glad cry oh cyril how you startled me she said pleased with the unexpected encounter i am so glad to see you dear have you heard lister threw himself contentedly on the fragrant heather and drew bella down by his side i have heard and i am very angry he said hotly dear what does your aunt mean by treating you in this way bella shrugged her shoulders i expect she wants the manor to herself now that she is married who told you miss ankers i met her coming out of school she told me that you were returning to dinner so i came to fetch you i guessed that i should find you here and so he waved his hand lazily i am glad to see you said bella again but you look ill dear cyril shrugged his shoulders i am worried about this mysterious double of mine he muttered and lying full length on the burnt grass he tilted his hat over his eyes he did indeed look ill for his face was very pale and lines appeared on his forehead which should not have been there at his age in some extraordinary way he seemed to have aged as it were in a moment i am very much worried he sighed everything is going wrong now this abominable treatment to which your aunt has subjected you to makes things doubly difficult for me in what way asked bella sitting up and hugging her knees i dont know how to move explained the young man while you were safe at bleacres with your aunt i could wait but now that you have no home i should like to marry you at once he sighed again but that is impossible dear owing to circumstances you need not trouble about me said bella promptly i have got one hundred pounds and i am quite glad to be away from aunt rosamunds incessant nagging i can live with dora and pay my way until such time as you can marry me heaven only knows when i can marry you groaned cyril dismally i can tell you said bella removing the hat from his anxious face in order to look into his eyes as soon as you are frank with me i have come to be frank with you said lister reluctantly it sounds like it my dearhe sat up to speak more forciblywhen i am frank you will be as unhappy as i am what do you mean mean i scarcely know what i meanthat is i scarcely dare put my thoughts into words of course i may be wrong i sincerely trust that i am wrong all the same there is no denying that i have grave grounds for my belief what belief bella asked the question in scared tones as cyril looked so wretched he did not reply at once but moved restlessly about evidently bracing himself to speak plainly even when he did open his mouth he was evasive i have an idea that my doublethat is the man who was mistaken by you and pence for me on that nightmight beohhe rested his head between his hands with a groani dare not tell you who he might be you have some idea yes i wish i hadnt is it anyone i know no is it oh my dear dont ask questions which i dare not answer you must answer said bella firmly i must share your griefs as well as sorrows tell me everything go on cyril tell me quickly hush lister started to his feet with an alarmed look whats that i swear that i heard a rustling in the underwood someone is listening he glanced around anxiously looking pale and nervous bella rose at the same time and caught his hand to give him courage although she could not understand what he meant by his words and looks but the two had not to wait long a distant crackling was heard and in a moment or so a tall bulky man stepped from out the underwood durgo breathed bella recognising the negro he ran towards cyril and dropped on his knees my master he cried then leaped up you are not edwin lister he growled with widely open eyes my father my father groaned cyril in despair i knew it i was certain of it now i know the worst and he sat down to hide his face chapter xii cyrils story bella looked from the astonished durgo to the despairing lister and wondered what the scene meant that the matter at issue was serious cyrils demeanour gave her fully to understand but what the matter might be she could not guess save that it had something to do with this mysterious double who had caused all the commotion the negro appeared to be as puzzled as herself and stared at the seated figure with an open mouth scratching his woolly head meanwhile not my master but like my master he muttered staring hard and speaking in his usual guttural manner but not in the usual negro dialect so rude and clipped if youre not my master edwin lister he added addressing himself to the young man who are you sir answer him cyril said bella seeing that her lover did not speak did you ever see this man before lister looked up pale and holloweyed never he said briefly did you ever meet mr lister before bella asked the negro lister lister gasped durgo retreating a step is this young gentleman called lister cyril lister said that young man but my master had no son i am his son edwin lister is my father oh a sudden light broke over bellas face and she clapped her hands and your double yes said cyril in low tones now you can guess how afraid i was to lay my suspicions before you no she said boldly why you should be afraid i cannot guess cyril rose slowly laid two heavy hands on her shoulders and looked directly into her eyes my dear he said in a hard voice can you not understand that this double was my father who resembled me so closely that this manhe jerked back his head towards the still staring negromistook me for him well said bella inquiringly well repeated lister impatiently you thought that i had committed the murder but now that you know the truth bella shook herself free and grew pale it was your father who struck the blow she said in a low horrified tone yes and if my father killed your father how can we marry there was a dead silence and the unfortunate lovers looked at one another with white faces if cyrils surmise was true a barrier had indeed been placed between them and for the moment they saw no chance of overleaping it quite oblivious of durgo they stared until the black man grew impatient of the silence what does this mean he growled looking from one to the other i come to find my master edwin lister and he is not here but i find one who calls himself the son of my master edwin lister he peered into cyrils face my master never told me that he had a son and yethe looked againi believe that you are my masters son am i so like my father then asked cyril smiling faintly durgo struck his huge hands together the same in every way he said firmly figure and face and colour and walk even the clotheshe ran his eyes over cyrils grey suityes even the clothes oh it was bella who spoke cyril do you remember that the grey clothes worn by your father on that night aided me to make a mistake lister nodded that was a suit of mine he said made for me when my father came home from nigeria he had no readymade clothes so he borrowed that suit until he could get fitted out in civilised garments well cyril addressed this last question to durgo who had started violently when nigeria was mentioned i am a nigerian he said in reply to the inquiry i was with your father at ogrude on the cross river for years i came with him to london three months ago but my master never said that he had a son he had his reasons for keeping silence no doubt said cyril quietly but i never saw you durgo nor did i hear my father mention you yet you know my name said the man suspiciously only because miss huxham mentioned it when you appeared just now and i mentioned it to you before bella reminded him i told you how durgo entered the bleacres drawingroom and took your photograph frame and all from his pocket and handed it to the girl i thought that it was one of my master edwin lister taken when he was younger he said simply but i see yes yes broke in cyril impatiently i know what you see i am a younger edition of my father yes yes yes cried durgo staring again never did i see two so alike bella glanced at the photograph and slipped it into her pocket her face was pearly white and she dreaded the full explanation of what was to come we are still perplexed she said quietly and controlling herself with great difficulty you know nothing of durgo and he knows nothing of you i think it will be best for us to sit down and discuss the matter quietly i agree with you said cyril dropping down promptly durgo tell your story and then i shall tell mine when we each know what the other knows we may be able to arrive at some conclusion regarding the murder said bella perhaps she added hopefully perhaps your father did not kill mine after all i fear he did said cyril heavily remember what was said at the inquest about the west african knife with which the crime was committed nigeria is in west africa my master had no knife of that sort said durgo bluntly have you a description of the knife asked bella i read it in the newspapers said the negro when you told me of your fathers death i read the papers you can read i can read and write and do many things said durgo quietly i have a black skin but my education has not been neglected so i should think from the way in which you speak english the missionaries taught me much and edwin lister taught me the rest cyril frowned i notice that you do not say mister when you speak of my father he said pointedly i am a chief and the son of a chief said durgo proudly and for love of your father who saved my life i left my tribe and came with him i called him master as a title of honour because i loved him so why should i not say edwin lister cyril with the white mans inborn superiority objected to this familiarity and but that durgos services were necessary to the unravelling of the mystery would have pointed this out as it was he simply nodded and asked the black man to be more explicit durgo sat down and complied without any argument his manners for a negro were singularly good there is not much to tell he said in his guttural tones edwin lister was my friend and a trader in nigeria my country he saved my life from a lion and won my gratitude i helped him with his trading and left my tribe to do so we heard of a treasure in the wilds of my country and wished to fit out an expedition to find that treasure edwin lister did that is and i was glad to do as he desired but we required money and it could not be had edwin lister then thought of an old friend of his captain huxham who had also been in nigeria my father cried bella startled yes missy said durgo bending his head towards her with grave respect he was well known in nigeria many years ago as he had a river steamer there edwin lister then came to london with me and afterwards came to see captain huxham here that was some weeks ago and he promised me to return as he did not i came down and then heard of the murder of captain huxham but where is my master edwin lister and durgo looked from one to the other have you not seen him since asked cyril anxiously no durgo shook his head profoundly what do you think has become of him asked cyril still white durgo reflected i think he said gravely that edwin lister killed captain huxham and ran away soon he will write to me and i can join him then we can return to nigeria and hunt for the treasure but why should mr lister kill my father asked bella he wanted money said durgo simply if captain huxham would not give the money edwin lister would kill him it is quite simple but i wish added the negro wisely that my master had let me kill captain huxham would you have done so cried bella horrified durgo looked up in surprise oh yes if edwin lister had wished it cyril and the girl looked at one another durgo was still a savage in spite of the veneer of education and civilisation which the missionaries had given him he would have killed huxham as easily as he would have killed a fly perhaps also edwin lister had become decivilised and had acted in the same way but what has become of my father asked cyril you do not know inquired durgo politely cyril shook his head i do not know he said gloomily unless as you say he murdered huxham to get money and then ran away into hiding he may be on the continentin paris in that case i shall hear from him soon said durgo rising when i do i shall let you know come back said cyril in an even tone as durgo was about to stalk away it is necessary for me to have your assistance in what asked durgo looking over his huge shoulder in finding my father but if he is in paris i can go there have you the money i have plenty of money said the negro with gravity i have my own money so it is easy for me to search for my master he may not be in paris said cyril hastily that is only a guess on my part before searching for him over there it will be best for you to assist me in looking for him in this district he may be in hiding durgo pondered then returned to lie fulllength on the grass i think that my master would have run further away after killing captain huxham he said reflectively he is very cunning is edwin lister and of course he would have the money what money asked bella impatiently the money for which he killed captain huxham the sum stolen was only worth a trifle one hundred pounds is the amount oh durgo opened his eyes and my master wanted five thousand it is a very difficult expedition right into the centre of nigeria and one hundred pounds is of no use i could have lent that amount to edwin lister myself haihe nursed his chin in his handwhat you say missy makes me think that my master is waiting here to get the money for which he killed captain huxham my aunt mrs rosamund vand has both the money and the estate then edwin lister will wait and see her said durgo gravely i must learn where he is hiding and he half rose again cyril put out one slim hand to prevent him wait for one moment he said quietly you must hear what i have to say and then we can arrange what to do durgo you loved my father the negro nodded i would rather lose my life than see him dead cyril looked at him curiously strange i did not think that my father was a man to inspire such devotion he saved my life said durgo impressively humph murmured cyril under his breath ill be bound if he did so that he took back the full value of his heroic act bella looked pained cyril why do you speak in that tone of your father because i know him better than durgo he retorted my father is abut that is neither here nor therehe waved his hand impatiently durgo i am about to speak plainly i see that you love my father so i dont wish to hurt your feelings all the same i must tell you something about my father which you will not like let me hear said durgo frowning and i can judge but you are his son and therefore should speak well of him ended cyril bitterly i wish i could but i have suffered too much at my fathers hands to have any love for him however i shall be as brief as possible and as kind said durgo meaningly and as kind as i can be retorted the young man cynically although my father will be the first to laugh at the idea of my talking kindly of him he loves you said the negro rebukingly did he ever tell you that no he never mentioned your existence judge then how he loves me said cyril coolly however in spite of all edwin lister is my father so i shall speak as respectfully of him as i possibly can he threw away a blade of grass he was chewing and laughed ironically bella looked pained cyril cyril your own father quite so dear he is my father i can say no more and no less as to what i know relative to this mystery you shall hear the sky had clouded over and the sun no longer shone the lark was silent and a chill wind seemed to breathe over the golden broom and the yellow blossoms of the gorze bella shivered as the change of temperature seemed to suit with cruel exactitude the cynical tones of her lover she had never heard him talk in this way before but then she knew very little about him and absolutely nothing of his past life now she was about to hear it and from the hard expression of his face she judged that the story he had to tell was not a pleasant one as for durgo he waited silently and nothing could be read of his feelings from the dark mask of his face edwin lister had saved his life and no matter what was said durgo did not intend to change his opinion of his master as the finest man in the wide world my mother died when i was young said cyril after a pause and i was brought up by a maiden aunt my father i rarely saw as he was always travelling round the world in search of a fortune which he never seemed to find sometimes he returned to england and treated me with careless affection but i saw very little of him but for my aunt i should have been utterly neglected bless her she is dead and he raised his hat poor cyril murmured bella affected by this picture of a dull childhood thank you dear he said taking her hand my aunt did everything for me out of her small income and i dont think my father gave one penny towards my education but surely no dear said cyril interrupting her my aunt told me on her deathbed that she had done everything so you can see that my father was only one to me in name he was working to make your fortune in nigeria said durgo quickly so he said when he came home but i have not seen that fortune yet well to continue my aunt sent me to a public school and afterwards to oxford i then became a journalist and my aunt died leaving me a trifle of money on which to live my father came to london and borrowed that moneythe principal of my small incomefor one of his wild schemes and i was left without one penny it was your duty to assist your father said durgo uneasily out of the mouth of babes and sucklings quoted cyril with a side glancethe missionaries have taught you well durgo i am a christian said the negro proudly so am i in a way however i must get on with my confession i saw my father at various intervals and meanwhile earned my bread by reporting and writing articles and all the rest of it my father appeared at intervals like the rolling stone which gathers no moss and always borrowed i did not grudge him the money and he always said that he was about to make his fortune which he never did he will make it this time said durgo vigorously the treasure is certainly hidden in the hinterland of nigeria and when we reach it yes when scoffed cyril i dont believe in my fathers schemes i tell you the last time he came home was five months ago with me said durgo gravely but i remained near the docks and my master edwin lister went to the grand part of the town coming down to see me when he required my services cyril nodded that sounds like my father he said with a shrug however on this occasion he told me that he intended to hunt for buried treasure in nigeria and wanted money he did not mention captain huxham so i expect that he intended to keep that part of his business secret butcyril hesitatedwell my fatherthat is hehenever mind he broke off abruptly i cant tell you just now but he wanted the sum of one thousand pounds which i tried to get for him oh cyril was that the money you mentioned asked bella in dismay yes the sum for which you thought i had killed your father said cyril nodding then seeing that she looked pained he hastily added never mind dear that is all over and we understand one another thoroughly i went to paris as you know to get the money when i returned i heard of the murder and when i called at my fathers lodgings in the west end could learn nothing of his whereabouts when you mentioned the double bella it was forced on my mind that my father must have been that person but as i could see no connection between my father and captain huxham i refused to believe this however from what durgo says there seems to be no doubt but that my father did come by stealth to the manor on that night with the idea of getting the loan of money perhaps he and captain huxham quarreled but it seems clear that my father did commit the murder with that sacrificial knife since it came as he did from nigeria i never saw that knife said durgo abruptly you did not see many things said cyril rising for he felt somewhat cramped my father was probably as secretive with you as he was with me you are well educated durgo and have your wits about you ask yourself if it is possible for two men to have come on this particular occasion from nigeria and two did come interrupted the negromyself and my master quite so but if you are innocent my father must be guilty durgo shrugged his great shoulders for myself i think very little of killing anyone said he gruffly but you white men think differently so you should not believe your father guilty unless oh cyril clenched his hand and grew pale do you not think that i would give the world to believe him innocent i love miss huxham and this murder by my father places a barrier between us if you knew allhere cyril broke off hastily as he remembered that he was speaking to a black man already he regretted that he had said so much but he had been carried away by the tide of his emotion the matter stands like this he said abruptly changing the subject my father has killed captain huxham and has disappeared with one hundred pounds but i thought that mr pence began bella only to be interrupted he is innocent said cyril hastily on the face of it he is innocent i go by the evidence of the knife from nigeria where pence has never been and by the fact that you saw my father whom you mistook for me enter the manor about the time the crime was committed i dare say you are right said bella vaguely and regretted that she had so hastily condemned the preacher after all the truth of the legacy left by his aunt was not a fiction but what will you do now i ask the same question remarked durgo sharply we are no nearer the truth than we have been cyril looked in astonishment at the negro who spoke such excellent english and so much to the point durgo undoubtedly in intellect was equal to if not superior to many englishmen and lister saw in him a helpful coadjutor in solving the mystery we must work together to learn the whereabouts of my father he said wearily passing his hand across his forehead it will be necessary to get him out of the country if what we believe is correct but it may be that my father has crossed the channel if that is so he will write to me commented the negro he paused and then asked abruptly if you learn that your father is guilty i shall do my best to get him away from england why do you ask durgo turned away after a piercing glance i thought from what you hinted that you would not be sorry to see your father hanged dont talk rubbish man said lister sharply my father is my father when all is said and done i only trust that we are mistaken and that he is not guilty of this brutal crime durgo shrugged his massive shoulders as to that i care very little from what i have heard of captain huxham in my own country he was not a good man he is better out of the world than in it bella grew crimson you speak of my father she said angrily the man bowed politely i ask your pardon missy then he turned to cyril ceremoniously i am stopping at the chequers inn at marshely he informed him so if you will call there we can speak about this matter women should have nothing to do with such affairs they are for men lister frowned as he did not approve of the superior way in which the negro talked however durgo gave him no chance of making a remark but swung off with a noiseless jungle step cyril watched him pass out of sight and confessed that the man puzzled him in spite of his barbaric origin and black skin and rough dress durgo spoke and acted like a gentleman though he certainly had been somewhat rude regarding the feminine sex yet i like him commented cyril half to himself he seems to be a square chap and to have brains he is not the usual christy minstrel of africa humph after all i dare say that if you scratched him you would find the savage his devotion to my father does him credit i wonderhere he was interrupted by a low sob at his elbow and turned to find bella in tears my dearest what is the matter he asked in dismay can you ask she moaned despairingly if what you think is true we must part for ever dont look at the worst but hope for the best he entreated we cant be sure that my father is guilty you contradict yourself she said wiping her eyes i wish i could i am trying to think that my father is innocent but i do not know my father has been my evil genius all my life a thought occurred to bella why did your father require one thousand pounds cyril looked at her sideways i did not like to speak out before durgo he said hesitatingly but the fact is my father forged a cheque for that sum chapter xiii mrs tunks discovery so far it appeared extremely probable that edwin lister was the assassin of captain huxham from the evidence of her own eyes bella knew that cyrils father had called to see the old sailor and that she had not seen him depart was owing to the fact of the drugging by putting laudanum in the girls tea huxham had precipitated his own death since bella with her wits about her might have made a third at the interview and so the blow would not have been struck neither bella nor cyril thought that edwin lister had come to the manor intending to murder huxham although it certainly seemed strange that the former should have carried with him the nigerian knife with which the crime had been committed but howsoever this particular point might be explained it was probable that the tragedy was the outcome of a sudden quarrel edwin lister had profited but little by his crime since the sum of one hundred pounds was all that he had been able to find in the safe certainly many papers had been carried away but there was nothing to show that these were of value save the fact that they had been thieved if edwin lister could only be found an explanation might be forthcoming but he seemed to have vanished completely it was not improbable that he had walked to tarhaven some miles away to escape on a steamer to the continent but if this was the case it was strange that he had not communicated with his savage friend durgo was a man upon whom edwin lister could rely entirely setting aside the fact that durgo was needed to guide the expedition into the hinterland of nigeria where the treasure was concealed it was now some weeks since the death and burial of the skipper but as yet edwin lister had given no sign of his existence and until he did so there was no chance of solving the mystery true to his promise cyril called at the chequers inn to see durgo and found that the negro was looked upon as a royal guest the lean landlady believed him to be an african prince on a secret mission to england concerning the missionary question she was right in one way for durgo undoubtedly was a chief and the son of a chief but it was questionable if he was the friend of the missionaries howeveras cyril foundhe made this excuse for his presence in marshely and mrs giles the landlady a redhot fanatic was delighted that her house should be so honoured also durgo paid largely for the sittingroom and bedroom which he occupied cyril was amazed when he called one evening to see this same sittingroom as he saw evidence of great luxury in the articles brought by the negro to decorate the somewhat bare apartment the furniture of the parlouras mrs giles called itwas plain and cheap but there were evidences that it was occupied by a wealthy guest indian coverlets gorgeously embroidered adorned the chairs there were splendid wildbeast skins on the floor and on the sidetables appeared several silver vases rudely but skilfully wrought cyril noted a bronze incenseburner in which pastilles smouldered several small golden images of ugly tribal gods some beautifullymade spears and warclubs brightlyhued feathers curious shells and photographs of native towns and their inhabitants why durgo should travel with such a collection of rubbish was not clear but probably he did so that he might be surrounded by memorials of his sunny country in the land of fogs and greyness durgo himself was a surprise as he received cyril in a wellmade smoking suit and quite in the conventional manner offered him cigarettes of a good brand and the orthodox whiskey and soda or champagne if you prefer it said durgo laying his black hand on the oldfashioned bellrope coffee for me said lister throwing himself into a comfortable armchair and accepting a cigarette do you know durgo that you are something of a puzzle to me the negro rang the bell gave an order for coffee to mrs giles who entered and when she had retired turned to his guest how so he asked your very good english the adornments of this room your present dressi did not look for such things in aa cyril hesitated in an african negro finished durgo sitting down with a grave smile well yes people of your colour added cyril with the covert insolence of the white towards the black dont usually durgo raised one large hand i know dont proceed he said with suppressed anger you think we are barbarians well you are as a rule i am the exception to this rule durgo paused and his eyes wandered to some photographs over the mantelpiece i told you that the missionaries educated me he continued but if you look at those photographs you might learn who was my real alma mater alma mater repeated cyril rising to approach the mantelpiece why these are university photographs oxford i was at oxford some years ago you cyril looked at the groups of boatingmen cricketers football players and wondered he wondered still more at a portrait of durgo in a master of arts gown you said cyril completely surprised yes why not my father was a great chiefa king as you might say but it was edwin lister who first fired my ambition to learn the lore of the white men so that i might civilise my tribe he induced my father to give me much money and took me to england himself many years ago i was at school and at oxford until i took my degree then i returned to my tribe in nigeriain southern nigeriaand as my father was dead i attempted to teach my countrymen and subjects what i had learned your father helped me and it was then that he saved my life when a lion attacked me i could do nothing however continued the negro bitterly as my countrymen were too much under the sway of the fetish priests these raised an outcry against me and nominating a cousin of mine as chief drove me and your father away we only escaped death by an accident but i managed to bring some treasure with me and came with your father to england and now i suppose you want to find this treasure you spoke of and regain your chiefdom said cyril interested in this strange story durgo fingered a cigarette carefully and lighted the same there is no treasure he remarked quietly but you said i know i did when miss huxham was present women as i say should know nothing or hear nothing of these things to you i speak plainly as you are the son of my master and so are entitled to my regard and trust i came here with your father added durgo slowly to get money from huxham so that we both might buy guns and swords and rifles to reconquer my tribe but the british government quite so the government would not approve so for that reason i remained in rough clothes in rough lodgings near the docks while edwin lister went to live in the west end he interested several adventurous spirits in our proposed expedition but money was sadly needed and i had not enough thus your father came down to see captain huxham and get that which was required captain huxham whom your father had met in nigeria owed my father a lot of money which he did not pay i was only employing edwin lister to get back my own i see but how did my father learn the whereabouts of captain huxham you told him was the negros unexpected reply i told him i dont recollect perhaps not as you spoke hurriedly but dont you remember that when your father one day asked you for money you said that you wished to save all you could as you desired to marry miss huxham your father questioned you and learned that she was the daughter of an old sailor it was therefore easy for him to guess that he had found the man for whom he was seeking but i did not tell my father where captain huxham lived durgo waved his hand as mrs giles brought in the coffee that was easy he remarked when she left the room you were followed here by your father but now that you understand the position will you work with me i will work with you to learn the truth about this murder i understand said durgo shrewdly so that you may prove edwin listers innocence yes said cyril accepting the cup of black coffee which his host passed to him i am hoping to see my father and to learn that he did not kill captain huxham if he did there is no chance of happiness for me as i cannot then marry miss huxham durgo stirred his coffee calmly no that is true i am sorry for you but if such is the case and your marriage is an impossibility why not come with us on our expedition to the hinterland of nigeria if i win back my chiefdom i can do much for you i dont want to go with my father said cyril turning pale especially if he hasas i suspectspoiled my lifes happiness if he is innocent i can then marry miss huxham and will stay at home quite so i understand but my offer is always open to you if you choose to take it meanwhile the first thing to do is to learn what edwin lister took away with him one hundred pounds yes and some papers i wish to learn what those papers are as captain huxham may have made a memorandum of the property he possessed there may be other papers which may cast light on those which were stolen but i dont understand said cyril perplexed whatever property captain huxham possessed went to his sister now mrs henry vand the english property said durgo with emphasis then seeing that his guest was still puzzled he laughed in his guttural way never mind i have an idea which may or may not turn out to be correct i shall know when mrs tunks comes here this evening and then i can explain myself fully mrs tunksgranny tunks what has she to do with the matter durgo smiled in his slow way my friend i have not been idle while in marshley looking for my master edwin lister i wished to search the manorhouse for possible papers to reveal that which i desire to know what is that i shall tell you when i am sure said the negro doggedly and not until then but it was impossible for me to enter the manorhouse and search as this man vand is very clever and cunning and more of a watchdog than his stupid wife i could have managed her had she been unmarried by posing as a wealthy princein fact i could have cajoled her as i have done mrs gilesbut her husband is suspicious and sharp i could do nothing then i learned that this gipsy woman mrs tunks is in the habit of charing at the manorhouse i therefore offered to pay her a large sum if she would bring to me certain papers which are hidden in a sandalwood chest carved with the figures of the gods of my tribe how do you know that such a chest exists or is in the manorhouse after i see mrs tunks i can tell you said durgo softly how will mrs tunks know the chest i have described it to her the figures of the gods are carved on soft white wood and the lines are filled in with red and blue and yellow pigment the design and the decoration are very noticeable the work is what you call in english skrimshanking i thought the word was a military slang one meaning to shirk work said cyril after a pause quite so but i think the word is a nautical one sailors carve and colour their carvings in the way i mention and call such work skrimshanking i expect that when a sailor was not at his post the excuse made was that he was skrimshanking hence the slang meaning of the word very interesting from a philological point of view yawned lister taking another cigarette but had we not better get back to our talk of my fathers whereabouts we can do nothing until i know what edwin lister took away with him said durgo again and that i can only learn if mrs tunks brings the papers i mentioned this evening he glanced at the travelling clock on the mantelpiece nearly nine she should be here soon but will she have the papers yes yesterday she told me that she saw the chest in an attic under a pile of rubbish but had no chance of opening it today she is charing at the manorhouse and will be able to get what i want but if mrs vand catches her mrs vand wont was the confident reply granny tunks is too clever to be caught and moreover wants to earn the fifty pounds i promised her great scott are you so wealthy as to yes yes interrupted durgo impatiently i have much money but not enough for my expedition unless indeed edwin lister has carried these papers which will show us how to get the money then my father knew about this chest also yes i expect he looked for it in captain huxhams study after the crime was committed unfortunately it happened according to granny tunks to be in the attic so he missed it but huxham may have had the papers in his study and that was why the room was so upset asked lister thoughtfully that was why after the crime was committed great heavens man burst out the other irritably dont talk as if it was certain that my father killed the man if he did not who did demanded durgo coolly then as cyril was markedly silent he continued i think very little of the killing myself if what i believe about the papers i require is correct captain huxham deserved his death as a thief and a false friend you speak in riddles said lister bewildered granny tunks can solve them replied the negro significantly have some more coffee and try these cigars they are superfine cyril silently accepted this further hospitality and stared furtively at the calm black face of his host the nose was aquiline and the lips extraordinarily thin so it was apparent that durgo had arab blood in his veins perhaps he was a descendant of those conquering mohammedans who came down like a storm on central africa in the middle ages what with durgos looks his educated speech and his air of command cyril wondered that he had ever taken the negro for an ordinary black all the same he believed that given the necessary environment the savagery would break out from under the thin veneer of civilisation which the man had acquired at oxford scratch a russian and you find a tartar scratch a modern man semicivilised or wholly civilised and you find the prehistoric animal while cyril was thinking in this manner and watching the black mans face through the smoke he saw durgo suddenly listen intently with the air of an animal scenting danger shortly footsteps were heard in the passage without and the door opened to admit granny tunks who was shown in by mrs giles the toss of the lean landladys head and her air of disdain showed that she was by no means pleased with the ragged visitor but a glance from the glossy romany eye of mrs tunks sent her shuddering out of the room in spite of the religion taught by silas pence at the little bethel chapel mrs giles was primitive enough to believe in the power of the evil eye and she had some reason to for people who offended mrs tunks invariably underwent a spell of bad luck here i am master said mrs tunks with a cringing air and cyril started to hear her so address the negro he was further surprised when he saw how commanding were the looks of durgo have you got those papers asked the negro extending his large hand granny tunks had them and said so but it took her some time to find them so ragged were her garments and so hidden her pocket she still wore the brown dress tagged with particoloured ribbons and her plentiful white hair still hung like seaweed from under the dingy red handkerchief also as usual she jingled with the multiplicity of coins which dangled from her neck her wrists and from various parts of her picturesque dress in sixty or seventy seconds she managed to find a bundle of dusty papers tied up with faded red tape and passed them to durgo with ingratiating smiles there you are deary master snapped the negro with sudden ferocity yes master stammered the woman turning slightly pale under her brown skin i found them in the chest you spoke of the catshe meant mrs vanddidnt see me master so no one knows but this gentleman but he wont say a word no no ill be bound he wont how do you know asked cyril sharply mrs tunks replied without taking her beady black eyes from durgo i saw the coming of the master in the crystal lovey and told your dear sweetheart of the same the master brings good luck to you both so if you tell it will part you and your deary for ever we are parted as it is said cyril bitterly perhaps not replied the old woman lister rose from his chair and stared what do you mean he cried imperiously durgo who had been examining the papers looked up on hearing this question and shot forth a long arm in the direction of the door go he said to mrs tunks go at once and the money master you shall have it tomorrow as soon as i have examined these go i say i am not used to speak twice but durgo cried cyril annoyed by the interruption i want to know you shall know what mrs tunks has to say tomorrow said durgo settling down into the chair and still examining the papers the witchwife who had moved slowly towards the door had not looked at lister once during her stay in the room all the time her gaze was fixed almost reverentially upon the negro in spite of durgos prohibition cyril crossed the room to catch mrs tunks by the arm but the moment he touched her she seemed to wake up as from a magnetic spell and opening the door slipped through like a snake when the door was closed again cyril in some anger faced durgo why didnt you let me question her she would have said nothing returned the man dryly because she knows nothing she hinted that bellamiss huxham i meanand myself would not be parted durgo shrugged his shoulders hai the woman is a witch and knows doings of the unseen she may have been told oh rubbish i dont believe in such things possibly you dont i do i have been taught things which would open your eyes if i explained them in africa we know much that you dont know a sudden light flashed into cyrils brain is that why mrs tunks addressed you as master durgo nodded absently still reading the papers but he did not reply in words as his eyes were travelling over some faded writing and his lips were moving before cyril could ask another question as he was desirous of doing the negro started to his feet with a fierce shout which sounded like a warcry as i believed as i thought he shouted hai the good news what is it asked lister surprised by the savage exultation durgo thrust the papers into his pocket and began to tell a story without any preamble when my father was chief there were two traders in his town whom he trusted one traded inland and the other commanded the river steamer maxwell faith was the inland traders name and the steamer commander was jabez huxham for services rendered my father the chief kawal gave mr faith jewels to the value of forty thousand pounds huxham became jealous and having murdered faith ran away with the jewels he brought them to england to bleacres and feared night and day lest he should be assaulted and killed for the sake of the treasure that is why huxham planted the fields with corn leaving only one path whereby to reach the manorhouse he did not wish to be surprised huxham took faiths papers also regarding the value and number of these jewels the papers were in the chest i told you of and i have these papers herehe tapped his breastbut the jewels no doubt have been taken by your father who doubtless killed huxham to get them durgo nodded good very good when my master edwin lister writes to me to join him we can sell the jewels for forty thousand pounds and then can fit out our expedition to recover my chiefdom goodnight lister i have work to do good night and before cyril could recover from his amazement he found himself gently led into the passage and heard the door locked what does it all mean he asked himself but could not answer the question chapter xiv what silas pence knew on that same evening when cyril was interviewing the strange negro there was a concert in the marshely schoolhouse in aid of the prize fund dora had arranged the programme and had asked bella to be present the girl would much rather have remained absent owing to the recent death of her father besides she did not feel able to enjoy music and frivolity and laughter but to please her friend who had been so kind to her she came dressed in black and deeply veiled to the festival for obvious reasons she took a seat at the lower end of the room and near the door so that she could easily slip out when the end came but mrs vand was less retiring in spite of her brothers tragic death she appeared dressed in all the colours of the rainbow posing more as a bride than as a mourner in fact she displayed very little grief for the death of jabez and those who knew the late captain huxham were not surprised as he had never been a man to inspire affection moreover the secret marriage of mrs coppersley to henry vand had created quite a sensation and bride and bridegroom were much talked about and pointed at vand himself was one of the performers as he played two violin solos some folk thought that both he and his wife would have displayed better taste by remaining away but mrs vand laughed at this opinion and flaunted her newlyfound happiness in the face of all her acquaintances luckily few people noticed bella in her obscure corner so she was not troubled with questions those who guessed who she was felt that she had been very badly treated since the money had been left to mrs vand and indeed the sympathies of the entire neighbourhood were with the disinherited girl mrs vand as everyone said should have been ashamed of herself but in spite of the indecent way in which she thrust her good fortune on everyones notice no one was bold enough to tell her what was the general opinion of her conduct as for bella she sat in her corner feeling ill and miserable she had every right to be so considering the position in which she and her lover were placed it was to ween her thoughts from this dismal state of affairs that the kindhearted schoolmistress had induced her to come to the concert hitherto the cure had not worked the programme was the usual village one there were several sentimental ballads of the purely english drawingroom type two or three recitations the violin solos of henry vand who really played with rare skill and a reading by silas pence who was the chairman pence looked leaner and more delicate than ever and read the dream of eugene aram as a cheerful contribution to the evenings entertainment his sepulchral tones and dismal appearance cast quite a gloom over the close of the evening which was only dispelled by the singing of a glee by the marshely choral society but some time before this point was reached bella had slipped out of the room and had taken her way back to the cottage she went early as her aunt had noticed her and it was just possible that mrs vand who dearly loved to make trouble might start a quarrel if it came to a conversation between the two mrs vand had not forgiven her enforced payment of one hundred pounds bella did not enter the cottage as it was very hot within and the night was simply glorious she took off her hat and veil and seated herself in the tiny garden to enjoy the soft breeze there was not a cloud in the darklyblue sky and a serene moon moved majestically across the starry heavens the cottage with the lamp light shining behind the pink blinds looked pretty and picturesque so bella resolved to wait for doras return in the open air she had ample to think about for the concert had failed to inspire her with cheerful thoughts how could it when the clouds which environed her were so densely black poor bella was not religious and had small faith in the goodness of god this was natural as gods name had rarely been mentioned by captain huxham and his sister who were perfect heathens of the animal sort so bella having no hope to cling to and seeing no ray of light piercing the darkness around her began to conceive a cheerless future in which the figure of cyril did not appear the fact that his father had murdered hers ended the chance of marriage once and for all he would doubtless go abroad and try to forget her while she bereft of love home money and father would seek some humble situation as a nursery governess and it must be confessed that as things were bella huxham had good reason to despair any chance of happiness seemed to be as far removed from her as was the moon in the heaven above her the seat upon which she was resting stood close to the white palings of the garden and under a leafy chestnut now in the full glory of its summer foliage occasionally a person would pass or a child singing would run home but for the most part the road was deserted nearly all the village people were at the concert and it would not end for at least another half hour only then would the roadway be full but in the meantime save for occasional interruptions bella had solitude and peace she was therefore extremely illpleased when a dark figure halted at the palings and leaning over removed its hat to reveal the delicate features of silas pence i give you goodevening miss huxham said the preacher in his refined but somewhat shrill voice good evening said bella coldly had you not better return to the concert mr pence as the chairman you cannot leave the platform i have presided most of the evening and have recited my piece said pence eagerly now on the plea of feeling faint i have left that hot room and i am here to commune with you in the glory of the night is it not beautiful miss huxham and he recited the wellknown lines of addison soon as the shades of night prevail the moon takes up the wondrous tale and nightly to the listening earth repeats the story of her birth did you come here to recite mr pence said bella disagreeably if so i must go indoors i have been entertained enough this evening you should not have been at the concert at all said the preacher rebukingly seeing that your dear father is scarcely cold in his grave that is my business mr pence said bella in icy tones if you rebuke any one it should be my aunt who is flaunting the property of which she robbed me in the face of everyone i shall rebuke sister vand at a proper time said silas authoritatively in the meantime you rebuke me said bella who had risen to her feet weary of the conversation i decline to permit your interference i dont want to rebuke you cried pence eagerly i wish to make you smile on me become my spouse or fair lily of the valley and you will have me always at your feet i have told you before mr pence that i cannot marry you then you still intend to wed that son of belial overflowing with insolence and wine questioned the preacher bitterly your fathers murderer mr lister is perfectly innocent as i happen to know can you prove his innocence can you prove his guilt retorted the girl spiritedly i saw him enter the manor on that night you saw a man who resembled him mr lister was in london and can prove that he was there it is useless your using threats mr pence for had you been able to carry them out you would long since have seen the police pence frowned who is this other man he asked you can find out said bella impatiently and i am going indoors there is no other man cried pence angrily why i saw mr lister quite clearly i could not mistake him you did however the police shall decide that go to the police you threatened to do so before why dont you do what you say instead of trying to frighten me with stage thunder silas stamped and raged you will find the thunder real enough before i have done with you this lister man is guilty and shall hang you shall become my wife my never never never and bella stamped in her turn you will as you have no name of your own you should be glad to take that of an honest man the girl started and stared my name is huxham she said angrily it is nothing of the sort when i wished to marry you captain huxham your supposed father told me that you were a nameless waif whom he had adopted out of charity it is wholly false it is true it is true pence leaped the fence before she knew what was his intention and caught her in his arms and you must become my wife you beast you villain cried the girl struggling how dare she got no further even while the words were on her lips a pair of very strong hands caught pence by the shoulders and wrenching him from the girl flung him over the fence the next moment cyril held bella in his arms oh my dear my dear she sobbed utterly broken down how glad i am that you arrived to punish him i shall punish him more cried cyril striding towards the gate no no said bella stopping him think of my good name it is useless making a scandal but ask him if what he says is true what does he say questioned cyril with a note of savagery in his voice oh hush hush implored bella clinging to him speak lower i dont wish everyone to hear what mr pence declares but what is it what is it ask him after all he may be wrong and still holding the girl lister mindful of her wish spoke in a loud whisper to the dusty figure on the other side of the fence pence had just risen sorely bruised but unable to leave his rival with the girl he loved yet lingered in the roadway here you said lister sharply what have you been saying to miss huxham speak out you dog or ill thrash you thoroughly let me go bella let me go i say no no we must avoid all scandal think of what might bebe she gasped and without ending her sentence fell half fainting into cyrils arms then came pences chance to discharge the vials of his wrath for he saw that lister hampered by the fainting girl could not touch him stepping up to the palings with his face distorted with anger he spoke in low tones of hate i say now to you what i shall soon say to all captain huxham adopted the girl whom you falsely say that you love she has no position and no name and no money so if you marry her stop said cyril imperiously can you swear to the truth of this wild statement miss huxham always passed as the captains daughter she is not miss huxham said silas insistently she is missi dont know what i can prove what i say if necessary and i shall unless unless what unless you renounce her so that she can become my wife bella heard the words and stood unexpectedly erect with fresh energy wrathful at pences persistency nothing will ever induce me to become your wife and if what you say is true my aunt would have told me mrs vand is not your aunt and captain huxham was not your father said the preacher sullenly if needs be i can prove it then do so cried cyril quickly for by doing so you will remove the sole barrier to our marriage what do you mean asked silas recoiling in sheer surprise let me speak said bella guessing what her lover meant we mean that had you held your tongue cyril and i might have been forced to part now that i know i am not captain huxhams daughter i can marry him pence looked from one face to the other in the chill moonlight and drew his own conclusions with swift intuition sharpened by hate then this lister man is the murderer of huxham you have to prove that said cyril cheerfully i am not bound to incriminate myself you know silas raised his hands to the heavens in mute appeal for he saw that in some way not entirely clear to him he had brought about the very thing he had been trying to avert enraged at his blunder and despairing of gaining his ends the man timid as he usually was would have sprung over the fence to renew the struggle with his rival but that many dark figures were seen coming along the road apparently the concert was over in spite of his anger pence retained sufficient sense to decide immediately on a sensible course he mechanically brushed his clothes and bent over the palings to speak with cyril tomorrow he said in a tense whisper you will be arrested on my evidence and shehe pointed a trembling finger at bellawill be known as a nameless outcast the girl uttered a faint cry at the insult and cyril would have struck the man who spoke but pence was prepared and swerved away from the fence with a taunting laugh to retreat rapidly down the road towards the advancing throng come inside come inside said bella plucking at cyrils sleeve you must not be seen here with me at this hour mr pence will say nothing for his own sake come inside until dora returns this was wise counsel so the pair hastily retreated and closed the door before they could be seen by the sharp eyes of the village gossips bella ran into the diningroom where supper was laid and sinking into a chair mutely pointed to the water jug lister seeing how pale she was poured out a glass and held it to her lips shortly she was more her old self as the colour returned to her cheeks and the brightness to her eyes it was then that she asked a leading question do you think that what mr pence says is true i hope so i fervently hope so replied cyril sitting down to discuss the matter for then we can marry and he started and stopped it occurred to him that pences statement might be the cause of granny tunks queer remark an explanation of which had been prevented by durgo then again from the negros action and from the facts that mrs tunks had seenso she saidhis coming in the crystal and obeyed him so implicitly it might be that durgo knew much that he would only disclose at the proper time of one thing cyril was certainnamely that durgo was his friend and would do his best to put things right if lister assisted him to recover traces of his father and the jewels which edwin lister was supposed to possess i shouldnt wonder if pences statement was true said cyril musingly as he reflected on the present position of affairs it did seem strange to me that such a rough seadog as huxham undoubtedly was should have so refined a daughter as you i thought it was my education and no said cyril looking at her searchingly in the light of the small lamp your feet and hands are too delicate and your features too clearly cut and your whole bearing too well bred to be the child of such a man huxham and his sister are plebeians you are an aristocrat i am quite sure bella coloured at his praise of her beauty perhaps what mr pence says may explain why the money was not left to me cyril nodded if you are not huxhams daughter of course he would not leave you the money but it was strange that he should tell pencewhy what is the matter bella had started to her feet and was looking at him strangely i am unwilling to suspect mr pence seeing that it seems almost certain your father is guilty but i dont believe that my fatheri mean that captain huxham told him why not it was not captain huxhams way to confide in anyone and if he had kept silent for so long he certainly would not have told anyone later especially silas pence if anyone knew the truth it would be my aunti mean mrs vandand she hated me quite sufficiently to tell me that i was no kith or kin of hers this she did not do well and what do you make of the business this said bella slowly i believe that mr pence does know something of the murder although he may not have struck the blow your father may have been disturbed by mr pence and may have taken the hundred pounds but i am certain that mr pence found some papers telling that i was not captain huxhams daughter and has them in his possession now cyril shook his head you have no proofs of this wild charge no i have not all the same i believe belief is one thing and certainty another said lister decisively and again i must tell you that my fatherif indeed he is guiltygot much more than one hundred pounds and he related all that had taken place in durgos rooms bella listened in silence and was particularly struck with the use made by the negro of mrs tunks i believe that granny and this black man are in league she declared you know she foretold his coming by the crystal and that is all rubbish in this instance she foretold truly said cyril drily because she knew beforehand and simply made use of the crystal to impress me retorted the girl do you think durgo himself is guilty no i do not replied cyril very decidedly he bewailed the fact that my father had not asked him to get huxham out of the way no bella in some way my father managed the matter himself he might have killed the old sailor during a quarrel and have secured the jewels and have gone into hiding either here or on the continent we can only wait until we hear from him then the mystery may be solved i am not so sure that your father got the jewels said bella after a pause after all they were in the chest in the attic by durgos showing the papers were but durgo was not certain if huxham left the jewels there my dear you see the old skipper might and probably did keep the jewels in his study for safety but the jewels were in the house i am sure for huxham feared lest they should be stolen and so planted the corn and used the searchlight by the way i saw that used the other night henry vand knows how to use it said bella indifferently my father showed him how to work it on one occasion but what is to be done i must wait and see what durgo intends to do he knows much that we are ignorant of and for my fathers sake i think he will help us both and mr pences statement cyril took her in his arms i believe it he said kissing her fondly so the barrier between us is removed thank god for that said bella reverently and being unstrung wept bitterly chapter xv durgo the detective as has been seen durgo was no ordinary man and even had he been white instead of black would have passed for a clever member of the aryan race undoubtedly the strain of arab blood in him sharpened his intellectual faculties and made him ambitious to play a leading part in the history of his tribe that the members of it were savages mattered very little since he had been educated in the lore of the ruling race and could raise them sooner or later almost to his own level almost that is but not quite for durgo had no notion that any individual of his tribe should be as clever as himself he wished to be a despot and rule from an autocratic throne the one weak point in his characterif gratitude can be called weaknesswas his adoration of edwin lister that gentleman had undoubtedly saved his life and assuredly had aided him to attain to his present position of culture by inducing the old chief to send his clever son to england but cyril knew what durgo in his blind idolatry did notthat edwin lister was not a man to work for nothing and wanted much more than he ever gave there was every chance that he would abuse the gratitude of durgo when the negros ambition was achieved and if his protege revolted from complying with the exorbitant demands which would surely be made on his generosity he would speedily be reminded of what had been done for him with an ordinary man this would have mattered little as such a one would decline unreasonable exactions but durgos strongest trait was gratitude and it was probable that in spite of his clever brain and european education he would become the mere puppet of his benefactor thus the very nobility of durgos nature would reduce him to slavery and he would be ruined because he possessed the rarest of all virtues little as cyril had seen of his father he knew his character thoroughly being able to read by intuition as well as by observation edwin had only one god to worship and that was himselfa deity so congenial that the egotist was most devout in his religion of course durgos enslavement and edwin listers tyranny had nothing to do with cyril as father and son had long since gone on their several ways but cyril liked the negro and swore to himself that if durgo aided him to marry bella he would stand by him when edwin lister played the tyrant as yetso much cyril gatheredthe trader had not shown the cloven foot but he would do so sooner or later and then cyril hoped to open durgos eyes to the fact that his gratitude was being abused but there was much to be done before affairs arrived at this point and the first necessary step to take was to discover the whereabouts of edwin lister durgo had learned much from cyril and something from granny tunks now it was necessary that he should be informed by bella of the accusation of pence and of her doubts about the preacher she resolved to see durgo for herself and when dora was at school she watched at the window of the cottage for the coming of the negro she did not even tell cyril of her intention as he disbelieved her statement that pence had stolen certain papers and was connected in some way with the murder that she had absolutely no grounds for such a belief troubled bella very little since she was very much the woman all she knew was that pence could not have heard the truth about her not being huxhams daughter from huxham himself and it was necessary to find out how he came to know let alone the necessity of making certain of its truth cyril would have scruples in assaulting pence and learning the truth at the swords point as it were durgo being uncivilised for all his education would have no such scruples and therefore was the best person to apply to he would undoubtedly twist pences slender neck as he would that of a rabbit if he could force from him any information likely to forward his aims and unless some such brutal course was taken bella felt sure that pence would hold his tongue in her exasperation against the troublesome preacher all the girls worst traits came uppermost durgo did not pass along the road in the morning and bella almost despaired of seeing him she nearly decided to go to the chequers inn but a memory of mrs giles gossiping tongue prevented her risking so much in the afternoon however durgo lounged along the road in his lazy heavy massive fashion arrayed in his rough tweed clothes and looking very much like a burly prizefighter luckily there was no one in sight as miss ankers cottage was in a solitary corner on the outskirts of marshely so bella ran hatless into the garden to beckon the negro into the cottage come in come in i wish to speak to you she said hurriedly when he stepped up to the white palings and she glanced right and left to be sure that no curious eyes were on her durgo stared and frowned as education in a worldfamous university had not quite eradicated his contempt for women however when bella ran inside again and stood beckoning him in the passage he resolved to enter if only to learn why she acted in this bold way so tall was durgo and so low the door that he had to stoop considerably to enter and when in the little drawingroom he bulked hugely as gulliver in the lilliputian temple what is it missy asked durgo roughly for he was not inclined to waste his time in saying pretty nothings to this englishwoman when so much was at stake i cannot stay here i am busy i wish to help you said bella going straight to the point in what way durgo stared at her peremptory tone i wish to help you on condition that you help me in what way he asked again and sat down on a chair which creaked under his mighty weight listen said bella speaking very slowly and with her eyes on his strong black face you are not of my colour or race yet i am going to trust you as cyril told me all about you besides we are both working for the same endthat is we both wish to find edwin lister cyril told me what mrs tunks discovered he had no right frowned durgo i want no women dont despise women said bella drily for you may need the help of one woman and she is my own self you know that i am supposed to be captain huxhams daughter supposed to be durgo noted the way she placed her words at once which said much for his powers of observation and the quick working of his brain yes silas pence the preacher i know him missy go on loves me continued bella with a blush and to marry me he would stop at nothing last night he declared that i was not the daughter of captain huxham and that captain huxham had told him as much do you believe that yes that is i believe i am not captain huxhams daughter since the money was not left to me but i do not believe that captain huxham told this to silas pence i believe bella bent forward that mr pence is concerned in this murder and stole certain papers which revealed the truth durgos eyes flashed he saw at once the value of such information can you prove this he asked in his throaty tones thats just where it is she answered quickly i wish you to prove it how can i do that question mr pence and make him answer force him in whatever way you like to show how he actually obtained the information if he stole the papers stating the factand this i believehe must have been in the room where the murder was committed some hour during that night if so he must have seen edwin lister and must know where he is hai durgo leaped to his feet that is true that is probable perhaps he can say if my master got the jewels perhaps he can but i am certain that he will not oh i think he will i think he will said durgo significantly dont hurt him cried bella alarmed for much as she disliked the preacher she did not wish him to come to harm at the hands of this african semisavage as a matter of fact she was sorry to enlist durgos services at all but under the circumstances there seemed to be no help for it i shall not hurt him more than is necessary said durgo catching up his bowler hat and placing it on his woolly head if he speaks plainly i wont hurt him at all you have helped me missy and you will find that i am not ungrateful when you marry the son of my master you will be rich i durgo the king will make you rich he ended arrogantly one moment said bella detaining him these jewels belong to captain huxham have you any right to take them every right since they never belonged to captain huxham said the negro decisively my father the great chief kawal gave them to maxwell faith and from maxwell faith they were stolen by huxham if faith were alive i would return the jewels to him and ask him to help me with my expedition but he is dead huxham murdered him and stole the jewels edwin lister came to get back what belongs to me and i think he has them supposing you find mr lister and learn that he has not the jewels durgo rolled his eyes ferociously i shall then enter the manorhouse by force and learn where they are hidden you would only be handed over to the police by mrs vand and her husband henry it will be better for me to search how can you since you are not friendly with mrs vand bella laughed i know much more about the manorhouse than mrs vand does i assure you she said significantly there are all manner of secret passages and unknown chambers in that ancient mansion if i desired to enter i could do so in the nighttime by a secret door hidden behind the ivy at the back of the house then do so said durgo eagerly and search for the jewels not yet wait until you see edwin lister and learn if he procured the jewels by the way where did your father get them durgo reflected for a few minutes i have heard much talk of my fathers treasure of which these jewels were part you know how rich the northern part of africa was in the time of the romans yes cyril made me read gibbons history well when the arabs swept across northern africa they looted the roman cities then possessed more or less by the goths and vandals many of the arabs came south to nigeria and brought their plunder with them i think that these jewels which my father gave to maxwell faith came into his possession from some remote ancestor who so brought them but i cannot say still that is my opinion it is a feasible idea certainly said bella musingly and astonished at the knowledge of the negro quite forgetting that he had been educated at oxford but where the jewels came from matters little what we have to find out is where they are and mr pence i shall see this man interrupted durgo quietly he may lie to others he will tell the truth to me no violence warned bella anxiously durgo nodded i fear your police too much said he with an ironical grin and strode out of the house looking more burly and defiant than ever bella had regretted her employment of his services but what else could she do when so much was at stake bella wished to marry cyril and to do so desired to be certain that she was not captain huxhams daughter the papersif her wild surmise was correctwould prove if what pence said was true then since cyrils father had not murdered her fathershe put it in this confused wayshe would be able to marry her lover with a clear conscience that he might be the son of an assassin troubled her very little to get her way after the manner of a woman deeply in love she would have set the world on fire or would have wrecked the solar system and in placing the safety of pence in the hands of a semicivilised negro she undoubtedly was risking his life but she did not care so long as she attained to the knowledge which she was confident he possessed it will be seen that bella huxham was no sundayschool angel or even the amiable heroine of a family herald novelette who never by any chance does wrong she was simply an average girl with good instincts brought up so far as schooltraining was concerned in a conventional way at home no one had taught her to discern right from wrong and like the ordinary healthy young animal of the human race she had not passed through sufficient sorrow to make her inquire into the truths of religion bella needed trouble to train her into a good brave woman and she was certainly getting the training now but she made mistakes as was natural considering her inexperience that same evening mr silas pence was seated in his shabby sittingroom making notes for his next sunday sermon he occupied lodgings in a lonely cottage on the verge of the common and did so because his landlady was a member of the little bethel congregation who boarded and lodged him cheaply in order to have the glory of entertaining the minister the landlady was a heavyfooted heavyfaced woman with two great hulking sons and occupied the back part of the premises silas inhabited the best sittingroom and the most comfortable bedroom there was no fence round the front of the cottage although there was a garden of vegetables at the back so the sittingroom window looked straight out on to the purple heather and golden gorse of the waste land an artist would have delighted in the view but silas had no eye for anything beautiful in nature and paid very little attention to the changing glories of the year the lodging was cheap and the situation healthy so he was perfectly satisfied on this especial evening the young preacher sat at the redrepp covered table reading his bible and making his notes it was after ten oclock and his landlady was asleep as were her two sons both agricultural labourers worn out with the heavy toils of the day the sittingroom window was wide open and the blind was up so that the cool night breeze was wafted faintly into the somewhat stuffy room which was crowded with unnecessary furniture silas made a few notes then threw down his pencil and sighed resting his weary head on his hand pence was by no means a bad man but he was weak and excitable the pursuit of bella aroused the worst part of his nature and made him think say and do much which he condemned the better part of him objected to a great deal which he did but the tide of his passion hurried him away and could not be checked by the dykes of commonsense at timesand this was one of themhe bitterly blamed himself for giving way to the desire for hepzibah as he called bella huxham in his own weak mind but sane in all other ways he was insane on this one point and felt that he would jeopardise his chance of salvation to call her wife nevertheless he was sane enough to know his insanity and would have given much to root out the fierce love which was destroying his life but the insane passion which he cherished for a woman who would have nothing to do with him led him deeper and deeper into the mire of sin and in spite of his prayers and cries for help the unseen would do nothing to extricate him from the morass of difficulties into which he had plunged himself at times silas even doubted if god existed so futile were his attempts to gain comfort and guidance much as he loved bella he desired to win clear of the unwilling influence which she exercised on his nature and vainly prayed for light whereby to know the necessary means to get rid of the tormenting demon but no answer came and he relapsed into despair wondering what his congregation would say if any member knew the unmastered temptations of his inner life the struggle made him weak and ill and thin and nervous and but that deep in his heart he knew vaguely that god was watching over him and would aid at the proper time he would have taken his own miserable life with his head buried in his hands silas thought thus with many groans and with many bitter tears the shedding of which made his eyes burn occupied with his misery he did not see a dark massive form glide towards the open window nor did he hear a sound for durgo stepped as lightfooted as a cat the sill of the window was no great distance from the ground and the big negro flung his leg over the sill and into the room but in getting hastily through he was so large and the window so small that he made a sliding noise as the window slipped still further up silas started to his feet but only to see durgo completely in the room facing him with a grim smile i have come to speak with you sir said the negro silas turned white being haunted by a fear known only to himself but he read in the eyes of this black burglaror rather he guessed by some wonderful intuition that his fear and the cause of his fear were known to this man durgo saw the look in the preachers eyes and read his thoughts in his turn the negro was not boasting when he hinted that he possessed certain psychic power yes he said keeping his burning gaze directly on the miserable white man you stole papers from captain huxhams room and i i did not interrupted pence wildly and making a clutch at his breast coatpocket how dare you the papers are in your pocket interrupted durgo advancing as he noted the unconscious action and guessed its significance give me those papers i have no papers i will alarm the house do so and you shall be arrested what do you mean you saw my master edwin lister enter the manorhouse and thought that he was his son cyril lister told me as much from what you said to miss huxham about her not being the daughter of the sailor i believe that you followed my master into the house what took place nothing nothing i swear that i did not those papers said durgo pointing to the white hand which still clutched feebly at the breastpocket say that the girl is not captain huxhams daughter i want to know whose daughter she is you are talking rubbish i have no papers i am making a guess and i believe my guess is a true one will you give up those papers or must i wring your neck with widelyopen eyes the preacher flung himself against the mantelpiece and clutched at a handbell just as he managed to ring this feebly for his hands were shaking and he was utterly unnerved durgo seeing that there was no time to be lost sprang forward and laid a heavy grasp on the miserable mans throat ripping open his jacket with the other hand in less than a minute he had the papers in his hand no no no shouted silas and made a clutch at them durgo thrust the papers into his pocket and raising pence up shoulder high dashed him down furiously his head struck the edge of the fender and he lay unconscious but durgo did not wait to see further he glided out of the window like a snakeswift silent stealthy and dangerous chapter xvi the papers next morning the news was all over the village that silas pence had been seized with epilepsy and in falling had cut his head open against the oldfashioned fender he had just timesaid the gossipsto ring the bell before the catastrophe and the landlady being fortunately awake had rushed into the room to his assistance in an hour he had become conscious and had been put to bed after giving the explanation of how he came by the wound in his head as silas was fairly popular everyone was more or less sorry and many were the callers at the cottage on the common dora heard the news from one of her scholars and retailed it to her friend when she came home to luncheon bella turned pale when she heard of the affair she guessed that this was the work of durgo and reproached herself for having enlisted his services but then she argued that if durgo really was responsible for the preachers sickness he would have appeared in miss ankers cottage in the morning to explain what had taken place and possiblysupposing he had been successfulto show the papers then again if this was durgos work bella wondered why the preacher had not denounced him it seemed to her on this assumption that pence feared to say too much lest he should be questioned too closely dora certainly had no more suspicions than had anyone else but what the story of the young man was absolutely true he never did look healthy said dora when the meal was ended so i am not surprised to hear that he has these epileptic fits perhaps hell get over them hinted bella feebly and not looking at her friend lest she should betray herself my dear people with epilepsy never recover rebuked dora seriously and i wonder that the man dared to ask you to marry him seeing what he suffered from what a terrible thing to have a husband with fits are you sure that it was a fit asked bella trying to salve her conscience with the idea that durgo had nothing to do with the mattera vain attempt my dear am i sure that the hair grows on my head of course i am sure the man himself explained how he fell just as he clutched at the bell he hit his poor head against the iron fenderyou know dear one of those oldfashioned kitchen fenders now out of date its a mercy there was no fire in the grate or he would have been burnt to death why a cousin of mine onceand dora went off into a long and wearisome tale of a member of her family who had suffered in the same way when the little old schoolmistress returned to her duties bella sat down to consider things on the face of it durgo had done nothing and silas really might suffer from fits but as he had never fallen before and as bella knew that durgo would stop at nothing to get the papers which she believed existed she began to believe that the fall was by design and not by accident this belief taking full possession of her she longed feverishly to see the negro and to ask questions but although she watched for quite two hours at the window he never appeared thenas her nerves were strung up nearly to snapping pitchshe determined to call round at cyrils lodgings and tell him of her interview with the black man for the moment she was unwilling to do this as she guessed that cyril would be angry still as it was more or less certain that durgo himself would tell her loveralways supposing the papers existed and had been obtainedbella thought it would be wiser to be first in the field with her story besides in any case she would have to confess to cyril so why not now the only chance of getting at the truth of the matter of the murder lay in herself and durgo and cyril working amicably together and in keeping nothing back from one another there was a certain amount of risk in going to cyrils lodgings as his landlady mrs block was one of the most notorious gossips in the village she would be certain to talk of the visit and to make unkind comments on the fact of a young lady choosing to visit a bachelor without a chaperon and a chaperon bella could not have since she wished no one else to be present during her conversation with cyril a third party would mean that she would be unable to speak plainly and all knowledge of the caseinner knowledge that ismust be confined to herself her lover and to the negro it would never do to let the outside world know of the means they were taking to arrive at the truth and a chaperon might easily play the part of a shejudas and after allas bella reflected when hurrying along the roadshe had no one to consider but herself since it mattered very little what was said about her so long as cyril was true she was at war with her auntif indeed mrs vand was her auntshe had no friend but dora and there was really no person whom she desired to conciliate under these circumstances she took her courage in both hands and with a calm face but with her heart in her mouth she rapped at the door of listers lodgings luckily he had observed her from the window and opened the door himself i am so glad to see you bella he said shaking hands in a conventional manner as the stout form of mrs block appeared at the end of the passage for i was just coming round to propose a walk on the common it is a beautiful day said bella likewise conventional very wait until i get my hat and stick mrs block if anyone calls i am going to the common with miss huxham and a very lovely sweet walk it is said mrs block coming nearer to see if bella was dressed in sufficiently deep mourning for her presumed father as i said to block if hed only make the money a man like him ought to make id be strolling on that there common dressed up as fine as ninepence but there you never get what you want in this world and aint it dreadful miss huxham about poor mr pence very dreadful assented bella politely then as cyril was ready she went with him out of the gate leaving mrs block looking after them luckily for the couple mrs block had nothing to say against the visit indeed it was in her heavy mind that cyril having failed to take bella out as promised had been called upon by a young lady weary of waiting so like a man soliloquised mrs block standing on her doorstep broom in hand they never thinks never never and if this mr lister commences neglect afore marriage what will it be when the honeymoons over ah poor miss huxham what with her pa dying and her aunt robbing and him as should love her neglectingits a miserable life shell have ah well theres always the grave to look forward to and ending her soliloquy thus cheerfully mrs block entered the house and shut the door with a bang meanwhile the lovers quite ignorant of mrs blocks opinion walked along the village street and soon emerged on to the common they passed the cottage wherein silas pence lodged and this recalled the episode of the socalled fit to cyril as he had heard all particulars from his garrulous landlady im sorry for pence said cyril glancing at the cottage why asked bella nervously its such an awful thing for a person to have fits if id known that i should not have pitched him over the fence last night of course hes a rotter and a blighter and a nuisance but hes weak and i shouldnt have treated him so roughly i only hope said cyril gloomily that it wasnt the fall i gave him which brought about this beastly fit you can be quite sure of that said bella sharply in fact she hesitated then spoke out boldly i dont believe he had a fit my dearest girl he said so himself according to mrs block i know he did as dora told me and that makes me the more certain of his connection with the murder of my father i suppose i must call captain huxham my father until i am certain of the truth of what mr pence said i dont know what you are talking about said cyril stopping to stare at the downcast flushed face under the black hat why should pence tell a lie about his fall because he didnt want anyone to know that durgo had thrown him down cyril stared harder would you mind explaining he said politely i still cannot understand your meaning i dont know that i understand myself she replied nervously the fact is cyril i believe that durgo threw mr pence down when he refused to give up those papers what papers asked lister still bewildered the papers which tell the truth about me but my dear girl that is all supposition we dont know if any papers exist after all pence may have spoken at random you believed that he spoke the truth i did i want to believe as only by learning that you are not captain huxhams daughter can we marry said cyril dismally but the wish is father to the thought in my case well said bella plunging into her confession you had better ask durgo if he assaulted mr pence last night why should he i asked him to cyril who had walked on stopped once more and stared you asked him to yes bella was less nervous now i told him all that mr pence said and suggested that he should get the papers cyrils face grew stern as she knew it would tell me everything that passed between you and that nigger i have not said that i saw him said bella evasively you could scarcely have asked him to assault pence unless you had seen him retorted cyril who looked displeased come be frank tell me all bella did so omitting nothing although she every now and then stole a glance at cyrils compressed lips and corrugated brow at the end of her explanation he looked up and his eyes were hard you have acted very wrongly he said sternly i know i have i admit as much said the girl penitently but after all i only asked him to get the papers i did not tell him to hurt mr pence cyril shook his head impatiently you should not have seen this infernal nigger i dont like any white woman to talk to niggers i dont like them myself said bella quietly and you may be sure had i not been anxious to learn the truth i should not have spoken to durgo you could have asked me to speak would you have done so seeing that you did not believe that the papers existed nor do i believe now replied cyril walking on quickly it is all guess work on your part no no no insisted the girl as they arrived at their favourite spot under a giant gorse bush the mere fact that mr pence told a lie about his injury shows me that i am right we dont know for certain that he met with his injury at durgos hands then i have done no wrong said bella promptly indeed you have said cyril in vexed tones as they sat down you spurred on that infernal nigger to do what was wrong i understood that you liked durgo and thought him a welleducated man so i do like him so i do consider him wonderfully well educated he is an oxford ma you know but i daresay if you scratched him you would find that he is a common nigger after all the son of a king an african king pooh whats that you must promise me bella not to have anything more to do with him but i have promised to seek for the jewels in the manorhouse and bella went on to state how she could enter bleacres by the secret door cyril nodded and approved of the idea but you must come to me and tell me what you find out i dont want you to speak to durgo more than you can help that is racial instinct and injustice racial instinct is never unjust i dont care if durgo was a black homer and bismark and napoleon rolled into one he is a man of colour and i detest the breed promise not to have anything to do with himat all events unless i am present i promise if you will not scold so much said bella wilfully i am not scolding if i did you would cry the girl slipped her arm within that of her lovers pleased to have escaped so easily i begin to think that i am marrying a tyrant you are marrying a man who loves you and who wants to protect you from all dangers oh bella bella i wish we could go away to london and get married quietly then we could go to australia and leave this bad past behind will you come i have money enough for a year and by that time ill be able to get something to do in melbourne or sydney bella shook her head dear i love you dearly but i cant marry you until i am quite sure that i am not captain huxhams daughter in any case said cyril bitterly you will marry the son of a man who has committed a murder i am not so sure of that now that mr pence has told a lie i think that he may have something to do with the matter he may be guilty cyril groaned i have no illwill towards pence in spite of his insolence to you but for the sake of my name i wish i could think so there was silence for a few moments and then bella who was looking along the path spoke to her lover in a frightened whisper here is durgo and indeed it was the negro swung along bluff heavy and ponderous he was in dark clothes and these with his black face made him look like a blot on the sunshiny beauty of the summer world at once with his keen eyesight he caught a glimpse of the lovers and strode towards them smiling and bland cyril nodded coldly he could not forgive the black mans impertinence in speaking to bella quite forgetting that bella was to blame and had sought the interview bella herself remembering cyrils warning and her own promise did not dare to welcome the man i went to see you said durgo addressing cyril and your landlady told me that you had gone to the common with miss huxham i followed i am glad to find you both together i have much to say bella could not contain her curiosity did you yes said durgo coolly i did he would have made a noise so i had to dash him to the ground he hit his head against the fender mrs giles he added with a grim laugh tells me that he accounts for the knock on his head by saying that he had a fit what do you make out of that asked cyril casting a glance at bella warning her to hold her tongue ohdurgo glanced from one to the otherso miss huxham has told you about her interview yes i am sorry you took her advice and saw pence for i knew that ill would come of it durgo leisurely took a bundle of papers from his pocket much good has come of it as i am here to explain said he quietly you were right miss huxham pence had certain papers stolen from captain huxhams safe then he is guilty of the i cant be certain of that interrupted the negro sharply i had no time to question pence as soon as i got the papers which he carried in his breastcoat pocket i slipped through the window lucky that i did so for his landlady came in almost immediately in answer to the ring of the handbell if he hadnt sounded it i should not have rendered him insensible but i had to do so for my own safety well well well said cyril impatiently and looking at the papers we can talk of this later you say that miss huxhams guess is correct it is and i congratulate miss huxham on her clever brain pence was certainly a fool to say as much as he did and especially to so talented a lady who guessed there there no more compliments tell us both at once did he speak truly when he stated that miss huxham was not the captains daughter he spoke absolutely truly as you will find when you read this and durgo placed a bulky roll of paper in bellas hands oh she said flushing a bright pink how glad i am but whose daughter am i and she made to open the paper cyril laid his hand on the bundle we havent time to read all that now he said gruffly tell us shortly what you have discovered durgo the negro nodded and addressed himself to the girl your name is isabella faith he stated and you are the daughter of maxwell faith who was my father kawals firm friend the lovers looked at one another but how did i come to pass as captain huxhams daughter she asked breathlessly durgo shrugged his shoulders so far as i can read the story which captain huxham has set down in that bundle you hold he was smitten with compunction for having murdered your father and so adopted you bella shuddered how terrible to have lived with such a wicked old man she said i never liked captain huxham but thinking him my father i tried my best to do my duty no wonder he would not leave the property to me i think he intended to leave you the jewels though said durgo thoughtfully he mentions in those papers that he intended to make a will leaving them to you since his sister mrs vand claimed bleacres and his income its my opinion that mrs vand learned how her brother had murdered maxwell faith and so forced him to make that will then the jewels really belong to you bella yes said durgo rising and making a courteous bow and when we find edwin lister my master he shall restore the jewels but your expedition asked bella in surprise the negro looked at the lovers humorously i fear that there will be no expedition he said seriously i cannot rob you of your fortune miss faith marry our friend here and be happy but what will you do asked cyril touched by this selfabnegation durgo shrugged his shoulders again i shall search out edwin lister and return to africa in one way or another i daresay we can manage to get back to my tribe then i shall measure my strength and education against my cousin who is wrongfully chief for the rest there is no more to be said the papers you have miss faith will prove your birth and reveal all the doings of huxham there is no more for me to do so i shall bid you both goodday and wish you all good luck the lovers stared to one another and then at the retreating form of durgo who had so delicately left them together it was cyril who spoke first he is a good fellow after all he said that black skin covers a white heart oh bella how strange it all is take me home said the girl faintly and with white cheeks i can bear no more at present isabella faith is my name now until you change it to that of isabella lister said cyril kissing her but she only wept the more broken down by the unexpected revelation chapter xvii a confession on the way home from the common cyril and bella agreed that it would be wise to say nothing about her true parentage in the first place it would benefit no one to be thus candid and in the second such a statement would lead to questions being asked which might get durgo into trouble after all the lovers argued since pence as the chief party did not move in the matter it was useless for them to fight his battles the more particularly when durgo had acted so generously in surrendering the jewels the black man had behaved in a way for which cyril would not have given him credit few members of the boasting white race would have done as much according to the arrangement which the lovers came to bella was to remain miss huxham to the world until such time as edwin lister could be found and the truth of huxhams death became known of course with jewels valued at forty thousand pounds the girl was quite an heiress and she proceeded to build castles in the air for the advancement of cyril when he became her husband the young man did not say much as he did not wish to damp her ardour but he privately thought that if his father were in possession of the jewels he would not surrender them easily if durgo was generous edwin lister as his son knew was not and since he had risked his neck to get the treasure he would certainly not hand it over to a girl whom he did not know for a mere sentimental whim that the girl was to be his sons wife and that the son would benefit by the sale of the jewels would make no difference on the way back to the cottage bella recovered her selfcontrol and her spirits it was a wonderful relief to her to learn that she was not the daughter of the gruff old mariner whom she had never liked looking back on her life at bleacres bella no longer wondered that her supposed father had never shown her any affection and she shuddered when she recalled the terrible fact that his hands were red with blood on consideration however she gave huxham full credit for the way in which he had acted towards her he had come to england a thief and a murderer it is true but he could easily have left her in the care of the people who looked after her in a little croydon house bella could scarcely remember that house or the woman who stood to her in the place of a mother her own being dead almost her earliest recollection was being taken from croydon by captain huxham and placed with some friends of his at shepherds bush until she was nine years old then she lived with huxham for a few years and ultimately was sent to the hampstead boardingschool whence she returned to bleacres at the age of twenty thus the captain had educated her and had looked after her and in his own coarse way had proved himself to be generous to a certain extent badly as he had acted in robbing her of her heritage he might have behaved infinitely worse and by her heritage bella meant the jewels with the property and the income left to mrs coppersley now mrs vand she had nothing to do and she no longer grudged the woman what she had schemed to get but it was probable that had mrs vand not so schemed huxham for very shame might have given his adopted daughter his nefarious earnings i must not be hard on captain huxham said bella when cyril brought her to the gate for in his own strange way he acted kindly but i am glad that he did not leave me anything as i am certain he earned his money in some shady manner a kind of captain kidd assented lister gravely i agree with you but the old ruffian had a soft spot in his heart for you my dear no said bella shaking her head i would not say that exactly he suffered from remorse and therefore looked me out when he came to england i did not find him an affectionate father by any means but he was just in a grim way and even generous he grudged me nothing save ready money i wonder if mrs vand knows the truth you said yourself that she did not replied lister quietly and i am inclined to think so too a tyrant like mrs vand would have been only too glad to tell you the unpleasant truth unpleasant why it is a delightful truth unpleasant from mrs vands point of view since had she known that you were not her brothers daughter in no way could you claim the money bella shrugged her shoulders i am very very glad that she has got the money and much good may it do her but i am thankful that captain huxham did not reveal the truth about me to her now she need never know it matters very little whether she knows or not retorted cyril she cannot gain possession of the jewels those are clearly yours how are we going to gain possession of them asked bella lingering cyril looked hopelessly up to the blue sky heaven only knows the first thing to be done is to find my father and see if they are in his possession and now that we are parting bella and you feel better i dont mind telling you that i dont think my father will give them upif indeed he has them but to me his sons future wife my father is quite unbiassed by sentimental considerations said cyril very dryly what he holds he keeps however there is plenty of time to talk of this matter when we meet my father meanwhile what will you do bella shook the bundle of papers which she carried i am going to my bedroom to read these she said seriously i wish to learn everything that concerns my true parentage i may have relatives you know if you have said lister emphatically i only trust that you will leave them severely alone i dont care for relatives they ask everything and give nothing well said bella smiling for she had quite recovered her spirits so long as i have you i need no sisters or cousins or aunts goodbye dear no dont kiss me someone may be looking on what of that everyone knows that we are engaged it doesnt do to emphasise the engagement in public said the girl seriously and ran into the cottage at the door she turned i shall tell you all that i read in these papers she called out and vanished while cyril returned home to think over the strange turn which events had taken and things were strange for in striving to solve one mystery they had solved another in seeking for huxhams assassin they had found the true father of bella dora had not yet returned so bella in the seclusion of her bedroom felt relieved she did not wish as yet to share her secret even with the little schoolmistress good friend as that amiable woman had proved to be locking her door she sat down and unrolled the bundle it consisted of many sheets of foolscap and appeared to be a kind of rough diary kept by jabez huxham when he was in africa the script was in his crooked painful writing but was legible enough and after some practice bella managed to read it fairly easily seated on her bed she perused what was set down and found the reading extremely interesting the sheets seemed to have been torn from a manuscript book for the diary both commenced and ended abruptly and dealt entirely with maxwell faith and his doings the old pirate had evidently ripped the pages from the diary which he kept and had placed them in the carved chest which mrs tunks had found in the attic there also according to durgos story the jewels had been stored so apparently huxham had used the chestwhich had belonged to faithas a repository for all that concerned the dead trader but edwin lister could scarcely have gone to the garret to seek the chest and get the jewels since he did not know his way about the old mansion it was therefore evident that huxham had kept the jewels in his study safe and had removed the chest containing the tornout leaves to the attic afterwards he had apparently placed the papers in the safe also where pence had probably found them but bella did not pause to think out these matters she was to much interested in the story which was set down huxham stated abruptly that he met maxwell faith at calabar and had been engaged by him to transport certain goods up the cross river nigeria as far as ogrude when they were to be taken in canoes up to yahe on the stream of that name the goods were for kawal durgos father with whom faith appeared to have had many dealings faith and huxhamso the writer saidgot on very well and the former told the latter much about himself and his past the trader declared that he was the son of a wealthy huntingdon quaker but had been disowned by his family and by the society of friends because he had married a lady who was a roman catholic there was one daughter who had been born in london and had cost the mother her life faith said that he had placed his daughter isabella with some friends of his at croydon and had come to nigeria to make money for her from what bella could gather her father appeared to have been desperately fond of her afterwards huxham and faith parted but met again in the hinterland at the chief town of kawal and again became friendly then the trader told huxham that because he had supplied the chief with guns and ammunition and had proved his friendship in many ways he had received ancient jewels to the amount of forty thousand pounds he was going home to his daughter with the money at this part of the diary a portion of the manuscript was torn away apparently that which dealt with the murder of faith by huxham the story commenced abruptly again with the statement that the writer was going to england with his earnings and with the jewels and intending to seek out faiths little daughter and adopt her huxham gave no reason for doing so in his diary but bella reading between the lines guessed that the man was overcome with remorsea strange thing for so hardened a sinner as huxham undoubtedly was then came hasty notes of huxhams fears lest he should be robbed for the sake of the jewels and reference to an unknown man who was dogging his steps ogrude afikpa obubra and calabar were towns mentioned as having been the scene of adventures with this man whose name was not given afterwards the hasty notes detailed the finding of faiths little daughter at croydon her adoption by the writer and her removal to shepherds bush a few remarks were made relative to the fears of huxham and of his determination to find some place in the country where he would be safe from pursuit the final page was torn off in the middle and bella could read no more putting away the bundle in her box she reflected on what she had read it was easy for her to find her quaker relatives as the name and address of the family were given evidently these same relatives were rich but very stiffnecked in quaker traditions bella however thought very little of this at the moment her brain was employed in wondering if huxham had met with his death at the hands of the unknown man who had dogged his footsteps in nigeria without doubt this man knew of the existence of the jewels and that huxham had murdered faith to get them it might be that he determined to get the jewels and having traced huxham to england after long years had killed him and so gained his end and this manbella asked herself the question earnestlywas this man edwin lister she resolved to tell cyril and to give him the papers to read he could decide better than she and probably durgo could throw much light on the subject but there was no doubt that huxham had bought the solitary farm and had planted the corn thickly and had mounted the searchlight on the roof of bleacres so that he might defend himself from robbery and possibly from death but all his precautions had been in vain and he had been struck down at last in his very fortress and by edwin lister bella felt certain that as edwin lister had been many years in nigeria and had been a close friend of kawals he must be the unknown man to whom huxham had so often referred lister was the assassin there could be no doubt on that point very thoughtfully the girl locked up the papers and descended to the drawingroom to wait for the return of dora she greatly wished to speak to her friend about what she had discovered but such a confidence was not to be thought of as many things had to be done first until edwin lister was discovered bella felt that she would have to be silent but her thoughts on this subject were brought to an abrupt conclusion when she opened the drawingroom door for she unexpectedly beheld silas pence i came to see you miss faith he said using her true name and i told the servant not to announce me i waited here till you came speaking in this jerky nervous manner the young man did not attempt to rise as he appeared to be ill and exhausted his face was haggard and his head was bound up in a white cloth anything more weird than his looks bella had never seen and she recoiled on the threshold of the room only anxious to escape from his unwelcome presence have you come to persecute me again she asked no no no said pence weakly and yet with great relief in his tone i have come to ask your pardon for the way in which i have behaved i was mad to trouble you as i did but now i have recovered my reason what do you mean exactly pence smiled in a ghastly manner can you not guess said he touching the linen rag round his head the blow i received when i fell on the fender has changed my feelings towards you but how can a blow do that asked bella relieved but puzzled i cannot say faltered pence resting his aching head on one thin hand i really cannot say my brain wont think just now then dont think and dont talk said bella kindly placing a plump cushion at his back rest quietly and ill make you a cup of tea you give me good for evil said the preacher flushing painfully no no replied the girl hastily and remembering her share in his trouble you did me great honour in asking me to be your wife though you were a trifle difficult in some ways but now it is all gone it is all gone i assure you it is all gone what is all gone all my love for you all my desire all my mad infatuation i like you as a friend miss faithi shall always like you as a friendbut i can never never worship you again in the way i did thank heaven for that said bella fervently she knew no more than did silas how the change had come about but it was evident that the blow on his head had suddenly rearranged his ideas up to ten oclock last night i loved you madly despairingly and would have risked my soul to gain your hand but since i fellhe passed his hand across his forehead in a bewildered mannereverything has changed and for the better bella assured him come dont think anything more about the matter i have rung the bell for tea i rung the bell also last night it brought in mrs queen very fortunately or i might have bled to death miss faith why do you call me miss faith asked bella abruptly because you are miss faith said the preacher lifting his haggard face to her own in some surprise did not the black man tell you how do you know that i have anything to do with the black man i have seen mr lister with him i saw you all three talking on the common oh miss faith you dont know how i have followed and spied on you and the man flushed with shame and dismay did you listen asked bella abruptly no i did not fall so low as that but i followed and watched why because i loved you that is all over now i shall never follow or watch you again i am glad that the black man threw me down last night when i found this morning that my prayers had been answered and that i no longer suffered from this mad passion i resolved to say nothing about what had taken place and so invented the story of the epileptic fit yes but the truth is i know the truth durgo told everything to me and to mr lister this morning or rather this afternoon also durgo gave me the papers i have read them and know that i am not captain huxhams daughter by the waybella looked sharply at the preacherare we friends yes if you will have me for a friend said pence meekly by all means now that you love me no longer be my friendshe held out her hand which pence grasped feeblyand tell me how you got those papers from your fathersi mean from captain huxhams safe then you were in the room on that night yes i saw the body and you said nothing no had i done so i should have incriminated myself when i entered the study captain huxham was lying dead under the desk did you see anyone about i saw no one not even mr lister whom i had followed into the house just explain precisely what you did see said bella anxiously pence thought for a few moments i was watching the house as usual on that night because i loved you he said in a slow feeble way for he was still weak from loss of blood i beheld mr lister coming towards me he brushed past me and entered the manor by the front door i watched for his return intending to speak to him but he never came out bella sat up alertly he never came out no i dont know how long i watched but finally i grew tired and stole up to the house the front door was ajar i saw that the study door was also open so i went in then i saw captain huxham lying dead and bleeding with the safe open and the papers in disorder in the safe or rather tumbled on the floor before the safe was a bundle of banknotes the accuser of the brethren tempted me said silas with the perspiration beading his high forehead and i snatched up the notes for i thought that if i had money i could marry you i then saw that bundle which the black man took from me and thinking there might be more notes in the bundle i snatched that up also and fled why did you fly asked bella following this story with great interest i thought i heard a noise and feared lest i should be accused of killing captain huxham i ran out of the study and out of the house and down the path between the standing corn as though the devil was after me but he was not after me wailed pence standing up he was in my heart here is the money for which i sold my precious soul and he threw a packet of banknotes on the table with feverish eagerness it was all for your sake bella took up the notes the man you mistook for mr lister was his father she said quietly did you not see him in the room i saw no one did listers father kill captain huxham cant you tell asked the girl looking at him straightly i have told everything said pence with an air of fatigue now i die and before she could help him he fell full length on the floor quite insensible the interview had proved too much for him in his weak state chapter xviii the ghost the corn on bleacres was rapidly ripening under the beams of the powerful sun the manorhouse was islanded amidst a golden sea of grain the waves of which rolled up even to its ancient walls the winding path to the boundary channel was still the sole means of approach but few people came up this to the house as the vands were not popular henry certainly was approved of on account of his manners his affliction and his violinplaying but the neighbours ignorant of the truth could not forgive his wife for robbing bella of her inheritance now that she was rich and remarried it was mrs vands intention to become the great lady of the district but hitherto she had not met with much success in her bid for popularity but in spite of cold looks and significant speeches mrs vand went from house to house talking of a harvest home fete which she proposed to give as soon as the grain was reaped her husband would not accompany her on these social visits as he was shrewd enough to see that only time would ameliorate the bad impression which mrs vands callous conduct had created in vain he tried to show his wife that it would be wise to retire for a short period mrs vand scorned such fabian tactics and did her best to take by storm the position she felt that her wealth and personality deserved the more she was snubbed the more she persisted and there was no doubt but what in the end she would gain what she wanted by wearing down those who resented her conduct mrs vand paid a visit even to dora ankers choosing a saturday afternoon when she knew that bella was walking on the common with her lover the little schoolmistress received her coldly as she had never liked the woman from the first day she had set eyes on her but mrs vand in the most flamboyant of costumes was all smiles and small talk refusing to see for one moment the chilly reception she was receiving you really must come to our harvest home miss ankers she babbled what with henrys taste and my money it will be wonderfully gay and bright and artistic everyone will help to reap the corn and in the evening we will have a ball at which henry will play old english tunes to which we shall dance you must come i shall take no refusal how can i asked dora tartly seeing that your niece whom you have treated so badly is stopping with me mrs vand drew up her stout figure with great dignity that bella huxham left her home and my guardianship is purely her own fault she replied i promised to look after her at poor jabezs request but she chose to behave in a way of which i did not approve and to engage herself to a man who is not the husband i should have picked for her bella has every right to choose a husband for herself retorted miss ankers girls are not clever enough to choose the right man and mr lister you know nothing about him mrs vand that is exactly what i complain of said the other woman triumphantly he may be a rogue and a scamp he may be but he is not mr lister is a gentleman that doesnt prevent his being a bad character well said dora rising to terminate the visit i dont care about discussing my friends mrs vand rose also let us shelve the subject she said grandly and you can tell bella that i am willing to forgive and forget if she likes to come to our harvest home she can do so i am not the one to bear malice it is the last harvest home we shall have prattled mrs vand as her hostess skilfully edged her towards the door henry does not intend to sow wheat again and the grounds of bleacres will be thrown open to the public people are not fond of wandering in marshes said dora dryly if you want to please us throw open the manorhouse that is interesting if you like and haunted said the visitor in a thrilling whisper do you know of any sad legend connected with the manorhouse miss ankers no snapped dora tartly then her curiosity got the better of her dislike for mrs vand is it really haunted there are footsteps and whisperings and rappings in the twilight i told henry that if this sort of thing continued i should leave the place privately dora wished that she would and thus rid the neighbourhood of a most undesirable presence but aloud she merely remarked that the noises might be due to rats a suggestion which mrs vand scouted its a ghost a ghost she insistedall old families have a ghost but do not let us talk of it she continued looking round with a shudder already the thing has got on my nerves to go to a more pleasant subject let me invite you for a row on the water a row on the water echoed dora who knew of no lake in the neighbourhood on the channel at the end of my grounds explained mrs vand henry has bought a rowingboat and takes me far into the country you can almost reach the railway line before you get to the swamps do come ill think about it said miss ankers only anxious to get her visitor out of the house before bella came back do dear and come to our harvest home it will be quite artistic you have no idea of henrys perfect taste and if bella comes i shall be glad to see her in spite of her nasty behaviour andand mrs vand could think of nothing more to say so took herself off with a gracious smile quite sure that she had played the part of a great lady to perfection ugh said dora looking after the stout gaudilyclothed figure youre a spiteful cat if ever there was one i shouldnt be surprised to hear that you had killed your brother yourself in order to get the money unaware of this amiable speech mrs vand sailed grandly through the village dispensing smiles and patronage fortunately for herself she was not a thoughtreader or her selfsatisfaction might have received a severe reproof she was considered to be considerably worse than jezebel and in her stoutness was compared to the late mrs manning a notable murderess to her face many were agreeable but usually she was not received with the best grace finally towards the evening she returned to the manorhouse to report on her triumphs crossing the boundarychannel she saw the boat which her husband had lately bought it was a narrow but comfortable craft of a light build and the waterway was quite broad enough to permit of its being rowed very comfortably even though the oars occasionally touched the banks mrs vand looked at this boat with a singular expression and then stepping across the planks walked up to her lordly abode she found that her husband was absent and had left word with the servant that he would not be back to dinner mrs vand was annoyed as she did not like eating alone but in her heart of hearts she was afraid of her quiet husband even though he was considerably her junior and made no comment however the servant who brought in the seven oclock tea had much to say and mrs vand permitted her to talk for as usual the sinister influence of the manor was getting on her healthy nerves masters gone to the village to see his ma said the servant who was small and elfish and somewhat brazen then hes going to see tunks whats the matter with tunks asked mrs vand pouring out the tea hes ill hes been drinking hard for weeks ever since that horrid murder mum and now the doctor says hes got delirious trimmings mrs vand looked up sharply and frowned he is raving raving hard mum but master will see that he is looked after your master is very good said mrs vand taking a piece of bread you can go sarah the servant departed somewhat unwillingly as she did not like the big bare kitchen and felt the influence of the unseen as did her mistress but as yet ghostly doings had not been sufficiently scaring to make her throw up a good situation nevertheless she shivered in the kitchen and wished that tunks was present to keep her company as he often did at the evening meal but tunks was raving at the present moment in the hut on the marshes and there was no chance of anyone else coming to bleacres mrs vand sat and shivered in the diningroom also she lighted three lamps and although the evening was warm she set fire to the coals and wood in the large oldfashioned grate it seemed to her that she could not have enough light or warmth to ward off the cold malicious influence which seemed to spread a sinister atmosphere throughout the vast room shivering at the head of the table mrs vand kept casting furtive looks here and there as though she expected to see the bloodstained figure of her murdered brother appear like banquos spectre outside the twilight gradually deepened to luminous darkness and although she had finished her tea she did not feel inclined to move about the gloomy passages again and again she wished that henry would return at nine oclock her nerves were still shaky and she felt that she could not stand the diningroom any longer ringing the bell she took a lamp in each hand and told sarahwho entered speedilyto take the other the two women proceeded to the drawingroom and mrs vand having pulled down the blinds ordered sarah to bring her work and sit beside her the servant was only too pleased to obey and for the next halfhour the two sat in pleasant gossiping confabulation mrs vand knitting a silk tie for her husband and sarah trimming a wonderful hat with aggressively brilliant flowers there was no noise as the wind had dropped and everything was intensely still mrs vand and sarah chattered incessantly to keep up their courage in the ghostly atmosphere suddenly listen said mrs vand raising her hand do you hear sarah turned white through her dingy skin and held her breath there came distinctly the sound of three knocks from somewhere near the fireplace then a long dreary sigh the servant shrieked and sprang for the door but mrs vand was after her in one moment and seized her hold your tongue you fool its only rats as if to give the lie to her statement there came the swish swish of silken skirts and then the sigh again this was too much for mrs vand she scuttled panicstricken into the hall followed by the shrieking sarah at the same moment as though it had been prearranged the front door opened and vand appeared oh henry henry gasped his wife and clung to him the young man shook her off what is the matter he asked in calm tones but mrs vand being too terrified to answer sarah did so for her the ghost the ghost the ghost what rubbish said vand easily there is no ghost you silly girl and if there is here is one who can lay it he stepped aside and granny tunks lean and weirdlooking appeared at the door she had a white cloak over her fantastic dress and looked more witchlike than ever mrs vand stared at the woman in surprise why have you left your grandson she asked and glancing at henry hes sound asleep deary the fit having passed a gal o mine of the true romany breed looking after him your sweet husband hereshe waved a skinny hand towards vandasked me to come and see what i could do to lay this unquiet spirit who walks rubbish rubbish said mrs vand now feeling more confident in company its not rubbish deary said mrs tunks mysteriously the dead walk the dead your poor brother as is uneasy at having been pitched out of life so cruel hes walking and she nodded weirdly on hearing this statement sarah whimpered and clutched at mrs vands dress whereupon that lady who was extremely pale herselfshook her off go to bed sarah she commanded me screeched the girl and when theres ghosts walking id scream myself into fits if i went upstairs mrs vand appealed to her husband henry make her go the young man took the girl by the shoulders and propelled her towards the foot of the stairs but sarah resisted wildly and finally made a bolt for the still open front door ill go home to mother she cried hysterically and disappeared into the darkness there said mrs vand angrily to granny tunks see what youve done the house will get a bad name ill give that minx warning in the morning vand seeing that it was useless to run after the terrified sarah who by this time was halfway to marshely closed the door and shrugged his shoulders come into the drawingroom he said to mrs tunks no no cried his wife shaking the ghost is there i heard the rapping and the sighing and the yes yes yes interrupted vand with less than his usual coolness that is why i have brought granny there is an evil influence in this house and i want her to find out what it is do you believe in such rubbish you seemed to believe in it just now said the cripple drily yes i do believe in the unseen as i have had too much proof not to believe then get a priest get a priest cried mrs vand wildly and looking twice her age what is the use of this old fool granny tunks laughed in an elfish manner when she heard herself spoken of thus and seemed very little put out a fool can do what a wise woman cant she croaked your husbands wiser nor you deary he knows knows what asked mrs vand turning on the ancient gipsy fiercely that theres danger coming to you and him mrs vand cast one scared and indignant look on the withered face and ran into the drawingroom henry had preceded her here and was standing by the table looking round the room in an inquiring manner evidently on the alert for the mysterious sounds mrs vand caught his arm do you hear what this woman says she asked shaking him as the door was open i did hear he replied coolly dont be a fool rosamund i brought her here to see what she can tell us about mrs vand faltered and broke down hold your tongue said henry with an angry hiss like that of a serpent usually the young man wore a mild and gentle expression but on this night his face was haggard and his eyes were wild he had all his wits about him however and forced his wife into a chair where she sat trembling violently ive had enough of these ghostly pranks he said in a fierce undertone and as granny undoubtedly possesses clairvoyant powers i wish her to learn all she can come in mrs tunks he added raising his voice and the old witchwife entered the room looking singularly weird in her white cloak is that the only reason that you have asked granny here demanded mrs vand in a low voice sarah told me that her grandson had been raving you fool snarled the cripple will you hold your tongue i have another purpose which you will find out shortly granny he pointed to a chair sit down and tell us what influences are about mrs tunks sat in the indicated chair and lay back with closed eyes vand and his wife remained perfectly still the latter gazing at the old witch in a terrified manner as though dreading what she would say and do the room was filled with shadows even though three lamps were lighted and the silence became quite oppressive mrs vand was a healthy animal and not in the least imaginative but after a time she felt that some evil influence was in the room and tightly gripped her husbands hand the perspiration broke out on her forehead henry gave her no comfort not even by pressing her hand his eyes were fixed on the perfectly expressionless and still face of granny tunks the seance had all the elements of terror about it the gipsy lay as still as though carved out of stone and the watchers could scarcely see the rise and fall of her breath deeper and deeper grew the stillness so that even the fall of a pin could have been heard had one been dropped apparently the body of granny lay supine in the chair but her spirit was far awayroaming the house maybe after a long pause the woman began to speak in a low expressionless voice and almost without moving her withered lips gems she said softly rare gems blue and red and green jewels of price and pearls of the ocean they are in an ivory box long ago the woman who is standing near memrs vand started looked but could see nothing yet the monotonous voice went on as though the speaker really saw the form describedwore those jewels she has the face of a roman empress in africa many centuries agoyes in africa and she sinned to get those jewels now she laments that she has lost them how did she lose them asked vand almost in a whisper as though fearful of breaking the charm apparentlyas mrs vand guessedthis was not the first time he had assisted at so weird a ceremony fierce warriors in green turbans took themwarriors of arabia the jewels travel south still with the warriors there are many fights the jewels pass from one hand to another still in the ivory box now a savage has thema savage in a wild forest they are buried in the earth at the place where victims are sacrificed to the gods long years pass centuries glide by the box of jewels is found it is in the hands of another savage who wears european clothes he gives the jewels to a white man for services rendered mrs vand interrupted with a strangled cry of terror jabezis he jabez he is not jabez huxham but a man called maxwell faith but seethe dull voice of the gipsy suddenly became emotional and loudthey pass into the hands of jabez huxham and the hands that bear away the jewels are stained with blood the jewels pass with him across the sea to this land in london first then in this house they are placed in a carved chest it is in the attic now they are in the safe in the study and now vand interrupted how did they pass out of huxhams possession granny tunks did not reply for a few minutes during which mrs vand clutched her husbands hand still tighter and passed her tongue over her dry lips they pass from jabez huxham as they came to himby murder went on the clairvoyant i see the study huxham is at the desk and the ivory box of jewels is before him there is a knife on the floor by the door and the knife is bloody but huxham is not dead said vand quickly and softly there is blood on the knife said mrs tunks without taking any notice of the question huxham is so engaged in looking at the jewels that he does not see the door softly open a man enters he sees the knife and picks it up he glided behind huxham who suddenly turns nownow the blow has fallen and the jewels the jewels she paused what more gasped mrs vand what more in gods name there is no god here but only evil came the reply i can see no more i see however that the man who struck the blow is a cripple and there came a cry apparently from behind the wall vand and his wife turned astonished and terrorstruck on the left of the fireplace a sliding panel was pushed back and they beheld bella pale but triumphant so you murdered captain huxham she cried you and your wife o god there is no god here breathed mrs tunks again only evil chapter xix an awkward position the appearance and accusation of bella were so unexpected that mrs vand and her husband became perfectly white and obvious fear robbed them of all powers of movement granny tunks sat up rubbed her eyes and stared at bella with the open panel behind her in great surprise where have you come from deary she asked rising unsteadily never mind said bella with her eyes on the guilty faces of the married couple it is enough that i am here to accuse these two of murder mrs tunks uttered a screech what are you talking about lovey this good gentleman and kind lady have murdered no one bella glanced at her in a puzzled way you declared that henry vand murdered my father she remarked quietly and keeping up the fiction of her being huxhams daughter you said that a cripple me screeched granny again i never said such a thing of course not chimed in vand who was the first to recover his powers of speech its all nonsense your face showed that it was the truth just now said bella sharply when mrs tunks talked in her sleep sleep no lovey no sleep i sent my spirit away to learn things what did i say tell me my good gentleman what did i say i dont remember i forgot said vand striving to appear cool i dont forget cried bella indignantly she spoke of the jewels and of my fathers murder how did you find out she asked granny tunks who dropped into her chair and seemed to shrink how did you learn about the jewels and maxwell faith i never heard the name i never knew there were any jewels murmured the witchwife i never said anything about murder when i came back to my body i never remember anything no no no the spirit is stronger than the flesh and jealous of its secrets and she went on murmuring and maundering like one in her dotage yet bella knew well that in spite of her age granny tunks was very far from being intellectually weak meanwhile mrs vand who had sunk into a chair had gradually recovered her colour and wits you are the ghost she said suddenly to bella in spite of the strained situation the girl laughed though not very mirthfully yes i am the ghost she acknowledged it was i who sighed and rapped and rustled my skirts so as to drive you and sarah out of the room how dare you how dare you shouted mrs vand rising wrathfully what do you mean by entering my house and how did you get in i got in by a way of which you know nothing said bella coolly and i am not going to reveal my secret but i know this house better than you aunt rosamundshe gave her the old familiar nameand i know of many secret passages thisshe touched the panel at her backis the entrance to one of them in the old days many a conspirator concealed himself here i have used the hidingplace to learn your secret how dare you how dare you blustered mrs vand and would have gone on abusing bella wrathfully but that her crafty husband interposed miss huxham you have behaved wrongly in entering the house in this secret manner seeing that i told you how welcome you were to come openly both rosamund and myself would have been glad to see you not me not me vociferated mrs vand with a bright spot of angry red on each cheek i always hated her and i hate her more than ever hold your tongue muttered her husband and gave her plump arm such a pinch that she leaped aside with a cry of pain taking no notice of her distress he turned to bella you should have come openly he repeated may i ask why you made use of the secret passages you may and i am quite willing to answer i came to find the whereabouts of the jewels which belonged to my father i know of no jewels said vand steadily do you rosamund no i dont returned mrs vand aggressively there was the property and the income both of which jabez left to me by arrangement but jewels i never saw any if i had i should have got hold of them since they are mineif they exist that is granny here said when she spoke that they existed insisted bella quietly mrs vand shrugged her fat shoulders i dont believe in hocuspocus and hankypanky henry thought that the house was haunted as i did myself and he brought granny here to lay the ghost she has done so since she brought you out to talk in a silly manner you are the ghost bella so i dont believe that there are any such things as spirits i dont believe in spirits either said bella promptly and so i wish to know mrs tunks how you learned all you said all what mumbled the witchwife vacantly all about the jewels and the murder and the i dont remember saying a word interrupted granny rising slowly and with a lacklustre look in her beady eyes when i go into a trance i dont recall what i say but let me go into a trance again and ill tell you where the jewels are if you will give me a share and her eyes began to glitter in an avaricious manner no said vand in his most peremptory tones we have had enough of this rubbish oh sneered his wife you admit then that it is rubbish yes now that i know miss huxham played the ghost grannyhe turned to the old womanall your teachings of the unseen have proved false so you can take yourself out of this house and never come near it again bella quite believing that the old woman was a fraud and knew the truth of what she had spoken when in her socalled trance expected to see her defy the man she had accused but in place of doing so granny tunks flung the tail of her white cloak over her head and moved towards the door seeing her retreat mrs vand after the manner of bullies and cowards became suddenly brave leaping towards the old creature and before her husband could restrain her she struck her hard once or twice between the shoulders get out of this you lying cat go to the devil your master you vile animal vand caught back his infuriated wife with a fierce oath but granny still continued on her way out of the room as she passed into the dark hall she turned and sent a glance at mrs vand which made that triumphant tyrant shiver in her shoes but she did not defend herself in any way and shortly the three in the vast drawingroom heard the front door open and shut granny tunks was gone and with her seemed to disappear the malignant influence which had hung over the house for so long bella did not believe in witchcraft but she could not help thinking that the old woman must have exercised some evil spell and now had departed taking her familiar with her at all events the air seemed to be clearer for her absence now then said vand addressing bella in his usual courteous way as you are satisfied miss huxham perhaps you will go also no said bella determinedly i believe that granny spoke truly and that you and my aunt have something to do with the murder its a lie shouted mrs vand furiously and would have struck her niece as she had struck granny but that vand kept her back why should i murder my own dear brother to get the heritage you now enjoy said bella firmly i dont say you actually murdered him but i should think you didnt indeed raved mrs vand stamping in impotent wrath you heard what i said at the inquest what i said then is true i left this house at seven oclock with tunks as he can prove i was all the evening with henry as he can swear to and he left me on the other side of the boundary channel i came in quietly at ten and went to bed i never knew that jabez was dead until the next morning and then i woke you and as i was out of the house from seven until ten how could i have murdered my brotheryour poor dead fatherwhen the doctor declared that he was struck down shortly after eight how dare you forget interrupted bella quickly that dr ward said the murder was committed between eight and eleven so that gave you an hour to grant me patience heaven cried mrs vand casting up her eyes why the coroner himself said that the poor dear must have been murdered shortly after eight oclock since i came in at ten and saw no light in the study ah said bella significantly he declared that on your evidence and because he hated dr ward and wished to put him in the wrong then you accuse me of murder no i accuse you of nothing you say that i am guilty asked vand suddenly but quietly i do not say so but granny tunks did if so would she not have accused me to my face when i turned her out of the house said vand earnestly i assure you miss huxham that i had no motive to kill your father i was quite content to wait even though rosamund and i were secretly married besides on that night i left rosamund on the further side of the boundary channel as she can prove also my mother can show that i returned to my home at fifteen minutes past ten and that i was in bed by halfpast there is not a shred of evidence to support this unfounded charge you have made i did not make it granny said i know what she said interrupted vand imperiously hold your tongue rosamund and let me speak granny said what she did say in a trance at one time i really believed in such things now and especially since our ghost has proved to be you i have ceased to believe you heard merely the raving of an old beldame i dare say she wished to blackmail myself and rosamund by bringing this unfounded charge and chose this socalled trance to bring the charge if she really has any grounds to go uponand i swear that she has notshe will doubtless go to the police tomorrow and i hope she will go cried mrs vand angrily for then henry and i can have her up for libel no wonder everyone is so disagreeable granny no doubt has been spreading all manner of reports against us i daresay we are regarded as a couple of criminal gory murdering assassins ended mrs vand with a fine choice of words bella was puzzled like the vands themselves she did not believe in the occult arts with which granny tunks was supposed to be familiar and it was not unlikely that the clever old woman intended to risk blackmail certainly if mrs tunks could really prove the guilt of vand she would not have retreated so easily when he ordered her out of the house much less would she have condoned the blow of mrs vand if granny honestly could prove her case she was mistress of the situation but as she had slunk away so quietly it seemed that she had merely spoken from conjecture bella began to think she had been too precipitate in revealing herself as the vands decidedly had right on their side yet after all she said reluctantly how did granny come to know about the jewels jewels had jabez really jewels asked mrs vand avariciously yes said bella coldly i read some papers which proved that he had jewels valued at forty thousand pounds where did you get those papers i refuse to tell you that retorted the girl anxious not to incriminate mrs tunks until she had interviewed her you must tell yelled mrs vand her face on fire with rage and expectation youve come in sneaking by these secret passages to steal jabez never gave you any of his papers they are mine and if they tell where the jewels are you minx they dont tell where the jewels are interrupted bella but they state how captain huxham murdered maxwell faith in nigeria to get them you talk of your dead father as captain huxham said mrs vand sniffing her husband made a gesture of silence maxwell faith was the name mentioned by granny in her trance and she also spoke of this murder did she see the papers ah bella was suddenly enlightened perhaps granny had learned about the jewels from the papers which had been taken from the carved chest in the attic but then in that first set of papers as she thought the name of maxwell faith had not been mentioned granny saw one set of papers but not the set i mean then there are other papers you have stolen cried mrs vand furiously upon my word bella you are a fine thief and no mistake give up those papers so that we may learn where my jewels are they are not your jewels but mine said bella stepping back into the hollow left by the open panel and you shall not have them where are they where are they cried vand becoming excited in his turn i wish i knew but i dont captain huxham had them before he died then the assassin must have them yes perhaps you can tell me who is the assassin i cant say you know as much as we do said vand coldly if i had murdered the old man as you were so ready to think on granny tunks ravings i should have the jewels and long since would have cleared out with them but the fact that i am still here with rosamund proves that i am innocent we must go and see the police tomorrow henry said mrs vand and have this wicked girl arrested she must be made to give up the papers she has stolen ohmrs vand plunged forwardi could scratch her eyes out undoubtedly the furious woman would have made the attempt but that bella was on her guard already in the secret passage she had only to touch a spring and the panel sprang back into its place with a click in the darkness bella heard her socalled aunt hurl herself against the hard wood using very bad language then came the beating of fists against the panel in the vain attempt to break it down bella knew that the panel was too strong to break but thought it was best to leave the house as speedily as possible cyril was waiting for her near the boundary channel and the sooner she joined him the better as she turned to go she heard the high screaming voice of mrs vand raging wildly go up on the roof and use the searchlight henry shouted mrs vand the minx will get out of the house by some way we dont know of and must get down the cornpath ill catch her there and you show the light so that i can seize her ill tear her hair out ill scratch her eyes out ill make her ill and what else mrs vand was about to do to her bella did not hear as there was no time to be lost in getting away from the dangerous neighborhood of the infuriated woman bella sped along the narrow passage fearlessly as long experience had made her acquainted with its intricacies it was contrived in the thick dividing walls of the old house on the ground floor at one part there was a shaft leading to another passage on the first floor and up this it was possible to scramble by notches cut in the walls bella had half a mind to ascend to the upper story and linger for a chance of escape but as cyril waited her at the boundary channel it was possible that he might come into contact with mrs vand who would be furiously hunting therefore she judged it best to leave the house and gain the cornpath before mrs vand could intercept her with this scheme in her mind bella ran along the passage until she came to a door which turned on a central pivot this she twisted and slipped like an eel through the opening to find herself in a kind of tiny chamber groping round this she soon discovered the hasp of a closed door which she skilfully manipulated the doora narrow one and somewhat highswung open and the girl was outside in a quiet corner at the back of the house and hidden fairly well by a projecting buttress a screen of ivy clothed the manor wall at this point and the door was concealed behind the screen so that its existence had never been suspected bella had discovered the exit from the inside and had cut round the ivy that masked the door so that she could get it open of course the cut ivy had more or less withered but even so no one guessed that there was a door behind the brownish oblong the night was dark and warm and silent bella stole along the footpath which ran between the house and the tall rustling stalks of the corn several times she paused thinking she heard a noise but everything was still and she speedily turned the corner of the mansion apparently mrs vand was not on the hunt yet or perhaps she was busy with the searchlight which she had asked her husband to use however this might be bella saw that the course was clear and stealing round to the front door which she found to be closed she sped like an antelope down the winding cornpath which led to the boundary channel just as she reached the top of this and was prepared to start down it the beam of the electric light struck into the dark sky huxham had rigged up the light on the flat roof between the sloping tiles but vand had transferred it to the quarter deck which was slung round the chimney thus he was enabled to sweep the whole horizon without being interrupted by the tall roofs of the manor the beam swung round here and there pointing like a great finger and finally settled on the cornpath and on bellas dark figure running for dear life from the mansion the girl heard vands shout as he espied her heard also the front door opening as mrs vand rushed in pursuit but mrs vand like hamlet was stout and scant of breath and with all the will in the world urged by a venomous hatred could not gain on her detested niece who ran like atlanta the searchbeam revealed the path plainly and showing the flying figure of bella with mrs vand panting in vindictive pursuit towards the end of the path near the boundary channel bella called softly and breathlessly cyril cyril mrs vand is following hide hide at that moment the beam struck the boundary channel and revealed the whiteclothed figure of young lister it rested for a moment there and then dropped back to aid the steps of mrs vand cyril seized the chance of the friendly darkness and as bella ran into his arms he dragged her into the standing corn in less than a moment they were lying some distance from the path amongst the crushed stalks while mrs vand blundered past running unsteadily if vand had kept the beam on bella she and her lover would not have been able to hide but having been forced to give light to his stout wife the two were enabled to escape they could hear mrs vand puffing and panting like a grampus as she searched round and round in cyrils arms on cyrils breast bella felt perfectly safe and in spite of the position and of the near presence of her enemy was bubbling over with laughter mrs vand crossed the boundary channel and finding no one on the hither side concluded that bella had escaped she returned slowly and as vand had now shut off the beamfor he also had seen that the search was vainshe stumbled up the path in a very bad temper as her sighs and groans died away and the darkness gathered around cyril and bella rose and gliding back to the verge of the boundary channel crossed rapidly in a few minutes they were on their way to marshely what does it all mean dear asked cyril when they were quite safe bella told him all about her adventure chapter xx the master magician next morning dora being at school as usual bella received cyril and durgo in miss ankers tiny drawingroom to discuss the position of affairs with regard to the huxham mystery in the negros opinion it was no longer a mystery for after hearing bellas account of granny tunks utterances while in the trance he unhesitatingly pronounced henry vand guilty but on what evidence asked cyril who like bella had small belief in the manifestation of the unseen the evidence that granny said that she did say returned durgo quietly that evidence would not be accepted in a court of law remarked bella i am aware of that i have not been to oxford for nothing missy but it gives me a clue which i shall follow up this afternoon i shall see mrs tunks and question her but if she really knows anything said cyril after a pause it will prove that her trance statements were by design and from practical knowledge i am sure they were said bella emphatically i fancied that as granny did not see the second set of papers which durgo got from mr pence that she did not know the name of maxwell faith my father but now i remember that in the first set which she found and delivered to you durgo my fathers name was also mentioned also the number and the value of the jewels all her talk was of the jewels and of the murder of your real father by huxham said durgo drily that was not in the first set of papers and was only lightly referred to in the second set that is strange said cyril reflectively you no doubt think so said the negro calmly as you disbelieve all that you cant see or prove i know otherwise but durgo argued cyril surprised at this assumption you have been to oxford and surely must have rid yourself of these barbarous african superstitions you call them superstitions because you dont know their esoteric meaning but there is such a thing as magic white and black magic pshaw durgo shrugged his shoulders of course i never argue with an unbeliever cyril lister he said indifferently but the wise men came from the east remember and europe is indebted to the east for most of her civilisation but not to africa africa has had her ancient civilisations also in the time of the atlanteansbut its useless talking of such matters all i say is that there are certain natural laws which when known can enable anyone to part what you call the spirit from the body when the spiritual eyes are open much can be seen that it is difficult to prove on the physical plane i dont understand what you mean by these planes grumbled lister quite so and it would be useless for me to explain but facts beyond your imagining exist and had i the time i could prove much to you mrs tunks is what we call clairvoyant and when in a trance state can seewell you heard her say what she saw miss huxham bella was also sceptical she must have read the first set of papers probably she did since woman is an animal filled with curiosity said durgo goodhumouredly i dont mean to say that granny tunks is entirely genuine there is a good deal of humbug about her as there is about all the romany tribes she may have known about the jewels and even your real fathers name but she did not know about his murder mrs tunks has a small portion of clairvoyant power which does not act at all times when that fails her she resorts to trickery like spiritualists suggested cyril exactly assented the negro with decision in all phenomena connected with the unseen there is a great measure of truth but charlatans spoil the whole business by resorting to trickery when their powers fail and i may say that the spiritual powers do not act always since in a great measure we are ignorant of the laws which govern them but enough of this discussion i do not seek to convince you i shall see mrs tunks this afternoon and gain from her actual proof of vands guilt but i fancied that you believed my father to be guilty said cyril so i did and if he were i would not mind since huxham was a rogue but from what miss faith miss huxham interposed bella hastily until this mystery is cleared up very good well from what miss huxham overheard i am inclined to think that vand murdered the old sailor aided by his wife for what reason you supplied it yourself miss huxham so that they might get his money but what about pences confession said cyril he might have committed the deed himself no he had no reason to kill the old man who was on his side in the matter of the marriage with miss huxham here besides if pence was guilty he certainly would not have composed what he did and assuredly would not have produced the one hundred pounds he stole now that his madness for miss huxham is past pence has behaved like a rational being and will do his best to assist us in solving this mystery durgo paused then turned to the white man cyril lister you put an advertisement into several london papers a week ago yes i did so without telling you as i hoped to surprise you with a letter from my father telling us of his whereabouts how do you know i saw the telegraph yesterday and also the daily mail said durgo nodding approvingly you did well have you had any answer if i had you should have seen it said cyril wrinkling his brows as he always did when he was perplexed what can have become of him durgo struck his large hands together in despair i fear my master edwin lister is dead he said mournfully why asked bella and her lover simultaneously miss huxham you repeated to me that granny tunks in her trance said that the knife lying on the floor when the cripple entered to kill huxham was already bloody cant you see see what that if the knife were already bloody huxham must have killed my master edwin lister and then was killed in turn by vand the cripple cyril looked impatient that is all the black magic rubbish you talk of well then if my master your father is alive and has the jewels why does he not write to me or to you he knows he can trust us both even the advertisements have failed nodurgo looked gloomymy heart misgives me sadly he arose abruptly meet me at the chequers cyril lister and i shall tell you what i learn from mrs tunks cant i come also to see her yes if you like perhaps i shall be able to dispel your disbelief regarding these occult powers which she and i possess is that why mrs tunks calls you master yes she recognised that i had higher powers than she when we first met and so i was enabled to make her get those papers do you think she would have done so unless i had controlled her no not even for the fifty pounds which i am taking to her today she can make a better market out of vand and his wife she knows their guilt but cannot prove their guilt perhaps said the negro indifferently goodday and he departed in his usual abrupt style after bidding cyril meet him at three oclock at the hut of the socalled witch the lovers looked at one another what do you think of it all cyril asked bella timidly i really dont know we seem to be involved in a web through which we cannot break durgo certainly seems to be a very strange being and in spite of my disbelief in the existence of occult powers i am inclined to think that he knows some strange things he looks like a negro and talks and acts like a white man indeed no white man would be so unselfish as to surrender those jewels to you as durgo has done he puzzles me said bella thoughtfully and me also however the best thing to be done will be to leave matters in his hands in one way or another he will learn the truth and then we can get back the jewels and marry do you think your father has the jewels cyril my dear he said frowning i cant be sure now that my father is alive i begin to believe that there may be something in grannys trances after all since she hinted at my fathers death at huxhams hands and terrible as it may seem added lister turning slightly pale with emotion i would rather think that he was dead than live to be called the murderer of jabez huxham i would like to come to you he said folding bella in his strong young arms as the son of a man whose hands are free from blood better for my father to be dead than a criminal the two talked on this matter for some time until their confidences were ended by the entrance of dora hungry for her dinner then cyril took his leave promising to return and tell bella all that took place in mrs tunks hut being anxious the girl made a very poor meal and was scolded by dora who little knew what was at stake but dora supplied one unconscious piece of information which surprised her friend i think mr and mrs vand are going away for a trip she said carelessly what do you mean asked bella starting so violently that she upset the waterjug dora looked surprised my dear you are not so fond of your aunt as to display such emotion i merely say that the vands are going away when where how do you know very soon i believe as they are packing but where they are going i dont know sarah jope the servant whose sister is at the school came flying home last night to her mother with a cock and bull story about a ghost at the manor this morning she went to get her belongings as she insists upon leaving the house she found mrs vand and her husband packing for immediate departure and was bundled out by her indignant mistress boxes and all with a flea in her ear sarah jopes sister told me this just before i came home to dinner the vands going away said bella in dismay this seemed to prove that they were guilty and wished to escape i thought they were going to wait for the harvest home i daresay they will be back in a month and the bleacres corn wont be reaped until then i only wish they would remain away altogether your aunt is a horrid woman bella though her husband is a dear bella did not echo the compliment for after what she had seen on the previous night she was inclined to think that henry vand was the worse of the two evil as his wife might be at all events he was the stronger and rosamund vand was a mere tool in his hands she was on the point of going to cyrils lodgings to warn him and durgo of this projected departure of the manorhouse inhabitants but on reflection she concluded to wait until he returned from mrs tunks hut after all the vands could not leave marshely before nightfall and would have to pass through the village on their way to the fardistant railway station if necessary they could thus be intercepted at the eleventh hour mrs tunks was seated by the fire in her dingy hut absorbed in her own thoughts which she assisted by smoking a dirty black pipe in the next room her grandson still turned and tossed watched by a brighteyed gipsy girl whom the old woman had engaged from a passing family of her kinsfolk but the man no longer raved as the worst of the delirium had passed he was sensible enough but weak and looked the mere shadow of his former stalwart self mrs tunks feared lest he should die and was much disturbed in consequence as he was her sole support without her grandsons earnings she could not hope to keep a roof above her head as her fees for consultations as a wise woman were woefully small she did not dare to make them larger in case her visitors should warn the police of her doings and mrs tunks for obvious reasons did not wish for an interview with dutton the village constable smoking her pipe crouching over the smouldering fire and wondering how she could obtain money the old woman did not hear the door open and shut not until a black hand was laid on her shoulder did she turn to see that durgo was in the hut with cyril behind him paying no attention to the white man she rose and fawned like a dog on the black hes ill master she whimpered clawing durgos rough tweed sleeve and if he goes theres no one to help me give him something to make him well set him on his legs again do you think i can do so asked durgo with a grave smile mrs tunks peered at him with her bleared eyes and struck her skinny hands together i can swear to it master you know much i dont know and i know heaps as the gorgiosmy curse on themwould give their ears to learn come loveyi mean masterhelp me in this and ill help you in other ways such as by telling us who murdered huxham put in cyril injudiciously me deary lor i dont know who killed the poor gentleman and mrs tunks face became perfectly vacant of all expression durgo turned frowning on the white man i said that i would let you come if you did not speak he remarked in a firm whisper you have broken your promise already cyril apologised in low tones i wont say another word he said and took a seat on a broken chair near the window mrs tunks cringed and bent before durgo evidently regarding him with awe as might her sisterwitches the evil one when he appeared at festivals the negro glanced towards the closed door of the other room who is watching your grandson he asked sharply a romany gal as i found that will do i want no listeners call her out and turn her out the old woman entered the other room and soon returned driving before her a blackeyed slip of a child about thirteen years of age this brat protested that tunks was restless and could not be left i shall quieten him said the negro quickly get out you and he fixed so fierce a glance on the small girl that she fled rapidly and cyril saw that the girl was not one easily frightened now to put your grandson to sleep said durgo passing into the next room and cyril saw his great hands hover over the restless man on the bed he made strange passes and spoke strange words while mrs tunks looked on shaking and trembling in two minutes the sick man lay perfectly still and to all appearances was sound asleep durgo returned to the outer room youll cure him master wont you coaxed mrs tunks yes ill cure him if you tell me what you know of this murder i dont know anything master mrs tunks looked obstinate yet terrified durgo stared at her in a mesmeric sort of way and threw out his hand the woman crouched and writhed in evident agony oh deary me im all burnt up and aching and shrivelled cruel dontoh dont ill be good ill be good and she wriggled will you speak said the negro sternly yes yes only take the spell off me dearymaster i mean you feel no pain now said durgo quickly and at once an air of relief passed over mrs tunks withered face she sat down on a stool and folded her clawlike hands on her lap durgo leaned against the fireplace what do you know of this murder he asked i dont know much save what heshe nodded towards the room wherein lay her sleeping grandsonwhat he said when he was mad with the drink get him to speak master and youll learn everything in good time ill make him speak said durgo with impressive quietness now i ask your questions answer do you hear yes master yes i hear i answer said the trembling old creature did you tell the truth in your trance last night mrs tunks looked up with awe he knows everything does the master she breathed softly then replied with haste yes i spoke of what i saw did you see all you spoke of or did you make up some i spoke of what i saw said mrs tunks decidedly and you know master how i saw it i loosened the spirit and it went to look but i dont say but what i didnt know much from what luke raved about so you knew before vand took you to the manorhouse for this trance that he had murdered huxham yes master i did know but i wasnt sure till i saw with the sight lukedurgo nodded towards the inner room in his turnluke knows that vand murdered huxham yes master i believe said granny sinking her voice that he saw the doings through the window of the study he never said naught to me though i wondered where he got so much money to get drunk every day but when he was mad with the drink he talked and talked all the night then i knew that he had got money from mr vand for holding his tongue tell me what he said commanded durgo he raved disjointed like said mrs tunks with great humility but he talked of mr vand coming in when captain huxham was looking at a box of jewels there was a knife on the floor and mr vand stabbed captain huxham with that knife and then dropped it behind the desk was his wife with him no she was in the kitchen was there another man with huxham before vand came luke said nothing of that but he did say added mrs tunks quickly that he was going to america with mr and mrs vand and raved of the good time he would have with them when are they going i dont know master luke didnt say cyril would have interrupted to ask a question about his missing father as he could not understand why durgo had not threshed out that important point but at the first sound of his voice the negro frowned him unto immediate silence when all was quiet durgo looked directly at granny and made passes sleep sleep sleep he said and cyril could see by the working of his face that he was putting out his will to induce a hypnotic condition sleep i say the old woman must have been a marvellously sensitive subject for she leaned against the wallher stool had no backand closed her eyes in apparent deep slumber almost immediately her face was perfectly expressionless and her limbs were absolutely still she lookedas cyril thought with a shudderlike a corpse durgo spoke softly in her ear are you free he asked gently yes said mrs tunks in a faraway faint voice go to the manorhouse i am there enter the door is fast closed said mrs tunks still faintly doors are no bars to you now you can pass through the door there came a short pause i have passed i am inside seek out vand and his wife commanded the negro softly i have found them what are they doing demanded durgo sharply packing boxes came the response without hesitation they talk of going away tonight where to i cant say they dont mention the place but they leave the manorhouse under cover of darkness tonight look for the jewels i have looked where are they in a small portmanteau marked with two initials what are the initials m f oh mrs tunks voice became very weary the mist has come on i can see no more it is not permitted to know more durgo looked disappointed and seemed inclined to force his will but after a frowning pause he waved his hands rapidly and spoke with great sharpness come back he said briefly and after a moment or so the old woman opened her eyes quietly her gaze met the angry one of durgo and she winced have i not pleased you master she asked timidly yes you have pleased me but i wish you could have learned more what did i say asked granny wonderingly never mind heredurgo produced a small canvas bag from his pocketthis is the money you have earned mrs tunks hastily untied the mouth of the bag and poured a glittering stream of gold into her lap fifty sovereigns lovey she mumbled her eyes glowing with avaricious delight thank you master oh thank you in an hour said durgo indifferent to her thanks i shall send you a small bottle containing a draught which you can give to your grandson it will put him right but of course a few days will elapse before he can get quite strong again this placehe glanced disparagingly round the dingy hutis not healthy so i thought master and tonight luke is going to my sisters caravan its on the road outside marshely and the gel can take him there if luke has a month or two of the open road hell soon be himself again anything more i can tell you master no but tonight i am coming here shortly after moonrise get rid of your grandson beforehand if you can what is to be done master never mind do as youre told goodday and durgo beckoning to cyril went out of the hut the white man followed in a state of great amazement how did you manage all that he asked wonderingly hypnotism said durgo shortly you heard that mr and mrs vand intend to fly tonight i have heard yet i cannot believe in that hankypanky durgo shrugged his shoulders and argued no more but when cyril came to his lodgings and found a note from bella stating that she had heard of the vands intention of leaving the manorhouse he disbelieved no longer nay more for on the authority of mrs tunks hypnotic confessions he believed that the vands also possessed the longsoughtfor jewels chapter xxi a desperate attempt when the darkness came on and just as the moon was rising lister and bella proceeded to the plank bridge of the boundary channel before leaving cyril on that afternoon durgo had intimated that he wished miss huxham to meet him at that hour and at that place and of course cyril came also he had every trust in the negro who had proved himself in every way to be a man of sterling worth all the same he did not intend to let durgo meet bella without being present the black man was far too intimate with unseen forces to please the white man and it was necessary to protect bella if necessary he might put you into a hypnotic trance explained cyril who had described all that had taken place i should not let him do that said the girl decidedly cyril shrugged his shoulders durgo might not care if you liked it or not he would hypnotize you if he wished no cyril he could not do that unless i consented my will is my own and it is a strong one i suppose said bella after a pause that he made granny feel those aches and pains by controlling her subjective mind lister glanced sideways at her in surprise you seem to know all about it he declared where did you learn those terms at my school at hampstead there was a girl who could hypnotise people she read all manner of books about hypnotism and talked about the subjective mind although i dont know what it is i can understand so much of durgos power over granny but that sending her spirit to the manor is strange i dont believe that he did he must have done so insisted cyril as durgo did not know that the vands were leaving and granny distinctly stated that they were in my hearing also if we find that the jewels are in the small portmanteau marked with the initials m f we can be certain that her spirit really did travel m f repeated bella dreamily those are my fathers initials maxwell faith so they are humph there is something in this business after all bella but do you really think anyone can separate the spirit from the body lister reflected i dont see why not after all as st paul says we are composed of spirit soul and body so in certain cases the one may become detached from the other i rememberhe looked thoughtfully up to the cloudy skyi remember reading in some magazine of a boatload of people being saved owing to one of them transferring his spirit to a passing ship and leaving written instructions in the cabin where the ship was to steer to oh cyril thats impossible my dear he said drily you can see the log of that very ship containing an account of the incident at somerset house however we have no time to discuss these matters further yonder is durgo by the bridge i want to know why he asked you to meet him here such a night toocyril shiveredquite a change i feel cold so do i it will rain cyril look at that heavy bank of clouds behind which the moon is hiding and oh how dark it is it certainly was dark and the two came very near durgo before they saw him the sky was heavy with gloomy clouds and undoubtedly there promised to be rain before midnight durgo wrapped in a heavy military cloak stood sentinel by the plank bridge when the lovers came up he led them across to the other side and when they stood on bleacres he used his great strength to rip up a couple of planks there said the negro flinging these into the standing corn they will not be able to get their boxes across even if they can cross themselves are you talking of the vands asked bella quickly yes they are still at the manorhouse look he pointed through the gloom and they saw two or three windows of the old house lighted up brilliantly across other windows occasionally flitted more lights apparently mrs vand was anxiously trying to impress the neighbours at least such as might be abroad on this nightthat she and her husband were ostentatiously at home durgo laughed grimly they have quite an eye for dramatic effect he said in his guttural voice and very contemptuously well they shall have all the drama they want tonight and more durgo bella spoke in an alarmed tone you wont hurt them not if i can help it cyril interposed imperiously i shall not be a party to the breaking of the law he said with sharpness nor will i allow bella to cyril lister interrupted the negro turning on him and addressing him by his full name as was his odd way if i could bring the police on the scene i would do so but you know as i do that we have no proofs save those of the unseen which would not be accepted in a court of law to prove that the two are guilty of murderof a double murder for all i know a double murder echoed bella drawing closer to her lover yes edwin lister my master has disappeared and huxham is dead the old sailor certainly may have killed my master but on the other hand as i believe vand murdered huxham and probably murdered edwin lister also howsoever this may be we can prove neither murder so it is not advisable to bring the police into the matter it would be safer said cyril uneasily he feared lest durgos barbaric instincts should be aroused against the couple at the manorhouse it would not be safer retorted the negro while the police were debating and searching the vands would be getting out of the kingdom and we could not stop them besides they have the jewels i am certain of that from what granny tunks saw when i loosened her spirit once the vands got news of the police being on their track they would hide those jewels and we should never find them i want those jewels for you miss huxham as before i leave england i wish to see you happily married to cyril lister here it is the least that i can do for his fathers son but if my father is alive and has the jewels asked cyril doubtfully that will make a difference assented durgo although i daresay that edwin lister will not mind returning the jewels we can arrange our funds for the expedition in another way but i fear he added in gloomy tones that my master is dead if so i can only avenge him but with your occult powers cant you learn if my father is dead or alive no said durgo very decidedly you forget that on the side of the unseen are mighty powers who have to be obeyed i can do much but not all and for some reason i am not permitted to know the truth about my master sooner or later i shall understand about this what we have to do at the present time is to prevent the vands from escaping will you both help yes said bella anticipating cyril that is if you dont intend violence be comforted said durgo ironically be comforted missy i have no wish to put a rope round my neck i simply mean to force these devils to give up the jewels and to solve so much of this mystery as they know when i regain the jewels and know what has become of my master i shall let them go or if you like i shall hand them over to the police but time presses added durgo impatiently and at any time the two may come along on their way to freedom will you help yes said cyril simply what do you want us to do missydurgo turned to the girlcan you work that searchlight bella nodded for an evenings amusement my fatheri mean captain huxhamonce showed me how to manipulate it well it is in good order as we know that vand used it last night you can get into the house by the secret passage and watch for the going out of our two friends then turn on the searchlight and use it as a pointer i can use the searchlight and i daresay it is in order since henry vand used it last night said bella quickly also i can get to the upper part of the house and on to the roof through a kind of well which runs from the lower to the higher secret passage but what do you mean by my using the light as a pointer direct the ray on to vand and his wife they may come down this path or they may try and escape in another way but if you bend the ray of the searchlight to where they are ill be able to catch them use the ray as a finger as it were bella nodded i see and where will you be i shall hide in the corn somewhere or another explained durgo i dont know where as i cant be sure how vand and his wife intend to escape they may take the boat suggested cyril and that is tied up some distance yonder i believe they will use the boat no said durgo shaking his head there is no place where they can row to as this channel ends in mere swamps all i can do is to walk here and there and watch for the finger of the searchlight what am i to do asked cyril anxiously go with bella no you wait in mrs tunks hut i daresay she is alone as i asked her to send her grandson away to his gipsy caravan before i came i shall walk down with you while miss huxham goes to the manorhouse i would rather go with bella objected the young man uneasily i am quite safe said bella determinedly and if you came cyril there would be no room for us both in that narrow secret passage i shall go by myself have no fear for me dearest one moment said durgo as she was moving away since you think that i may use violence i may tell you to quieten your minds that the police are coming after all when did you tell the police to come i thought you said yes yes interrupted the negro impatiently i know what i said but i saw inspector inglis the other day when i went to pierside and informed him of my suspicions i wired him today asking him to be with three or four men on the bank of the boundary channel opposite to granny tunks hut at what time about eleven as i dont suppose that the vands will try and escape until everyone in marshely is asleep did you tell inglis about the jewels asked cyril no there is no need to tell more than is necessary besides the police might take possession of the jewels and i want them for miss huxham all inglis knows is that i suspect the vands of a double murder and that they intend to fly he will come with his constables to arrest them if there is sufficient evidence but i say durgo i wanted you to do as you say some time ago and you talked of it not being advisable to bring the police into the matter it seems that you have done so it is a fact said durgo drily i didnt wish to tell you all my plans at once as you and miss huxham here seemed to be so certain that i intended blue murder if you had not been ready to trust me i should not have changed my mind or have told you about the presence of the police you look on me as a barbarous black man we look on you as a very good friend said bella quickly for the negro seemed hurt by their suspicions there there said durgo gruffly but bowing to the compliment go to the manorhouse miss huxham and do what you can goodbye cyril said bella the young man ran after her as she moved up the corn path dont go without a kiss bella he said catching her in his arms god keep you my darling and bring us safely through this dark business im not afraid now that i know inspector inglis and his men will be on the spot whispered bella goodbye and goodbye and goodbye and she kissed him between each word in a few minutes she was swallowed up in the gloom which was growing denser every minute there will be a storm prophesied durgo as the two men proceeded side by side to mrs tunks hut hark just as he spoke there came a deep hoarse roll of thunder as though the artillery of heaven was being prepared to bombard the guilty pair in the old manorhouse durgo with the instinct of a wild animal raised his nose and sniffed i smell the rain glory look at the lightning a vivid flash of forked lightning zigzagged across the violenthued sky and again came the crash of thunder already the wind was rising and the vast fields of corn were rustling and sighing and bending under its chill breath it is going to be a fierce night said durgo dilating his nostrils to breathe the freshness of the air do you remember in macbeth cyril lister of the night of duncans murder and he quoted in his deep voice but this sore night hath trifled former knowings cyril looked at the strong black face which showed clearly in the frequent flashes of lightning you are a strange man durgo one would think that you were almost he hesitated a white man finished durgo coolly no my friend i am an educated black man and an ingrained savage he spoke mockingly then flung back his military cloak look would a man be like this in your sober england cyril uttered an ejaculation and had every reason to in the bluish flare of the lightning he saw that durgo had stripped himself to a loincloth and that his powerful body was glistening with oil the sole civilised things about him were canvas runningshoes which he wore and the cloak why have you stripped to the buff asked cyril astonished i may have hard work to catch those two this night said durgo replacing his cloak which made him look quite respectable so i wish to run as easily as possible but there was no need to strip the police wont be stripped its my way and was the way of my fathers before me in africa but not in england pooh was all that durgo answered and the two trudged along bowing their heads against the now furiously driving wind shortly they came to mrs tunks hut and the door was opened by the old woman herself i felt that you were coming master she said nodding enter no said durgo pausing on the threshold of the illsmelling room i have to go back to my post and watch for the coming of the vands mr lister will remain here has your grandson gone no loveyi mean master said granny coaxingly hes ever so much better for the medicine you gave him and is quite his own self but ive sent the gel to get a boat to take him to the caravan theyve moved it down the channel to a meadow near the high road the gel will bring the boat up here in an hour or so and take luke back with her then hell go on the merry road with her and my sister you should have sent luke away before said durgo frowning for he knew all about the murder and has blackmailed the vands inglis and his constables will be on the opposite bank to this place soon and they may arrest him i shant say more than i can help but get him away as soon as you can yes master yes deary yes lovey croaked the old woman and durgo with a significant glance at her and a nod to cyril turned away into the gloom wont you come in lovey asked mrs tunks coaxingly no said cyril who did not relish the malodorous hut ill stay here and watch for the signal what signal demanded the witch wife never mind go in commanded lister and settled himself under the eaves of the hut to keep guard granny scowled at him as she obeyed she did not mind cringing to durgo who was her master in the black art but she objected to cyril ordering her about had granny really possessed the powers she laid claim to she would have blighted his fresh youth on the spot as it was she simply muttered a curse on what she regarded as his impertinence and went indoors cyril lighted his pipe and kept his eyes on the distant mass of the manorhouse which was revealed blackly when the lightning flashed across the ocean of grain tore the furious wind making it rock like an unquiet sea flash after flash darted across the livid sky and every now and then came the sudden boom of the thunder hour upon hour passed until the watcher almost lost count of time within the cottage all was quiet although at intervals he could hear the querulous voice of mrs tunks shrilly scolding the romany girl lister began to grow impatient as he dreaded lest bella should have fallen into the clutches of the vands who would certainly show her no mercy it was in his mind to leave his post and see for himself what had occurred suddenly a long clear beam smote through the darkness of the night and he sprang to his feet they have left the house muttered cyril thrusting his pipe into his pocket whats to be done now the lightning was not quite so frequent so the vivid beam of the searchlight had full and fair play but as the lightning ceased and the thunder became silent a deluge of rain descended on the thirsty earth on its strong wings the wind brought the rain and a tropical downpour almost blotted out the haggard moon which now showed herself between driving clouds but through the steady beam of the searchlight could be seen the straight arrows of the rain and the vast cornfields hissed as the heavy drops descended here and there swung the ray of light evidently looking for the fugitives but as it did not come to rest cyril guessed that bella had not yet descried the flying couple but the rain was so incessant and the wind so strong that he was angered to think how bella on the high altitude of the quarter deck was exposed to its fury suddenly as sometimes happens in furious storms there came a lull both in the wind and the rain a perfect silence ensued and cyril straining his ears heard the soft dip of oars as he peered towards the black gulf of the waterway running past the hut the ray from the manorhouse became steady and the finger of light pointed straight to the boundary channel cyril heard a wild shriek and ran down to the bank coming along the stream he saw a light boat and in it mrs vand huddled up at the end in her shawl vand himself was rowing with great care but when the beam revealed their doings he lost all caution and rowed with desperation again came a drench of rain almost blotting out the landscape but the ray of light still picked out the guilty couple following the course of the boat steadily like an avenging angels sword row henry row hard shrieked mrs vand crouching in the stern of the boat and steering down the narrow channel as best she could well soon be safe row hard dear row hard stop cried cyril from the bank mrs vand you must wait here until the police come stop the police yelled the terrified woman and her face was pearly white in the brilliant searchlight row henry dont stop lister whipped out a revolver with which he had been careful to provide himself if you dont stop vand i shall shoot and he levelled it but the cripple was too desperate to obey he bent again to the oars and brought the shallop sweeping right under cyrils feet then before the young man could conjecture what he intended to do he stood up in the rocking boat and swung up an oar with the evident intention of striking the man with the revolver into the water lister dodged skilfully as the oar came crashing viciously past his ear and fired at random mrs vand shrieked her husband cursed as the shot rang out there came an answering cry from the near distance and into the glare of the searchlight bounded durgo naked save for his loincloth black as the pit and furious as the devil who lives therein showing his white teeth like those of a wild animal he raced up to the boat and without a moments hesitation flung himself on the figure of vand as he stood up the next moment the light craft was overturned and durgo with the vands was struggling in the water at the same moment the beam of the searchlight suddenly vanished leaving everyone in complete darkness and the rain driven by the triumphant wind deluged the fields chapter xxii mrs vands repentance afterwards cyril when questioned could never clearly recollect what took place vands oar had missed his head but had struck his right shoulder with considerable force so that his revolver shot had gone wide of its intended mark when bella shut off the beamand cyril wondered at the time why she did soeverything was dark and confused what with the gloom the rain and curses from vand and durgo who were struggling in the water and the shrieks of mrs tunks added to those of the halfdrowned woman cyril felt his head whirl also the blow from the oar had confused him and he became sick and faint for the moment granny tunks with commendable forethought had brought out a bullseye lantern which she must have stolen from some policeman flashing this on to the waterway its light revealed durgo and the cripple locked in a deadly embrace and mrs vand clinging to the bank with one hand while she clutched her shawl with the other cyril thereupon plunged down the incline and dragged the wretched woman out thinking she was about to be arrested she fought like a wild cat and would have forced the halfdazed young man into the water again but that mrs tunks brought a chunk of wood with considerable force down on her head what the devil did you do that for gasped cyril furiously youve killed her you old fool what do i care deary cried granny shrilly id kill them both if i could for the master wants them killed curse them both and she tottered down to the boundary channel while cyril carried the inanimate form of mrs vand into the hut here he laid her on the floor and hastily bidding the romany girl attend her hurried out again theyre dead both of them oh the masters dead yelled granny tunks with the lantern raised she stood on the bank peering into the water but there was scarcely enough light to see what was taking place all sounds had ceased however and only the drench of the rain could be heard but even as granny spoke the romany girl anxious to see what was taking place darted out of the cottage with a kind of torch consisting of tow at the end of a stick steeped in kerosene this flared redly and flung a crimson glare on the waterways and flung also its scarlet light on the bodies of durgo and the cripple these lay halfin and halfout of the water fast locked together in a death grip there was no wound apparent on either body so cyril conjectured that in the struggle both had been drowned durgos mighty arms were clasped tightly around the slender body of the cripple but vands lean hands were clutching the negros throat with fierce resolution both were quite dead and even in death cyril although he tried could not drag them apart that so delicate a man as vand could have contrived to drown the powerful negro seemed incredible to cyril but he soon saw that to kill durgo the cripple had been willing to sacrifice himself probably he had dragged durgo under water and having a grip on the mans throat had squeezed the life out of him with a madmans despairing force the weak had confounded the strong on this occasion in a most pronounced manner meanwhile granny tunks was bewailing the loss of her master and the sharpfeatured romany girl echoed her cries the screams of both brought out luke who appeared at the firelighted door of the hut looking much better than cyril expected him to be seeing how severe had been his last illness he had something in his hands and in the flaring light of the torch lister saw that it was a somewhat small black bag in a moment the young man guessed that luke tunks had been robbing the unconscious mrs vand as he remembered that she had kept a close grip of something under her shawl even while she was struggling with him the jewels cried cyril too excited to be cautious and leaped for the gipsy give me the jewels theyre mine blast you growled luke trying to evade him missus gave em to me leave me alone granny help me mrs tunks ran to the rescue for the mention of jewels stirred her avaricious blood like the call of a trumpet but already cyril had plucked the black bag from the still weak gipsy and luke was not strong enough yet to make a fight for it aided vigorously by the romany girl the old woman would have closed in but that a shout from the opposite bank made all turn a dozen bullseyes were flashing over the stream cyril gripping the bag dashed the woman and the man aside and sprang to the verge of the channel is that you inspector inglis he shouted yes who are you came the sharp official tones cyril lister come over yourself or send some men vand and durgo the negro are dead there was a confused muttering of surprise amongst the constables then came ingliss cleancut speech we heard a shot is no durgo struggled with vand in the waterway and they were both drowned these gipsies here are making trouble and mrs vand is unconscious in the hut come across and take charge how the devil can we get across here demanded inglis its twenty feet of water here you men go round by the bridge its broken down yelled cyril who broke it durgo let go you old devil and cyril swung granny tunks aside the woman was still trying to clutch the jewels inglis youll have to swim across theres no other way no sooner had lister suggested this expedient than inglis obeyed it with the promptitude of an englishman several heavy bodies were heard plunging into the water and the bullseye lanterns were seen approaching like moving glowworms as their swimming owners held them above their several heads had granny tunks been strong enough she would have attempted to prevent the landing of this hostile force but luke was useless and the romany girl still more so all she could do was to enter the fortress of her hut and bar the door which she accordingly did while luke mindful that he might be arrested for the murders as an accomplice after the fact slunk hastily into the standing corn shortly cyril was shaking hands with a dripping police inspector and surrounded by six dripping constables as the half dozen men and their officer were already wetted to the bone by incessant rain the plunge into the channel did not trouble them in the least indeed they looked as though they rather enjoyed the adventure but we may as well get under shelter to hear your story suggested inglis and knocked loudly at the door of the hut as granny would not open he simply turned to his men and gave a sharp order break it down said inglis and in less than a minute the constables were marching into the small apartment over the fallen door ill have the law on you for this screeched mrs tunks shaking her fist youll get a stomachfull of law i have no doubt before i have done with you retorted inglis who is this and he stared at the inanimate form on the earthen floor amidst pools of water vands wife who was trying to escape with him said cyril she is insensible from a blow this old demon gave her shed have had you in the water else hissed mrs tunks scornfully it wasnt unlikely seeing how she fought have you any brandy a trifle for my spasms admitted granny sullenly then bring it out and revive mrs vand said inglis impatiently it will be necessary for me to question her mr listerhe brought his mouth very close to the young mans ear and spoke in a whisperis what that nigger told me quite true about vand murdering huxham i believe it is but i cant be sure i got these however from mrs vand dont let the old hag come near or shell try and loot them loot what demanded inglis on seeing cyril open the black bag after he had motioned the constables to surround the table oh by jupiter his surprised ejaculations were echoed by his men for lister emptied on the table many glittering stones cut and uncut chiefly they were diamonds but also could be seen sapphires rubies pearls and emeralds all glowing with rainbow splendour in the fierce radiance of the bullseye lanterns mrs tunks whimpered like a beaten dog when she saw what she had missed and tried to dart under a policemans arm no you dont said the man gruffly and gripped her lean wrist as her hand stretched greedily over the flaming heap of gems whose are these asked the inspector quite awed by this wealth miss huxhams said cyril making a ready excuse until such time as the matter could be looked into for he did not wish inglis to take possession of bellas fortune her father left her these and the house to mrs vand but the woman withheld the jewels from her niece and tried tonight to bolt with them then luke tunks attempted to steal them from her while she lay unconscious here luckily i was enabled to rescue them and now i can restore them to miss huxham where is luke tunks asked the inspector while cyril packed the gems in a chamois leather bag which he found in what granny had called in her trance the portmanteau gone where you wont get him grunted mrs tunks who was holding a glass of brandy to mrs vands white lips you must get him inglis said cyril insistently he knows all about the murder of huxham and has been blackmailing the vands so that nigger said by the way we must see to the bodies inglis turned to the door then looked back at lister i wish i knew what this all meant sir he remarked much puzzled you shall know everything in due time and a very queer story it is the inspector might have gone on asking questions but at that moment bella huxham breathless and wet appeared in the doorway in the semidarkness she could scarcely see her lover and called him cyril cyril what has happened she panted i have run all the way andwho are these inspector inglis and constables said that officer where have you come from miss from the manorhouse i went to see my aunt and saw her run away with her husband where is she where is he there is mrs vand said cyril pointing to the still insensible woman and her husband is dead in durgos arms bella shrieked is durgo dead yes unfortunately vand clutched his throat and dragged him under but so weak a man he sacrificed his own life to kill durgo said cyril whats to be done now inspector inglis acted promptly one of my men can stay here to look after the old woman he said officially and the rest can help me to take the bodies of vand and the nigger back to the manorhouse we must take possession of that place until everything is made clear at the inquest what will you do miss huxham better get home this is no place for a lady i must stay and revive my aunt said bella who already was bending over the woman and had the glass of brandy in her hand good said inglis motioning his men to file out ill come back and question her when you get her right again mr lister with your permission mr inspector ill wait here with miss huxham said cyril significantly i dont trust these two womenhe looked at granny and the romany girlalso luke tunks might be lurking about if miss huxham were left here alone his shrug completed the sentence dutton will keep guard at the door said inglis selecting the village constable a freshfaced powerful young man and if these women try any games he can take them in charge also duttonhe turned to the man who had already posted himself as directedyou can hold luke tunks should he turn up i want to question him also after which orders inglis with a nod went out cyril followed the bodies were duly found and the inspector uttered an exclamation of surprise when he saw that durgo was nude what does this mean mean said cyril who looked over his shoulder simply that durgo in spite of his oxford training was a savage at heart he arranged a trap to catch the vands and stripped so as to be prepared for any emergency rum notion said inglis who looked puzzled but what had he to do with all this murder business he was my fathers friend explained lister and he stopped on seeing the eager faces around him adding in lower tones what i have to explain is for your own ear in the first instance inspector inglis looked grave and even suspicious there seems to be much to explain mr lister he said seriously however you can stay here i shall take the bodies to the manorhouse and thoroughly search the place when i return i hope to hear your story and to examine mrs vand it seems to me added the officer as he turned away that the mystery of the huxham murder is about to be solved at last i think so myself assented lister soberly and after seeing the six men take up their burden of the dead he returned to the hut in silence here he found mrs vand pale but composed sitting up on the floor with her back propped up against the wall granny tunks looking very sulky was on her hunkers before the fire smoking her cutty pipe and the romany girl could be seen lying on lukes vacated bed in the inner room only bella was attending to the woman she had called aunt for so long and who had so persecuted her she was urging mrs vand to speak out you must tell the truth now said bella for the police will arrest you mrs vand could not grow paler for she was already whiter than any corpse but a terrified look came into her eyes youll be glad of that bella no said the girl earnestly i am not glad to see you suffer you have been cruel to me and i thought that i should like to see you punished but now that you have lost your husband and are so miserable i am very sorry and both cyril and i will do our best to help you tell all you know aunt rosamund and perhaps you will not be arrested if i tell all i know i am sure to be arrested said mrs vand sullenly but surely you did not murder your own brother no i didnt badly as jabez treated me i did not kill him although i dont deny that i wished for his death well he is dead and i got his money and now she buried her shameful face in her hands wailinglyoh my poor dear henry i have lost him and lost all as to youshe suddenly lifted up her head to glare furiously at cyril who was leaning against the doorpost a few yards from the watching policemanyou have been the evil genius of us all where are my jewels they are in this bag said lister holding it up and they belong to bella jabez left everything to me began mrs vand when cyril interrupted these jewels were not his to leave they were the property of maxwell faith who was a trader and i know all about that said mrs vand cutting him short and bella is his daughter you were going to say yes therefore the jewels are her property who told you of luke tunks told me thats a lie snarled granny from her stool near the fire its the truth gasped mrs vand taking another sip of the brandy which bella held to her lips luke was dodging round the house on the night of the murder and peeped in at the study window he overheard the interview between jabez and edwin lister what cyril took a step forward in sheer surprise you know my fathers name also i know much but not all said mrs vand in a stronger voice for the spirit was taking effect for instance i dont know what became of edwin lister but luke does then luke shall be arrested and questioned he shant muttered granny venomously lukes escapeda clever boy bella put her arm round mrs vand to render her more comfortable how much did luke tell you she asked softly only so much as cheated ushenry and iinto paying him money oh said cyril quietly so that is why luke got so drunk he spent his money in drink said mrs vand indifferently we paid him a good deal he never would have left us and intended to go to america with us tonight as he knew too much for our safety how did you intend to escape asked cyril sharply we intended to row down the channel to the swamps that is why henry got the boat a few weeks ago then we intended to cut across the marshes to the high road where a motorcar hired by henry awaited us it would have taken us to london and there we could have concealed ourselves until a chance came to get to the states everything was cut and dried but you no said lister seriously it was not i who stopped you but durgo that negro then i am glad he is dead cried mrs vand who was getting more her old self every minute however its all done with now you have the jewels henry is dead and i dont care what becomes of me but who murdered my father asked bella earnestly jabez wasnt your father maxwell faith was your father for luke overheard edwin lister say as much to jabez and what became of edwin lister i dont know luke never told me that all he said was that he saw and heard the two talking then he left the window and only returned to see henry stab my brother oh cyril and bella both uttered ejaculations of horror yes you may say oh as much as you like but its true said mrs vand with great doggedness henry came with me to the manorhouse on that night at ten oclock he did not stop at the boundary channel as he declared he only said that to save himself but he came with me and we saw my brother who was in his study we confessed that we were married and then jabez grew angry and said he would turn me as a pauper out of the house next morning he drove henry and myself out of the room i fainted in the kitchen and when i came to myself henry was bending over me very pale he said he had killed jabez with a knife which he found on the floor i had seen the knife before when we were telling jabez about our marriage but in the excitement i didnt pick it up was there blood on the knife asked cyril remembering granny tunks trance as reported by bella i cant say i dont know i was too flurried to think about the matter all i know is that henry killed jabez with that knife which jabez brought from nigeria and then dropped it behind the desk what took place exactly asked cyril hastily while bella closed her eyes ask luke ask luke said mrs vand testily he knows all and she refused to say another word chapter xxiii what luke tunks saw as mrs vand obstinately refused to speak there was little use for bella to remain in the hut the girl was sick and faint with all she had gone through and wished to get home to rest cyril also was anxious to follow inglis and his officers to the manorhouse to see what had been discovered likely to prove the truth of mrs vands statements but before going bella made a last attempt to induce her presumed aunt to confess all in detail its your sole chance of getting out of this trouble said bella who was now sorry to see her enemy brought so low i dont care if i get out of the trouble or if i do not said mrs vand wearily henry is dead just as we were on the eve of happiness so i dont much care what becomes of me could you have been happy in america knowing your husband to be a murderer asked cyril skeptically certainly returned the woman with great composure i knew all along that henry had struck the blow but i daresay jabez goaded him into doing so as poor henry was so good and weak weak echoed cyril remembering all he was not very weak to kill an active man like captain huxham and a strong negro such as durgo was ah said mrs vand exultingly and contradicting herself in a truly feminine way henry was a mannone of your weaklings if we had only escaped with thoseshe stared hard at the black bag which contained the jewelsbut its no use fretting now everything is at an end and bella is glad no i am not aunt rosamund i am not your aunt i dont wish to be your aunt all the same i am very sorry for you said bella with the tears in her eyes and if i can do anything to help you let me know goodbye aunt and may god watch over you she bent and kissed the lined forehead dont you believe that i killed jabez faltered mrs vand somewhat touched no said bella quietly i believe what you say henry killed captain huxham and like a true wife you held your tongue to save him i should have done exactly the same had cyril been guilty youre a good girl bella im sorry i was so hard on you i dont suppose theres much happiness left me in this life now that henry is dead but i shall repay you for those kind words there there dont kiss me again i have been mistaken in you goodbye and mrs vand lying down on the floor in an utter state of despair turned her face to the wall bella had to leave her in this unsatisfactory condition as there was no chance of taking her home to miss ankers cottage dutton still watched by the door and probably had overheard all that she had confessed even though she had not been so explicit as she should have been but she had detailed quite sufficient to ensure her arrest as an accomplice after the fact so it was not likely that dutton would permit her to leave the hut until he received orders from his superior under the circumstances there was nothing to be done but for the young people to go which they accordingly did granny tunks flung a curse after them as they passed out into the night and flung also a burning sod to emphasise the curse old devil said cyril comforting bella who was crying dutton lend me your lantern as the path along the channel is dangerous dutton having received five shillings made no objection to this provided he got back his bullseye later in the night cyril promised to return it when he came back to the hut with inglis and then taking bellas arm he led her carefully along the slippery path the storm had passed and the wind had dropped but the clouds were still thick enough to envelope the earth in murky darkness they picked their footsteps carefully until they came to the foot of the cornpath here they halted how are we to get across cyril asked the girl shivering lister groped in the corn wherein durgo had flung the planks and soon recovered these with the aid of bella he fixed them again on the tressels sunk in the mud and the two passed dryshod over the channel in walking to marshely the young man gave bella the bag take this dear he said the jewels are in it be careful of them oh cyril said the girl awestruck did mrs vand steal them yes and in spite of what she says i believe she and henry murdered your fatheri mean captain huxhamfor the sake of the jewels they were in this bag marked with the initials m fyour fathers initials just as granny saw it in her trance very nearly only she called the bagand it is a bag as you seea portmanteau either granny or the unseen are at fault but it matters little since the jewels are now in your possession keep them carefully but cyril said bella as they drew near the cottage does it seem right for us to keep jewels that already have caused two murders my father was killed because of these gems by captain huxham and he met with the same fate for probably the same reason i daresay in ages past many and many a wicked deed has been committed for the sake of these jewels do you remember what you heard granny say in her trancethat a roman empress had secured the jewels by crime my dear girl all jewels have a history more or less and if one feared the sort of thing you mention not a woman would wear jewels no dear god has given you this fortune and you have every right to make use of it heres the door and by the light in the window i see that miss ankers is sitting up i promised to tell her why i went out said bella kissing her lover so as she is our good friend she must know all just as you please tell her everything from the beginning i have to tell inspector inglis what i know shortly will you tell him about your father asked bella faintly lister hesitated i must he said at length with a mighty effort for if i do not luke tunks may be caught and he will tell tell what i dont know god only knows what happened when luke peeped through that window from the presence of the bloody knife on the floor and the fact that vand murdered huxham i am inclined to believe that huxham stabbed my father with that knife bella caught his sleeve if so where did captain huxham hide the body cyril removed her arm gently although he shivered we have had enough of these horrors for one night dear he said kissing her go inside and talk to miss ankers tomorrow ill come and see you what are you about to do cyril i am returning to the manorhouse and then shall go to grannys hut with inglis there must be an end to all this mystery tonight bellahe turned suddenlyif it is proved that my father is alive will you still marry me think of the disgrace he has brought on me why in any case your father didnt murder captain huxham no his hands are free from blood in that respect but this case will have to be thoroughly inquired into and much about my father may come out his doings were shady as i told you i had to borrow one thousand pounds to buy back a cheque for that amount which he had forged in the name of an old college friend then theres the gunrunning in nigeria and all manner of doubtful means by which he made his money bella if you marry me you marry a man with a soiled name her arms were round him on the instant you have not soiled it she whispered and that is enough for me cyrils lips met hers in a passionate kiss and glowing with happiness she ran into doras little garden as the door opened miss ankers hearing voices at this late hourfor it was nearly midnightwas looking out to see what was the matter cyril watched her admit bella and then turned away with a sigh he intended to confess much about his father to inglis which he would much rather have kept concealed but under the circumstances there was no other way of settling matters since the tragic death of captain huxham these had been in a very bad way very shortly the young man arrived at the manorhouse and found a constable on guard at the door but he was admitted the moment the man recognised him it appeared that inglis had been expecting him for some time lister walked into the study wherein the inspector had established himself and explained that he had been escorting miss huxham home the poor girl is quite worn out said cyril seating himself with an air of relief for he also was extremely tired no wonder replied the inspector is dutton on guard yes mrs vand and the old woman and the girl are all safe i have sent along another man said inglis nodding so that there may be no chance of the three escaping the house was locked up when we came here mr lister and only by breaking a window could we enter look at this sirand the inspector pointed to a small lozengepane in the casement which had been broken well said cyril after a pause through that broken pane luke tunks saw everything which took place in this study on the night of the murder cyril felt his hair rise and he thought of his fathers probable danger but he calmed down on reflecting that at least edwin lister was not guilty of the frightful crime how do you know he gasped with difficulty we have caught luke and he will be here in a moment or so to confess cyril looked surprised how did you catch him he ran out of the hut when we crossed the channel and concealed himself in the corn then remembering that the manorhouse was deserted he fetched a circle round the fields and came here when we got into the house we found him nearly crazy with fear he took us for ghosts where is he now in the kitchen guarded by a couple of men he refused to confess and i gave him an hour to make up his mind meanwhile we have searched the house and have found that everything valuable more or less is gone some things left behind have been packed in boxes i suppose the vands hoped to escape and then get their goods later but they carried off what they could they intended to go to america said cyril the woman explained she also declared that her husband murdered captain huxham i expect she had a hand in it herself she denies that she naturally would said inglis very drily however ill send for luke tunks and see if he is willing to confess and he gave a sharp order to one of the constables who was lounging in the hall in a few minutes the tall lean gipsy who looked extremely ill and extremely defiant made his appearance at the door held by two policemen bring him in said the inspector calmly and arranging some sheets of paper which he took out of his pocket along with a stylograph pen now then my man will you confess all that you saw if i do what will happen governor asked tunks hoarsely you may get a lighter sentence will i be arrested you are arrested now and shortly you will be lodged in gaol then i shant say anything growled luke defiantly and folding his arms he leaned against the panelled wall very good said inglis serenely take him away in the morning he can be removed to the pierside goal the two constables advanced and luke bit his lip in any case he saw that things looked black against him you have no right to arrest me he declared on what charge do you arrest me on a charge of murdering captain jabez huxham i didnt i can prove i didnt you can do so in court and to a judge and jury take him away no no ill tell you all i know now said luke making the best of a bad job and being imaginative enough to both see and feel a visionary rope encircling his neck let me tell now governor this was exactly what inglis wanted as he desired to obtain all available evidence for the forthcoming inquest on the bodies of the dead men black and white but he pretended to grant the mans wish as a favour as you please he said with a cool shrug you two men can go outside and remain on guard on the other side of the door the constables did as they were ordered and closed the door inglis lister and luke tunks were alone and as the gipsy was still weak from his late illness the inspector signed that he could take a seat now tell me all you know and i shall take it down you shall affix your name to your confession and mr lister and myself will be the witnesses do you agree yes said luke hoarsely and drawing his sleeve across his mouth for nothing i can say can hang me i didnt kill either of the blokes either of the blokes what do you mean i mean that captain huxham killed the man who called himself lister and henry vand killed captain huxham i saw both murders lister rejoiced horrified as he was at the idea of his fathers violent death but thankful from the bottom of his heart that he had gone to his own place guiltless of blood inglis saw the expression on the young mans face and asked a leading question was not this mr lister your father yes answered cyril promptly he came home from nigeria some months ago with durgo who is the son of a friendly chief my father i understand came down here to ask captain huxham for certain jewels those you showed me sir yes they were robbed from a trader called maxwell faith by huxham and my father wished to get them durgo came down to seek for my father but we have never been able to find him he is dead said luke abruptly so you say but where is the body i dont know i cant say luke paused then turned to the inspector let me tell you what i saw through yonder broken pane very good inglis arranged his papers and prepared his pen mind you speak the truth as i shall take down every word you say afterwards mr lister can tell me what he knows so it was arranged and tunks as ready to tell now as formerly he was unwilling launched out into his story it appears that after leaving mrs coppersleyas she was thenhe went home to have some food shortly before eight oclock he strolled along the banks of the river and saw pence watching the house knowing that the preacher was in love with the daughter of his master he took little notice then while lying in the corn by the side of the path smoking he saw as he thought cyril lister pass him and stealthily followed why did you do that asked inglis raising his eyes i knew that this genthe nodded towards cyrilwas in love with miss bella also and knew that captain huxham hated him why did he hate him i can tell you said cyril quickly because of my father huxham knew my father in nigeria and as my father wished to get these jewels he feared lest he should force him to give them up for this reason huxham came down here and planted corn all round his house as a means of defence and installed a searchlight he wished to be on his guard did your father intend murder asked the inspector sharply i really cant say but he did struck in luke who had been listening earnestly all that the young gent says is true sir i only followed as i thought that there would be a row between captain huxham andas i thoughtmr cyril i waited outside the house and then hearing loud voices in the studyin this place said tunks looking round i stole to the casement and peeped through that broken pane they did not know that i was there what became of mr pence meanwhile asked inglis suddenly he was watching the house but i think he went away and then came back inglis nodded that is unsatisfactory i must examine mr pence later you go on tunks and tell us exactly what you saw tunks settled down to his narrative i listened and heard all about the jewels and the death of maxwell faith and all about miss bella being his daughter i saw by this time that mr lister was not mr cyril here and i guessed from his likeness that he was mr cyrils father mr lister wanted captain huxham to give up the jewels for some expedition but the captain refused they began to quarrel and then the captain pulled out a big knife from a drawer of his desk and rushed on mr lister there was a struggle and mr lister tried to pull out a revolver at length huxham got mr lister down and cut his throat which would account for the quantity of blood found on the floor here when huxhams body was found i thought there was too much blood for one mans corpse to supply go on oh its terriblehorrible said cyril covering his face what did you do tunks why didnt you give the alarm what and be run in for being an accomplice said tunks disdainfully not me but i was frightened and when i saw that captain huxham had killed mr listeri knew his name by that time having heard them talkingwhy i ran away as hard as my legs could carry me where did you go home to granny so that i might be able to supply an alibi if necessary i didnt tell her anything but she found out a lot when i was raving with the drink in me but i couldnt rest and when granny was abed i stole out it was after ten by this time i went up to the manor and to yonder window then i saw mrs coppersleyas she wasand mr vand talking to the captain and telling him they were married the knife all bloody was on the floor near the door but they were all three so busy talking that they did not notice it but i wonder the captain didnt cover it up where was the body of my father asked cyril impatiently i dont know the body was gone ive never been able to find out where the captain put up the body but as i say he turned out mr vand and his wife as i knew she was then and cursed up and down but he didnt pick up the knife in place of doing so which would have been more sensible seeing that he had murdered the lister cove with it he went to his desk and pulled out a black bag he emptied this of jewels and my mouth watered ah so you recognised the bag when you tried to steal it from mrs vand in your mothers cottage yes i did said luke sullenly and very sorry i am that i didnt get clear off with it you have quite enough to answer for as it is said inglis sharply go on as i have got everything down so far well then while the captain was sitting at the desk gloating over the jewels mr vand comes in softly like a cat he saw the jewels and his eyes lighted up captain huxham being busy didnt hear him so he picks up the knife lying near the door and before i could cry out he rushed at the old man huxham turned to meet him and got the knife in his heart then mr vand as cool as you please dropped the knife behind the desk and taking the bag with the jewels he put em backwent away what did you do i went home and tried to sleep but couldnt why didnt you warn the police asked inglis no sir im only a gipsy and theyd have thought id something to do with the business if id accused mr vand him and his wife would have accused me and it would be two to one besides said luke coolly i wasnt sorry to see old huxham downed after killing the other gent serve him right say i so thats all humph said inglis finishing his writing you made capital out of this yes i did said luke defiantly and taking the pen which inglis held out to him i told mr and mrs vand what id seen they were frightenedit was the next morning you seeand paid me heaps of money to hold my tongue then like a fool i went on the bend and talked so much that granny got to know heaps and so set the nigger brute on our tracks thereluke signed his nameyou cant hang me for what ive told you inglis and lister both signed as witnesses and the inspector put the paper into his pocket he was about to ask further questionsto crossexamine tunks in factwhen the door opened and a young constable appeared in a mighty state of excitement sir he cried to his superior officer mrs vand has escaped escaped cried the inspector in a voice of thunder yes sir dutton is lying drugged in the hut and the old woman has been stunned mrs vand and the gipsy girl are gone chapter xxiv a remarkable discovery next morning there was a great sensation in the village of marshely as in some way the events of the previous night leaked out certainly the accounts of these were more or less garbled and no one appeared to know who was responsible for them but this much of the truth became public property that vand and the negro prince who had been stopping at the chequers were dead that mrs vand had fled to escape arrest and that the police were in possession of bleacres later in the afternoon it became known that vand had killed captain huxham for the sake of certain jewels but the villagers were greatly astonished when they heardfrom what source was not knownthat another man had been killed no one save silas pence had seen edwin lister enter the manor and pence himself had presumed until informed that the man was cyril so no one knew that any person was missing now it appeared that the man who was murdered by vand had committed a crime himself previous to his own death but what he had done with the body no one knew and the police could find no traces of the same in spite of all their efforts inspector inglis called at miss ankers cottage in the morning and interviewed both bella and her lover from them he heard the whole tale and was greatly astonished by the recital under the circumstances he was inclined to take the jewels into official custody but bella refused to give them up and undoubtedly they were her property left to her by her father maxwell faith inglis admitted this so did not press the point afterwards the inspector examined silas pence and heard from him much the same story as he had told bella the preacher was lying on a bed of sickness as the blow on his head and the many worries he had been through of late nearly gave him brain fever of courseand inglis told him as muchhe should have reported at once the death of huxham as he had seen the body but as pence had not beheld the blow struck the police could do nothing but admonish silas stated that in one point of his story when he confessed to bella he had been wrong which was after seeing edwin lister enter the manoror as he thought then cyrilhe had rushed away in the direction of the common in the vain attempt to rid himself of troublesome thoughts when he returned mr and mrs vand were in the kitchen as luke proved and pence was thus enabled to enter the house undoubtedly the guilty pair had left the front door open so that blame might be cast upon some outsideron a possible burglar for instance when they heard the noise of pences flight and found the money gone they were quite determined to place the blame on a robber mrs vand confessed this later although at the time of the robbery she had not dreamed the burglar was the talented young preacher whom she so greatly admired but the guilty woman was missing for some days on inquiry being made it appeared that the romany girl bribed by mrs vand to assist her flight had made a cup of tea for the constable as dutton was wet and cold he drank the tea only too willingly never suspecting that it was drugged but it turned out to be dosed with laudanum and he fell into a deep sleep granny tunks as she stated on reviving had attempted to stay the flight of mrs vand and the romany girl but the latter had promptly knocked her down with the very chunk of wood with which mrs tunks had struck the halfdrowned woman in this way grannys sins came home to her inglis found on the detail of the motorcar being reported by cyril who had heard it from mrs vand that use had been made of the same he advertised for such a car in such a neighbourhood and speedily was called upon by a public chauffeur who drove for hire the man confessed very frankly that vand had engaged his car to wait for himself and his wife on the high road to pierside and that thinking that nothing was wrong he had done so vand had paid him well and the driver merely thought it was the eccentric whim of a rich man vand it appeared had engaged the car in london from the stand in trafalgar square when mrs vand left the hut the romany girl had rowed her to the swamps in the boat she had brought for the removal of luke to the caravan and the woman had then crossed the marshy ground to the high road making some excuse for the nonappearance of her husband she had been driven to london and the driver who had already received his money dropped her in piccadilly that as he confessed was the last he saw of her inspector inglis was very angry with the man and pointed out that he should have suspected that the couple were flying from justice from the fact of the large sum of money paid and on account of the strange place where it was arranged that the car should wait but the man exonerated himself completely and in the end he was permitted to go free as the police could not do anything and after all the chauffeur who did not look particularly intelligent might have acted in all good faith however the point was that mrs vand dropped in piccadilly had vanished entirely she had ample money as it was proved that she had drawn fifty pounds in gold from her bank and although she had fled from the hut with only the dripping dress she wore there would be no difficulty in her obtaining a fresh disguise the police advertised in the papers and with handbills but nothing could be heard of the woman she had vanished as completely as though the earth had opened and swallowed her strangely enough it was from mrs vands solicitor that the first news came of her doings timson was the lawyers name and he came down to pierside to see inspector inglis on being shown into the inspectors office he broke out abruptly sir said timson who was a mildfaced spectacled yellowhaired man i have a communication to make to you about my respected client mrs rosamund vand if you will hear it respectable eh questioned the officer ironically perhaps you dont know mrmrhe referred to the cardmr timson that your respectable client is wanted for her complicity in the murder of her brother sir said mr timson again and firmly my clientmy respected client he added with emphasis assured me that she had nothing to do with the commission of that crime she was in a dead faint in the kitchen when her husband in a moment of passion struck down captain huxham so she says because it is to her benefit to say so mr timson but the man who saw the murder committed swears that it was a most deliberate affair and was only done for the sake of certain jewels which deliberate or not mr inspector interrupted the meek little man my respected client had nothing to do with it afterwards she held her tongue for the sake of her husband for his sake also paid blackmail to the man who saw the crime committed we can argue that point said inglis drily when we see mrs vand you are doubtless aware of her whereabouts no said timson coolly i am not but you said you had seen herafter the murder was committed i fancy you hinted i saw her said timson quite calmly on the day following her flight from the hut on the marshes she alighted in piccadilly and walked about the streets for the rest of the night afterwards she went to a quiet hotel and had a brush and a wash up she then called on me and you did not detain her when you knew i knew nothing had i known that she was flying from justice i certainly should have urged her to surrender but the news of these terrible doings in marshely had not reached london it was not in the papers until the following day you grant that yes yes but no buts at all mr inspector said timson who seemed firm enough in spite of his meek aspect my client confessed to me that her husband had been drowned and that he had murdered her brother in a fit of passion because captain huxham intended to turn his sister out of doors and alter his will on account of her secret marriage that motive may have had some weight said inglis quietly but i fancy the sight of the jewels made vand murder his brotherinlaw did mrs vand call to tell you this no snapped timson whose meekness was giving way she called to make her will make her willin whose favour i see no reason why i should not tell you said the lawyer although i never reveal professional secrets but i will tell so that you may see how you have misjudged my client she made a will in favour of miss isabella faith faith ah she knew then that the girl was not her niece yes but she did not tell me that nor did i inquire all she did was to make me or rather instruct me to draw up a will leaving the bleacres property and the five hundred a year she inherited from the late captain huxham to miss faith as some token of repentance for having misjudged her and now cried timson rising wrathfully my respected client is misjudged herself i come to clear her character i dont see how that will clears her character said inglis coolly and from the mere fact that she made it i daresay she has committed suicide impossible impossible i think it is very probable indeed mr timson mrs vand cannot get out of england as all the ports and railway stations are watched and there is a full description of her appearance posted everywhere unless she wants to get a long sentence for complicity in this most brutal murder she will have to commit suicide i tell you she is innocent can you tell me that she is not an accomplice after the fact a wife is not bound to give evidence against her husband inspector inglis rose with a fatigued air i am not here to argue on points of law with you mr timson all i ask is if you know where your respected client is he laid a sneering emphasis on his last words no i do not said timson taking up his hat and i bid you good day what the lawyer said was evidently correct for although his office and himself were watched by the police it could not be proved that he was in communication with the missing woman the whereabouts of mrs vand became more of a mystery than ever inglis told bella of her good fortune but of course until mrs vand was dead she could not benefit and there seemed to be no chance of proving the womans death even though the inspector firmly held to the opinion that she had committed suicide meantime timson went on to marshely to look after his clients property and seeing that the corn was ripe he arranged with a number of labourers under an overseer whom he could trust that it should be reaped immediately thus it happened that four days after mrs vands disappearance when cyril came to tell bella about the inquest she was able to inform him that the solitary farm lands were about to be reaped and we might go there in the evening to look said bella my dear i should think that the manor was hateful to you well it is even if i do inherit it from mrs vand i can never live there cyril but i want you to come with me this evening as i have a kind of idea that the body of mrs vandshe grew pale and shudderedmay be found amidst the corn cyril started back astonished my dear girl you must be mad no i am not cyril think of how she is being hunted and how her person is described everywhere while all the ports and stations are watched i believe that she poor woman went to see her lawyer so as to prove her sorrow for having misjudged me by making me her heiress and that she then returned to die amidst the corn do you think she is dead there perhaps yes perhaps no granny tunks is still in the hut and she is very avaricious mrs vand had money she may have bribed granny to bring her food while she lay hid among the corn but such a hidingplace said lister who nevertheless was much struck with what bella was saying a very good one and a place where no one would think of looking think how thick the corn is growing no one ever enters it and that scarlet coated scarecrow stands sentinel over it believe me cyril mrs vand has been hiding there i wish you to come with me this evening they have started to reap the corn by order of mr timson if mrs vand is there she will in the end be discovered let us find her and save her and get her out of the kingdom that will bring us within reach of the law i dont care said bella quite recklessly after all she had nothing to do with the crime and only kept silent to shield her husband i want to help the poor thing and you must aid me to do so but bella she never liked you what has that got to do with it cried the girl passionately our natures did not suit one another and perhaps i behaved rather harshly towards her she meant well and remember cyril she has made amends by leaving me all that would have been mine had i really been captain huxhams daughter cyril nodded i admit that she has done her best to repent he said after a pause and we should not judge her too harshly ill come and help her to escape yes it wont be easy but ill do my best thats my own dear boy said the girl kissing him and now what about the inquest a verdict of death by drowning has been brought in said cyril quickly i think if we can get mrs vand away everything concerning the huxham mystery will be at an end they wont put the whole story in the papers cyril no inglis will edit all that is to be given to the reporters and journalists he will say as little as possible about the matter it is known that huxham was murdered by vand and in the absence of my fathers body no cognisance can be taken of that alleged murder dont you believe that your father has been murdered i dont know i cant tell tunks says so and i dont suppose he would tell such a story against himself unless it were true but no body has been found and until the body of the missing man is found it is presumed in law that he is alive butcyril shrugged his shoulderswho can tell the truth it will be made manifest in time said bella firmly your father or your fathers body will be found where are durgo and henry to be buried in marshely churchyard tomorrow i shall go to the funeral i am sorry for durgo in spite of his skin he was a real white man and when he is under the earth bella i think we had better sell the jewels and marry and take a trip round the world in order to forget all this terrible business i am quite glad it is over it is not over yet insisted bella your father has to be found and mrs vand must be discovered or their bodies said cyril significantly and turned away it must not be thought that young lister was callous his father had never been one to him and moreover his son had seen so little of him that he was as strange to the young man as he had been to the boy cyril deeply regretted the gulf that was between them as he was of a truly affectionate nature but his father always had repelled the least sign of tenderness he only looked on cyril as one to be made use of and borrowed from him on every occasion had he succeeded in getting the jewels and had aided durgo to regain his chiefdom he would have remained in nigeria as a kind of savage prime minister without casting a thought to his son and whether his father was dead or alive cyril knew that he would have to repay the one thousand pounds which he had borrowed to cover his fathers delinquency in respect of the forged cheque how could such a son as cyril lister respect or love such a parent as edwin of the same name nevertheless cyril although he said little to bella was very anxious to ascertain the fate of his father it seemed very certain that tunks had seen him murdered by the evilhearted old sailor but what that scoundrel had done with the body could not be discovered in vain the police dug in the cellars of the manorhouse tapped the walls ripped up the floors and dragged the boundary channel the body of edwin lister could not be found and as no one had seen him save tunks and pence and bella who had all mistaken him for cyril the police began to believe that edwin the father was a myth and cyril could not make inglis see otherwise for all his urging and confession if the man is alive why doesnt he turn up asked inglis and if dead why cant we find his body there was no answer to this and cyril gave up his fathers fate as a riddle when he walked in the cool of the evening towards the solitary farm the immediate object of his visit was to find if mrs vand dead or alive was concealed in the thickly standing corn bella strolled by his side but the lovers had taken no one into this particular confidence not even dora and walked towards the wellknown house and up the cornpath anxiously looking right and left then cyril uttered an exclamation of annoyance what a bother he said much vexed see bella there are labourers still reapingyonder near the scarecrow i suppose mr timson wants the fields reaped quickly said bella also much vexed i thought everyone would have been gone by this time we must wait until the labourers depart cyril it will never do to find mrs vand while they are about they would tell the police and she would be arrested that would be dangerous so it will beif she is alive said the young man who was very doubtful on this point himself the setting sun cast a rosy glow over the fields of golden grain the old house seemed to be buried in a treasure meadow all round rolled the radiant waves and the scarletcoated scarecrows task was nearly done the corn was ripe for the harvest and soon the acres of the solitary farm would consist of nothing but stubble as the lovers drew near the house they saw a labourer approach the scarecrow the corn had been reaped for some distance all round it and now a man had cut a path direct to it in order to pull it down its task was over and it was no longer needed to keep off the birds suddenly the man laid his hand on the quaint figure which had been so familiar to every one for months and uttered a loud cry of astonishment cyril saw him beckoning to other labourers and shortly there was a crowd round the scarlet coat what is the matter asked bella and the lovers hurried to join the group one of the labourers heard the question and turned excitedly master missus he said in horrified tone its a corpse he pulled the tattered gray felt hat from the scarecrow and cyril recoiled with a loud cry of surprise bella bella what is it what is it she said startled by the discovery it is my father it is edwin lister all present knew of the tragedy and of the hunt made for edwin lister and now the missing man had been discovered one of the labourers mindful of public house gossip touched the drooping neck of the figure and shuddered take missy away he said softly to cyril and with a grey face this aint no sight for her his throat has been cut but it was not the man who led the girl away bella saw the labourers face guessed with a shudder what he had said and catching cyrils arm dragged him away from that awful spot the young fellow with a blanched face and tottering limbs stumbled blindly along as she pulled him forward in all his expectations he had never counted upon such a terrible dramatic discovery as this his father the missing man the murdered man who had been hunted for alive and dead for many weeks had been used by captain huxham as a scarecrow to frighten the birds no wonder they had kept away from those sinister fields oh great god moaned cyril sick and faint let this be the end chapter xxv run to earth the quiet village of marshely in essex was getting to be as wellknown through the length and breadth of england as westminster abbey the murder of captain huxham had caused a sensation the death of durgo and vand had created another one but the discovery of the ghastly scarecrow which had warned the birds from the cornfields of bleacres startled everyone greatly the news flew like wild fire through the village and in less than an hour the inhabitants were surveying the terrible object shortly the constable of the village who had superseded duttonin disgrace for his share in the escape of mrs vandappeared and armed with the authority of the law and assisted by willing hands removed the poor relic of humanity from the pole whereupon it had hung for so long the explanation of its being there was easy undoubtedly captain huxham after he had committed the crime and while tunks and pence were away the one through horror and the other through sheer worry had carried out the dead body to fasten it to the pole he undressed the strawstuffed figure with which everyone was familiar and having destroyed it arrayed the corpse of edwin lister in its military clothes then he pulled the tattered grey felt cap well over the face so that it should not be suspected as being that of a human being and bound the dead to the pole of course no one not even the vands suspected that the figure was other than what it had always been and it said much for the cruel ingenuity of captain jabez huxham that he had selected so clever a mode of disposing of the body had he thrown it into the boundary channel it might have been fished out had he concealed it in the house it would probably have been discovered and had he buried it in the garden near the house it might have been dug up but no one ever dreamed that the scarletcoated scarecrow was the man who was wanted huxham had been struck down almost immediately after he had put his scheme into execution and it was doubtful if he had intended to leave the body there probably he did as it was isolated by the corn and when the field was reaped he doubtless intended to get rid of the corpse in some equally ingenious way the removal of the scarecrow would have excited no comment when the fields were reaped as its career of usefulness would then be at an end the dead mans clothes still clothed his corpse under the scarecrows ragged garments one result of the discovery was that everyone decided not to buy the corn which had flourished under so terrible a guardian far and wide the newspapers spread the report of the discovery and timson became aware that a prejudice existed against making bread of the wheat grown on the bleacres ground not wishing to spend more money since he would have to account for everything he did to mrs vand he withdrew the labourers the solitary farm now became solitary indeed for no one would go near it especially after nightfall the golden fields of wheat spread round it like a sea and the ancient house stood up greyly and lonely like a thing accursed and indeed it was looked upon as damned by the villagers an inquest was held and going by the evidence of luke tunks it was decided that edwin lister came by his end at the hands of jabez huxham cyril was compelled to attend and give evidence but said as little as he could not wishing to make his fathers shady career too public he simply stated that his father was a trader in nigeria and being the friend of durgo the dispossessed chief of a friendly tribe in the far hinterland had come home to see huxham and get from him certain jewels of course he could not suppress the fact that these jewels had been given by kawal to maxwell faith and had been stolen from the dead body of the man by his murderer captain huxham nor could he fail to state that bella was the daughter of maxwell faith since had he not done so the jewels might have been taken from her but cyril spoke as clearly and carefully as he could quite aware of the delicate position he occupied there was no doubt that huxham dreading lest the murder of faith should be brought home to him and anxious to retain the jewels which were the price of blood had murdered lister afterwards he had disposed of the body in the ingenious manner explained but lister was dead huxham was dead vand and durgo were dead so the papers suggested that there should be an end to the succession of terrible events which made marshely so notorious and i think this is the last said cyril when he returned to miss ankers cottage from his fathers funeral bella we cant stay here im sure i dont want to replied the harassed girl who looked worn and thin the place is getting on my nerves ill marry you as soon as you like dear and then we can go away but this morningshe hesitatedi received a letter from my fathers relatives they ask me to come to them what will you do asked cyril gravely write and say that i am marrying you and intend to go abroad but bella if you reside with your relatives you may be able to make a much better match yes said bella with a grimace i might marry a quaker no dear i intend to stay with you and marry you i have done without my relatives for all this time and i hope to continue doing without them bella bella i have nothing to offer you yourself dear that is all i want a stupid gift on my part said cyril looking ruefully in a near mirror at his face which was now lean and haggard you have the money and also the sympathy of the public i can offer you nothing but a dishonoured name oh nonsense she said vigorously i wont have you talk in that way why one of the newspapers referred to your father as a pioneer of empire sad as he was cyril could not help smiling that is just like my fathers good luck he exclaimed alive or dead everything comes to him i expect his shady doings will be overlooked and no one knows of his shady doings dear well then he will be looked upon as a hero its just as well he is buried in marshely churchyard for some fanatic might propose to bury him in westminster abbey you will be congratulated on having such a father no cried cyril violently i wont stand that bella we shall go to london next week and get married in a registry office miss ankers can come with you to play propriety bella laughed i rather think dora is so busy nursing poor mr pence back to health that she has no time why you dont mean to say that she loves pence yes and no i wont say what may happen she pities him for his weakness and pity as you know is akin to love besides only ourselves and inspector inglis know of the temptation to which mr pence was submitted why bella everyone knows he saw the corpse of huxham and held his tongue yes but everyone doesnt know that he took the one hundred pounds which he restored to me he is looked upon as somewhat weak for not having informed the police of the crime but on the whole people are sorry for him i shall be sorry too if a nice little woman like miss ankers marries such a backboneless creature cyril cyril have not our late troubles shown you that we must judge no one after what we have undergone i shall never never give an opinion about anyone again i am sorry now that i did not behave better to poor mrs vand when my supposed father was alive i did treat her haughtily no wonder she disliked me my dear said lister taking her hand dont be too hard on yourself you and your socalled aunt would never have got on well together but i might have been kinder said bella almost crying now that she is dead and gone i feel that i might have been kinder how do you know that she is dead and gone asked cyril in so strange a tone that bella dashing the tears from her eyes looked at him inquiringly she is alive he replied to that mute interrogation oh cyril i am so glad tell me all about it i dont know that i am glad poor soul said lister sadly the police are on her track i didnt want to tell you bella but for the last two days the papers have been full of the hunt after mrs vand why didnt dora tell me i asked her not to you have had quite enough to bear well now that you have told me some tell me all there isnt much to tell some too clever landlady in bloomsbury suspected a quiet lady lodger it certainly was mrs vand but she became suspicious of her landlady and cleared out then she was seen at putney and afterwards someone noticed her in hampstead the papers having been taunting the police about the matter theyll catch her in the end poor mrs vand poor mrs vand the girls eyes again filled with tears we cant help her bella i wish timson could get hold of her and induce her to stand her trial i dont think either judge or jury would be hard on her more i fancy that her brain must be turned with all this misery and she has lost her husband too sighed bella she loved him so oh dear cyril what should i do if i lost you before lister could reply with the usual loverlike attentions there was a noise in the road and looking through the window they saw many people hurrying along dora came in at the moment from the other room whither she always discreetly withdrew when not nursing pence it is only some policeman they are running after he declares that mrs vand is in the neighbourhood if she is i hope she will escape by jove i must go out and see said cyril seizing his hat i shall come also cried bella and in a few minutes the two were on the road but by this time the people were not tearing along as they had been and one villager told lister that it had been a false alarm the old vixen wont come back to her first hole said the villager with a coarse laugh and bella frowned at him for his inhumanity as there really was nothing to hurry for the lovers strolled easily along the road talking of their future bella you havent many boxes asked cyril only two why do you ask will you be ready to come with me to london tomorrow yes i shall be glad to get out of marshely where i have been so miserable only i wish i knew where mrs vand is poor soul cyril passed over the reference to mrs vand as he was weary of discussing that unfortunate woman theres a chum of mine got a motor said the young man i wrote and asked him for the loan of it he brought it down last night and it is safely bestowed in the stables of the chequers tomorrow at nine oclock let us start off with your boxes and dora no said cyril very decidedly dora can remain with pence whom she probably will marry we will go to london and get married at a registry office in the afternoon and then cross to paris for our honeymoon i havent much money miss rothschild but i have enough for that in our own happiness let us forget all our troubles ill come said bella with a sigh after all we can do nothing by the way cyril what about durgos things well its odd you should mention that he evidently thought that something might happen to him on that night for he left a note behind him saying that if he did not return they were to be given to me so i have shifted them long since to my lodgings there they lie packed up and ready to be taken away in our motor tomorrow cyril you have been arranging this for some time well i have its the only way of getting you to leave this place and you will always be miserable while you remain here i only stayed in the hope that poor mrs vand might return and then i would be able to comfort her oh how i wish durgo with his occult powers was here to help us i dont durgos occult powers brought him little happiness and didnt solve the mystery of my fathers death one would have thought that granny tunks in her trances would have told durgo that the scarecrow which he saw daily was his dearlybeloved masters dead body it is strange said bella thoughtfully but then as durgo said about something else perhaps it was not permitted whats become of granny tunks cyril is she still at the hut yes but i heard today that she is going on the road again with her old tribe of the lovels i daresay granny will be at all the fairs and race meetings swindling people for many a long day and her son luke hell get off with a light sentence he certainly had no hand in the murders and there is no one to prosecute him for blackmail granny and luke will soon be together again i hope never to hear more of them for my part bella bella dont let us talk of such things we have had enough of these tragedies let us be selfish for once in our lives and consider ourselves hullo whats this the question was provoked by the sight of inglis with three constables who whirled past in a fly which they had evidently obtained from the station as they dashed onward in a cloud of dust the inspector recognising the two shouted out something indistinctly with his hand to his mouth what does he say cyril asked bella anxiously something about fire i wonder where they are going ohcyril suddenly stopped shorti wonder if they are after poor mrs vand come bella let us see where they go to but where are you going asked bella as he rushed along the road dragging her after him swiftly oh she cried out with horror look at the far end of the village and in the direction of the solitary farm a vast cloud of smoke was mounting menacingly into the soft radiance of the twilight sky no wonder inglis said fire cried lister excitedly i believe bella that the manorhouse is blazing no cried bella in reply it is impossible but it was not as they rounded the corner of the crooked village street in the midst of a crowd of people who had sprung as by magic from nowhere they saw the great bulk of the manorhouse enveloped in thick black smoke and even at the distance they were could catch sight of fiery tongues of flame the sky was rapidly darkening to night and the smokecloud laced with red serpents looked lurid and livid and sinister come bella come cried cyril to the panting girl and took her arm within his own we must see who set it on fire bella got her second wind and ran like atalanta they speedily outstripped the crowd and were almost the first to cross the planks over the boundary channel inglis and his policemen were already running up the cornpath why they should run or why the villagers should run cyril did not know as there was no water and no fire brigade hose or engine and no chance of saving the ancient mansion he and bella ran because they wished to see the last of the old home who can have set it on fire cyril kept asking perhaps a tramp suggested bella breathlessly but in her heart she felt that something more serious was in the wind a strange dread gripped her heart and the name of mrs vand was on the tip of her tongue although she never uttered it as the weather was warm and the ground dryfor there had been no rain since the electric storm which raged when vand and durgo had gone down into the muddy waters of the boundary channelthe old house flamed furiously the dry wood caught like tinder and when cyril and the girl arrived the whole place was hidden weirdly by dense black smoke amidst which flashed sinister points of fire inglis and his men attempted to enter the house but were driven back by the fierce flames which burst from the cracking windows also the great door was closed and could not be forced open they were forced to retreat and the inspector nearly tumbled over miss faith as bella was now called cant you get her out asked inglis breathlessly get her out cried the girl terrified and half grasping his meaning mrs vand she is in there and he pointed to the furnace of flame bella screamed and cyril turned pale you must be mistaken he said no no replied the inspector who was greatly agitated for even his official phlegm was not proof against the terror of the position the london police wired to me at pierside that mrs vand had gone down to marshely we waited at the station to arrest her but she got off at a previous station and was seen by your village policeman to run across the marshes he wired to my pierside office and the wire was repeated to the station we waited at we got a fly and hurried here only to see the smoke i cried out fire to you as we passed great heavens what a blaze cant you get her out cried bella who was white with despair little as she had liked mrs vand the position was a dreadful one to contemplate what can we do said the officer with a gesture of despair there is no water and no buckets and if there were what bucket of water would put out that conflagration you might as well try and extinguish hell with a squirt bella paid no attention to the vehemence of his expression but turned to cyril what can we do she wailed oh what can we do nothing nothing look at the police look at the villagers we can do nothing if mrs vand is in that blazing house god help her there was now a great crowd of men women and children all gathered some distance away from the burning mansion trampling down the tall corn in their efforts to see bella with the police and her lover stood the nearest to the house please god she is not there breathed the girl clasping her hands in agony at that moment as if to give the lie to her kindly prayer a window on the first storey was flung open and mrs vands head was poked out even at this distance bella could see that her hair was in disorder her face haggard and her whole mien wild breaking away desperately from cyril she rushed right up almost under the window despite the fierce heat aunt oh aunt she cried stretching up her hands come down and save yourself no no they shall not catch me i shall not be hanged i am innocent i am innocent shrieked mrs vand and bella could almost see the mad flash in her eyes bella bella come back shouted cyril and dashing forward he caught the girl in his arms and carried her away as the front door fell outward a long tongue of flame shot out and licked the grass where bella had stood a moment since by this time the house was blazing furiously and every window save that out of which mrs vands head was thrust vomited flame the sky was now very dark and the vivid redness of the flame in the gloom made a terrible and lovely spectacle bella in her despair would have rushed again to implore her aunt to escape but that cyril and inglis held her firmly it is useless they said and the girl could not but admit that they were right mrs vand apparently was quite mad she kept flinging up her arms and shouting out taunts to the police for having failed to catch her then she was seized with a fit of frenzy and began to throw things out of the window chairs and lookingglasses and rugs and table ornaments did she fling out suddenly a devilish thought occurred to her crazed brain she noted that a tongue of uncut corn stretched from the main body of wheat almost under the window darting back she plucked a flaming brand from the crackling door and regardless how it burnt the flesh of her hand she ran to the window off off off with you cried mrs vand and carefully dropping the brand on to the tongue of corn in one moment as it seemed the thread of fire ran along to the main body of the corn and in an inconceivably short space of time the acres of golden grain were a sheet of flame the villagers the police both cyril and bella ran for their lives and it took them all their speed to escape the eager flames which licked their very heels pellmell down to the boundary channel ran everyone the plank bridge was broken and many tumbled into the muddy water mrs vand stood at the window yelling and clapping her hands like a fiend and the whole vast fields of wheat flared like a gigantic bonfire half swimming half holding on to the broken bridge planks cyril with bella on his other arm managed to scramble through that muddy ditch beside him shrieked women and cursed men and screamed children the police having safely reached the other side stretched out arms to those in the water cyril and bella were soon on dry land and shortly everyone else was saved not a single life was lost either by fire or water and when safe on the hither side of this jordan the excited smokebegrimed throng looked at the flaming fields and the roaring furnace of the manor house the smoke and flame of the burning ascended to heaven and reddened the evening sky mrs vand in setting fire to her last refuge had indeed provided herself with a noble pyre and a dramatic end before those who watched could draw breath after their last exertions the roof of the mansion fell in with a crash mrs vand gave one wild cry and fell backward then fierce red flames enwrapped the whole structure while far and wide the raging fire swept over the fields of the solitary farm may god have mercy on her soul said cyril removing his cap ah said inglis if i had caught her i wonder if the judge would have said as much no replied bella she is dead and she was innocent god help her poor soul and everyone around echoed the wish bella and cyril did not go to london the next morning as they had arranged but three days later in the meanwhile search had been made amongst the ruins of the manorhouse for the body of mrs vand but nothing could be found in that fierce furnace of flame she had been burnt to a cinder and not even calcined bones could be gathered together in a whirlwind of flame the unhappy woman had vanished and her end affected bella deeply indeed cyril feared lest the muchtried girl should fall ill and on the third day he brought round the motorcar to miss ankers cottage to insist that she should come with him to london but if we marry so soon it seems like a disrespect to mrs vand argued bella and she has left me her money remember my dear dont be morbid advised dora you will be ill if you stay get married and go to paris and try to forget all these terrible things what do you say pence asked cyril who in the meantime had carried out bellas boxes pence looking lean and haggard after his recent illness but with a much calmer light in his eyes nodded i say go miss faith and get married as soon as you can you wouldnt have given that advice once said bella with a faint smile as dora assisted her to adjust her cloak no but i have grown wiser what a compliment you have forgiven me have you not yes i have she held out her hand and the best thing i can wish you is the best wife in the world as if by chance her eyes rested on dora who blushed and then on pence who grew red afterwards with half a smile and half a sigh she got into the car beside cyril dora hopped like a bird on to the step to kiss her lister raised his cap and the car went humming down the road on the way to peace and happiness thats the end of her solitary life said pence thankfully on the solitary farm rejoined dora come and have some breakfast the end the best novels by fergus hume the mystery of a hansom cab
