of the strange room on the night of july th in the year between the hours of eleven and twelve grangebury a littleknown suburb of london was wrapped in slumber as became a respectable neighbourhood whose inhabitants retired regularly shortly after sunset not that they had done so on this particular night for the unusual excitement of a lecture on dickens delivered in the tiny town hall had kept them from their beds later than was customary at a quarter to eleven a stream of instructed pleasureseekers discussing lecture and lecturer filled the narrow streets but gradually the crowd diminished until highways and byways were left deserted save by watchful policemen and vagrant cats the lamps were then extinguished by order of an economical municipality the few lights still twinkling from the upper windows of various houses disappeared and the little town lay under moon and stars as silent and almost as lonely as the spellbound cities in eastern fables every now and then the footsteps of policemen making their rounds could be heard echoing along the streets and sometimes an official lantern would be flashed into dark corners to search out possible burglars or homeless beggars but no thieves or vagabonds could be discovered for on the whole grangebury being a comparatively new suburb was free from such criminal pests and the police force there under the command of mr inspector lackland had a very easy time there was nothing on this night to indicate any ending to this arcadian age of security and innocence yet shortly after eleven oclock a yawning policeman leaning against a convenient wall heard a word cried aloud which told him of crime and danger the word was murder murder repeated the constable looking up and down the street murder shrieked the voice again and then there came the sound of running feet cries for help and the quick panting of an exhausted creature before the policeman could decide in which direction to move a dishevelled woman screaming and gesticulating came at full speed round the corner and almost fell into his arms her face was pearly white in the moonlight her eyes were filled with terror and an almost continuous cry issued from her open mouth without any motion of the lips ere ere wots this said the policeman seizing the flying creature by the arm wot dye mean screeching out murder like a loonatic come now trembling violently the woman grappled with the policeman shrieking the while and evidently beside herself with terror not being gifted with brains the officer of the law shook her vigorously to brighten her intellect and she wavered limply in his grasp like a dummy figure murder she whimpered clawing and clutching at the man lord its awful ugh ugh ive seen her dead seen oo dead demanded the policeman stolidly my lodger dead strangled ugh ugh cried the woman breathlessly raising her voice higher at each word a corpse in the yellow room paradise row come and seecome and oh poor soul and she fell to wringing her hands again quivering and panting wait a bit said the jackinoffice bound by redtapeism the police station is just roun th corner kim up an see th inspector iii am innocent gasped the woman hanging back neither tilda nor i laid a finger on her oo said y did retorted the man suspiciously and for his own protection he recited an official formula wot y say now ull be used in hevidence agin y kim up i tell y and grasping her arm he hurried her fighting and crying round the near corner and into a redbrick building over the door of which was a lamp inscribed police station in a stuffy room rendered almost unbearable by the heat of the flaring gas two men were talking earnestly together notwithstanding the lateness of the hour the one in uniform was a burly redfaced martinet known in grangebury as inspector lackland he was too completely hemmed in by red tapeism to count for much but the other in plain clothes was absolom gebb well known in scotland yard as a capable detective but not so infallible as the miraclemonger of fiction it was gebb who brought home the theft of lady daleshires diamonds to herself who proved dr marner to be guilty of poisoning his wife in spite of strong evidence to the contrary who solved nine out of every ten criminal problems submitted to him and who was the terror of all evildoers this tall lean man with his cleanshaven face and black observant eyes was an enthusiast in his profession and loved to ponder over and follow out the intricacies of criminal mysteries at the present moment he was conversing with lackland about a recent anarchist conspiracy and therefore happened to be in the grangebury police office when the zealous policeman appeared with his terrified prisoner she cried out when she was thrust into the room and confronted by inspector and detective covered her face with her hands hey what said lackland in his rasping voice whats all this about case of murder sir jerked out the policeman pushing forward the prisoner paradise row woman strangled murder cried gebb pricking up his ears at the ominous word murder screeched the woman and fell into a chair evidently she had received a shock and was on the verge of hysterics for she began to babble and weep copiously accustomed to deal with this sort of emotion lackland seized a jug of water standing near his desk and dashed the contents into her face the remedy was efficacious for with a gasp and a shiver the woman recovered her selfcontrol and tongue also her inherent feminine vanity you brute she screamed jumping up wrathfully my best bonnets spoilt attention roared the inspector in his sternest military manner none of this nonsense here what about this murder in i didnt kill her interrupted the woman wiping her face tilda and me knew nothing about it till we found her strangled when we came back from the lecture did you attend the lecture on dickens in the town hall asked gebb yes i did sir both me and tilda who is my servant went what is your name asked the detective with professional sharpness maria presk married or single married once single now sighed the woman i am what you call a widow sir and i let lodgings in paradise row was this dead woman a lodger of yours miss ligram you mean yes miss ligram was in the first floor front and who killed miss ligram asked gebb looking keenly at mrs presk the good lady turned ever paler than before ii dont know sir she stammered with a scared look i can take my stand in any court of face this way maam interrupted lackland who was indignant at the way in which gebb was usurping his authority im in charge of this office im the officer to take your evidence mr gebb discipline alright go ahead replied the detective inwardly cursing the too methodical procedure of his superior i dont want to interfere but he added with emphasis i think we should go at once and look at the corpse all in good time mr gebb more haste less speed said lackland crisply and the more delay the less chance of getting at the truth retorted gebb the fact was that gebbs sporting instincts were roused and he wanted to be off on the trail while it was yet fresh every moment was of importance yet as he was not in charge of the case he was forced to stand idly by and hear the blundering inspector putting a lot of irrelevant questionsgood for nothing but wasting time however gebb managed to extract some grains of wheat out of a vast quantity of chaff and in a roundabout waythanks to the inspectors method of questioninglearned the following facts which were sufficient to inform him how matters stood at present miss ligram wasor rather had been since she no longer existeda lodger in the house of mrs presk no paradise row she was a quiet inoffensive old lady who gave little trouble and who remained by preference in her own room on the night of the th july mrs presk and her servant matilda crane had attended a lecture delivered in the town hall the lecturean amusing one on charles dickens and his workshad afforded them much pleasure and they returned at eleven oclock to paradise row in a state of high spirits on passing round to the back entrance they saw that a light was still burning in miss ligrams sittingroom and wondering at the sightfor the lodger usually retired earlymrs presk on entering the house had gone upstairs to see if anything was wrong to her horror she found miss ligram dead with a cord round her neck terrified by the sight she had called up matilda crane who more impressionable and less hardened had promptly fainted away mrs presk a woman of energy and resource had immediately sought the aid of the police and now insisted that lackland and his subordinates should remove the corpse and capture the murderer that last is easier said than done was gebbs comment on this demand by this time the assassin is far enough away however theres no time to be lost in looking at the scene of the crime as i suggested quite so said lackland gruffly no time to waste maamto mrs presk march gebb come with me and catch the murderer this proposition recommending itself to mrs presk she left the policeoffice with inspector and detective and led the pair to her house which was situated down a side street no great distance away as the front door was closed she conducted the men round the back way through the kitchen and up the stairs into miss ligrams sittingroom on the mat in the passage tilda the servant lay still insensible so mrs presk lifted her in her strong arms and carried her to the kitchen to be revived as speedily as possible in case as was almost certain her evidence might be wanted in the mean time lackland and gebb had entered the room wherein the crime had been committed and were amazed at the splendour of the apartment for colouring and evidence of wealth it was like a scene out of the arabian nights the room was of no great size with a window looking out on to the street and two doors one leading in from a narrow passage the other giving admittance into an inner apartment evidently a bedroom the walls were draped with rich hangings of satin yellow as a buttercup in hue and a tentlike roof of the same tint and material was drawn in many folds to a domelike centre whence depended by a brass chain an arabian lantern studded with knobs of yellow glass which illuminated from within shone like pale topaz stones tables chairs and couches were framed of gilded cane with coverlets and quilts of yellow silk and the ground of the carpet was of the same colour embroidered with bunches of primrose flowers also there were tall narrow mirrors framed in yellow satin clusters of daffodils in grotesque chinese vases of a deep yellow shade and numerous candlesall lightedin candelabra silver gilt near the window from a brass chafingdish standing on a tripod of the same metal curled up a thin white vapour diffusing a heavy rich perfume and everywhere lay nicknacks of gold and silver more or less costly fur mats and rugs dyed yellow and many books covered in a homely fashion with yellow paper the prevailing colour of the room was a violent yellow and this with the glare of the candles the glitter of the mirrors the scent of the flowers and the strong perfume of the incense made the heads of the onlookers reel even the matteroffact inspector was impressed by the uncanny magnificence of the place by george sir said he to gebb with the instincts of an old soldier its like a mandalay pagoda if twas in burmah now shouldnt mind looting it gebb was rubbing his hands with sparkling eyes by the sight of it he said joyfully this is going to be a romantic case i only hope ill be lucky enough to get charge of it did you furnish this room maam he asked turning sharply to mrs presk whose pale grey face appeared over the shoulder of the burly staring inspector no i didnt retorted the landlady miss ligram furnished it herself and called it her yellow boudoir chapter ii the deathcard if the appearance of the room was amazing that of the dead woman was not less so the body was lying loosely in an armchair with sprawling legs and arms like a sawdust doll the head lay limply on the shoulder and a yellow cordevidently torn from a near curtainwas bound tightly round the lean throat the distorted face the protruding tongue the bulging eyes and discoloured skin all showed that the poor creature had been strangled in the most remorseless manner before her was placed a low cane table on the yellow coverlet of which a pack of cards was spread out face downward but in the lap of the dead woman lay another card with the face upward it was the ace of spades mrs presk noting it for the first time gave a screech of mingled horror and surprise the deathcard she gasped stepping back lord how awful what do you mean by the deathcard asked gebb sharply why said mrs presk astonished at the question which to her seemed unnecessary its the card in the pack as stands for death when you turn up the ace of spades you know its time to order your coffin rubbish said gebb humbug roared the inspector and they both shrugged their shoulders to show their contempt for such superstition mrs presk shook her head gloomily talk wont alter the matter she said pointing to the card theres the deathtoken and theres the corpse what do you make of that i make this said gebb dryly that the murderer must be a person of imagination he ought to be shot the blackguard growled lackland playacting with a corpse i wonder what they were fooling with cards for looks like a madmans work to me what do you say gebb gebb said nothing at the moment he was examining the dead woman who was arrayed with unusual splendour quite in keeping with the room yet too richly for the front parlour of a fifthrate lodginghouse miss ligrams body was that of an old woman close upon sixty years of age with a wrinkled face and a profusion of silvery white hair turned back in the style of marie antoinette it was dressed in an oldfashioned dinnerdress of white silk trimmed with valuable lace and this was designed so as to show the lean neck and bony arms of the wearer anything more incongruous than that poor clay clothed in such costly garments can scarcely be imagined it seemed to accentuate the grimness of the crime almost to elevate a sordid murder to the level of tragedy did miss ligram usually dress like this asked gebb turning to mrs presk every evening replied the landlady promptly she must have been eccentric was gebbs comment on this reply very eccentric sir i dont think she was quite right here and the landlady tapped her head significantly a crazy jane questioned lackland she was and she wasnt answered mrs presk enigmatically she wasnt mad enough to be shut up but she acted in a queerer way than most people look at this room and all its lights every night it was the same she usually dined off a chop and potatoes yet she dressed in silk and lace to eat them and thus far mrs presk with her eyes on the corpse had proceeded volubly when suddenlystill staring at the dead womanshe stopped and her jaw dropped motionless as a stone image she stood looking and then with an ejaculation she ran out of the room the detective and the inspector looked at her vanishing form looked at the corpse looked at one another and failed to understand her action what the devil does that mean said gebb with surly amazement only the devil knows retorted lackland grimly but if that jade is hiding anything of importance the sooner we get it out of her the better youre a bit of a lawyer gebb so ill bring back mrs presk and youll examine her no said gebb detaining his friend let her go now ill get the truth out of her tomorrow by george you will will you grumbled lackland annoyed that his advice was not taken and what if you dont get charge of the case ill grin and bear it i suppose retorted the other but ill work my hardest to be given the handling of this affair for it strikes me that it will prove a sight more difficult than either of us guesses this rooms a rum one aint it and that pack of cards arent there for nothing then there is the dead womans dress and the landladys queer conduct oh you can bet inspector theres a jolly lot more in these things than meets the eye and im the man to find out what they all mean you can blow your own trumpet i see said lackland dryly gebb laughed in nowise embarrassed my trumpeters dead from overwork he replied coolly if i dont praise myself no one else will however ill see tomorrow if the big wigs will let me run this show in my own way now you go and look round the house lackland and leave me here to examine the room what about the body asked the inspector dominated by gebbs strong will well let it lie here as it is until the doctor comes i told that policeman who brought mrs presk to the station to knock up an md by george sir one would think you were inspector here spluttered the indignant lackland am i nobody youre a good fellowtoo good to get your monkey up for nothing you let me look after this murder myself ill do you a good turn some other time well ill let you have your own way for once youre no fool i will say muttered lackland and withdrew to look through the house he knew that gebb was very clever and in his heart was not unwilling to avail himself of the detectives assistance therefore he left him to his own devices and set out to seek mrs presk in the kitchen having found her he made her show him the house but judiciously refrained from commenting on her late conduct he left the elucidation of that to gebb left to himself the detective examined the dead woman and the room with minute attention to detail keeping up a running commentary the while on his discoveries he had a habit of talking aloud when alone as if to emphasize his opinions and while examining the boudoir soliloquized with appropriate actions like a stageplayer the furniture is quite in order he murmured his keen eyes roving hither and thither therefore there can have been no struggle the murderer was no intruder but was expected a visitor perhaps a friend helet me presume the criminal to be a manhe no doubt entered and was kindly received by the deceased here is a bottle and two glasses with wine in each so the two were friendly enough to drink in company there is a chair on either side of this table whereon the cards are laid out the dead body remains in the one nearest the wall so i expect the visitor sat in the other with his back to the door were they playing cards i think not as in that case the whole pack would not be laid out in this fashion i have it cried gebb smiting his open palm with his fist the visitor was telling miss ligrams fortune he placed the cards in that position and told her to draw one she drew the ace of spades which yet lies in her lap and when face to face with the omen of death he killed her here the detective paused to consider if he was correct in assuming the assassin to be a man fortunetellingespecially by cardsis usually indulged in by the other sex but would a woman however cruel have so brutally strangled her unsuspecting hostess andas it may be assumedfriend gebb examined the chair on which the visitor had sat and found traces of tobacco ash cigarette ash he pronounced it after an examination the quality is fine and quantity small the visitor was a man and he was smoking hm that is not like a professional fortuneteller such a one would be too desirous of impressing his dupe to spoil the gravity of the situation by smoking the man must have been a friend and he probably told the womans fortune in this way to throw her off her guard let us look further the chair in which the dead body was lying stood some little distance from the hangings of the wall these as gebb discovered on further examination had been draped back with a cord to reveal a small oil painting but the cordwhich had a loop at either end to slip over a brass nail concealed beneath the hangings of satinhad been deftly removed not torn from its peg and flung round the victims neck on the floor behind the chair gebb picked up a halfburnt cigarette which had smouldered out with this in his hand he returned to the centre of the room and looked once more at the cards these attracted him strangely without doubt the fortunetelling was a trick he said aloud the man set out the cards and while his victim was selecting one he lighted a cigarette and rose to stroll round the room not suspecting any dangerwhich shows by the way that she must have trusted himhis victim let him pass behind her chair while there he slipped the loops of the cord off the nail then when she turned up the deathcarda pure coincidence no doubthe threw the cord over her head and choked her before the poor wretch had time to call out for assistance he then robbed the body at his leisure and left the house its as clear as day presuming that the murderer had gone out by the front door gebb left the room and went into the passage to his surprise he found that the front door was locked but as the detective noted not bolted he must have locked it after he left the house thought gebb and no doubt did so to prevent intrusion and a too sudden discovery of his crime i expect he threw away the key when outside in the front garden most probably ill look before he could put his design into execution which he intended doing by passing out the back way mrs presk arrived downstairs with the intelligence that inspector lackland was still searching the upper portion of the house for traces of the assassin but could find nothing and no one so said she i expect the wretch ran away after killing poor miss ligram by the front door gebb informed her and he locked it after him did he said mrs presk with a stare now thats queer why asked the detective sharply because miss ligram always kept the front door locked and the key in her pocket that was one of her queer ways which i never could abide without a word gebb returned to the yellow boudoir and searched in the pocket of the dead woman sure enough he found therein a large key which mrs presk immediately declared to be that of the front door gebb was puzzled as this discovery upset much of his previous reasoning in that case the man could not have cleared out by the front he said as not having the key he could not lock the door after him let us see the back door he may have escaped in that direction the back door was locked said mrs presk promptly i had the key in my pocket when i went to the lecture was the door locked when you returned asked gebb more puzzled than ever yes sir it was i had no thought that anything was wrong until i came upstairs and saw the corpse though to be sure added mrs presk suddenly i fancied it strange that the lights should be burning so late in miss ligrams boudoir i saw them from the road you know mr gebb and the sight gave me a turn i can tell you he must have got out through a back window murmured gebb indeed he didnt sir when i brought tilda out of her faint in the kitchen i looked at all the windows in the basement they are all bolted and barred proper tilda and mes both careful on account of burglars gebb pinched his chin and shook his head in a perplexed manner after which he walked to the window of the yellow room and examined it carefully it was fastened by a snick the position of which showed that the window was closed and could not have been used as an exit let alone the danger of the cove being seen by a chance policeman and taken up as a burglar mused gebb what about the upstairs windows mrs presk theyre all locked sir mr inspector examined every one then the man must be in the house still was gebbs final conclusion he isnt insisted mrs presk with a startled glance over her shoulder weve looked under all the beds and into all the rooms and cupboards unless he is like a sparrow on the housetop i dont know where he can be well there doesnt seem any way by which he could get out said gebb in a vexed tone did you hear any sound in the house when you arrived home no i didnt sir i went up to see if miss ligram was ill as i noticed that her room was lighted up then i saw the corpse and called tilda who ran up and fainted she aint got my nerves mr gebb did you lock the back door when you came in lawks no sir tilda and me was in such a flurry to see if miss ligram was ill that we just left the door anyhow when you went upstairs was the door closed to i think so replied mrs presk after a pause for tilda banged it to but it wasnt locked ill take my dying word on that when you came for the police did you leave by that door yes i did by the back door as miss ligram kept the front one locked was it closed when you went out mrs presk looked up suddenly rather alarmed no sir it wasnt said she in startled tones it wasas you might sayajar aha said gebb triumphantly then you may depend upon it mrs presk that when you came home the assassin was in the house in the house gasped mrs presk lor sir it aint possible yes he did not know where to find the frontdoor key and discovering that the back door was locked he just hid himself in the kitchen until you and the servant went upstairs to look on his handiwork then he slipped out to escape the consequences mrs presks knees gave way and she was fain to sit downas far away from the dead body as possible however its past believing she moaned rocking herself to and fro lord what an escape tilda and mes had from being strangulated ugh she shuddered look at that poor soul sir aint it enough to freeze your blood did it freeze yours that you ran out of the room asked gebb hoping to take her unawares no awasnt that whispered mrs presk turning pale but i was afeard of what asked the detective rather puzzled of you sir was the unexpected reply indeed then you know something about the matter yes issued from the landladys pale lips ii noticed something what did you notice i darent tell you you must mrs presk rose and hastily made for the door before she could reach it gebb had placed his back against it you dont leave this room until i know what you are hiding im hiding nothing burst out mrs presk havent you got eyes she pointed towards the dead woman look she cried look chapter iii a woman without a past as desired gebb looked at the gaily decked figure in the chair and tried to find out what mrs presk meant well im looking he said at length but im blest if i can see anything of course you cant cried the landlady hysterically triumphant cause they aint there what arent there the diamonds diamonds repeated gebb with a start as he noted that the dead woman wore no jewellery had she diamonds i should think she had said mrs presk sitting down again stars for her hair rings bracelets and the loveliest necklace you ever sawjust like dewdrops with the sun on them she wore her jewellery every night and all to eat her chop i saw them diamonds on her afore i went to the lecture and when you came back they were gone every one of them replied mrs presk defiantly and when i noticed itfor to own up mr gebb i didnt notice they were gone till i was here with you talking about her dressbut when i did notice i ran out of the room cause i was afeared you might say tilda and i stole em nonsense why should i say that oh there aint no tellings said mrs presk with a toss of her head was that why you made all that howling yes it was sir and i ran out to the kitchen to ask tilda if she had noticed if the diamonds were gone when we came in first for i was that flurried i didnt look for em and does tilda say the diamonds were gone yes i dessay the murdering villain who killed the poor dear stole em i wish i had the hanging of him oh you may assist me to put the rope round his neck said gebb well mrs presk ill come and see you tomorrow and you must tell me all you know about this woman in the mean time i think i hear the doctor coming the detectives ears had not deceived him for the approaching footsteps were those of the doctor escorted by the policeman who had met mrs presk he entered in no very good humour at being knocked up at so late an hour however the looks of the corpse and the appearance of the room both astonished and interested him and he made his examination it took only a few minutes for him to decide that the death had taken place shortly before or after ten oclock and must have been almost instantaneous when the examination was concluded gebb and the inspector left the house in charge of the policeman and returned to the station to make their report while the prosaic lackland set down the bare details of the case for the information of the authorities gebb mused over the events of the night and pondered what was best to be done under the circumstances as yet he had gained no information from mrs presk about her lodger but intended to examine her on the morrow when she was somewhat recovered from the strain of the late events in the mean time gebb fancied that the strange room designed and furnished by the dead woman might turn out a more important factor in the matter than at present appeared even if mrs presk did prove to be ignorant of miss ligrams pastwhich was extremely unlikelythe strongly marked and eccentric taste of the lodger as exemplified in illumination colouring and furnishing might provide a sufficiently stable basis for operations in a word gebb considered that the most promising clue to the mystery was the predominance of the colour yellow in the sittingroom criminal problems as he knew had been solved by slighter means as lackland surmised gebb being high in favour with the authorities as a detective of no ordinary capabilities had little difficulty in gaining their consent to taking charge of the case the inspector made his report gebb his application and after the due formalities had been complied with the detective found that the responsibility of tracing miss ligrams assassin lay solely on his own shoulders whichas he comfortably assured himselfwere quite capable of bearing the burden he was the more pleased with his employment as the grangebury murder case promised to be one of those mysteries which he loved a dead woman a strangely furnished room a pack of cards these were the elements of the case and so far as gebb could see at present there was no cluesave the lavish use of the colour yellowto the past of the victim or the identity of the assassin in mrs presk lay his sole hope of gaining intelligence likely to lead to some practical result so at eleven oclock next morning gebb in an anxious frame of mind was once more on the scene of the murder and in the presence of his principal witness in the searching light of day mrs presk was more uncomely than ever tall gaunt angular and dressed in the worst possible taste she presented few of the alluring graces of her sex to have wood and won and lived with this strident amazon the late mr presk must have been a suitor of no ordinary courage however she made an excellent witness as her brain was clear her courage high and she had not a morsel of imagination moreover her hysteria of the previous night had disappeared she answered gebbs leading questions in a cutanddried fashion without discursive rambling after her own private opinions but with all this the examination and the details obtainable therefrom proved to be anything but satisfactory considering the businesslike instincts of detective and widow a more meagre result can scarcely be conceived for how long has miss ligram been lodging with you was gebbs first question put in a form which appeared to assume that the victim was still in existence for three months replied mrs presk referring to a dingy little book with which she had furnished herself in anticipation of the ordeal she came to me on the first of may last she left herefor heaven i hopeon the twentyfourth day of july so as you can see for yourself mr gebb she has been with me two months and twentyfour days neither more nor less and there aint no court of law as id swear different in she came in answer to an advertisement i suppose no she didnt contradicted the widow i dont advertise its low i put a card in the window and it was that card which made miss ligram apply here for board and lodging she applied continued mrs presk consulting her book on the twentyninth of april and i agreed to take her on the thirtieth so that she entered my house on the first of may why two days delay because i couldnt make up my mind about taking her in she offered you too little on the contrary mr gebb she offered me too much no wonder you thought her eccentric said the detective with irony but kindly explain the position more fully i asked her three pound a week for parlour bedroom fire and light which is little enough im sure as everything in my house is of the best to my surprise miss ligram offered to pay me sixjust doubleon condition that i allowed her to dismantle the front room and refurnish it herself did she give any reason for this singular request she said she liked her own goods and chattels about her replied mrs presk and though at first i did not fancy the idea of clearing out the parlourwhich was most handsomely furnishedyet on thinking over the matter i decided that double the money i asked was not to be despised i therefore agreed to miss ligrams terms and on the last day of april i dismantled the parlour on the first of may miss ligram came in a van and came in a van interrupted gebb profoundly astonished yes she rode beside the driver and he assisted her to set out the parlour in the style you saw it was all done in a day by the pair for miss ligram would not let me help perhaps she was afraid of your asking the driver questions as to where she came from suggested gebb shrewdly she might have saved herself the trouble said mrs presk grimly i did speak to the driver and asked that very question only to find that he was deaf and dumb queer murmured the detective rubbing his nose she took good care to hide her past i wonder why i dont snapped the landlady with feminine malevolence its my opinion that miss ligrams past was not respectable hm i must say it looks like it what was the name on the van there was no name mr gebb the vanpainted yellow with one grey horse and a redheaded driver deaf and dumbwas the private property of miss ligram it was not the first time she had moved that yellow room about and the widow nodded significantly why are you doubtful of miss ligrams past well said mrs presk taking time to answer this question you can only judge a persons past by a persons present and miss ligram knew too many shady people for my taste shady people echoed gebb pricking up his ears at this hint of a clue what sort of people fortunetellers conjurors spiritualists and suchlike sir ah gebb recalled the spreadout pack of cards so she was rather superstitious superstitious cried mrs presk casting up her eyes she was a very pagan for omens and talismans and consultation of cards there wasnt a fortuneteller in london she hadnt down here at one time or another to read her hand or question the stars or look into the crystal ball or spread out the cards she was a perfect gold mine to those swindlers believing all their lies like the poor benighted heathen she was what did she particularly seek to know the future was the landladys curt reply no doubt returned gebb dryly and her own future at that but was there any particular aim in her questioning yes said mrs presk with a burst of confidence there was i found it out from one of her fortunetelling visitors she wanted to know if she would die by violence so said gebb drawling out the word reflectively in the german fashion and was a violent death predicted it wasby the fortuneteller i asked mr gebb and sure enough the prediction came true though as a rule i dont believe in such rubbish still it was queer she should die with the ace of spades in her lap a fortuneteller was with her on the night she was killed said gebb after a pause how do you know sir questioned mrs presk eagerly because the cards were laid out and the deathcard was in the lap of the corpse now i believe that this man by the way said gebb breaking away from his original speech did miss ligram smoke not to my knowledge rejoined mrs presk promptly she was a lady in her habits some of em was queer but they were all genteel indeed they were its not out of keeping with wellbred habits for a lady to smoke corrected the detective mildly many ladies do nowadays but asaccording to youmiss ligram did not smoke herself it is probable that her visitor was a man i found the stump of a cigarette near the chair when he got behind it to strangle her to strangle her repeated mrs presk horrified do you think this fortuneteller killed her yes i do i believe firmly that attracted by her diamonds he verified his own prediction and murdered her in the most coldblooded fashion impossible mr gebb he was a friend of hers ah you know the man cried gebb pouncing down on this admission no i dont cried the landlady in rather a nervous manner for one of her iron composure but i know she had a visitor on that night she told me she had a friend coming but she didnt say if it was a lady or a gentleman it was because miss ligram expected this person that she sent tilda and me to the lecture sent you to the lecture said gebb emphasizing the first word well she didnt exactly send us explained mrs presk reluctantly but she gave me two tickets and suggested that we should go knowing her habits and always willing to oblige i went and took tilda what do you mean asked gebb staring at the landlady mrs presk explained herself more clearly on occasions miss ligram was ashamed of her superstitions i think sir for three or four times she got me and tilda out of the house while she consulted her swindlers once said mrs presk consulting her book it was the crystal palace again two seats at the adelphi earls court exhibition three weeks ago and the local lecture last night but we came back always to find her in bed until this last time concluded mr presk with a shudder a strange woman commented gebb thoughtfully so you never found out where she came from no sir she was as close as wax i called her the lady from nowhere you know nothing of her past nothing she might have come from the moon for all i know of her you saw no letters photographs nothing interrupted the landlady emphatically i saw nothing then said gebb rising briskly i must stick to the clue of the yellow room chapter iv the five landladies the journalist is the true asmodeus of the day and is quite as fond as that meddlesome demon of interfering with what does not concern him he invades the privacy of our lives unroofs our houses reveals our secrets and trumpets forth things best left untold to the four quarters of the globe gebb had an especial abhorrence of this magpie habit of the press as he averred with much reason that the excessively minute details of criminal cases set forth in the newspapers put the illdoers on their guard and warned them of coming dangers with the result that they were easily able to evade the futile clutches of the hands of justice yet in the instance of the grangebury murder the publication of details had a singular result no less than the assisting of right against wrong as soon as the circumstances of the crime became known the reporters of every newspaper in the metropolis flocked to paradise row with expansive notebooks eager eyes and inquiring minds they surveyed the house questioned the police interviewed mrs presk and gave outline portraits of the landlady and her servant the yellow boudoir especially attracted their attention and stirred their imagination to descriptions of eastern splendour it was hinted that its magnificence was on more than a kingly scale it was compared to the celebrated room in one of balzacs romances and its furnishing and appointments were minutely detailed in glowing descriptions exhausting the most superlative adjectives in the english tongue also the unknown history and strange death of its occupant were commented upon guesses were made as to her identity and reasons were given for her secretive life for her strange belief in and consultation of charlatans and fortunetellers and all those cunning gipsies who live by the gullibility of the public appeals were made in these articles to the deaf and dumb driver to appear and declare the mystery of the yellow van the yellow room and their queer owner in short as the journals were in want of a sensation they made the most of this material supplied by chance and england from one end to the other rang with the tidings of miss ligrams death miss ligrams boudoir and miss ligrams mysterious life and all this trumpeting and noise gebb the enemy of the press heard with singular complacency indeed with pleasure and satisfaction as a rule i hate these revelations said he to one who knew his views and wondered at his equanimity as in nine cases out of ten they do more harm than good by placing the criminal on his guard but this is the tenth case where it is advisable to make the details of the crime as public as possible i rely on these descriptions of the yellow boudoir to trace miss ligrams past life in what way demanded the inquirer in the way of the yellow van replied gebb promptly as mrs presk truly observed the hard fact of that van shows that miss ligram was in the habit of moving from place to place with her tent and setting it up after the fashion of an arab in whatever spot took her fancy now when those other people who have had the yellow boudoir set out in its tawdry splendour under their roofs read of miss ligrams death and recognize the description of her strange room they will come forward and detail their experiences of the lady so in one way and another we may be enabled to trace miss ligrams past life back to a startingpoint it is the only chance i can see of gaining any knowledge within the week events of a strange nature justified the judicious belief entertained by the astute detective letters in female caligraphy were received at scotland yard stating that the writers could give certain information to the police concerning the murdered woman also a few days later decayed females of the landlady genus presented themselves in person to detail their experiences of miss ligram and her eccentricities from all these personal and written statements it appeared that for four years more or less miss ligram had been moving from one part of london to another in no one place she had remained longer than six months and in each her conduct and mode of life had been the same she arrived regularly in the yellow van and having obtained permission from the various landladies at the cost of paying double the rent demanded as regularly set up and furnished her yellow boudoir as in the latest instance of the grangebury episode she consulted fortunetellers spiritualists and shady people of a like nature departing at the end of each tenancy without a word as to her destination it would seem from this evidence that the woman was consistent in her eccentricities and conducted her strangely secretive life on the most methodical principles one thing which seemed of a piece with the dead womans desire for concealment was that in every place sheso to speakcamped in she gave a different name each appellation being stranger than the last and all apparently of her own manufacture she figured at hampstead under the name of margil in richmond she was known as miss ramlig when housed in st johns wood she called herself milgar and at shepherds bushbut for the sake of clearness it will be advisable to let the several landladies speak for themselvesfive persons five pieces of information more or less similar and five obviously madeup names so much for the past of miss ligram mrs brown of west kensington stated that she knew the deceased under the name of miss limrag she arrived at mrs browns in the month of may and after a six months tenancy departed in the month of october in the same year mrs brown was ignorant as to where she come from and equally at a loss to declare whither she went both in coming and going miss limrag used as a means of transport the yellow van and during her residence she inhabited the yellow room of her own furnishing for the consulting therein of the fortunetelling fraternity mrs kane testified that a lady who called herself miss milgar arrived in shelley road st johns wood on the first day of november and left the district in the last days of april her conduct during her six months stay was similar to that described by mrs presk and mrs brown on the evidence of such conduct and the facts of the van and boudoir both yellow in colour mrs kane had no hesitation in declaring that the murdered miss ligram of grangebury was her eccentric lodger miss milgar the information given by miss bain of crescent villa hampstead showed that the name assumed there by the wandering lady was margil and that she took possession of her lodgings there in the month of november having arrived according to her custom in the yellow van while the lodger of miss bain she gave herself up to the study of dreambooks and the interpretation of visions during her occupancy of crescent villa the landlady in spite of all efforts could find out nothing about her past or discover where she came from and the socalled miss margil departed with her furniture towards the end of april she left no address miss lamb resident at richmond entertained the unknown from november to april she knew her by the strange name of ramlig and always thought her weak in her mind owing to her queer mode of life and belief in omens when miss ramlig made any boastful speech reflecting on her worldly prosperity she would touch wood to avert the omen absit omen umberufen in a good hour be it spoken nimporte these words and phrases were continually on her tongue and she was a slave to all forms of superstition she would not walk under a ladder if she spilt salt she threw a pinch over her shoulder an unexpected meeting with a magpie a hunchback a crosseyed person or with a piebald horse either made her rejoice in the most extravagant fashion or threw her into a fever of apprehension she was not communicative and resisted all miss lambs attempts at social intercourse during the whole period of her stay no words were spoken and no event occurred likely to throw light on her past nor when she departed did miss lamb discover whither she intended to go in coming in staying in going miss ramlig was a mystery the owner of myrtle bank shepherds bush a birdlike spinster called cass informed gebb that a certain miss migral lodged with her from the first of may to the end of october she arrived in the van spoken of by the other witnesses she paid double rent for the privilege of dismantling a room and therein set up her tentlike habitation of yellow satin furnished with cane chairs and tables illuminated with candles and perfumed with incense she was said miss cass superstitious beyond all belief actually divining by teacups and believing in the future as foretold by the position of the tealeaves after the fashion of illiterate servantgirls miss migral never went to church she hadso far as miss cass knew no bible in her possession but read books dealing with fortunetelling and necromancy one of her favourite volumes was the book of fate another the book of dreams and she appeared to have an insatiable desire to know the future but for what reason miss cassin spite of all effortswas unable to discover this strange creature departed with all her worldly goods for some unknown destination during the last days of october mrs presk was the last landlady who received this mysterious woman and knew her as miss ligram she arrived at paradise row at the beginning of may and met with a violent death three months later mrs presk was as ignorant of the womans past as the other landladies had been she arrived from nowhere and no doubt would have departed six months later in an equally mysterious fashion but in the middle of her grangebury tenancy a violent death put an end to her further wanderings gebb heard all this evidence which was monotonous from its sameness with much satisfaction and great attention by means of the details afforded by the five landladies and mrs presk he traced back the wanderings of the dead woman to the month of november but further back he was unable to go for lack of information in spite of all publicity given to the case notwithstanding advertisements and his own private efforts no other witnesses came forward to give evidence as to the past of miss ligram so finding he was at a dead stop the detective resolved to standat all events for the presenton the information he had already acquired for his own private information and guidance he tabulated an account of miss ligrams names addresses and former landladies together with the dates of her various rests as follows miss bain hampstead margil nov to april miss cass shepherds bush migral may to oct miss lamb richmond ramlig nov to april mrs brown west kensington limrag may to oct mrs kane st johns wool milgar nov to april mrs presk grangebury ligram april to july and at the foot of this table he noted the fact that on the night of the th july according to medical evidence at ten oclockthe socalled miss ligram met with a violent death at the hands of some unknown person so far so good but here gebbs information came to an end and beyond a few years knowledge of miss ligrams past he had no evidence to show him why she had taken to this mode of life or why her eccentric manner of living should have been cut short by violence ready as he was in resource the detective did not know how to act or in which direction to turn for information while thus perplexed he received a hasty note scribbled on a halfsheet of dirty paper it ran as follows guy street pimlico come and see me at once about the grangebury case i have solved the mystery and can hang the criminalyours simon parge chapter v a friend in need but that gebb knew the writer of this curt note which was hardly civil in its brevity he would have been much surprised at the untoward chance of its coming at so critical a moment to help him out of his difficulties as it was he felt more relieved than astonished and hastened to obey the summons without delay it was not the first time he had used mr parge as a fingerpost to point out the right path and in the present instance he was rather vexed with himself that he had not applied before in this quarter for advice and guidance but better late than never thought he while repairing his error and making up for his neglect by replying in person to the summons towards parge the detective stood in the relation of pupil to master for it was parge who observing his abilities had induced him to join the profession and had never ceased to praise and blame and help him on to the best of his ability for some considerable time parge had been a noted detective himself and he had retired within the last few years into private life owing to a tendency to obesity and an increase of years which forbade his further exercising his talents in the way of thiefcatching and assassinhunting the criminal fraternity had rejoiced rather too soon when they heard that their great enemy had retired on a pension for parge left behind him a worthy successor in the person of gebb and he still instructed the latter in particularly difficult cases where two heads were better than one mr parge by reason of his eighteen stone was chained to an armchair for the rest of his life but his brain was still active and he took a sufficient interest in scotland yard affairs to read all criminal cases and help his more active deputy to bring them to satisfactory conclusions the old detective sat in his house like odin on the airthrone andthrough the medium of the pressknew much that was going on in the shady section of society which he had watched for so many years frequently he instructed gebb how to act and what conclusions to form on slender evidence and the pupil when at a loss invariably turned to his master for a word of encouragement and explanation but that parge had forestalled him by sending the note gebb later on would have laid the case of the yellow boudoir before hisso to speaksleeping partner i guess the old man will be in a rage said gebb to himself as he hurried with all speed to pimlico i should have seen him before on the matter only it has bothered me so he says he has solved the mysterythat means he has discovered who killed miss ligram i dont believe itwith the greatest possible respect for simoni dont believe it the exdetective dwelt in a little house in a little square and passed his time usually in a huge armchair placed conveniently near the window so that he could survey the busy world from which he had withdrawn he was a daniel lambert for size and rotundity with a large red face like a full moon and an impressive girth which would have made the fortune of an alderman but his eyes were keen and bright and the brain pertaining to this manmountain of flesh was as active as one cased in the leanest of bodies he was clothed in a gaudyfigured dressinggown of blue and red wore carpet slippers on his large feet a smokingcap with a large tassel on his sparse locks and sat amid a litter of newspapers parge took in nearly every morning and evening journal in london and from dawn till dark read the police news cutting out all such cases as he deemed worthy of his attention in the evening he usually played whist with his wife and two cronies or kept the company enthralled by his stories of the scoundrels he had exposed and the underworld he had moved in mrs pargean anmic woman as slender as simon was stoutwaited on her husband and thought himintellectually and morally as he was physicallythe greatest of men she did all the housework with the assistance of a small servant and being an excellent cook had contributed not a little to the weight and size of her spouse by preparing those appetizing dishes which her simon loved the couple had a comfortable income a comfortable house and both enjoyed the best of health so that the parge household was as happy a one as could be found in london my word absalom said lean mrs parge when she opened the door youre going to have a bad time youve going to catch it simon saw you from the window and is getting up steam to receive you a series of growls proceeding from the near parlour proclaimed the truth of this warning and when gebb entered the presence of his master steam was got up so far that parges smokingcap came skimming past the head of the visitor gebb picked it up and brought it to parge who received him and it with a growl of wrath at parges feet lay a pile of newspapers some open some folded some with evidence of scissors work and some quite whole on a near table there lay a large volume bound in red cloth which gebb recognized as one of the series of books in which parge noted down the more important cases and stored his newspaper cuttings he wondered if the old man had it at his elbow to throw at him for parges fingers evidently itched to send the book after the smokingcap but as he refrained from further violence gebb concluded that the volume had been placed within reach of its owner for some purpose connected with his visit he was right as subsequent events proved oh growled parge glaring at the young man so youve thought fit to come at last i couldnt come sooner simon protested gebb taking a chair ive been worried out of my life by this grangebury case and what good has all your worry done you fool youve found out nothing indeed i have ive traced back miss ligrams life to the year she isbut i forgetyou dont know the case dont i retorted parge sharply i know a deal more than you can tell me i suppose you are in difficulties over the matter gebb admitted that he was and i candidly confess that i do not see my way out of them he added with an anxious look at parge the fat man grunted if you had come to me in the first instance i could have saved you a lot of trouble can you explain the mystery simon i can if i couldnt i wouldnt have sent for you do you know the motive for the committal of the crime i do ive employed my wits to some purpose i can tell you and the name of the assassin yes didnt i say in my letter that i had solved the mystery you fool and where he is to be found continued gebb exhaustively for the first time parge replied in the negative there you have me he grumbled scratching his chin i know where he should be but i dont know where he is it will be your business to find him if youll give me a clue to his whereabouts ill do my best was the meek reply of the pupil i cant said the exdetective frankly i did my best to hunt him down four years ago before i retired and i failed ho ho so this cove has been in trouble before not only in trouble but in prison on what charge asked gebb with openly expressed surprise on a charge of murder what is this assassination of miss ligram his second crime it is replied parge enjoying the astonishment of his visitor but this manill tell you his name later ondid not intend to kill miss ligram but he did kill herstrangled her not miss ligram said the fat man obstinately ligram was an assumed name i know that simon she has passed under half a dozen names so the papers say just run over the names gebb did so promptly giving the names in order margil migral ramlig limrag milgar and ligram good now absalom what strikes you as strange about these names they are all invented said gebb after a pause quite so assented parge and their invention does credit to the imagination of the lady do you notice that the same letters differently placed are used in every instance anagrammatic said gebb with a nod precisely she manufactured all these false names out of her real one a very ingenious idea simon and what is her real name gilmar replied parge slowly miss ellen gilmar of kirkstone hall near norminster hants for quite two minutes gebb sat in silence looking at his chief in blended wonder and amazement try as he might he could not guess how the fat man had come by this knowledge what he with the use of his limbs and the power of the law had failed to discover this invalidas he might be calledhad found out without moving from his armchair in a darker age gebb might have judged parge to be gifted with necromantic power or divination by second sight are you certain of this he asked in a hesitating voice quite certain cried parge furiously quite certain im not a fool but how did you find out by exercising my memory and joining the past with the present in what way asked gebb still perplexed what clue had you the clue of the yellow boudoir the yellow boudoir repeated gebb recalling his own fancy yes said parge gravely twenty years ago in a room furnished in the same fashion in a room under the roof of kirkstone hall there was a murder committed in this book parge here laid his hand on the large volume there is a full account of the trial of one marmaduke dean for the murder of john kirkstone and the crime was committed in the yellow boudoir but what has a crime committed twenty years ago to do with the assassination of miss ligi mean of miss gilmar everything miss gilmar only reaped as she sowed you must hear the story in full before you can see the connection but to put the matter briefly you must understand that dean was convicted of killing kirkstone and was sentenced to death afterwards as there was some doubt about the absolute justice of the verdict the death sentence was commuted to penal servitude for life dean swore that he was innocent and that the accomplishment of the crime had been brought about by the machinations of ellen gilmar he swore if his life were spared to escape from prison and kill the woman who had placed him by her craft and cruelty in the dock about four years ago the man did escape from dartmoor prison and it was dread lest he should keep his word which drove miss gilmar from lodging to lodging under different names for some reasonbest known to herselfshe chose to dwell in a room furnished and draped similar to that in which the first crime had been committed it was reading the description of that room which put me on the right track and you believe that miss ligram and miss gilmar are one and the same person asked gebb breathlessly i am certain of it on the authority of the yellow boudoir and you think that dean murdered her yes i believe that dean kept his word but what was his reason vengeance said parge opening the red book listen i will tell you the case after my own fashion and you shall learn the reason why miss ligram was strangled at grangebury chapter vi the crime of kirkstone hall it sometimes happens that a youthful spendthrift becomes an aged miser and hoards money in the same extreme fashion as formerly he wasted it john kirkstone was a fair example of this species of human chameleon as his fathers heir he drained the estate of all ready money and squandered the same in london without regard to economy or even reason in this riotous life he was encouraged by a former college companionone marmaduke deanwho even went to the extent of borrowing money of kirkstone and so became his debtor for a large sum dean subsequently married a lady of fortune and repaid a portion of the money but either could not oras was more probablewould not discharge the whole on this point kirkstone who needed money for his pleasures quarrelled with his friend and the pair parted to meet no more for some years it would have been better for both had they never renewed their youthful friendship as might be expected old squire kirkstone was by no means pleased with his son and did not relish leaving his large fortune to one who probably would waste it in a few years the hall and its surrounding acres were entailed and were bound to pass into john kirkstones hands but the old man possessed a large income acquired by speculation which was at his own disposal wrathful at his spendthrift son he resolved to leave this personal property to his only daughter and accordingly when john became squire on the death of his father he found that his sister laura was in possession of a good income while he had to be content with a dwelling far too large for his means and several farms whose tenants did not always pay their rents the shock of this discovery was unpleasant but salutary in the first place kirkstone renounced his london profligacy and associates and came to live at the hall in the second he insisted that his sister should dwell with him and pay a handsome yearly sum for the privilege and in the third he invited his first cousin ellen gilmar to be his housekeeper laura kirkstone who was a weakbodied and weaknatured girl readily consented to remain at the hall and pay what her brother demanded and as readily welcomed her cousin ellen as mistress of the household a post for which she herself had no great love having thus arranged matters kirkstonethough not yet fortybecame as penurious as formerly he had been wasteful and in this system of economy was ably assisted by his new housekeeper a shrewd coldhearted skinflint laura in derision called ellen mrs harpagon after molires miser and well did miss gilmar deserve the name she was a little black active woman with a neat figure and a somewhat pinched white face her eyes were hardlooking her lips were thin and she was a perfect skinflint in the management of the household even kirkstone inclined as he was to economy grumbled at times about her excessive economy but as the months went by he fell gradually into her saving way of living and the hall soon gained a name in the county for all that was mean and niggardly the larder was always kept locked the servants were ill fed and the occasional beggars who came to that forbidden door were not fed at all scraping and screwing and hoarding of money became the order of the day and kirkstone soon found that he was redeeming his former waste at the cost of a hard and somewhat hungry life however the habit of living thus penuriously became confirmed and both he and mrs harpagon vied with one another in discovering new methods of saving money the only person in the hall who did not relish this extreme economy was laura kirkstone the attitude adopted by kirkstone towards his wealthy sister was a fairly amiable one having a strong will he compelled her weaker one to bow to it and kept a sharp watch on her lest she should marry some one of whom he did not approve and so take the moneywhich he looked upon as rightfully his ownout of the family many a young man would have been glad to marry miss kirkstone both for her money and good looks for in a pinkandwhite sort of way the girl was pretty but kirkstone invited none of these wouldbe suitors to the house and turned a cold shoulder to them in public laura was forbidden even to speak to them and being kept closely to her own home lived in the gaunt grim hall like an enchanted princess guarded by two ogres and none of the young knights who wished to marry her had sufficient courage to brave the black looks of kirkstone or the acidulated sneers of his amiable housekeeper and cousin such was the position of affairs at kirkstone hall when marmaduke dean again entered into the life of his former friend it was the death of his wife which led to deans visit to kirkstone hall he had squandered the fortune of the unhappy lady and had treated her with so much coldness and neglect that she had died of a broken heart leaving him a little son dean promptly placed the child with some distant relatives and being poor again looked about him for some means whereby he could procure money recalling the easygoing and generous disposition of kirkstone he resolved to apply to him for aid quite oblivious to the fact that he was already in his debt to this end he one day presented himself at the hall and was astonished to find that its owner from a generous friend had changed into a miserly curmudgeon kirkstone not only refused to help dean but demanded immediate repayment of the monies already due dean seeing that only trouble would come of his application was on the point of withdrawing so as to save himself the danger of being sued for the lent money when a new idea entered into kirkstones knavish brain which made him detain dean at the hall as a necessary element to bring it to fruition the scheme was none other than the marriage of laura to the disconsolate widower and comprehended a division of her fortune between the brother and the proposed husband an amiable arrangement which really amounted to robbery laura herself forced kirkstone to adopt this plan by reason of her refusal to let him handle the fortune which had been left to her by their father like most weakminded people she was singularly obstinate on some points and being cunning enough to see that her sole hold over her brother lay in retaining command of her money she always evaded his proposals to manage her investments beyond the income he derived from the sum she paid for board and lodging kirkstone had nothing to do with these monies of which as he frequently stated he had been robbed naturally he was angered to think of his loss and tried several times to bully laura into surrendering her fortune the result of this illjudged conduct was that laura met force by cunning and taking a dislike to her brother executed a secret will whereby she left the whole of the money to ellen gilmar in this case there was no honour among thieves for the housekeeper tricked her master and cousin by keeping secret the fact of the will and when kirkstone tried to marry his sister to dean he was quite unaware that ellen for her own selfish ends intended to thwart the match if she could furthermore a new and unforeseen obstacle arose to complicate matters for it chanced that both laura and ellen fell in love with dean the scamp was a handsome man with a plausible manner and laura was quite willing to marry him and to settle half her fortune on him receiving in return a presentable husband with a damaged reputation it was agreed between kirkstone and dean that when the marriage took place the latter should discharge his debt to the former and also pay over a certain sum of money by way of commission on the marriage settlement so far all went well and kirkstone invited dean to stay at the hall until the marriage took place and all pecuniary arrangements between them were settled it was then that ellen threw prudence to the wind and lost her heart to dean the result of this feminine weakness was that ellen did violence to her instincts by relaxing her stingy rule she kept the table supplied with better food while dean stayed at the hall she paid more attention to her dress humoured the man she loved in every way and altogether behaved in a manner so alien to her natural self that laura became suspicious the end of this folly was that laura discovered ellens secret and lost her temper over it she accused dean of making love to ellen and ellen of encouraging his advances kirkstone was told this by his sister and he seeing a chance of his losing money by the marriage not taking place had a stormy scene with ellen he threatened to turn her out of the hall as a pauper whereat the woman turned at bay on her cousin and revealed the truth about the secret will if this marriage takes place she declared i lose money as well as you and if i can influence laura to refuse dean i shall certainly do so if it comes to the point we shall see who is the stronger you or i the upshot of this conversation was that kirkstone lost his temper altogether and went to bully his sister into revoking her will had he only remembered that the same result would be attained by the marriage taking place he would have urged on the match and defied ellen instead of acting thus sensibly he vented his rage on dean and accused him of encouraging the folly of the housekeeper then dean lost his temper in his turn and quarrelled with kirkstone and laura so in the month of july it chanced that the four people inhabiting kirkstone hall quite misunderstood one another and for the time being were hardly on speaking terms dean stormed at kirkstone as trying to thwart the proposed marriage kirkstone blamed dean as having encouraged the love of ellen and laura in her weak way fretted herself ill over the whole disturbance only ellen the cause of all the trouble retained her placidity she did not move an inch from her position she had an end to gain and in one way or another she was determined to gain it it was while things were in this unhappy state that the country was startled by the news that kirkstone had been murdered by dean the tragedy took place in a certain room strangely furnished by the mother of the present squire which was known as the yellow boudoir it was a favourite apartment with kirkstone who had turned it into a smokingroom on the night of the th of july kirkstone and dean were drinking and smoking in this room when apparently they renewed their quarrel with a fatal result kirkstone was found dead in the room at midnight with a knife in his heart this knife had been brought from americait was a bowieknifeby dean and his name was marked on the handle ellen deposed at the inquest that guessing the pair might quarrel she had gone downstairs shortly before midnight to implore them to part then she had seen dean leave the yellow boudoir in a state of alarm and alcoholic excitement afterwards kirkstone asked her to tell dean to come down again she did so and dean rejoined kirkstone when they parted for the second time ellen went to the smokingroom and found kirkstone lying dead with deans knife in his heart the result of this statement was that dean was arrested for the murder of his friend and mainly on the evidence of miss gilmar he was found guilty the man protested his innocence in vain and would have suffered the extreme penalty of the law but that a sympathizing section of the public not satisfied with the judgment prepared a memorial to the home secretary the sentence was then commuted to penal servitude for life the immediate result of the crime was that laura on seeing the dead body of her brother and learning that the man she loved had murdered him received such a shock that within three months she was dead as her will in favour of ellen had never been revoked the former housekeeper came in for all her money also as no male heirs of the kirkstone family were left miss gilmar by the will of her greatgreatgrandfather and as the daughter of john kirkstones paternal aunt inherited the estates therefore ellen gilmar lost the man she loved but found herself a wealthy and lonely woman only one thing she feared and that was a violent death for dean had declared that his unjust sentence was due to her lying evidence and that if his life were spared he would some day kill her apparently he had done so such was the statement of the kirkstone hall crime which was undoubtedly in some secret way connected with the more recent murder of ellen gilmar at grangebury the question wasdid dean strangle her out of revenge since he had escaped from prison about the time miss gilmar left the hall on her lonely wanderings and was at large to carry out his threat if dean murdered kirkstone he would have no compunction in committing a second crime to revenge himself on the woman who had delivered him into the hands of justice if dean did not murder kirkstone it might be that enraged at his unjust sentence he had killed miss gilmar to punish her for the lying evidence which had smirched his name and ruined his life in either case there was the threat to murder miss gilmar which on the face of it implicated the convict in the grangebury murder deeming the man guilty of the first crime parge declared that he had committed the second putting aside the first crime gebb maintained that dean was innocent it now remains to discover which of the two is in the right chapter vii comments on the crime it must not be supposed that in informing gebb of these details in connection with a longforgotten crime parge gave the exact context of the newspaper reports he used them rather as notes to refresh his memory and detailed the somewhat barren information in a conversational manner adding suppressing and amplifying evidence in the way most necessary to convey a clear idea of the case to his hearer yet at the conclusion of his reading or rather narrative gebb was not satisfied to him the case seemed incomplete i know a good deal of what happened before the murder he said bluntly but very little about the crime itself you know all that was reported in the newspapers replied the fat man casting the heavy book on the table with some irritation probably but now i wish to know such details as were not given to the public you can supply them certainly ask what you like and ill answer youll arrive at an understanding of the case soonest that way gebb remained silent for a few minutes and watched parge lighting his pipe then he asked suddenly do you believe that dean is innocent of this kirkstone hall crime no replied parge deliberately i dont on what grounds on the grounds of his defence hm said gebb with an astonished look those are queer grounds on which to doubt a man well absalom you can judge for yourself dean declared that he was innocent they all do and no doubt having regard to this new crime he said that miss gilmar was guilty no he did not accuse her he ascribed the crime to laura what to the sister yes the mean hound to the woman he was about to marry is not such a foul accusation enough to make you believe the wretch to be guilty not quite rejoined gebb dryly a man may be a blackguard without being a murderer besides this laura seems to have been weakin fact halfwitted so dean might have had some grounds for his belief however if you can recall his defence i shall be in a better position to judge briefly replied parge his defence was as follows he declared that he was left alone with kirkstone in the yellow boudoir or rather smokingroom about halfpast ten oclock who left him and kirkstone alone the ladies they accompanied the two from the drawingroom and chatted with them for a few moments before saying good night what cried gebb suspiciously in spite of the disturbed atmosphere of the house and the quarrelling yes there existed it seemed a kind of armed neutrality and notwithstanding the situation the quartet were civil enough to one another i have my doubts about so improbable a situation said gebb shaking his head well and what took place after the ladies retired kirkstone and dean quarrelled over the marriage kirkstone it seemed began to taunt dean about his attentions to miss gilmar dean turned round and declared that he was not attached to miss gilmar nor for the matter of that to laura both women he said were in love with him and he could marry either without consulting kirkstone he furthermore swore that if kirkstone insulted him any more he would marry laura without her brothers consent and refuse to pay the money and no doubt at this point kirkstone lost his temper suggested gebb so dean declared and the quarrel reached such a pitch that dean killed kirkstone finished gebb quickly no replied parge he denied that he left the room according to his own story about eleven oclock and retired to his bedroom shortly before midnight when he was considering how to act ellen gilmar knocked at his door and said that kirkstone wanted to see him in the smokingroom dean descended and found kirkstone dead at first he was tempted to give the alarm but reflecting on the quarrel which must have been overheard by some of the servantsa fact afterwards provedand finding that the knife with which the crime had been committed was his own he fled back to his room then miss gilmar came to see what had occurredfound the dead body and gave the alarm she accused dean of being the murderer because she had left kirkstone alive when she brought the message and afterwards found him dead when dean fled from the room but how did dean implicate laura he declared that he had given her the bowieknife at her own request to prune some plants with in the conservatory now that is ridiculous cried gebb of course it is and a further proof of his own guilt ladies dont use bowieknives to prune plants dean however stated that he left kirkstone alive when he first retired to his room miss gilmar stated that her cousin was not dead when she conveyed the message to dean so for the defence it was maintained that between the time miss gilmar left kirkstone and the time dean returned to the yellow room for the second visit laura must have killed her brother with the bowieknife which she had obtained two days previously from dean but why should laura kill her brother because as prisoners counsel argued it was probable that after the last conversation kirkstone fancied that dean might not pay the money if the marriage came off so he resolved to stop it by exercising his influence over laura while there was yet time laura so dean declared must have revolted and killed kirkstone in a moment of uncontrollable anger still why should she bring the knife into the smokingroom if she committed the crime on the impulse of the moment dean did notcould notexplain that point replied parge with contempt all his defence was that he gave laura the bowieknife that he left kirkstone alive in the yellow boudoir about eleven and that when summoned by miss gilmar he found the man dead also that he held his tongue because he was afraid of being accused as there had been a quarrel between himself and kirkstone i dont wonder he was afraid said gebb thoughtfully and in any case his defence was extremely weak what evidence did the prosecution bring forward miss gilmar was their principal witness as she was the last person to see kirkstone alive she denied any knowledge of the bowieknife but stated that she had come downstairs to prevent further quarrelling kirkstone was alone but asked her to request dean to come back to the yellow boudoir she went up to deans room and asked him at first he refused but later on consented it was twenty minutes between the time miss gilmar left kirkstone alive and dean found his dead body one point of the evidence against dean was that blood was found on his shirtcuff he explained this away by stating that he had felt kirkstones heart to see if any life remained and so got his cuffs soiled with the blood from the wound what did laura say to deans accusation she denied it altogether but it was the horror of thinking that the man she loved deemed her capable of such a foul crime which was one of the causes to bring about her death she was halfwitted you say said gebb after a pause no replied parge sharply i dont say so she was weakwitted and softnatured but as i truly believe perfectly sane i see that you think she might have killed her brother in a fit of insane rage well that was deans defence or at least part of it but laura when in the witnessbox declared that after leaving dean and her brother in the yellow boudoir she had not left her room all night and in this statement she was supported by miss gilmar now you can see for yourself gebb that dean was rightfully convicted well said the detective reflectively it looks like justice but it may not be so for my part knowing what i do of women i should not be at all surprised to learn that miss gilmar was the guilty person some people suggested as much at the time said parge in no wise disturbed by this suggestion but i did not believe it then and i dont now what possible motive could she have quite as feasible a motive as the one ascribed to laura replied gebb did not kirkstone threaten to turn her outofdoors was it not his intention to deprive miss gilmar of dean by marrying him to laura and did he not try to induce laura to revoke her will in favour of the housekeeper oh there are plenty of motives but when do you suggest she committed the crime why between the time dean left the yellow room and returned to it again i dare say she had a row with kirkstone on her own account and killed him then went up to dean with a lying message to implicate him in the matter but objected parge again why should she accuse dean he was the man she loved yes but he did not love her and no doubt since she was old and illfavoured he showed his dislike to her advances too plainly i fancy that it was a case of a woman scorned and that miss gilmar revenged herself by accusing dean however this is all theory added gebb with a shrug and as such is worth little dean was condemned on miss gilmars testimony and no doubt intended to kill her if he could escape although added the detective inconsequently i dont believe he did why not said parge emphatically he did escape and i believe he did kill her as sure as i sit here it was dean who strangled that wretched woman humph humph said gebb perplexed im not certain i am absalom why she expected to meet with a violent death at his hands that was why she left kirkstone hall and concealed herself in these various lodgings under several false names besides as i read in the papers she constantly consulted fortunetellers as to whether she would die by violence a behaviour which showed how lively were her fears that is all very well admitted gebb but there was no struggle there was wine drunk a cigarette smoked by the murderer and miss gilmar let him wander about the room what does all this prove that she knew her visitor and trusted him she could not and would not have trusted the man who had sworn to kill her he might have gone to her disguised as a fortuneteller suggested parge that is rather an imaginative suggestion said gebb smiling by the way when did dean escape towards the end of and you say yourself that miss gilmar began her wanderings in that year quite so and i admit that she fled to escape deans vengeance but i am not so certain that he killed her remember the diamonds were stolen so it may be a vulgar murder for robbery after all no said parge sticking obstinately to his point dean killed her out of revenge and stole the diamonds to provide himself with the means of escape have you been round the pawnshops not yet but every pawnbroker has been warned also i have sent detectives over to amsterdam and to paris to watch if the diamonds turn up very good said simon with a nod if dean tries to pawn the jewels youll catch him i dont believe the thief is dean i do and also that he killed miss gilmar well and what do you intend to do now go down to kirkstone hall and see the original of the yellow boudoir good and afterwards interview the solicitor who conducted the defence for dean you mean the barrister no i dont i mean the solicitor who was deans solicitor mr prain of bacon lane you wont get anything out of him absalom said parge warningly hes as close as wax who was deans counsel asked gebb ignoring the hint clement basson replied parge youll induce him to talk freelyfor a drink oh he is dissipated in a sort of way a bohemian barrister ruined his career through love of pleasure has had a few briefs but not enough to pay and lives on a small income gebb noted this nutshell biography in his pocketbook and prepared to take his departure he had a parting glass with the fat man and after promising to advise him of all that took place in connection with the case he left the house and tell me cried parge after him obstinate to the last tell me when you find dean chapter viii mr prain solicitor when gebb left parge he intended to go down to norminster with as little delay as possible and look over kirkstone hall there he hoped to learn further details of miss gilmars life and to ascertain if possible whether she had other enemies besides the man she had condemned to lifelong imprisonment owing to her grasping disposition and penurious mode of life it was probable that she had been extremely unpopular and it might be that amongst those who disliked her might be found one who had carried the feeling so far as to kill her on considering the circumstances of the case gebb could not bring himself to believe that dean was the assassin all the same he was anxious to ascertain the hidingplace of the convict and make certain of his innocence of this second crime with the first which was before his time he had nothing to do on second thoughts however the detective judged it would be wiser to call on mr prain beforehand and learn his opinion on the matter also gebb wished to discover why the solicitor had not come forward to identify the body of miss gilmar from the description of the yellow boudoir so often referred to in the papers he must have been aware that the socalled miss ligram was none other than ellen gilmar if so why had he not assisted the police to trace the womans past history it was mainly to elucidate this pointwhich might be an important one in solving the mysterythat gebb called at the office in bacon lane mr prain proved to be a small leanfaced man with a sharp pair of eyes and a hardlooking mouth he was neatly and spotlessly dressed in the plainest fashion and his office a somewhat dingy place was as clear and trim as himself when gebb sent in his card mr prain had only to glance at the name to know that his visitor was the scotland yard detective and told the clerk to show him in at once it was with his hard little face set like a mask that prain received the officer of the law for he had quite expected sooner or later to receive such a visit and was not unprepared you wish to see me mr gebb said the solicitor in a low crisp voice yes sir about a case you dealt with twenty years ago oh then you have no questions to ask about the case of today said prain composedly and he darted a sharp look at his visitor to see how the shot told do you know my errand asked gebb somewhat uncomfortably for he was by no means pleased to find that the little solicitor was prepared for his reception and could not conceive why it should be so yes mr gebb i do if you had not called on me it is probable that i should have paid you a visit it is two weeks since the crime was committed mr prain so you have had ample time to call no doubt returned prain dryly but it so chanced that i was abroad in italy however when i saw the description of the yellow boudoir i hastened back at once you guessed by the description of the yellow room that the murdered woman was miss gilmar i did but may i ask how you found it out an exdetective told me he traced her identity by the same means as you did but for his recollection of the room i should have known nothing oh so the yellow boudoir gave parge the clue said prain thoughtfully yes but how did you guess that i referred to parge he was the detective employed by the prosecution to hang my client but he did not succeed for dean still lives ah does he do you know where he is to be found asked gebb sharply no replied prain shaking his head i know that he escaped about four years ago and that miss gilmar out of fear of him left kirkstone hall lest he should kill her i know no more you know one thing at least retorted gebb astonished at the coolness of the man that dean killed miss gilmar i deny that said prain sharply then after a pause he added do you know why i came back to england on reading about her death no i do not how should i and why i intended to call on you no youll have to answer your own questions mr prain then ill tell you said the solicitor slowly i wish to find out if miss gilmar left a confession behind her stating why and how she killed john kirkstone it was for that reason i returned so quickly miss gilmar kill kirkstone cried gebb thinking of his own suspicions why even your unhappy client did not accuse her my unhappy client as you call him was a fool retorted prain coolly he thought that laura kirkstone was guilty whereas i am sure that the housekeeper killed her master but i could not bring the crime home to her and dean was condemned to penal servitude on account of a murder which i am certain he did not commit when i heard of his escape i thought he might find out miss gilmar and make her confess he always intended to escape if possible for that purpose gebb thought for a moment perhaps he killed her after all because she would not confess said he with some hesitation no replied prain dean was wild and wasteful and between you and me mr gebb not altogether as wellbehaved as he might have been but i am sure he was not the man to commit a murder believe me he is as innocent of this second crime as he was of the first well said gebb thoughtfully i have my doubts regarding his guilt in both cases i agree with you going by the story told to me by parge that miss gilmar killed kirkstone but who killed miss gilmar some unknown person for the sake of the diamonds returned prain promptly the diamonds yes miss gilmar took possession of laura kirkstones jewels and amongst them were some valuable diamonds i read in the papers that miss gilmar wore those diamonds nightly and that when her dead body was discovered the diamonds were gone true enough replied gebb it might be a case of robbery as you say but if the murderer tries to dispose of those diamonds by sale or pawning ill be able to catch him i may tell you said prain after some reflection that the most valuable of lauras jewels was a diamond necklace which i see by the reports in the papers was stolen by the murderer now that necklace was given to laura by dean and miss gilmar had no right to it but how could dean who was almost bankrupt afford to give laura a diamond necklace the necklace was a family jewel said the solicitor quickly and i have a description of it this i shall have copied and give it to you it may assist you to trace the necklace and thereby snare the murderer answered gebb thank you mr prain the description you speak of will be very serviceable and now i wish to ask you a few questions about miss gilmar if you dont mind replying to them why should i mind retorted prain raising his eyebrows parge gave me to understand you were as close as wax said gebb pointedly i use his own words prain shrugged his shoulders i dont deny it he said quietly why should i twenty years ago i was trying to save dean from being hanged while parge was doing his best to place the rope round the mans neck naturally i was on my guard and refused to tell parge all i knew your position is a different one mr gebb as with me you desire to learn the name of miss gilmars murderer i am quite at your service and you can ask me what you please thank you then tell me who inherits miss gilmars property do you mean her real or personal estate asked prain both replied gebb promptly well then you must know that the kirkstone estates were entailed but the entail ended with that first murder so i heard from parge mr prain in the male line yes in the male line afterwards by the will of the kirkstone who bought them and who lived some hundred and fifty years ago they pass on through the female line now the male line died out with john kirkstone so that the estates passed by the will to the female line represented by laura when she died ellen gilmar inherited through her mother who was kirkstones aunt on the paternal side now that miss gilmar is dead the estates pass to john alder a barrister who inherits through his mother a distant cousin of the kirkstones if he died edith wedderburn would inherit who is she another cousin yes even more distant than alder she is now at kirkstone hall looking after it for miss gilmar who placed her there so far as the personal estate is concerned miss gilmar can leave it by will to whomsoever she pleases have you the will yes but i cant open it save in the presence of those likely to inherit miss wedderburn and alderin short the relatives whom do you think the money is left to its not my place to say said prain with sudden stiffness gebb saw that the little solicitor knew the contents of the will but he was bound by professional etiquette and could not disclose them well he said covering his disappointment with a cough we may leave that out of the question tell me about miss wedderburn i have told you replied prain sharply she is the caretaker of kirkstone hall and is very poor is she very pretty extremely pretty ho ho said gebb in a jocular tone in that case she must have lovers she has two answered prain dryly one is john alder what the heir yes if she marries him she will still be mistress of kirkstone hall but she wont said prain rubbing his chin with a vexed air for the simple reason that she likes her other lover better who is the other lover an artist called arthur ferris he is poor but handsome good looks wont make the pot boil said gebb sententiously well im not particularly anxious for further information about her love affairs what i wish to know is if miss wedderburn corresponded with miss gilmar i cant tell you that i dont know do you think miss wedderburn is aware of her cousins death said gebb putting the question in another form its improbable as she would have written to me on the subject had she known by the way is the body buried of course it is two weeks since the murder true i forgot said prain thoughtfully i wonder if alder knows about her death he cant know unless he traced her by the yellow boudoir oh alder doesnt know much about that room and its crime as he belongs to the younger generation and the story is almost forgotten however ill write to him on the subject it is necessary that he should learn his position as speedily as possible if only on account of the will that is your own concern said gebb rising still you might arrange for me to have an interview with him as he might throw some light on the subject i fail to see how he can said prain raising his eyebrows miss gilmar never corresponded with him during her travels if any one will know about her it will be miss wedderburn ah im going down to see her said gebb putting on his hat ill have a look at the original of the yellow boudoir at the same time i say said prain as the detective moved towards the door well replied gebb turning if you see edith ask about her lover which of them alder or ferris said gebb stolidly dont mention the name of either repeated prain slowly but ask about her lover thenwell youll see what will come of your question the detective gazed steadily at the solicitor what do you mean he demanded struck by the significance of the mans words and look youll find that out when she answers how will she answer demanded gebb quite mystified ah said prain with a long breath you ask and see chapter ix kirkstone hall the day following his conversation with the little solicitor gebb left waterloo station for norminster in hampshire and arrived at that quaint little town about midday on making inquiries he learned that kirkstone hall was a mile distant situate amid some woods near the banks of the avon as it was a fine morning and gebb was fond of walking he used his own legs to reach his destination and after a pleasant stroll through rural lanes and across flowering meadows he reached a pair of finely wrought iron gates which stood wide open the gates themselves were covered with red rust the lodge beside them was shut up and the stately avenue which curved upward between noble oak trees was overgrown with grass even on the threshold as it were of the estate gebb espied the ruinous economy of the late miss gilmar on coming in sight of the hall he found the hand of time still more heavily laid upon the works of man it was a quaint jacobean building of red brick set upon a slight rise and surrounded by stone terraces from the main body two wings spread to right and left but the windows of these were all closely shuttered the hall door was also closed andso far as gebb could seeno smoke curled from the stacks of chimneys the terraces were grassgrown the gardens untended and in disorder and the whole place had a silent melancholy aspect as though the soul of the house had departed it was the palace of the sleeping beauty enchanted and spellbound and it seemed as though there were a curse on the place and no wonder said gebb looking at the gaunt mansion grim even in the sunshine seeing the kind of people who lived in it and the crimes they committed he ascended the steps and rang the bell but before the sound had died away he was aware of a brisk step approaching and turned to see a young lady walking along the terrace on the right she was tall and dark with fine eyes and a handsome face her figure was shown to perfection by the trim tailormade costume which she wore in her hand she carried a silverheaded cane and walked smartly towards the detective with the air of a woman fully alive to the importance of time when she spoke her voice was deep and full but the matter of her speech was remarkably businesslike on the whole gebb judged miss edith wedderburnfor he guessed that this was the young lady referred to by prainto be a clever plainspoken woman with few of the weaknesses of her sex to hamper what she conceived to be her duty good day said the lady with a comprehensive glance may i ask what you want i wish to see miss wedderburn well you see her now i am miss wedderburn can i do anything for you yes replied gebb becoming as curt and as businesslike as herself you can give me a trifle of information can i said miss wedderburn dryly that entirely depends upon my humour and what you want to know also why you what to know it who are you my name is absalom gebb i am no wiser interrupted the girl with pointed insolence of new scotland yard detective finished gebb coolly this time his reply made a decided impression on his hitherto cool auditor the rich colouring of her face vanished as by magic and she became pale even to the lips nevertheless she forced herself to smile with some composure and controlled her emotion by a powerful effort of will startled as she was she even attempted to speak lightly and what does mr absalom gebb detective wish with me she said in a low voice her eyes fixed on the mans face he wishes to ask you a few questions said gebb in the same vein about what about whom about miss ligram ligram i dont know the name said edith calmly who is miss ligram the owner of this place you are wrong there mr gebb the lady who owns this place is called miss gilmar i am aware of the fact but it suited her to take other names while she lived while she lived repeated miss wedderburn raising her voice in surprise what do you mean i mean that miss gilmar is dead dead murdered murdered oh god when where in a suburb of london called grangebury on the twentyfourth of last month edith looked rigidly at the detective with horror in her dark eyes and for the moment seemed scarcely to comprehend his news she appeared to be genuinely astonished and shocked yet her next question conveyed to gebb a hint that she was not altogether unprepared for the information did he kill her she stammered laying her hand on gebbs arm he who asked the cunning detective trying to trap her into a hasty speech dean marmaduke dean said the girl breathlessly what do you know about marmaduke dean everything no doubt i know more than you do have you never heard of the murder which took place in this house in the yellow boudoir yes ah you know the story cried miss wedderburn suspiciously i do and i have come down to see you about it please take me inside miss wedderburn and show me the yellow boudoir in which dean murdered your cousin kirkstone my cousin kirkstone you seem to know a great deal of our family history mr gebb said edith drawing herself up i know as much as a report of the kirkstone murder could tell me and as much as prain the solicitor knows you know mr prain yes i was with him yesterday but ill learn no good from this desultory conversation miss wedderburn please take me indoors and we can discuss the matter quietly i am the detective in charge of the case so you need have no hesitation in telling me all you know i know nothing cried edith vehemently nothing it is for me to judge of that retorted gebb dryly the keen look he gave her and the significance of his tone and words seemed to startle the girl she glanced defiantly at his watchful face and strove to match his gaze with a steady look of her own but whether from fear or modesty her eyes fell and she turned away to obey his request and lead him within doors gebb followed her in silence along the terrace and round the corner of the house until they both paused before an open french window which led into a pleasant sunny apartment of no great size before entering edith who had evidently been considering his last speech turned to excuse herself mr gebb she said with an air of great dignity your words seem to imply that i know more than i dare tell i assure you that such a suspicion is unjust and unfounded the intelligence of miss gilmars death is terrible and unexpected to me and any aid i can give you to bring the assassin to justice you shall have whatever questions you ask me i will answer whatever you desire to see in this house i will show you but in justice to myself i must ask you not to credit me with guilty knowledge my dear young lady i am the last person in the world to do so said gebb quickly i do not for a moment suppose that you know anything of your cousins unhappy death i disclaim the sentiments with which you credit me and i must admit that there is no necessity for you to exculpate yourself as you are doing i am not exculpating myself in the least rejoined miss wedderburn coldly but you detectives seem to be so suspicious that you see ill where none exists gebb laughed you have been reading detective novels said he indulgently believe me we detectives are not so black as the novelists paint us but as i said before this desultory conversation is not useful i would rather see the yellow boudoir edith nodded and led the way into the house gebb followed her through the sittingroom which faced the terrace and down a wide passage on the wall of which hung many pictures mostly ancestral portraits at the end of this passage his guide unlocked a door with a key selected from a bunch which dangled at her girdle and threw it open so that gebb could pass into the room before her he did so without hesitation this is the yellow boudoir said miss wedderburn following the detective it was in this room that the unfortunate mr kirkstone was killed twenty years ago by dean not by dean replied miss wedderburn sharply from all i have heard dean is as innocent of that crime as you are then who is guilty asked gebb artfully i am not a detective said edith moving towards the window so i cannot give you an opinion if you will permit me i will admit air and light so that you can see the room to its fullest advantage when they entered the boudoir had been in a kind of semidarkness as the shutters of the one window were closed but now miss wedderburn threw these open and the sunlight poured in the dust raised by their feet danced in motes and specs in the suns rays and gebb dazzled by the strong glare felt his eyes somewhat painful however they soon became habituated to the flood of glorious light and he looked with deep interest at the original of the room which he had seen in paradise row the apartment was larger than that which had been occupied by miss gilmar in grangebury but in every respect the furnishing and appointments were the same as she had carried out her whim with the utmost care the furniture in place of being cane was chippendale the window and door were differently placed and the colouring of the whole room was more subdued and mellowed by time but the predominating hue was the samethe carpet was yellow sprinkled with bunches of pale primrose flowers the walls were draped with costly hangings of golden tint and from a domed ceiling of drawn silk depended an exact copy of the arabian lamp studded with knobs of yellow glass the furniture was cushioned and covered with yellow silk the vases and metalwork were of brass there was even a brazen tripod and chafing dish standing in the same position as its imitation had occupied in paradise row the main difference in the room lay in the absence of books knickknacks flowers and magazines which showed that it was not in daily use otherwise all was the same gebb almost fancied that some genii of the lamp had transported the grangebury palace to norminster it is just the same he said aloud having taken in these details what is the same asked miss wedderburn who was standing near the window this room it is similar to that in which miss ligi mean in which miss gilmar was murdered the girl looked puzzled you are making a mistake she said it was kirkstone who was killed here not miss gilmar oh but i am referring to the room at grangebury returned gebb quickly miss gilmars lodgings you mean asked edith still perplexed yes her room was furnished like this impossible from what i knew of my cousin she would not have spent the money in furnishing a costly room nevertheless she did replied gebb coolly of course the imitation was somewhat gimcrack and done on a cheap scale but for all that i assure you the resemblance between the original and the copy is marvellous strange muttered edith sitting down on a primrosehued couch i wonder why ellen tell me all about this terrible murder she broke off allfrom the beginning chapter x strange behaviour after some reflection gebb concluded that miss wedderburn was quite ignorant of the causes which had led to her cousins death also of the details and of the death itself he therefore told her as concisely as possible the story of the tragedy from the time mrs presk had been brought to the grangebury policestation down to the visit he had paid to prain the solicitor some points in the story he suppressed others he amplified but on the whole he gave her a very fair and unprejudiced account with attentive ears and her eyes fixed on the face of the narrator edith sat listening her hands clasped loosely on her lap several times she asked him questions but as a rule let the account flow on uninterruptedly when gebb ended she heaved a deep sigh whether of relief or pity the detective could not say and rose to pace up and down the room evidently she was more moved by the tragic fate of her wretched cousin than she chose to admit gebb having told his story waited for her to recover and comment on the matter poor ellen said miss wedderburn at length but speaking to herself rather than to her companion a miserable ending to a miserable life but i am not astonished how is that said gebb with a sharp look at her surely the tragedy is unexpected enough miss wedderburn shook her head ellen always said that sooner or later she would be murdered by mr dean yes replied edith quietly by mr dean oh said the detective taking a long breath i thought you believed in the innocence of dean so i do i never said i didnt i only remarked that ellen declared mr dean would kill her well she has been murdered and in the most barbarous manner do you say dean is the criminal do you said edith answering one by asking another i dont know what to think replied gebb crossly neither do i responded miss wedderburn and then for quite two minutes there was a dead silence it was broken by gebb was miss gilmar unpopular in these parts he asked very unpopular the people round here called her mrs harpagon from her miserly habits did you like her miss wedderburn no replied the girl coolly i did not neither did she like me there was no love lost between us she wanted a caretaker and i wished for a home my staying here is a simple matter of business but surely you are sorry to hear of her murder i am not utterly without heart mr gebb although you seem to think so yes i am sorry i would be sorry for any one who met with so cruel a death had miss gilmar any enemies asked gebb impatient of this fencing which kept him at a distance i told you she was unpopular said edith slowly but i dont know that she had any enemies bitter enough to murder her except dean of course she replied unmoved always except mr dean then he must have killed her its not impossible retorted miss wedderburn coolly gebb a rare thing for him to do lost his temper completely madame he cried in a rage will you or will you not answer me plainly there is no need to raise your voice sir i am answering you but not plainly what do you call plainly asked edith with a provoking smile you know what i mean said gebb testily i call black black and white white you call both a kind of grey i believe they are grey when mixed however i see what you mean mr gebb so do not lose your temper you wish to know why miss gilmar left this place how she left it and why i am in charge yes i shall be glad of the information very good said edith calmly then you shall hear my history it will be just as well for you to tell it said gebb dryly at least so far as concerns miss gilmar every detail is of value in connection with this case please go onand he took out pencil and pocketbook i am an orphan said miss wedderburn taking no notice of this action as i lost my parents some five years ago i was then eighteen years of age and at a school in canterbury but on the death of my father and mother i was unable to continue my education therefore as i had no parents no friends and no money i was in anything but a pleasant position did your father leave no money inquired gebb with sympathy if he had i should not be here sir my father died so poor that there was hardly enough money to pay his funeral expenses i tell you all these details mr gebb so that you may understand my position here when i found myself thrown on the world i did not know what to do as i was unable to obtain a situation either as companion or governess then i remembered ellen gilmara relative of my fathers who i knew was living a quiet life in this place on the money left to her by laura kirkstone i wrote to her and explained my position and as she no doubt found life here extremely dull she asked me to stay with her as a companion but without a salary the offer did not attract me greatly nor did ellen on our first interview but i was in that unenviable position when beggars cant be choosers so i was forced to accept her offer i have been here for the last five years and on the whole i have no reason to complain of my lot in life was miss gilmar kind to you edith shrugged her shoulders as kind as she could be to any one we quarrelled once or twice about what i dont see that you have any right to ask that question said edith quietly still to show you how candid i am i will answer it frankly we quarrelled about a certain mr alder what john alder the barrister yes said miss wedderburn rather surprised do you know him not personally but i heard about him from mr prain mr prain seems to have been very confidential however this gentleman wished to marry me and miss gilmar thought that i ought to accept him as he was the heir to the kirkstone estates and also because she intended to leave him her money without a provision for you oh said miss wedderburn indifferently ellen was not bound to leave me her money seeing that she had provided me with free board and lodging but she advised me to marry mr alder and so make certain of being comfortable for life but i did not like him so i refused to become his wife now i suppose he will turn me outofdoors would he be so cruel said gebb with a glance at her handsome haughty face he might and he might not he is much liked by his friends and i suppose has as much charity as most people but whatever he decides i cant stay on here now that he is the master does he know that his cousin is dead i cant say i dont think so unless like myself and prain he discovered her death through the newspaper descriptions of the yellow boudoir hell find out soon ive no doubt said edith and come down to offer me a choice of being his wife or leaving the hall i shall certainly go but to continue my story i remained with miss gilmar and got on fairly well with her she told me all about the murder and her fears of being killed by dean often she congratulated herself that he was in prison and what did she do when she heard of his escape she was beside herself with terror and thinking he would come down here to murder her she determined to leave the hall she made all arrangements as regards money with her solicitor and asked me to take charge of this place i agreed and she went away over three years ago i have never said miss wedderburn with emphasis set eyes on her since did you know the course of her wanderings sometimes when she wrote to inquire if dean had made his appearance at the hall but as a rule i heard nothing and knew not where she was the last time she wrote was about six months ago but she did not say then where her next restingplace would be and as she was not inclined to be confidential i did not ask questions did you know that she carried about a duplicate of this room no not until you told me i never see the newspapers down here can you tell me why she did so it is hard to explain said edith with a puzzled look when ellen was here she sat constantly in this room and seemed greatly attached to it i do not know why seeing that it had been the scene of her cousins murder but i suppose she wanted to keep the threats of dean to kill her constantly in mind and so framed a duplicate of this room that she might not forget her danger and run the risk of being lulled into a state of dangerous security that would hardly account for her strange fancy for the room said gebb shaking his head i can supply no other reason answered edith reflectively ellen was very eccentric and one could not always account for her whims she was superstitious very believed in omens and fortunetellers and all kinds of rubbish yet i fancy she had not always been so weakminded it was the dread of a violent death that made her consult these people did she ever drop any hint about the murder she dropped no hint as you call it said edith stiffly but told me the whole story very plainly she quite believed that dean was guilty yet she might have killed kirkstone herself said gebb after a pause that is impossible she had no reason to do so and moreover if she had been guilty she would certainly have betrayed herself to me it is no use speaking ill of the dead mr gebb yet you cannot say that your cousin was a good woman perhaps not retorted miss wedderburn on the other hand i cannot say that she was a murderess well sir i have told you all i know and you see i cannot help you in any way i am not so sure of that replied gebb coolly i have not yet closed my examination edith flushed and looked uneasy i dont like that word she said in irritable tones it sounds as though i were a criminal in the dock that is a strong way of putting it miss wedderburn why not compare yourself to a witness in the witnessbox oh call me what you like cried the girl rising impatiently but let us finish our conversation as quickly as possible i have told you about miss gilmar about this room about mr alder i know nothing more nothing miss wedderburn think again i tell you i know nothing said edith now crimson with rage what do you mean by your hints i mean that you have another lover remarked gebb acting on the advice of prain but quite in the dark as to what it would bring forth miss wedderburn sat down promptly again on the couch as though her limbs refused to support her and the flush on her face gave place to a deadly pallor she shook in every limb as though overcome with terror arthur she faltered you know about her voice stopped and she fell back in a faint chapter xi the mad gardener gebb was not easily surprised being used by reason of his profession to traffic in mysteries but the unexpected fainting of edith at his apparently innocent question perplexed him beyond measure of course the girl had not told him the whole of her history so no doubt in the portions thus kept back lay the explanation of her violent emotion gebb being ignorant of the cause was amazed at the result hullo said he throwing open the window to admit fresh air there is something queer about this prain hinted that if i asked about her lover i might hear something strange and her actions speak quite as loud as words this fainting has some meaning in it well well i must revive her first and question her afterwards this was easier said than done as there was no restorative of any sort at hand miss wedderburn lay back on the couch motionless and white the image of death even the breeze from the open window could not restore her senses gebb was about to throw wide open the door and shout for assistance when through the window he caught sight of a man crossing the lawn and immediately hailed him loudly the man jumped round suddenly as though startled by the call and after some hesitation moved forward slowly and unwillingly to crane his head into the room he was a queer old creature with shaggy white hair and untrimmed beard and two glittering eyes set so closely together as to give him an uncanny look he was dressed in a suit of old clothes discoloured and rusty and with his elbows on the windowsill moped and mowed in a smiling vacant way at the detective at the first near glance gebb saw that the newcomer was not in his right mind here my man he said making the best of this doubtful assistant bring some water the lady has fainted the man grinned and turned his eyes towards the white face of edith over his own a shade passed with the result of altering it from gay to grave he even looked terrified and with a kind of hoarse cry pointed one lean finger at the unconscious girl is she dead did you kill her he asked in a harsh whisper no no replied the detective soothingly as he would speak to a child she has fainted bring some water kill her whispered the man nodding its a good room to kill people in we use it for that here i wont tell id rather see her dead than alive its better for her the graves the bed for a weary head hush bring the water cried gebb shrinking back from the horrible creature be off with you the madman shrank back in his turn at the peremptory tone of the detective and vanished with a nod just as a sigh sounded through the room the cool draught playing on the forehead of edith had at length produced its effect and with a second sigh longer than the first she opened her eyes and looked vacantly at gebb the detective caught her hand and slapped it vigorously whereat the girl sat up with an effort and her faintness passed away still her brain was not quite clear and she looked languidly at gebb as though she were in a dream what did you say she asked in a low voice am ihave iwhat is it and she passed a slow hand across her forehead you fainted miss wedderburn replied gebb softly yes i remember i fainted you asked about oh god i know and she covered her eyes with one hand before she could speak again a harsh cracked voice was heard singing in the distance the raven is the fowl for me he sits upon the gallows tree and bravely bravely doth he sing in a voice so low and rich while flaunting in a garb of pitch the murderers corpse does gaily swing ho ho ha ha he he he the raven and the gallows tree ah miss wedderburn shivered nervously as this gruesome ditty sounded nearer and put her fingers in her ears to shut out the singing it is martin with his fearful songs said she softly martin and who is martin asked gebb amazed at these extraordinary proceedings martin martin mad martin croaked the harsh voice and there at the window stood the crazy man leering in a fawning manner and holding a tin basin half full of water dipping his hand into this he sprinkled a few drops towards edith singing tunelessly the while weep till tears roll as a flood i baptise thee now with blood with an exclamation of annoyance edith rose and snatching the basin out of the mans hand shut the window hurriedly martin gave a frightened whimper and slunk away while his mistress soaking a handkerchief in the water bathed her pale face gebb judiciously waiting the development of events stood quietly by wondering but silent is this a lunatic asylum miss wedderburn he asked when she was more composed and he judged it judicious to recommence the conversation no of course not she replied irritably the man is mad but quite harmless martinmartini do not know his other name he is an excellent gardener and usually quiet enough although he will sing those gruesome songs all about gallows and murders todayfor some reasonhe is worse than usual he ought to be placed under restraint said gebb carelessly for he was too bent on questioning his companion to be distracted by a lunatic but this is not to the point may i ask what caused you to faint miss wedderburn the girl raised her head and directed a steady stare at gebb in my turn may i ask why you come here to question me she said defiantly i thought i explained my errand before replied the detective mildly i am here to learnif possiblewho killed miss gilmar i cannot tell you i know nothing about it until you gave me the news i was not aware even that she was dead yet you were not so surprised by the information as i expected that can be easily explained mr gebb said edith wringing out her wet handkerchief as i told you before i knew of my cousins fears she was perhaps pursued by mr dean when he escaped from prison with the avowed intentionit was reportedof killing her she left her homeas i knowin order to hide from him but it is possiblei say she added with emphasis it is possible that dean tracked her down and revenged himself for her conduct of twenty years ago you wish to learn who killed miss gilmar sir i tell you i do not know mr dean in my opinion is innocent but on the face of it i admit that appearances are against him perhaps if you find the man and question him you may arrive at the truth it is not improbable replied gebb coolly but we must catch him first still miss wedderburn your opinion of deans guilt or innocence does not explain your recent conduct to put a plain question miss what made you faint that is my business said edith haughtily but with averted eyes and mine too why should you faint because i ask if you have another lover besides mr alder i refuse to answer in that case observed gebb artfully there must be something wrong with arthur how dare you call him arthur flashed out miss wedderburn call who arthur asked gebb laying a trap for her hasty tongue mr fer she stopped and bit her lip hesitating as it would appear whether to tell the name or not after a momentary pause she evidently deemed bold speaking the safest policy for she continued calmly after all there is no reason why i should not tell you his name none in the world so far as i can see answered the detective with a shrug i know that his christian name is arthur but what is the surname of your lover miss wedderburn how do you know that i have a lover retorted edith answering one question by asking another how do i know that you have two lovers corrected gebb coolly because you told me about one named mr john alder and mr prain spoke to me about the other i came here with a certain amount of knowledge miss mr prain what has he to do with it i dont know im waiting for you to tell me edith clasped her hands together with a restless movement and walked up and down the room hastily suddenly as though making up her mind to the inevitable she stopped before the detective mr gebb she said clearly and distinctly i have no reason to conceal anything in my life i am engaged to a gentleman named arthur ferris whose occupation is that of an artist he has nothing to do with the murder of miss gilmarthat i swear there is no need to swear said gebb wondering at her vehemence but why did you faint when i asked you about him i thoughti thought you might suspect him faltered miss wedderburn in a low tone i know how suspicious you detectives are you seem to think that i know more than i tell you but you are wrongi do not i suspect neither you nor mr ferris said gebb quietly but it was so strange that you should faint at a simple question that i naturally wished to find out the reason well sir you know it now i know the reason you choose to give replied gebb significantly but you will excuse my saying that it is rather a weak one i can give no other you could if you wished then i refuse to give any other rejoined edith with a frown quite so replied gebb rising well there is nothing for it but for me to take my leavefor the present he added significantly this sudden cessation of gebbs questions alarmed edith more than the questions themselves had done and she looked uneasy once or twice she appeared about to speak but closed her lips again without a word and conducted gebb silently out of the house the detective was rather annoyed by this selfcontrol as the sole reason of his manoeuvre was to make miss wedderburn talk nine women out of ten would have done so and have defended themselves with many words but this girl was evidently the tenth and knew the value of silence however gebb was too experienced to show his annoyance and mentally resolving to question this sphinx on a future occasion when she was not so much on her guard he took his leave with a last warning you ought to have that mad gardener locked up he said looking up to miss wedderburn as she stood on the terrace else there will be another murder in the yellow boudoir oh martin is quite harmless replied edith calmly i told you so before so harmless that had he lived in grangebury i should have suspected him of killing your cousin responded gebb dryly and forthwith took his departure considerably puzzled as well he might be by the attitude of the young lady so far she had baffled him completely as he walked down the neglected avenue he heard the harsh cracked voice of mad martin piping a tuneless ditty and shortly afterwards met with the man himself face to face with his lean bent form picturesque rags and venerable white beard the man looked like lear insane and wretched when he saw gebb the creature stopped singing and broke into a cackling laugh which had little mirth in it gebbusually selfcontrolled and careless of impressionsshuddered at that merriment of hell are you in love with her too he asked the detective no replied gebb humouring the man why do you think so john alder came here and loved her said martin reflectively arthur ferris came and loved her i thought you might be a third but you wont win her heartoh no young arthur has done that tall straight dark handsome arthur with the mark of satan on his cheek the mark of satan repeated gebb puzzled by this description of ferris hist cried martin with uplifted finger he is a wizard and she a witch and they dance in the yellow room when the moon is up young arthur has a red mark on his cheek satan baptized him there with blood oh blood oh blood moaned the wretched creature nothing but blood a knife for you and a rope for me and death in the yellow room i am alive and you are dead but each hath gotten a tomb and with a long dolorous cry martin ran up the avenue swinging his arms leaving gebb to puzzle out his enigmatic verse as best he could chapter xii the diamond necklace gebb much to his disgust returned to norminster as wise as he had left it beyond meeting a lunatic and interviewing an obstinate young woman he had spent his time and money to little purpose and it was with a perplexed brain that he sat down to consider his future movements in the face of his failure he was at a loss how to act miss wedderburn with what looked like deliberate intention only repeated the story he already knew miss gilmar had confessed to a fear of dean she had fled from the hall on account of that fear her travels and hidings and extraordinary precautions had been undertaken solely to thwart the revenge of dean gebb was aware of these facts but there was nothing more in them likely to instruct him he had so far exhausted their capabilities what am i to do he asked himself for say the fiftieth time how am i to act in which direction am i to move miss wedderburn without any given reason says that dean is innocent prain is of the same way of thinking and so am i parge alone seems to believe in deans guilt and i dont agree with him the man himself may be able to supply evidence to reveal the truth but where is he to be found gebb could answer this question no more than he could the others he propounded and vainly racked his usually inventive brain to settle on some course likely to elucidate the mystery finally after mature reflection he resolved to call upon prain and ask him to explain the meaning of miss wedderburns fainting the lawyer had told him to ask a certain question and see what answer it would bring well he had done so and the answer was that the girl without any apparent cause had fainted perhaps prain knew the reason and since edith refused to reveal it his sole course was to question the solicitor so to prain the detective went full of curiosity two days after his return from the country the interval had been filled up in attending to business unconnected with the grangebury mystery but now gebb returned to it again and sought mr prain in the hope of learning something tangible but his spirits were very low well mr gebb said brisk mr prain after greetings had passed i have not been idle since i saw you last i have sent a description of that necklace to the police i have informed mr alder of miss gilmars death and i have received his instructions about the will there is a will then without doubt miss gilmar made her will before she left the hall in favour of mr alder said gebb yes of course by the will of kirkstones ancestor mr alder becomes possessed of the hall but miss gilmar has left her personal propertythat is the money which she inherited from laura kirkstoneto him also miss wedderburn i am sorry to say receives nothing poor girl she will have to leave the hall prain shrugged his shoulders that is at her own discretion he said coolly mr alder is in love with her so if she marries him she wont marry him interrupted gebb she is in love with and engaged to mr ferris ah she told you about that scamp she told me very little mr prain but she fainted when i mentioned the man under the very general description of a lover she fainted hum prain looked so serious and perplexed that gebb was impelled to question him further touching the matter why did she faint asked the detective bluntly i dont knowthat is i cant exactly say stammered the other gebb looked at the solicitor who in his turn stared at the carpet the ceiling at the papers on his desk anywhere but at his questioner mr prain he said seriously you are not treating me fairly i beg your pardon said prain nervouslyand as a rule he was not a nervous man i dont see how you make that out i do replied gebb sharply you know the reason of that fainting perhaps i do but i am not at liberty to reveal my knowledge the secret is miss wedderburns has it anything to do with this murder no replied prain decisively that it has not then why did you tell me to ask her about ferris because i wanted to be sure of something and that fainting has enlightened me cant you tell me more cried gebb with some indignation no i cannot answered prain bluntly get miss wedderburns permission and i will but even if you did know the knowledge would be of no use to you has miss wedderburn any theory about this murder not that i know of you saw her last mr gebb does she know who killed miss gilmar why not ask her said prain evading the question i did and i cant make out what she means she says that dean is innocent but wont give her reason now parge declares that dean is guilty well mr gebb perhaps he is indeed sneered gebb who was growing irritated last time i saw you mr prain you denied his guilt and i do so now cried prain warmly i believe as you do gebb that dean is innocent of both crimes he killed neither kirkstone nor miss gilmar i dont know what miss wedderburns reasons are but she is right to defend dean still added prain with a shrug i dont deny that many people look on the man as a murderer does mr alder believe in deans guiltin his double guilt yes he is sure of it you can ask him for yourself added prain looking at his watch hell be here soon ill be glad to meet him but what is your opinion about this crime i told you the last time i saw you replied the solicitor miss gilmar was murdered by one of those fortunetellers for the sake of her diamonds recover that necklace and you will soon trace the assassin its not much of an idea said gebb scornfully its the best ive got at all events retorted prain with heat i have done my best to prove its truth by sending a description of that necklace to the police i dare say the description is in the hands of all pawnbrokers by this time said gebb thoughtfully well we shall see what will come of it what about ferris ferris repeated prain in no wise astonished at this abrupt question well he is an artist and a bit of a scamp with whom edith wedderburn is in love i dont know why perhaps because he is a scamp women seem to like scamps for some reason best known to themselves is he handsome very tall and dark rather militarylooking has he a mark on one cheek yes a birthmark but not disfiguring how did you know about it that lunatic at kirkstone hall told me he called it the mark of satan by the way who is that man a gardener who used to live at the hall in kirkstones time i think the tragedy of the yellow room must have sent him off his head at all events he ran away after it occurred and only turned up a year or two ago quite mad why didnt they lock him up well you see miss wedderburn who is rather a strongminded young woman thinks kindness may cure him so she gave him back his old post of gardener if miss gilmar had been there i dont think he would have been allowed to stay i dont think either that miss ws experiment will be a success he sings the most gruesome songsabout murder and blood and the yellow room i know replied prain cheerfully i am afraid that last muddled his brain and inspired his muse he didnt sing or compose verse when i knew him but the mans a complete wreck he used to be rather handsome and stupid but his own father wouldnt know him now im sorry for the poor devil as now that alder owns the hall i dare say hell be kicked out and have to end his days in an asylum the best place for him in my opinion said gebb emphatically he is as mad as a march hare and not half so harmless hullo who is that knocking come in it proved to be a note from inspector lackland asking gebb to come down to grangebury in the first instance it had gone to scotland yard and as it seemed important had been sent on to the detective who had left word that he would be at prains in case he was wanted seems important said gebb reading it i wonder what lackland wants to see me abouteh prain but prain was not attending to him he was busy shaking hands with a tall broadshouldered man fairhaired blueeyed and altogether comely to look upon this gentleman was introduced to gebb by the name of alder whereby the detective was informed that he stood in the presence of miss gilmars heir and miss wedderburns lover alder on hearing gebbs name looked at him keenly and saluted him with marked cordiality i am glad to meet you mr gebb he said in loud and hearty tones indeed he was rather like a foxhunting squire than a barrister how are you getting on with the case of my poor cousins murder have you caught dean no answered gebb plainly and to tell you the truth i am not sure that dean is the culprit but if you knew what dean said about i know all that dean said interrupted gebb also that he escaped but for all that i do not think he killed miss gilmaror kirkstone either for the matter of that hum said alder thoughtfully i see you are of bassons opinion mr clement basson do you know him asked the detective i should think so replied alder smiling i have known him for years he was deans counsel in the kirkstone case i instructed him said prain complacently he believed in deans innocence as i did but unfortunately our united efforts could not get the poor devil off i think ill call on mr basson said the detective thoughtfully where is he to be found no blackstone lane fleet street replied alder promptly but what do you expect to learn from him his reasons for believing dean not guilty they are the same as mine cried prain and i dont know how his stating them over again can help you he does not know where dean is still mr gebb had better see basson suggested alder with conviction something may come of the visit will you call on me afterwards mr gebb and tell me what you learn from basson i am to be found in the temple and as you may guess i am most anxious that dean should be traced i intend to offer a reward of two hundred pounds for his capture i hope you will earn it i hope so too answered gebb much pleased but you are certain that dean is guilty if he is not i dont know who is replied alder emphatically and for the time being the conversation ended gebb left alder to consult with prain as to the necessity of exhuming the body of miss gilmar for identification and took his way down to grangebury to learn why the bluff lackland had written so earnest and urgent a note he found the plethoric inspector in a state of excitement bordering on apoplexy and wondered what could have occurred to stimulate the martinet to such unusual excitement that you gebb cried lackland the moment the detective put his nose inside the door george i am glad to see you its found sirfound what do you think of that hey what is found the name of the murderer no no but something as useful the diamond necklace said lackland slowly you dont say so cried gebb excitedly was it soldpawned pawned interrupted the inspector aaron and nathans harold street city it came into their possession the day after the murder the devil our assassinating friend lost no time who pawned it a young man who called himself james brown james fiddlesticks said gebb contemptuouslya false name what was he like tall dark handsome said lackland with military brevity aaron said that he put the necklace up the spout as cool as a cucumber he was hold on cried gebb eagerly had he a mark on one cheeka birthmark by george he had a purple spot but not large enough to spoil his looks i thought so said the detective joyously so it was arthur ferris did it arthur who asked lackland gruffly arthur ferris of chelsea artist he pawned the necklace he stole the diamonds he murdered miss gilmar hurrah weve got him chapter xiii arthur ferris the unexpected discovery that ferris had pawned the necklace spurred gebb to unusual activity no longer doubtful how to act he hastened to procure a warrant of arrest against the young man yet before doing so and to be certain that his belief was not a false one he called first at aaron and nathans these worthy jews he questioned closely concerning the necklace and the man who had pawned it the ornament corresponded in every way with the description furnished by prain and the individual on the evidence of his appearance and of the birthmark on his right cheek could not be mistaken for any one but ferris furthermore his connection with edith who in her turn was connected with the murdered woman gave colour to gebbs assumption that ferris was the guilty person i understand now why miss wedderburn fainted said gebb to himself she thought when i mentioned him as her lover that i had discovered the truth and feared for his safety no doubt having informed him about that necklace and miss gilmars fear of death he killed and robbed the woman in the hope that dean would be blamed if things were as gebb surmised ferris in hoping that his crime would be laid to the charge of dean displayed an amount of cunning hardly compatible with his disposal of the plunder he had accomplished the crime so cleverly and had escaped so mysteriously that gebb could not understand why he had pawned the necklace so openly the very next day under the obviously false name of james brown the rashness nullified his former caution for he might have guessed that information concerning the jewels would be sent to all pawnshops as a criminal ferris evidently had to learn the abc of his craft why did he not wait until the storm blew over before pawning the necklace murmured gebb much perplexed or at least take the stones out of their setting and sell them separately either in london paris or amsterdam discovery would have been more difficult in that case and why did he pawn them so hurriedly unless he intended to leave england but in that case edith wedderburn would have known of his intended departure and probably would have gone with him rum sort of cove he must be gebb in this manner argued the case for and against ferris for the young mans conduct displayed such a mixture of caution and rashness as to perplex the detective still it was no use as he well knew to waste his time in making bricks without straw when the arrest of the culprit might enable him to gain a frank explanation of these obviously silly actions so gebb on the evidence of the pawning procured a warrant and proceeded to take ferris in charge as a further mark of the mans folly he had given a wrong name but a right address and gebb proceeding to chelsea asked at an eden street house for mr brown only to be told that mr ferris was the sole lodger in it the nave simplicity of this novice in crime almost made the detective swear to his innocence on the spot confound it said gebb disconcerted by this the man has gone about the pawning so openly that i really believe he is guiltless of the crime either that or hes a born fool although even that is doubtful miss wedderburn is not the sort of woman to love an idiot although she does protect one seems to me as im dealing with a lot of crazy folk ferris chanced to be absent at the time of gebbs visit but was expected back every moment so on intimating that he wished to see the artist on a matter of importance and would wait for his return the detective was shown into the studio it was a bare apartment of some size with ample light but few decorations ferris seemed to be rather a hard worker than an artistic dandy for there were scattered around none of the knickknacks and bibelots which many painters love to collect there was a sprawling clayfigure near a carpeted das for the model specimens of work on the walls plaster heads and unfinished pictures lying about in disorder and on the easel beside a rusty iron stove a landscape picture in progress of painting altogether the studio looked anything but that of a sybarite and in no wise accorded with prains description of ferris as a scamp for scamps as a rule owe their doubtful reputations to their assiduity in gratifying all their tastes the best and the worst yet he must have been hard pushed for money to murder that old woman in order to rob her said gebb so if he is economical here i expect he is wasteful in other ways hullo heres a letter on the writingtable with the norminster postmark empty he added in disgust finding no letter inside yet it is from that girl i am certain the handwriting is that of a woman hum and yesterdays date i see by the postmark she had been writing to warn him she knows all about the matter i wish i could find the letter shes a deep one that girl and as sharp as a needle she wouldnt have bungled the murder as ferris has done with this doubtful tribute of admiration gebb calmly proceeded to turn over the papers on the writingtable and examine the drawers but he could find no letter from edith amongst the loose papers and the drawers proved to be locked which showed that ferris was a more cautious man than his conduct in pawning the necklace indicated how far gebb would have proceeded with his search or how successful he would have been it is hard to say for just as he was casting his eyes towards a bureau which he thought might contain papers likely to illuminate ferris and his dark ways the door opened and the man himself entered with a brisk step he appeared agitated and rather pale but on the whole composed and businesslike for a moment or so he did not speak but looked at gebb with no very friendly expression of countenance on his side the detective scrutinized the face of the newcomer with close attention to see in what degree he corresponded to the descriptions of prain and martin he beheld a tall and slender man with an intelligent expression and brilliant black eyes on his short upper lip there was a small pointed moustache which gave him a rather military appearance and on his right cheek a purple mark the size of a sixpence but whichhis skin being so darkdid not show very conspicuously he was dressed quietly and in good style and to all appearance was a man who respected himself too much to indulge in the profligacy with which he was credited by prain gebb was rather favourably impressed by him than otherwise and could not help regretting his errand i am told you are waiting to see me said ferris civilly may i inquire your business is your name arthur ferris it is may i ask what i arrest you in the queens name interrupted gebb laying one hand on the young mans shoulder and with the other drawing forth his warrant ferris turned white even to the lips and leaped back with an exclamation of alarm and surprise the detectives action seemed to amaze him arrest me why what for who are you my name is gebb i am a detective here is my warrant for your arrest mr ferris on a charge of murder murder repeated ferris much agitated as was natural you accuse me of murder there is some mistake people in your position always say so replied gebb dryly but there is no mistake you murdered a woman called gilmar on the twentyfourth of july last its a lie i no more murdered miss gilmar than you did that has yet to be proved sir here is my warrant and i have a couple of men outside in case of need however i have no desire to make trouble and if you come along with me quietly i shall use you civilly we can drive to the prison in a hansom ferris who was looking round wildly as though for some means of escape started and recoiled at the sound of the illomened word to prison he echoed hoarsely great god you would not take me to prison i am innocent i tell you i know nothing of this murder we have evidence to the contrary said gebb quietly and i advise you sir to hold your tongue anything you say now will be used in evidence against you i shall not hold my tongue said ferris with more composure there is nothing i can say likely to inculpate me in the matter i protest against your action i protest against being treated as a criminal you can protest as much as you like mr ferris but you must come with me you may thank your stars that i have not put the darbies on you give me your word not to attempt escape and well walk out arminarm no one will guess where you are going you see i wish to make matters easy for you i shall not try to escape said the unfortunate young man proudly as i have done nothing wrong if i must go to prison on this charge i must and i thank you mr gebb for your civility but i swear before god that i am innocent of this crime with this speech he resumed his hat and walked slowly out of the studio gebb followed forthwith and slipped his arm within that of ferris so that the pair seemed to be leaving the house in a friendly way two men were waiting at a distance but on gebbs nodding to them to intimate that his charge was amenable to reason they walked off and shortly afterwards the detective and ferris got into a hansom gebb directed the driver whither to go and then turned to comfort his companion for whose despair he felt extremely sorry certainly the young mans conduct did not suggest guilt cheer up mr ferris he said kindly if you are innocent you will soon be out of this trouble i dont know how ever i came into it replied ferris disconsolately you mean kindly mr gebb therefore in spite of what you say regarding my remarks being used against me i shall speak freely i did not know miss gilmar at all i never set eyes on her in my life and until yesterday i was not aware of her death i see miss wedderburn wrote and informed you of that said gebb coolly what do you know of miss wedderburn asked ferris in surprise i have seen her and spoken with her and i know from her own lips that she is engaged to you on your writingtable i saw an envelope with the norminster postmark and yesterdays date so i guessed that she wrote to you about miss gilmars death she did i have no reason to conceal it but she did not mention that she had conversed with you perhaps not mr ferris she is a young lady who can keep her own counsel she has no secrets that i know of said ferris haughtily gebb shrugged his shoulders she has one about you he said calmly indeed replied the other with sarcasm and do you know what it is mr gebb i did not know when i saw her but i know now miss wedderburn is aware that you killed miss gilmar did she say so asked ferris anxiously no but i guess that is her secret you are guilty you know i swear i am not rejoined ferris vehemently i never saw miss gilmar i did not murder her i know nothing about the woman do you know anything about the diamond necklace the diamond necklace stammered ferris changing colour and with a visible start for this leading question evidently took him by surprise yes the necklace you pawned on the twentyfifth of july to aaron and nathan ititwaswas mine replied the young man as clearly as his consternation would let him it was not yours said gebb sharply it was miss gilmars she wore it on the night of the murder and it was taken from the corpse i did not take it i did not take it yet you pawned it yes i pawned it but i swear i did not take it then how did it come in your possession i refuse to answer that question said ferris sullenly gebb shrugged his shoulders just as you please he said but the fact of your pawning that necklace is the cause of your arrest if you can explain i explain nothing i intend to keep my business to myself then you will be in danger of the gallows ferris bit his lip and shuddered i am innocent he said wonderfully calm considering his position but i refuse to state how i became possessed of the necklace chapter xiv a surprising discovery the next day ferris was brought up before the magistrate on the charge of murdering miss gilmar he looked pale and ill and heard the evidence of his pawning of the necklace in absolute silence when he was asked to defend himself he refused to utter a word he declined even to engage a solicitor so in the face of this conduct there was nothing for it but to commit him for trial ferris asked for bail but his request being refused he was taken back to prison still silent he might have been a stone image for all the information the law got out of him and every one marvelled at his obstinacy so dangerous to himself so inexplicable to others gebb could not understand why he acted in this way and risked his neck in so obstinate a manner certainly ferris declared himself to be innocent but he refused to prove the truth of his words and preserved an impenetrable silence which at once perplexed and provoked the detective the only reason he could conjecture for the mulish behaviour of the artist was that the evidence against him was too strong for disproval and that he knew this to be the case still he might make an effort to save himself thought gebb as he sat meditating in his office if only to tell a lie although i dont quite see what he could say mrs presk declared that miss gilmar wore her jewels on that evening and when we found the body those jewels were gone the principal jewelwhich is a necklacewas pawned the day after the murder by arthur ferris who knows miss wedderburn who knew miss gilmar and he refuses to state how the necklace came into his possession if he murdered the woman his possession of the diamonds is easily accounted for if he is innocent he must have obtained the necklace from the assassin therefore if not guilty himself he must know who is that is plain logic logic or not the result of the argument was very unsatisfactory and gebb in his own mind was unable to decide either for or against ferris he had that morning informed prain by letter about the artists committal for trial and asked him to call at the prison to discover if possible the reason for the strange conduct of ferris also he requested prain to call at his office and tell him the result of the interview so when his meditations were interrupted by a sharp knock at the door he quite expected to see the little solicitor enter in place of prain however he beheld the burly form of john alder who appeared to be different from his usual genial self you are no doubt surprised to see me here mr gebb he said when the first greetings had passed but i am greatly disturbed about ferris he is a friend of mine you know gebb did not know about the friendship but he was well aware that ferris was alders favoured rival with edith wedderburn so wondered at the tenderheartedness of the man who was distressed over the removal of an obstacle to his wooing why are you disturbed asked gebb rather sceptically what makes you worry over ferris because i am sure he is innocent of this murder replied alder oh i heard all about his arrest and committal for trial from prain who has gone round to see him so i thought i would come and tell you that i am convinced of his innocence but he pawned the necklace mr alder he admits that he did then he must have obtained the necklace from some one else that may be sir said gebb quietly but if he did he refuses to say as much and whosoever gave him the necklace killed miss gilmar what defence does he make asked alder looking puzzled none he asserts his innocence but refuses to explain how he became possessed of the necklace if he cant explain or wont explain those diamonds will hang him in what way i dont quite see how you arrive at that point miss gilmar wore the necklace on the night she was killed explained the detective it was gone when we found the body so by the strongest of circumstantial evidence the assassin must have taken it all this may be true mr gebb but it does not prove that poor ferris is guilty i think it does replied gebb coolly seeing that he pawned the necklace in question if he isnt the principal he is an accessory before the fact wont he confess how he became possessed of the diamonds no not to me he refuses to say a word in his own defence then i tell you what said alder gravely this quixotic young man is defending another person he is shielding the assassin if he is that shows him to be an accessory either before or after the fact repeated gebb but who is the person you think he is shielding dean i believe the man killed my cousin does mr ferris know dean asked gebb looking up sharply no nor did he know miss gilmar so far as my knowledge goes said alder with a nod ferris has been a friend of mine for many years and although for certain reasons we are not very intimate i am sure he is not guilty of this crime if ferris did not know dean or does not know him i dont very well see how he can be shielding him cried gebb irritably if you will excuse me saying so mr alder i think you are talking sheer nonsense i am sorry you think so said alder stiffly of course i only state that ferris is not acquainted with dean so far as i am aware but he may know him for all that why asked gebb pertinently because i am certain that dean is guilty admitting that he iswhich i dont on the strength of the romantic vowhow did ferris become possessed of the necklace i dont know only ferris can explain that well then mr alder he wont explain so on the face of it he is guilty and dean isnt i tell you he is innocent said alder angrily and my friend mr basson can prove it bassonclement basson the barrister said gebb with a stare why what on earth has he got to do with it he saw ferris on the night of the murder saw him where at grangebury in the evening and miss gilmar was murdered at grangebury said the detective why that looks as though ferris was guilty your evidence rather condemns than exonerates him not at all rejoined alder tartly i read the evidence of the murder in the daily papers although i did not know at the time that miss ligram was my cousin ellen gilmar well what of that inquired gebb rather puzzled by the irrelevancy of this remark this much mrs presk and her servant were at a lecture on dickens in the grangebury town hall i know that well mr gebb that lecture was given by basson by clement basson the barrister who defended dean twenty years ago the same you must know that basson is a friend of mine continued alder conversationally and a barrister like myself he is by no means well off as he is fonder of play than of work i suggested to him that he should write and deliver a few lectures in order to make money for he has a fine voice and is an excellent orator he adopted my suggestion and wrote a lecture on dickens but being nervous he wished to make an experiment in the suburbs before attempting to interest a london audience i suggested that he should deliver it in the grangebury town hall as i know many people in that suburb he consented and delivered the lecture on the twentyfourth of july that is on the very night my cousin was murdered and mrs presk attended the lecture with her servant reflected gebb did you know that miss gilmar was in grangebury i no she took lodgings in paradise row under the name of ligram you know said alder i had not set eyes on her for yearsin fact not since she left kirkstone hall out of terror lest she should be killed by dean she kept her address secret from all although i believe she occasionally wrote to miss wedderburn on business i know replied gebb with a nod but miss wedderburn had not heard from your cousin since six months before the murder so she was not aware of miss ligramsor rather miss gilmarspresence in grangebury but what has the lecture to do with ferris and his innocence im coming to that said alder quietly as i had suggested the lecture to basson i wished him to have a large audience so i asked my friends in grangebury to attend also i invited some london acquaintances amongst them ferris did ferris go to the lecture yes i saw him myself at the door when i spoke a few words to him he sat in a front row and bassonwho knows himtold me that he stayed almost to the end of the lecture oh said gebb meaningly almost to the end well at all events he stayed until ten oclock replied alder rather nettled and as my cousin was killed about that time ferris could not have murdered her no certainly not so far as i can see ferris can prove an alibi if so why does he not defend himself in that way alder shrugged his shoulders i cant say unless he is shielding some one i suggest dean as i really believe that dean is guilty but thenso far as i knowferris is not acquainted with dean nor is anybody for the man has not been heard of since he escaped from prison but you see mr gebb that if my cousin was murdered at ten oclockand the medical evidence says she wasferris who was in the grangebury town hall at that hour cannot be guilty i admit that i shall look into the matter said gebb and let me tell you mr alder that i think very well of you for coming forward with this evidence as i know that mr ferris is your rival with miss wedderburn said alder colouring true enough but for all that i dont want him to be hanged when i know that he is innocent if miss wedderburn marries ferris ill just have to put up with it thats all gebb was about to express further admiration of alders conduct when the door opened unexpectedly and prain came hurriedly into the room the little man looked worried and with a nod to his brother lawyer he threw himself into a chair near the detectives desk well gebb he said in a vexed tone i have been to see that young ass and i cant induce him to speak there will be no need for it said gebb quietly i know now that he is innocent mr prain how is that asked the solicitor in amazement whereat gebb with the assistance of alder told him of the presence of ferris in the town hall at the hour the murder was committed prain was more amazed than ever great heavens he said if the man is innocent and can prove it as you say why doesnt he speak out because he is screening some one i think said gebb i know he is said alder and i believe that the some one is dean why asked prain with a sharp look i believe that dean committed the crime mr prain yes but you also believe that ferris does not know dean cried gebb crossly so why should he shield him that is a paradox said alder smiling prain looked up with a grave expression on his face it is a paradox which i can explain he said shortly ferris does know dean he does know dean cried both his hearers in amazement yes i may as well tell you both that arthur ferris is the son of marmaduke dean chapter xv the revelation of mr prain arthur ferris the son of dean repeated gebb looking alternately at solicitor and barrister well i never heard of such a thing did you know of it mr alder alder shook his head with unqualified amazement not i he said i suggested that ferris was shielding dean only because i am certain dean is the assassin and only the assassin could have given that necklace taken from the dead woman to ferris but i had no idea that there was any relationship or even acquaintance between them nevertheless it is true replied prain with a nod i was deans lawyer as you know and he told me much of his family history when his wife died he placed his son arthur with some of her relatives and went himself as a bachelor down to the hall to court laura kirkstone for his second wife and meet with his fate when he was imprisoned for the murder of kirkstone the relatives of arthur gave him his mothers name of ferris i have kept my eye on that young man all my lifeor rather all his life of twentyfive years and have even assisted him on occasions with money he is the son of dean right enough although he still keeps to the name of ferris oh he knows who he is then said gebb sharply certainly he has known it for many years has he any idea of the whereabouts of his father questioned alder no he would have told me if he had as he is well aware that i consider his father innocent and would not give him up to the law even if i knew of his hidingplace do you believe that dean is innocent in this instance mr prain the little man moved restlessly and evaded a direct reply to the inquiry of alder that is a question i cannot answer he said dubiously i asked ferris if he obtained the necklace from his father but he denied that he did and added that he was ignorant of his fathers whereabouts he declared that he had not seen his father since he was five years of age oh of course he would say all that cried alder with scorn in order to shield his father as i suggested although until you spoke i did not know who dean really was the evidence against dean seems clear enough to me in what way asked gebb anxious to hear alders ground of accusation since he appeared so certain of deans guilt in every way retorted the barrister dean hunted miss gilmar down and killed her in paradise row being hard up as he must be seeing that he is an outlaw and in hiding he stole the jewels she wore he no doubt gave the necklace to ferris as i know the young man is as poor as a church mouse and kept the other jewels to himself i dont say that ferris knew at the time his father had killed miss gilmar but when mr gebb here stated that the necklace was taken from her dead body ferris is quick enough to put two and two together and guess what his father had done he therefore holds his tongue and refuses to say from whom he got the necklace a man with his life in jeopardy would not keep silent without a strong motive and what stronger motive can ferris have than one which concerns the safety of his father to me the affair is as clear as day your case is very ingeniously constructed i admit said prain dryly and you argue the rope round deans neck in fine style nevertheless your theory istheory and nothing more well said alder with a shrug what does mr gebb say mr gebb says nothing at present rejoined that gentleman after a moments thought least said soonest mended when i gather more evidence i shall speak more freely where do you intend to look for evidence at kirkstone hall i shall ask miss wedderburn why she fainted on the occasion of my mentioning about ferris although i did ask her once and she lied i can explain that observed prain quickly i said i would not do so without the young ladys permission but as i have been forced to tell you about deans relationship to ferris i may as well reveal the rest miss wedderburn knows that arthur is the son of dean so when you asked her about him i dare say the thought struck her that you knew of it through me and intended to accuse him of killing miss gilmar to avenge his father with a revulsion of feeling she fainted thereyou have the explanation from my point of view thats all very well mr prain but i wish to have the explanation from miss wedderburns point of view where is she now still at the hall said alder gloomily but she intends to leave it now that i am master there oh said prain with a smile she refuses to be its mistress yes i dont mind confessing it she is infatuated with ferris and when i went down the other day to ask her for the last time to be my wife she refused me and declared that she intended to marry ferris but i dont bear him any illwill said alder generously we both love miss wedderburn and she prefers him in his poverty to me with my money still i dont know how she can bear the idea of marrying the son of a murderer perhaps like myself she believes in deans innocence said prain dryly if he is guilty of the first crime he is guilty of the second well said gebb thoughtfully there is something in that unless dean had been guilty of kirkstones murder he would not have been so bent upon punishing the woman who accused him of it and it is just possible he murdered her out of revenge however i believe myself that dean is innocent of both crimes as to the second i shall see ferris again and try to learn if he got the necklace from his father as to the first added gebb emphatically i shall search kirkstone hall for miss gilmars confession her confession repeated alder surprised what confession ah said prain taking no notice of the barristers question and addressing gebb so you are coming round to my opinionthat miss gilmar killed kirkstone it has been my opinion for some time rejoined gebb coolly and i believe that miss gilmar left a confession behind her telling the truth i dont think she would risk its discovery by carrying it about with her so it is probable she wrote it out and concealed it in some hidingplace at kirkstone hall in that case search the hall said alder disbelievingly you have my full permission to do so i shall certainly avail myself of it mr alder so miss wedderburn leaves the hall what about her protg martin that lunatic i dont know he had better stay where he is for the present although i think myself he should be locked up what does miss wedderburn think she says he is mad but not dangerous and asked me to let him stay on at the hall until she is settledwith ferris i supposewhen she will take him with her a nice companion he will be to a young married couple im afraid that marriage wont take place for some time said prain gloomily even if arthur does escape hes too poor to keep a wife in that case said alder rising to take his leave there may be a chance for me while there is life theres hope you know prain shook his head with a doubtful smile while arthur ferris lives miss wedderburn wont marry you he said positively alder stopped at the door and looked back see here mr prain he remarked earnestly im all fair square and aboveboard gebb here will tell you that before you came i defended ferris because i consider him innocent but i believe that his father killed kirkstone and my cousin and i am certain that both crimes will be brought home to him in that case i have my doubts as to whether a proud girl like edith will marry the son of a murderer if she does not she will accept me of that i am certain and i shall do everything to bring such a marriage about well said prain ive known edith all her life and i dont think she will marry you well see about that rejoined alder confidently and swung out of the door with a look of determination in his blue eyes prain shook his head and shrugged his shoulders for he thought that the barrister was overconfident for a lover then he took up his hat to go and addressed a last question to gebb well sir said he grimly and what do you intend to do now three things mr prain and i dont mind telling you what they are i intend to question both ferris and miss wedderburn i intend to search kirkstone hall for that confession of miss gilmars which i really believe exists and i intend to call upon mr clement basson what about bassoncan he prove anything he can prove an alibi in favour of ferris said gebb and forthwith related to prain all that he had been told by alder regarding the lecture in the grangebury town hall prain listened attentively and nodded his head approvingly for he was pleased to find a loophole for arthurs escape very creditable to alder he said when the detective finished his conduct in speaking up for ferris deserves our praise few men would be so generous to their rival but if this is so why did not ferris clear himself before the magistrate he would be free now had he done so well said gebb thoughtfully so far as that goes we come back to mr alders belief ferris is shielding his father if he is said prain dean must be guilty it looks like it but i tell you what mr prain cried gebb emphatically as sure as i sit here dean is innocent whosoever killed miss gilmar was expected by her was a friend with whom she was at her ease that is proved by the smoking and the wine she would not have been at ease with dean he might have been disguised as a fortuneteller suggested prain no i dont believe it no disguise could have hidden him from the eyes of a woman who feared him so whosoever killed that woman it wasnt dean then why is ferris shielding dean we dont know if he is you yourself said that he denied it i know i did i know he does cried prain in despair god bless my soul what a case this is the more we talk about it the more confused does it become i tell you what gebb your only chance of arriving at the truth lies in either forcing ferris to confess where he got the necklace or in hunting down dean ill try the first of your suggestions at once said gebb putting on his hat and if ferris wont confess to me ill write and ask miss wedderburn to come to town what good can she do she can make him confess the truth what the man wont do for justice he may do for love however ill see him at once justice will make the first attemptlove the second and both will fail cried prain youd better catch dean my good man thats easier said than done retorted gebb and the two parted each more or less exasperated and very naturally for the perplexities of the grangebury murder case were enough to anger the mildest natures and those of prain and gebb were rather the reverse irritated and puzzled by the complexion of affairs gebb did not let the grass grow under his feet but at once visited the prison in which arthur ferris was confined he easily obtained permission to see him and entered to find the young man looking ill and worn but as firm as ever in his policy of silence gebb came to the reason of his visit forthwith well mr ferris you are a nice gentleman to stay here when a word from you in the court would clear you of all this what word asked ferris suspecting a snare and speaking cautiously why word where you were at the time of the murder i know you did not kill miss gilmar how do you know that asked the young man with a start because you were in the grangebury town hall listening to the lecture on dickens replied gebb mr alder told me it is very kind of alder to defend me replied ferris frankly yes mr gebb it is quite true i was not near miss gilmar on that night i am innocent then why didnt you say so i did several times but why dont you produce your alibi because i dont choose to retorted ferris slowly and turned sulky again so you are shielding your father after all who told you about my father he asked tremulously mr prain said gebb your father is dean who swore to kill that woman for accusing him of kirkstones murder he escaped and killed her and gave you the necklace and you wont speak because you want to save your fathers neck my father has nothing to do with it mr gebb i did not get the necklace from him i dont know where he is this is my last word said ferris firmly and it was gebb begged and implored and threatened but to no purpose whatever ferris knew he kept to himself chapter xvi miss wedderburn having failed with ferris owing to the artists obstinate refusal to speak gebb thought that he would hear what basson had to say he knew from prain that the barrister had defended marmaduke dean and although he had not succeeded in obtaining an acquittal believed that his client was innocent dean of course must have known that his counsel held this opinion so on escaping from prison with a desire to prove his innocence it was not unlikely that he might have called secretly on basson and implored his assistance if so basson might know a good deal about the man if he could only be induced to speak out and it was to gain his confidence in this matter that gebb paid him a visit of course he may know nothing thought gebb as he walked the next day towards blackstone lane in which mr bassonaccording to alderhad his abode on the other hand if dean called on him which is not unlikely he may know a good deal i wish to learn where dean is hiding how he manages to live and what his movements were towards the end of july last basson may be able to inform me of these matters if he can so much the better if he cant ill go down to kirkstone hall to search for that confession and see miss wedderburn before she leaves the place if she cant force ferris to speak no one else can the man is as obstinate as a pig with this elegant simile gebb turned out of fleet street into blackstone lane and shortly found himself climbing the narrow staircase of no mr basson being poor and briefless and evidently careless of his ease lived at the very top of the high building after ascending four flights of steep stairs the detective came upon a door with the name clement basson painted on it in black letters also there was a dingy scrap of paper on which was written back in five minutes so it seemed much to gebbs disappointment as though basson were not in his office however two or three sharp knocks brought forth a grinning boy in a suit several sizes too small for him and this lad having put gebb through a short examination with the intention of discovering if he had a bill or a writ or a judgment summons in his pocket at length relented and announced that mr basson was within evidently the back in five minutes label was used to beguile creditors into thinking that mr basson was absent that announcement and the conversation with the juvenile cerberus gave gebb an immediate insight into the state of mr bassons finances and his bohemian mode of handtomouth living shortly he was ushered into a dingy chamber very barely furnished and very dirty there was a yellow blind pulled up askew on an unclean window below this a deal table covered with green baize inkstained and wornout which was piled up with dirty papers an ancient bookcase with a brass screen was filled with an array of untidylooking volumes in calfskin with red labels there were two chairsone for the lawyer and one for any possible client a rusty grate filled with tornup papers and an empty japan coalscuttle in the midst of these ruins of prosperity like marius amid the remains of carthage sat clement basson a tall joviallooking man with a fine head of grey hair a quick eye and a neatly trimmed beard and moustache he was carelessly dressed in a kind of sporting fashion and wore an old cricketingcap on the back of his head the man was clever kindly and quickwitted he was also thriftless weakwilled and untidy his worser qualities weighed down his better and with many qualifications for climbing to the top of the tree mr basson preferred out of sheer idleness and lack of concentration to dance gaily round the trunk in ragged attire he looked like a survival of grub street one of the featherheaded crew who wrote pamphlets and starved in garrets and naturally belong to the reigns of the early georges he was quite out of place in the late victorian epochan ironical survival of the unfittest good day he said in a rich baritone voice advancing to meet his visitor what can i do for you mr gabb gebb sir not gabb answered the detective seating himself in the one other chair the boy said gabb retorted basson returning to his chair he was thinking of his own gift maybe and he laughed heartily at his rather feeble joke well mr gebb have you brought me a brief no said gebb smiling for the mans good humour was infectious im in a different branch of the law to a solicitor i dont deal in briefs so much as in handcuffs ah you are a detective a bow street runner yes in charge of the grangebury murder case just so said basson with a nod and looking grave i read about it in the papers and now i remember your name was mentioned well and have you caught the blackguard who murdered the poor woman not yet ive come to see if you can help me i said basson much amused youve come to the wrong shop then how should i know the assassin if i can believe mr alder you knew him once was gebbs reply ah so alder has been speaking to you about me he thinks that dean is guilty and i was deans counsel in that kirkstone case is it that you are driving at mr gebb it just is do you believe that dean is guilty basson did not reply immediately he lighted a german pipe of porcelain and blowing out the match placed it in a little pile which lay near the inkstand then he puffed out a cloud of smoke and through it looked at his visitor why do you ask me he demanded abruptly i want your opinion i know from mr alder that you did not believe dean guilty of kirkstones murder no that i did not rejoined basson hastily no more than i believe mr ferrispoor boyguilty of this one i was coming to tell you that he was at my lecture on the night of the murder but alder said he would speak to you about it did he gebb nodded i know that ferris is innocent but he had the necklace in his possession and that is a suspicious circumstance i saw about that in the papers said basson nodding well and how does he say the necklace came into his hands he declines to tell me does he with his neck in the noose so to speak precisely mr basson he did not even confess his presence at your lecture he said he was innocent and for the rest held his tongue basson stared and pressed the tobacco in the pipe bowl with his little finger now thats queer he said why does he act in this way i think he wishes to shield his father i didnt know he had a father thought his father was dead as good as dead i am afraid dean is his father what bassons pipe fell out of his hands and he looked at gebb in amazement dean the man i defended ferriss father yes ferris lived with some relations who changed his name when his father was condemned now mr basson i dont believe dean is guilty of this second murder but on no other ground than that he did kill the woman and gave ferris the necklace to pawn can i account for the young mans silence does he say that dean is guilty asked basson picking up his pipe no he denies it but refuses to confess how he became possessed of the necklace mr basson tell me on what grounds you believed that dean did not kill kirkstone no motive rejoined basson people dont commit murders without motives but a year or two ago i got an anonymous letter which strengthened my belief in his innocence wait a bit and ill get it for you he opened a small safe standing at the end of the room near the bookcase and after five minutes groping in its depths at length fished out a dingy bit of paper which he brought back to gebb this he spread out on the table and raised his finger to enforce the attention of the detective dean declared his innocence to me said the barrister with forensic force and i believed him but he thought that laura kirkstone was guiltythat in a mad fit she killed her brother i did not agree with this for i held then and i hold still that ellen gilmar stole that knife from laura and murdered kirkstone before she went upstairs to call dean and inculpate him in the murder now when dean escaped from prison i received this letter read it gebb glanced his eye rapidly over the scrap of paper which contained two lines of writing running thus if you see dean tell him not to hunt down a wretched woman when she dies justice shall be done to this there was no name and no date and no envelope gebb inquired after this latter im sorry to say i destroyed it by mistake said basson with regret but i remember that it had the norminster postmark on it therefore i am sure the note came from miss gilmar but why should she write to you inquired the detective she fancied dean on escaping might visit me to get my aid to prove his innocence i thought such might be the case myself said gebb thoughtfully did he come near you at any time after his escape no said basson emphatically i never saw him from the time he went into prison i dont know where he is i wish i did as this note shows that miss gilmar knows herself to be guilty and has left some sort of confession behind to be read after her death and clear dean where do you think this confession is to be found i dont know she may have hidden it in kirkstone hall or may have had it with her when i got this note i went at once to the hall to tax miss gilmar with writing it however she had fled out of fear of dean and i could not learn her whereabouts the next i heard was her murder at grangebury under the name of ligram do you think dean killed her asked gebb anxiously i dont know he might have found her and tried to force her into confession and failing getting her to do so have killed her but i dont know well said gebb getting on his legs i had an idea myself that there might be a confession concealed in kirkstone hall now on the evidence of this note i am sure of it ill go down and search but tell me frankly mr basson do you know where dean is to be found no said basson solemnly i swear i dont i must rely on myself then said gebb with a sigh ill see you again mr basson i shall be glad to help you sir replied the barrister and bowed the detective out of his dingy room gebb retired in an exultant frame of mind as he had discovered beyond all doubt that a confession by miss gilmar was in existence which would probably exonerate dean from all complicity in kirkstones murder the question was where to search for it on his way back to the office gebb tried vainly to find an answer to this query but it was banished from his mind when he discovered that no less a person than miss wedderburn was waiting to see him she approached him at once when he entered and there was a sparkle of rage in her eyes which intimated that the object of her visit was not a peaceful one here you are at last mr gebb she said in a wrathful voice and pray sir what do you mean by arresting mr ferris oh thats your trouble is it miss answered gebb coolly well my dear young lady i arrested mr ferris because he pawned a diamond necklace and what had that to do with you may i ask this much miss the necklace was the property of miss gilmar and was removed from her dead body nothing of the sort cried edith vehemently ellen was alive when she gave away that necklace gave away that necklace repeated gebb starting up what do you mean what i say rejoined miss wedderburn tartly i gave the necklace to arthur and it was miss gilmar who presented it to me in paradise row on the night she was murdered chapter xvii an explanation it took gebb some time to grasp the meaning of miss wedderburns remarks for the information it conveyed seemed impossible of belief he looked so doubtful that she repeated her speech with some impatience i tell you miss gilmar gave me that necklace on the night she was murdered at what hour gasped gebb not quite master of himself shortly after nine oclock did you see her on that night of course i did said edith sharply how else could i have got the necklace but you told me at kirkstone hall that you did not know miss gilmar was in grangebury that is perfectly true rejoined edith colouring but i told you many things that were false i was forced to do so to protect arthur and myself so you knew of the murder when i paid my first visit yes and when you inquired after arthur i fancied you had discovered his pawning of the necklace and that you intended to accuse him of the crime naturally i was anxious to save him that was why you fainted said gebb suddenly enlightened it was in a moment i saw arthurs danger as i knew well he would not say that i gave him the necklace so the thought made me faint when i learned later that you knew nothing i held my tongue you did and to some purpose i congratulate you on your power of acting miss wedderburn you deceived me completely what else was i to do said edith resentfully you would not have had me betray myself or arthur how did you find out that the necklace was pawned that i shall explain later replied gebb annoyed by her attitude and in my turn may i ask why you killed miss gilmar edith stared at him in surprise and laughed you are making a mistake she said with haughty coolness i did not kill ellen gilmar but you were with her on that night so i was but i left her at nine oclock and then she was alive and well why should i kill her to obtain the necklace what nonsense you talk mr gebb she gave me the necklace for arthur of her own free will even if she had refused to give it to me i should certainly not have murdered her i love arthur very much it is true but hardly enough to commit so wicked a deed for his sake do you swear that you are innocent asked gebb looking at her keenly yes i swear i am she answered meeting his look with much frankness if necessary i can prove my innocence and that of arthur oh mr alder has proved his innocence already very kind of him said edith with sarcasm for i dare say he was glad enough to hear of arthurs arrest you do him wrong miss wedderburn on seeing the case in the paper mr alder came round at once to see me he stated that mr ferris was present in the town hall at mr bassons lecture and therefore could not have been with miss gilmar at ten oclock the hour when she was killed he proved your lovers innocence edith raised her eyebrows and looked surprised why did mr alder do that she said half to herself he hates arthur because because he is engaged to you finished gebb that is a mistake miss for mr alder is quite friendly with mr ferris and bears him no grudge for winning your hand you may not credit it but mr alder is a real gentleman the leopard can change his spots then said edith still puzzled i should never have thought that mr alder was so generous it is very strange she finished musinglyvery strange indeed the detective quite agreed with her he thought that the whole affair was wonderfully strange particularly as he was ignorant of how edith had obtained a valuable necklace from an old miser like miss gilmar and also he could not understand her reason for taking it he quite saw that she had deceived him in order to save herself and ferris from being accused of the murder but he was doubtful if she was so innocent of all knowledge concerning the death as she feigned to be with this idea in his mind he addressed her with some sharpness and asked her a leading question if you did not kill the woman yourself said he who did i dont know answered edith candidly she was alive when i left her at nine oclock and when i saw her death in the paper i was as much surprised as any one you knew then that she called herself miss ligram at grangebury oh yes else i would not have known she was the victim though to be sure added edith with a nod the description of the yellow boudoir would have made me suspect i spoke falsely for my own ends when i told you that i saw no newspapers at norminster well miss wedderburn said gebb after a pause i see no reason to doubt your innocence but i should like to hear your reasons for getting the necklace ill tell you the whole story mr gebb indeed i am sorry now that i did not do so when you called to see me but i was afraid of getting arthur into trouble and so held my tongue it was your silence which caused his arrest said gebb had you spoken out he would not have been arrested he could have exculpated himself protested edith earnestly i dare say but in order to shield youas i now seehe refused to speak however we can talk of these things later miss wedderburn tell me your story certainly i shall explain fully said the girl quickly and anything you do not quite understand you can ask me about afterwards well mr gebb you must know first of all that arthur is the son of marmaduke dean who i am aware of that fact interrupted gebb prain told me very good said edith composedly it makes my task the easier yes he is the son of dean and when his father escaped from prison some years ago he came down to kirkstone hall to see if the poor man had returned there you know that dean desired to revenge himself on miss gilmar for her share in his condemnation well arthur thought that his father might have gone to the hall to punish her so he came down to warn miss gilmar and prevent a second crime if possible and what did miss gilmar do she was greatly alarmed by the news and terrified lest dean should really come she went away as i told you before and hid herself in london under those several names it was in this way that i became acquainted with arthur and we were very friendly he used to visit me frequently and in the end we fell in love with one another as was natural said gebb smiling but before you proceed tell me if dean ever came to the hall as he was expected no replied edith vehemently he never did i dont know where he is does ferris know asked the detective eagerly not he neither of us have set eyes on his father the poor man may be dead for all we know im not so sure of that said gebb thinking of the murder go on please i would not tell you about my engagement said edith who did not relish the smiles of the detective and therefore spoke with some resentment but that it is necessary for the safety of arthur and myself that i should speak freely mr ferrisshe adopted this more formal style of mention to keep gebb in ordermr ferris came to see me frequently and confided to me all his troubles he was greatly in want of money as his pictures did not sell and he had no one to help him i could not as i had no money and i was simply earning my living as my cousins housekeeper at kirkstone hall in july ar that is mr ferris was in such distress that i resolved to aid him by obtaining from miss gilmar the diamond necklace which had belonged to his father i know said gebb who was listening attentively the necklace which dean gave laura kirkstone yes it was a family jewel and dean gave it to laura only because she was to be his wife when she died it should have been returned to deanor as he was a convictto his son miss gilmar however seized it and all the rest of lauras jewels with the other jewels i had nothing to do but i was resolved to obtain the necklace for arthur was it not right to do so yes rejoined gebb promptly the necklace certainly belonged to mr ferris as his father could not benefit by it but my wonder is how you got it from what i have heard of miss gilmar i should have thought the task an impossible one it was difficult to obtain it but i did so in the end i told you said edith with some colour that i did not know miss gilmar was at grangebury well that was not true for she wrote to me stating that she was living in paradise row under the name of ligram and in her letter she asked me about some business i resolved to visit grangebury but as i did not know where it was i asked arthur to escort me did he know of your intention no but curiously enough the week i wrote to him he was going down to grangebury to hear a friend lecture that was on the twentyfourth of july so i came up to town and went with him on that night to the lecture well not at first the lecture did not begin until close on nine oclock and i wished to see miss gilmar so i sent arthur in to the town hall and intended to join him when i got the necklace i then visited miss gilmar she was alone in the house and admitted me herself she was much alarmed at seeing me and still more so when i demanded the necklace i dont wonder at it did she refuse to give it up yes although she was wearing it at the time i told her then that if she did not give it up to me for arthur i should search for dean and tell him where she was indeed added edith reflectively i am not sure but what i did not say that i knew where dean was but you did not said gebb looking at her keenly no certainly not she rejoined hastily but i said so to frighten miss gilmar she was terrified and implored me not to take the necklace or tell dean but i knew that i was acting rightly so in the end she gave me the necklace which i put into my pocket and left at once about what time about halfpast nine i think miss gilmar seemed anxious to get me away from the house and almost pushed me out of the front door which she locked after me i then went to the town hall but as arthur was in one of the front seats and the lecturer was speaking i did not wish to create a disturbance by joining him so i sat down near the door i had some conversation with the doorkeeper as to where mr ferris was seated so if you ask him hell tell you that i sat near him until the lecture concluded at halfpast ten oclock then arthur joined me in much alarm as he thought i had got into trouble we returned to london where i gave him the necklace and told him to pawn it and pay his debts i slept at the grosvenor hotel near the victoria station and arthur went back to his rooms in chelsea so you see mr gebb both he and i are quite innocent it seems so said the cautious gebb not committing himself it is so insisted edith haughtily the doorkeeper can tell you that both mr ferris and myself were in the town hall before and after ten and it was about that time miss gilmar was murdered was any one with her when you called no i told you she was alone but there was wine on a small table and with that and the way she pushed me out i was sure she expected some one did you meet any one in the street going there not a soul i saw no one everybody in grangebury seemed to be at the lecture did you write and tell mr ferris about my visit to you yes i did and warned him not to pawn the necklace as he might be suspected but it was too late for he pawned it the day after i gave it to him but he is innocent as you see mr gebb surely he will be released when his trial takes place he will said gebb he would have been let off before if he had told this story to the magistrate ah said edith in a low voice he held his peace for my sake good brave arthur no wonder i love him chapter xviii what mrs presk found gebb continued to question and crossquestion edith until he became thoroughly acquainted with the details of her visit to miss gilmar at grangebury when in full possession of the facts he permitted her to depart but took the precaution to ask for her london address in case he should require her further evidence edith informed him that since leaving kirkstone hall she had been staying with an old schoolfellow in bloomsbury square and was likely to remain there for some time or at all events until she could find a situation i must work you know mr gebb she confessed frankly i am very poor yet had you accepted mr alder you would accept mr alder interrupted edith colouring i would sooner sweep the streets than marry any one but arthur mr gebb she added imploringly now that you are convinced of his innocence do get him out of prison ill do my best promised the detective he will come up for trial in a week or two but in the mean time if i place the actual facts of the case before the magistrate who committed him i have no doubt he will be admitted on bail anythinganything dear mr gebb so long as he is set free the detective proved to be as good as his word and worked zealously in the interest of ferris as the forthcoming trial would probably be a mere matter of form seeing that the later evidence acquitted him the magistrate readily accepted bail for a small amount and to ediths astonishment the person who guaranteed it was mr alder he came forward in the most friendly way to stand security for his rival and would not even hear of edith thanking him when arthur was released through his generosity i knew he was not guilty said this benefactor to edith and i told gebb it was a shame keeping an innocent man in prison how can we ever thank you said edith tearfully there is no need to thank me miss wedderburn of course i should like you to marry me but as ferris proves to be the lucky man i can only make the best of my misfortune in her own heart edith could not understand the kindness of mr alder for up to the present she had always thought him hardhearted and selfish perhaps the succession to the kirkstone estates had wrought this change for previous to the death of his cousin the barrister had been in deep water as basson frankly told gebb its an ill wind that blows nobody any good said the bohemian lawyer and the wretch who killed that old woman put a power of money into alders pocket he isnt the man to live on nothing and has rather expensive tastes so if he hadnt come in for that property hed have been in queer street its truth im telling you to which latter remark gebb quite assented as alder had rather the worn look of a man who lived hard and made the most of his life its a pity miss wedderburn doesnt marry him he observed she might keep him in order hes a ship that needs an anchor in my opinion well well mr gebb ferris is the better man of the two but not the richer mr alder has offered two hundred pounds reward for the capture of miss gilmars assassin and you intend to earn it i suppose said basson smiling if i can but at present i see no chance of finding the criminal upon my word cried gebb in disgust against my better judgment im beginning to believe that dean is guilty after all i dont think so but if that is your idea why dont you find dean and tax him with the crime an interview with him would put the matter beyond all doubt i dont know where to look for him said gebb grumbling i think i shall look up parge about the matter if any one knows where dean is to be found parge is the man yes ill see parge you may see parge said basson in a tone of contempt but its doubtful if youll ever see dean he has vanished so completely that i should not be at all surprised to learn that he is dead if he was alive and in hiding surely the police would have found him out before now the police only perform miracles in novels replied gebb dryly and went off to see parge the fat exdetective received him almost as wrathfully as he had done on the occasion of the previous visit gebb had been so busily employed in searching for miss gilmars assassin that he had foolishly omitted to pay mr parge the attention which that gentleman considered his due therefore he was greeted by his chief in anything but a friendly way and i dont want to hear any more excuses said parge scowling too much time is lost in telling unnecessary lies let me know how much further you have got on with the case glad to escape further blame the detective related all he had discovered in relation to ferris and miss wedderburn parge listened attentively and was gracious enough to signify his approval of gebbs conduct you have not done badly he said with a nod although your discoveries have been due more to good luck than to your own intelligence if the girl had not confessed about her visit and her giving of the necklace to ferris you would still be in doubt about his innocence no i wouldnt protested gebb before miss wedderburn spoke i was quite sure that ferris was guiltless alders evidence proved that he was at the lecture at the time the crime was committed it didnt prove how ferris became possessed of the necklace however snapped parge but i dont see that you are much further on than before have you examined that doorkeeper as to miss wedderburns presence in the lecture hall on the night and at the hour of the murder i have not had time simon tomorrow morning i am going down to see him at grangebury i suppose said parge will you find the man there yes the doorkeeper is also the caretaker of the hall then at the same time you had better call on mrs presk i suppose the goods of miss gilmar have been moved by alder as her heir yes the body was exhumed and has been identified and now alder has taken possession of the estates prain is attending to all legal matters concerning the will and by alders direction he dismantled the yellow boudoir i dont see what i shall gain by seeing mrs presk you can find out if she has discovered anything touching on the first or second murder i dont quite understand bah cried parge angrily cant you understand that a woman would not be left in possession of a dead womans goods without satisfying her curiosity in some way ill bet you absalom that mrs presk has searched in all miss gilmars boxes and clothes and papers to find out what she can about her now it is just possible that mrs presk may have come across that confession you talk about do you think it exists asked gebb with some scepticism yes i do that hint in the anonymous letter written to basson shows that miss gilmar had it in her mind to do justice to the man she wronged but you declared that dean was guilty said gebb recalling his first conversation so i did it seemed so at the time rejoined parge promptly but i have altered my mind especially since you told me about that letter written by miss gilmar to basson either she or laura kirkstone killed the man i dont know which neither do you so for the gratification of our mutual curiosity and the clearance of dean you had better find that confession well simon if that confession is anywhere it is hidden at kirkstone hall it might be replied parge cautiously on the other hand miss gilmar might have written it after she fled from the hall and have carried it about with her from place to place if mrs presk has found it she is just the kind of woman from your description to make money over it by refusing to give it up until she gets her own terms call on mrs presk absalom and find out the truth ill do so said gebb making a mental note of this but what about dean well i believe that dean is guilty of murdering miss gilmar said parge even if he is innocent of the first crime he committed the second in order to punish the woman who unjustly condemned him i am sure he had every cause to wish her ill she treated him most vindictively it is no use our discussing that matter said gebb tartly i believeon arguments i furnished you with beforethat dean is innocent you think he is guilty time and discovery may prove which of us is right the question now is where is he to be found i cant say absalom he escaped from prison in and we hunted for him high and low but without success he vanished as completely as though the earth had swallowed him up i thought myself he might have gone to kirkstone hall to kill miss gilmar and i searched the neighbourhood but he was nowhere to be found from that day to this not a word has been heard of him i suppose there is no use hunting for him it is waste of time to my mind retorted parge crossly you see what mrs presk is doing question her question the servant who by the way what is the servants name matilda crane but she knows nothing its as well to ask her however warned parge the people who seem to know least usually know most now go away absalom and dont be so long in looking me up again im anxious to get to the bottom of this case you cant be more anxious than i am replied gebb disconsolately at all events i am more hopeful rejoined parge and dismissed his pupil who went away with the conviction that the old man was worn outthat he was past workand that no aid or useful advice could be expected from him but gebb still had sufficient reverence for his elder not to hint at these things besides parge might have turned the tables on him had he been too frank the next day he went down to grangebury and called at the town hall to interview the caretaker he proved to be a smart exsoldier with an observant eye and a good memory which gifts he made use of on the present occasion for the benefit of gebb and also of his own pocket i remember the lady quite well he said after some thought the young gentleman called himself mr ferris and told me he was going in but that a lady by name miss wedderburn would come afterwards and he asked me to bring her up to where he was sitting in the front seats she came in about halfpast nine oclock but refused to let me take her up to the front as she did not wish to disturb the lecturer she sat down near the door and when the lecture ended the young gentleman joined her and they went out together were they in the hall before ten oclock asked gebb yes sir before ten and after ten i saw them both this unprejudiced testimony put the matter beyond all doubt so gebb gave the man a florin and went away quite convinced that ferris and edith were innocent he next called upon mrs presk and had an interview with that lady and with her servant what the landlady told him may be gathered from a conversation later in the day which gebb had with edith it was in the afternoon when miss wedderburn saw him she was sitting with arthur in the drawingroom of mrs barrington at bloomsbury and they were anxiously discussing the case of miss gilmars death when gebb was announced neither edith nor her lover was particularly glad to see the detective as their associations with him had been anything but pleasant however gebb took black looks and short answers as a portion of the ills incidental to his profession and conversed with the pair in his most amiable and persuasive fashion i have been down to grangebury today he said addressing edith and i saw mrs presk the landlady of your late cousin from her i obtained a railway ticket and it is a piece of evidence of such importance that i have come to you and mr ferris about it a railway ticket repeated edith looking puzzled from what station the ticket said gebb producing it from his pocketbook is dated the twentyfourth of july and is a return portion from london to norminster it is not mine then cried miss wedderburn i did not take a return ticket but you came up on the twentyfourth of july from norminster did you not certainly to see ellen but i bought a single ticket second class second class said the detective looking at the ticket this is a third class return are you sure it isnt yours quite sure said edith decisively why should i deceive you about it why indeed said gebb ironically with a hint at her former deception is it yours mr ferris arthur shook his head no if i travelled at all it would be third class i admit but i did not go to norminster in the month of july i thought so said gebb with an air of relief then as this ticket belongs to neither of you some third person must have travelled from norminster to grangebury on the twentyfourth of july and i believe that person added gebb emphatically to be the murderer of miss gilmar on what grounds cried edith and arthur together because mrs presk found this ticket in the yellow boudoir it must have been dropped there by the assassin chapter xix the unexpected occurs gebb found it impossible to discover the owner of that thirdclass railway ticket he went himself to norminster to find out if possible to whom it had been issued but all in vain the stationmaster had taken another situation in scotland the ticket clerk was absent on his annual holidays and none of the porters could remember any particular person who had gone up to london on that particular day on the whole circumstances seemed to be against gebb in following this clue and after several vain attempts he gave it up at all events for the present this he confessed to parge who at once reproved him for faintheartedness and preached a lengthy sermon on the folly of being discouraged you dont expect roast ducks to fly into your mouth do you said parge indignantly of course it is no easy task to hunt down a criminal wed have all the bad uns in gaol if such was the case youve only been a week looking after this ticket business yet you shy off just because you cant find out about it straight away you never were a detective absalom and you never will be but just look here cried the badgered absalom what can i do ive been i know where youve beento norminster growled parge and i know what youve donenothing you think im past work i saw that the other day well from natral infirmity or too much fat so i am but in nowise else absalom so dont you believe it if i was in your shoes which i aint id write up to that stationmaster in scotland and ask him if he knows of any particler person as left norminster on that day it aint a big place and if hes a sharp one he might remember ive written to the stationmaster cried gebb crossly oh have you returned parge rather disappointed then ill be bound you dont know what youre going to do about that ticket clerk yes i do im going to wait till he comes back and then question him at once in about a week ill know all those two know though i dare say it wont be much and look you here simon cried gebb warming up its all very well your pitching into me over this case but is it an easy one cause if you say it is it aint i never in my born days came across such a corker of a case as this one who would have thought that ferris and the girl would be mixed up in ityet they were and who would have thought them guilty everybody and were they guilty you know they werent can you find dean no you cant though you tried yourself when his trail was still fresh then how the devil do you expect me to find him after all these years its very easy to sit in your chair and pick holes simon but when you come to work the case for yourself youll be as up a tree as i am at this blessed moment i dont deny that the case is hard absalom hard echoed gebb with scorn its the most unnatral case as ever was ive only got one blessed clue after all my hard work and thats the railway ticket which so far as i can see is about as much good as a clock would be to a baby why dont you question mrs presk i have questioned her and the servant too and beyond the ticket she dont know a blessed thing cant basson help you or mr alder or mr ferris no none of the three they dont know who killed miss gilmar and if it comes to a point simon i dont see why they should know it is queer that the lot of them including the girl should have been in grangebury on the very night of the murder said parge with a musing air its a coincidence thats all retorted gebb and you know very well in our profession theres no end of coincidences though if you write them in a book people tell you theyre impossible you cant accuse any one of the three of killing the old woman as they were all in the lecture hall the whole evening you know all about ferris and miss wedderburn well it couldnt have been them mr basson was lecturing it couldnt have been him mr alder was looking after the money and the house so as to get plenty of cash in for his friend so it couldnt have been him if not them who is guilty well dean must be the criminal i dont believe it replied gebb obstinately and if he is hell not be hanged for old nick himself couldnt hunt him out by the way simon what kind of a man was he to look atto the naked eye so to speak i dont know what hell be like now replied parge briskly but he was uncommonly goodlooking in the dock i can tell you just the man to take a womans fancy tall and dark and smiling any particular mark asked gebb professionally well he wasnt scarred or scratched in any way that i know of replied parge reflectively but he had a frown get along every ones got a frown said gebb in a disgusted tone not of his sort was parges answer since sitting here absalom ive been reading a heap of books i never read before amongst others one called redgauntlet by a baronet sir walter scott know it no i dont what has it got to do with dean there was a fellow in it said parge following his own reflections as had a horseshoe mark over his nose when he frowned quite queer it was must have been said gebb derisively and has dean a horseshoe no but when he scowls or frowns like thishere parge made a hideous facehes got a queer mark deep as a well and quite straight between his eyebrows id know him from among a thousand by it seems to cut his forehead in two like if you see a man with a mark like that when hes in a rage absalom just you nab him for thats dean stuff said gebb impatiently lots of men wrinkle up into lines when they get out of temper ive seen foreheads like clapham junction for lines not so deep answered parge shaking his head and not straight down between the eyes most men frown in lines which run across the forehead when they raise their eyebrows like but dean draws everything up to a deep mark as dips just between the eyebrows and on to the nose its the queerest mark i ever saw and whatever disguise he puts on he cant smooth that furrow out a baby could tell him by it hum said gebb who had been thinking now you come to talk of it simon that young ferris has a mark like that but not very deep hes young yet absalom but i dare say he takes after his father well all i say is that theres no other way in which youll spot dean he may grow old and white and shaky or he may disguise himself in all kinds of ways but he cant rub out that brand of cain as nature has set on him i said it before and i say it again ill look round for a man of that sort said gebb rising to take his leave but i cant say ive much hope of finding him deans been lost for so long that i dare say hes lost for ever well goodbye simon i wont see you for a day or two theres heaps for me to do where are you going grunted the fat man im off to ask mr alder to let me search in kirkstone hall for that confession of miss gilmars then im going down there to look it up that wont do any good towards finding out who killed her said parge shaking his head i dont know so much about that simon replied gebb coolly i wouldnt be a bit surprised to find as the person who killed kirkstone was some one quite different from those we suspect it must be either miss g or miss k said parge and knowing the truth about them wont help you to spot the assassin you look for dean first absalom and leave the confession alone for a while no replied gebb obstinately ill look for the confession and fly round afterwards for dean you let me negotiate the job in my own way simon with this determination of which parge by no means approved but was unable to hinder gebb went off to make his last venture in solving the mystery by this time he was in a furious rage at his many failures and swore under his breath that come what might he would hunt down and punish the unknown assassin of the wretched old woman who had been strangled in paradise row he had three designs in his head one of which he hoped might serve to attain the muchdesired end firstly he intended to search for the confession of miss gilmar in the belief that it might throw some light on the later case secondly he resolved to follow the clue of the railway ticket and learn who had come up from norminster on that fatal night to visit miss gilmar since such personon the evidence of the ticket found in the yellow boudoirwas undoubtedly her murderer thirdly he was bent upon making another search round the pawnshops to see if any of the other jewels taken from the body had been turned into money the appearance of the necklace was accounted for by edith as she had received it from the old woman before the assassin had arrived but the rings bracelets and hair ornaments were still missing sooner or later in order to benefit by his crime the murderer would seek to turn them into cash when he thought the storm had blown over then was the time to trace and capture him the french have a proverb which runs in english that nothing is certain but the unforeseen and certainly gebb proved the truth of this when he arrived at alders lodgings as yet the barrister pending the administration of the estate had not moved from his rooms in the temple but he intended to do so shortly and already had engaged handsome chambers in halfmoon street these however he was never destined to occupy for on the very day gebb called to see him he met with an accident which seemed likely to result in his death as one pleasure to be gained from his riches alder had purchased a horse shortly after coming into his fortune and every morning went riding in the row he was a good rider but not having indulged in the exercise for some years by reason of his impecuniosity he had lost a portion of his skill with the result that the horse a fiery animal with tricks of which alder was ignorant bolted unexpectedly and threw his rider against the rails alder fell across them with such force that he had injured his spine and now was lying in his rooms in a crippled condition do you think hell get over it asked gebb when alders servant was relating the occurrence no sir answered the man shaking his head the doctor says hes bound to die sooner or later the spine is injured and my poor master cant feel anything below his waist its death in life already and the end is sure to come can i see him asked the detective after some thought no sir the doctor left word that he was to see no one with this gebb was forced to be content and as already he had obtained alders permission to search the hall he went away rather lowspirited it seemed hard that the man should come to an untimely end just when he inherited his kingdom moreover he had behaved very well in defending ferris in the face of all evidence and releasing him from prison therefore gebb thought it just as well to send a line to the artist and edith so that they might come forward in their turn to do what they could for the man who had acted so generously towards them both its hard lines said gebb to himself when he had posted his letter i do call it hard alder gained a fortune it is true but he lost the woman he wished to marry and now he loses his life its a queer world that gives a man a pleasure only to take it away from him again i dont understand the workings of providence nohow with this philosophical reflection gebb went home to make his plans before going down to norminster the next day he had little hope of success however and now that alder was dying he wondered if he did capture the murderer if the reward would be paid to him of course it will he said to himself on reflection for if alder dies miss wedderburn becomes mistress of the hall chapter xx a needle in a haystack it was a bright and sunny day when gebb found himself once more at kirkstone hall in the sunshine the building looked grim and desolate the smokeless chimneys the closed doors dusty windows and grassgrown terraces gave the place a forlorn and wretched aspect and the absence of life the silence broken only by the twittering of the birds the neglected gardens created even to the detectives prosaic mind an atmosphere of menace and dread it looked like a place with a history and gebb wondered if miss wedderburn on becoming its mistress would care to inhabit it again when she marries ferris and begins a new life i dare say she will seek some more cheerful abode he thought as he stood on the terrace and looked on the silent house it would be foolish for a young couple to dwell with the ghosts of the past i am not imaginative myself but i should not care to live here no not if the house was given to me rent free if i were miss wedderburn id pull it down and build a new place without a past or a ghost while gebb soliloquized thus he heard a hoarse voice in the distance and saw martin spade on shoulder passing across the lawn singing one of his gruesome songs evidently he had caught sight of the detective on the terrace for not until he came towards him did he begin to sing then he danced grotesquely over the green turf croaking his wild ditty and looking a strange figure in the strong sunshine yet not unsuited to the lonely place with its grim associations when moon shines clear my shadow and i dance in the silver light when moon lies hid in a cloudy sky my shadow with her takes flight and i remain in the falling rain calling upon my shadow in vain oh shadow dear i wait you here alone in the lonely night when he came close to gebb he stopped his song and dance suddenly and looked inquiringly at the detective with his head on one side what do you want he croaked there is nothing here but death and misery ive come to look at the house martin can you show me over it no no said the gardener shaking his head i dont walk through the valley of dry bones if you sit in the yellow room you hear the dead tell secrets what kind of secrets asked gebb humouring him how the sister killed the brother and how she who killed them both laughed and laughed but she died at last in deep despair when satan caught her in his snare gebb looked fixedly at the man he had been in the house at the time of the kirkstone murder so it might be that his poor wits retained a memory of the tragedy was it possible that light could be thrown on its darkness by this madman the detective asked himself that question once or twice as he listened to the poor creature rambling on how laura had killed her brother at the instigation of miss gilmar and is mr dean innocent he asked suddenly god and his saints know that he had no hand in it cried martin with a remarkably sane look on his face a woman ruined one a woman slew the other and the poor soul lies in chainsin chains and he fell to weeping as though his heart would break with sorrow and pain i wonder if this is the truth thought gebb perhaps after all laura did murder her brother and miss gilmar to save her denounced dean but there is no sense to be got out of this lunatic his evidence would not stand in a court of law the only thing is to search for that confession so the sooner i set to work the bettermartin he said aloud can you show me over the house not i not i ask old jane come and ill take you to old jane and shouldering his spade again martin walked off round the comer of the terrace singing god it far away alas the devil is beside us and as we wander thro the world he is the one to guide us he gives with grin the wage of sin and when the fiend hath paid us we stand outside the gate of hell with christ alone to aid us old jane proved to be a grim and elderly female in a rusty black dress and a still rustier bonnet she came out of a side door and wiping her hands on a coarse apron curtsied to gebb while martin introducing the pair with a regal wave of the hand danced off round the corner what may you be pleased to want asked old jane when the scarecrow gardener had disappeared i have received permission from mr alder to look over the house replied the detective and i wish you to show it to me there aint much to see sir croaked the ancient dame its all dust and darkness i doubt if my old legs would carry me over it oh well i can go by myself jane said gebb cheerfully mrs grix if you please snapped jane indignantly i only allows miss edith to call me by my first name poor pretty dear and shes gone away for ever i wouldnt be too sure of that rejoined gebb dryly mr alder has met with an accident and may die in which case miss wedderburn will return here as mistress mr alders ill is he said jane in no very regretful tone and may die ah well with a lachrymose whine all flesh is grass that it is and if miss edith does come back i hope shell shut up the yeller room for what reason mrs grix cause its haunted by spirits replied mrs grix with a mysterious look ive heard the two of em quarrelling there which two what two asked gebb who began to think that the old lady had been at the bottle miss gilmar and the master they aunts the yeller room and fights i knows it cause i sleeps here all alone save for martin as lives in the back part an i hears voices that i do i wonder you are not more afraid of that madman than of ghosts mrs grix smiled in a cunning and significant manner oh i aint afraid of martin sir no one as knows him fears him and why asked gebb sharply this question mrs grix did not choose to hear but mumbling and shaking her old head hobbled along the passages in the direction of the yellow room she ushered gebb into this with a chuckle and threw open the shutters to let the sunlight shine on the faded and timeworn decorations of the room i spose youll want to see this first said mrs grix most folks likes to see a room as a murders been done in theres a stain of blood over in that cornermasters blood which miss gilmar would never let be wiped out i dessay master comes and looks at it and wishes he had his body again he was an awful bad oneand mean mrs grix lifted up a pair of dirty and trembling hands they was both of em skinflints said she with a nod whom are you speaking of mrs grix of miss gilmar and mr kirkstone sir did you know them did i know them echoed the hag with scorn of course i knowed them and a bad lot the pair of em was they give miss laurer a fine time i can tell you i wonder she didnt go off with mr dean i do were you here when the murder took place asked gebb lor bless yer eart i sawr the ole of it croaked mrs grix master was alying over there with a knife in his eart and miss gilmar she was ollering for the police did dean kill kirkstone ah thats telling said mrs grix cunningly dont you ask no questions young man and you wont be told no lies you must tell me cried gebb seizing her by the wrist i am from scotland yarda detective and he shook the beldame furiously mrs grix raised a feeble wail of horror lor youre perlice are you she whimpered jist let me go i know nothin did laura kirkstone kill her brother i dunno i swear i dunno was miss gilmar the criminal mrs grix leered she never told me she was sir but she didnt carry the yeller room about with her for nothing what do you mean said gebb releasing her mrs grix rubbed her wrist which had been somewhat bruised by his clasp and leered again miss gilmar wrote it all down she said a confession cried the detective i dunno what you call it sir but i know she wrote it down cause she said to me itll be all right when im dead well she are dead said mrs grix and it aint all right unless she left the writin behind her where is that confession i dunno i wish i did theres money in it ive hunted all over the ouse and i cant come across it nohow well mrs grix what is your opinion was it dean or miss gilmar or miss laura who killed the man you look about for the paper lovey said mrs grix coaxingly and itll tell ye all you tell me but i dont know for certain never mind what is your opinion will ye give me money for it that depends upon your information then i shant tell ye cried mrs grix backing towards the door you can look for what she wrote i shant elp you keep me fro the workouse and maybe ill tell ye summat to make you wink but not now not now old jane grix aint no fool lovey no no gebb made a step forward to detain her but mrs grix hobbled through the door and vanished in the darkness as mysteriously as any of the ghosts she had been talking about at all events when the detective slipped out of the yellow room and into the twilight of the passage his eyes were somewhat dazzled by the sunlight and glare of colour within and he saw nothing for the moment mrs grix was quicker on her old feet than he supposed and in some way hobbled out of sight into one of the numerous passages so that when gebbs eyes became accustomed to the gloom he did not know into which one she had gone also he heard rapidly retreating footstepsnot the heavy hobble of the old woman but rather the light dancing step of martin and as to confirm this impression he heard the hoarse voice of the gardener singing one of his wild songs light shall come but not from above joy shall come but not from love the glow of hell the lust of hate impatiently for these i wait ha said gebb to himself as he hurried down the passage martin has been listening i wonder why i dont believe he is mad after all for neither that old woman nor miss wedderburn is afraid of him he must be feigning madness for some reason ha cried the detective with a sudden start can martin be the murderer of before he could finish the sentence he heard a series of piercing shrieks from mrs grix and a hoarse growling from martin these noises sounded far in the distance and gebb ran down the passage through the sittingroom into which he had been shown by miss wedderburn on the occasion of his first visit and on to the terrace here he saw mrs grix running from martin who was rushing after her with a furious face gebb stared not at the terrified old woman who was hurrying towards him with wonderful activity for one of her years but at martins face it wore a savage scowl and there between the eyes was the deep mark spoken of by parge dean cried gebb thunderstruck you are dean yes yes screeched mrs grix getting behind gebb hes dean sure enough he was going to kill me cause i wanted to tell ye martinor rather deanstopped when he heard his name then turned and leaping over the terrace ran like a hare down the avenue chapter xxi found at last on seeing the pseudonymous gardener speeding down the avenue gebb lost no time but leaving mrs grix to her rage and lamentation vaulted over the terrace in his turn and raced at top speed after the fugitive the detective was lean and young and an excellent runner whereas dean alias martin was old and scant of breath so the only thing which equalized the contest was the despair which winged the feet of the wretched quarry if dean were caught by the bloodhound of the law he would be shortly relegated to the prison whence he had escaped so he flew wildly over the ground running he knew not whither to escape the fate which awaited him and gebb who personified nemesis followed hotfooted in his track the road to norminster ran straight through the fields like a white ribbon laid upon green velvet and the town itself was distant a mile from kirkstone hall down this amid a cloud of white dust gebb saw dean running some way ahead and setting his elbows to his sides he followed steadily and surely reserving his wind for the termination of the race the result of which could only be the capture of the ragged figure now flying for dear life carters and pedestrians and labourers in the fields stared in amazement at the chase and some with that love of sport inherent in every breast joined gebb in his manhunt after dean had covered a quarter of a mile he began to fail and to zigzag in his course bounding wildly from one side to the other and wasting his strength in useless ways gebb with his shouting train drew steadily nearer and the miserable hunted wretch could hear their cries and the beating of their feet on the hard white road still he endeavoured to shake off his pursuers and escape for by a powerful effort he managed to run another quarter of a mile then age and fear and exhaustion told on his failing limbs and with a wild cry dean flung up his hands despairingly and fell amid puffs of dust when gebb arrived he was lying senseless in the middle of the highroad so said the detective to himself as he knelt beside the ragged creature ive found you at last mr dean you know the truth of all these matters at any rate and in some way or another ill force you into confessing it but at the present moment it seemed as though dean would never speak again in this world for he lay as still as any corpse his white head and whiter face resting on gebbs knee the frowning mark between the eyes by which the detective had known him was smoothed away and there was no expression on the blank countenance no movement in the slack limbs gebb however knew that this apparent death was only a temporary faintness and whipping out his brandyflask forced some drops of the fiery liquid between the white lips of his prisoner while engaged in this kindly office the labourers who had joined in the pursuit came up with much amazement expressed on their honest sunburnt faces whats the matter with mad martin mister asked one looking at the unconscious dean hes madder than usual thats all said gebb and has nearly killed mrs grix at the hall yonder i must take him to norminster and get a doctor to look after him hell die here the detective made this artful speech with the intention of enlisting the sympathy of the bystanders both for himself and martin alias dean as popular feeling generally inclines towards defiance of law and order moreover a detective is not an admired character with the common people and gebb had no desire to render his task of capturing dean more difficult than was necessary by stating his vocation so for diplomatic reasons he spoke as above the result justified his precaution for the labourers were most anxious that the mad gardeneras they knew him to beshould be taken at once to norminster and placed in charge of a medical man a cart was coming along the road and into this dean was hoisted by friendly hands gebb having taken his seat beside him the vehicle rolled slowly towards norminster while the labourers returned to their work quite vivacious after the exciting episode which had broken the monotony of the day gebb knowing what was at stake felt thankful to get rid of them so easily as it was but half a mile to norminster from the spot where dean had fallen the cart soon arrived there the man himself had revived thanks to gebbs brandy and sat staring straight before him in a kind of sullen stupor he made one effort to escape when he was set down at the door of the gaol but gebb with the assistance of a near policeman soon overpowered him and carried him within while the carter drove off wondering in his slowthinking mind that a man brought to see a doctor should be taken to the county gaol for care however he had received five shillings from gebb so did not trouble his head about the matter and spent most of it at the next publichouse where he narrated the episode with such additions as his drunken humour suggested to the governor of the gaol gebb explained that dean was an escaped prisoner for whom the police had long been looking and mentioned his own name and occupation the result of this was that dean was confined in a cell with a warder to watch him lest he should in his despair attempt suicide then gebb repaired to an hotel and wrote to the governor of the gaol whence dean had escaped asking him to come down himself or send some responsible person in order to identify the prisoner the detective also sent an urgent wire to ferris requesting him to visit norminster at once on business connected with martin for he shrewdly suspected that the artist knew of the mans identity with dean and that the mention of the name would bring both arthur and edith immediately to kirkstone hall it was shortly after midday when gebb sent this telegram so he quite expected that if matters stood as he imagined ferris would come down and not alone for if ferris knew that martin was his father edith also must be in the secret and no doubt she would accompany him then gebb who was really angry with the young couple for their many concealments determined to have a thorough explanation of their strange behaviour these important matters having been attended to gebb returned to the gaol and saw dean but the interview proved to be anything but a success whether the man was mad or not gebb could not decide without evidence but certainly his present sullen silence formed a strange contrast to his former excitement he neither talked recklessly nor sang his wild songs his limbs were at rest and his eyes looked dull although formerly they had been bright and glittering with vacant gaze and a sullen expression he sat huddled up in a corner of his cell and absolutely refused to speak or even notice his questioner the man was thoroughly exhausted and worn out but gebb left the cell with the firm conviction that dean was perfectly sane and that his madness had been feigned to more effectually baffle dangerous inquiries but like the fox in the fable for all his tricks the man had been caught at last and gebb wondered if after all he had murdered miss gilmar did that return thirdclass ticket dropped in the room at paradise row belong to dean the detective asked himself i should not be surprised if it did as miss wedderburn denies that it is hers dean under the name of martin is the only person who could have used it in that case he must have remained in london all night for as the crime was committed at ten oclock he could not have caught a return train so late to norminster now mrs grix lives in the hall so she is the most likely person to let me know if dean was absent on the twentyfourth of july ill see her at once and get to know all i can pending the arrival of ferris and miss wedderburn they may deny deans complicity in the crime so i must be prepared to baffle them having made up his mind to question mrs grix the detective making a hurried meal walked out to kirkstone hall and arrived to find the old woman solacing herself with ginandwater after the fatigues of the morning she was excessively nervous when gebb reappeared as she was conscious she had said too much in her rage with martin and now guessed that she was about to be thoroughly examined touching all she knew concerning him mrs grix to save her own skin was quite prepared to equivocate and gebb guessed as much for he went to work with her in a severe official way which frightened her considerably now mrs grix said he when they were comfortably established in the kitchen ive come to ask you a few questions i dont know nothin i dont protested mrs grix beginning her tactics you know a great deal replied gebb sharply and if you dont answer me truthfully ill arrest you on suspicion and put you in gaol longside of dean so now you know lawkamussy squealed mrs grix have you put him in prison yes i have so you tell me the truth or ill put you in also ill speak out sir cried the old wretch much terrified i dont want to go to prison ive done nothing you have spied and listened and searched retorted gebb all for the sake of gaining possession of other peoples secrets and extracting blackmail when possible now you answer my questions or it will be the worse for you im willing sir said mrs grix meekly but i dont know as much as you think i only suspects like can you tell me who killed kirkstone asked the detective thats one thing i dont know for certain replied the dame but if you arsk me sir i belve as miss gilmar did on what grounds do you suspect her becose she wrote out summat telling the truth and hid it and she wouldnt have done that unless she were guilty then she were in love with mr dean and mr kirkstone wanted him to marry miss laura so i thinks as miss ellen got em both out of the way she was a clever one was miss ellen do you know where the confession is no i dont martin was always hunting for it to clear himself but if he found it he didnt tell me and martin is dean yes he is it aint no good tellin lies lovey he is dean i thought there was a gardener here at the time of the murder called martin there was replied mrs grix coolly and he was queer too i tell you but not as queer as this martin i knowed he was dean as soon as i clapped eyes on him though he was sorely altered from the andsome man he was then he impersonated martin to save himself from the police he did hes no more mad than i am but he thought it was safer to pretend being crazy his songs was awful said mrs grix shuddering did miss wedderburn know the truth of course sir and when she knowed as i knowed she tole me to old my tongue and paid me for doing it but she didnt give much lovey did mr ferris know seeing as mr deans his own born fatherwhich i knowed fro listening to m talkinghe did did dean kill miss gilmar mrs grix did not reply to this question with her former glibness i dont rightly know of that she said slowly if he did it wasnt here for miss ellen was in london this long time was dean ever in london while he stayed here under the name of martin yes he was and just about the time of the murder it was in july miss ellen died wasnt it it was replied gebb eagerly on the twentyfourth of july ah well i shouldnt be surprised if dean did kill her he was always talking of punishing her continued mrs grix with relish but i didnt think hed go so far as murder what makes you think that he did asked gebb why said mrs grix nodding he was up in london in july and he stayed there all night on the twentyfourth i cant be sure sir but it was at the end of the month and when he came back he was queerer than ever oh i dessay he went up to kill miss ellen said mrs grix with conviction i cant swear to it but im sure he did and serve her right too chapter xxii a secret hoard on concluding the examination of mrs grixwhich lasted some time owing to the inherent objection of that lady to speak the truthgebb spent the afternoon in searching the house for miss gilmars confession by this time he had quite adopted the opinion of mrs grix regarding the guilt of the former housekeeper and on the same authority he was certain that she had written out and hidden away an account of her crime the question was where was it concealed for the house was so large and rambling and dusty and dusky that gebb almost despaired of finding the paper at first he thought it might be hidden in the yellow room in that fatal apartment the crime had been committed and to keep her perpetually in mind of deans threat against her life the wretched woman had lived during her concealment in a precisely similar apartment decorated and furnished in the same manner so seeing that she had attached such importance to it the probability was that she had hidden the paper within its precincts but a strict examination of floor walls carpet hangings and furniture proved that the confession was not there gebb was disgusted at this result and turned his attention to the rest of the house in the few hours he had to himself he examined nearly every room in the place not forgetting the sleeping apartments of dean and mrs grix which were situated in the back part of the house he made several discoveries of more or less importance but the object of his search he failed to find towards five oclock he gave up hunting for this needle in a haystackfor the search was quite as difficult and impossibleand repaired hot and dusty to mrs grix from the old woman he obtained water to wash in and a brush for his clothes and afterwards she supplied him with a cold supper and beer just as gebb finished this feeling very refreshed he heard the sound of voices and stepped on to the terrace to find that ferris and edith had arrived they both looked pale and nervous and the grim way in which the detective eyed them inspired neither with confidence we are here you see said ferris as edith seemed unwilling to speak but neither miss wedderburn nor myself can guess the reason of your very peremptory telegram i think you know the reason very well said gebb grimly else you would not be here however there is no need to talk secrets in the open so if you will come with me to the yellow boudoir we can speak more at our easeand perhaps more openly finished the detective with a dry cough edith looked at her lover in a quick terrified manner but judged it wiser to make no remark and the two meekly followed gebb into the yellow room here they sat down side by side on the primrosehued couch while gebb after glancing outside to see that mrs grix was not listening closed and locked the door then he drew a chair in front of the couch and surveyed the pair in no very friendly manner well miss wedderburn and mr ferris he said with much displeasure it seems i have to find out things for myself what things asked edith flushing for not knowing the extent of gebbs knowledge neither she nor ferris was prepared to speak freely things which you know miss wedderburn and about which you could have informed me if i had known then what i know now added gebb with emphasis i might have had less trouble and more result in this murder case i dont understand you faltered ferris doubtfully you may understand me better when i tell you that your father is in prison again my father dean yes dean or martinwhichever you like to call him do you mean to say that mad martin the gardener is really mr dean said edith making a final attempt to baffle gebb yes miss wedderburn i do and why should you or mr ferris there pretend ignorance of what you know to be true i recognized dean myself from a description given by parge no one can mistake that mark between the eyes when he frownswhich mark i see mr ferris has at this moment and to make sure that martin is dean i have the evidence of mrs grix mrs grix has she told you she has told me everything interrupted gebb and dean tried to punish her for talking then he ran away and i chased him into norminster where he now lies in gaol but he is mad said ferris eagerly who is mad demanded gebb turning on him your father or martin the gardener ferris made a despairing gesture since you know so much he said in low tones i admit that the two are one and the same martin is really my father marmaduke dean who has been concealed here but he is insane he is nothing of the sort mr ferris his insanity was feigned for the better baffling of the police neither you nor miss wedderburn can deceive me any longer you have kept silence you have told untruths and altogether have given me endless trouble but now i must insist upon your speaking out both of you this time i know so much that you cannot deceive me and ill force you to speak suppose we refuse cried edith indignant at this rough speech if you do ill arrest you both as accessories after the fact to the murder of miss gilmar ah you look afraid but i knowi know dean murdered that woman and you are both aware of it my father is innocent cried arthur with a groan if he is what was he doing at grangebury on the evening of the murder why did he stay in london all night what was his return ticket to norminster doing in miss gilmars room at paradise row the man is guilty i tell you defend him if you can tell the truth if you dare and for once both of you act honourably and straightforwardly the detective spoke with much vehemence and rising from his seat walked rapidly up and down the room much as edith resented his language yet she was conscious that in a great measure it was deserved for this reason she restrained her passion and spoke frankly and to the purpose mr gebb she said and the detective paused to listen i do not deny that much you say is true neither myself nor mr ferris have spoken so openly as we might have done but you must not forget that we had much that was dangerous to ourselves to conceal if we had told you about the necklace you might have suspected us of the crime and it was dread of such danger which kept us silent i know that you are both innocent said gebb coldly but about dean we did not speak of deanof my fatherfor the same reason struck in arthur earnestly he was imprisoned for a crime which he did not commit and you would not have had mehis own sonbetray him perhaps not it is a hard thing to ask responded the detective but now that i know so much perhaps you will tell me more and inform me how it was that your father came here and when it was that you first recognized him certainly replied arthur with a glance at edith for permission to speak i heard almost immediately about my fathers escape from prison and knowing his hatred for miss gilmar i came to kirkstone hall thinking he might go there to revenge himself however although he had not come miss gilmar with a guilty conscience no doubt took fright and went to hide herself in london on my first visit i met miss wedderburn and afterwards i frequently came to see her one day while i was here an old man arrived and asked to see miss gilmar i saw him and so did miss wedderburn and when he heard my name and had examined me carefully he saluted me as his son at first i could scarcely believe that he was my father as i had not seen him for close on twenty years and was too young to retain much recollection of him but he soon proved to me that he was marmaduke dean and told us how he had escaped did he come to the hall to kill miss gilmar asked gebb anxiously no said ferris with emphasis that threat was uttered only in his mad passion all he wanted from her was proof of his innocence and i wrote to her about it said edith taking up the tale but she was afraid of mr dean and swore that he killed mr kirkstone though i am certain interposed arthur that she killed him herself and accused my father because she was jealous of his love for laura that may be said gebb nodding but proceed with your story let me tell the rest cried miss wedderburn mr dean was so broken down and ill with the life he had led in prison that i suggested he should stay here and let me look after him the police had been to the hall and not having found him there had left i did not think they would come again so i believed that mr dean would be quite safe so he stayed for a day or so until mrs grix recognized him but i bribed her with money to silence she suggested that for safety mr dean should pretend to be martina gardener not quite right in his head who had left the hall after the tragedy it was twenty years since he had gone and mr dean was much altered from his former self so in the end he adopted the name of martin and pretended to be mad so now you know mr gebb when you saw me first the reason why i was not afraid of his madness you thought it real i knew it to be feigned did every one round here think he was really martin come back yes but he kept within the hall grounds and saw few people these left him alone because of his madness so there is the truth mr gebb not all the truth said gebb significantly you have not told me how he killed miss gilmar he did not kill her cried ferris furiously he did insisted gebb he was in grangebury on the twentyfourth of july impossible said edith much alarmed i did not know that but even if he was she went on it does not prove that he killed the woman its pretty good as circumstantial evidence said gebb coolly but i have another and stronger proof look here and out of his pocket the detective took a canvas bag which when opened displayed bracelets rings and diamond stars miss gilmars jewels cried edith recognizing them at once yes said gebb miss gilmars jewels which i found concealed in deans bedroom chapter xxiii the convicts defence shaking in the body and white in the face ferris looked upon the jewellery which seemed positive evidence of his fathers guilt then flung himself back on the couch with a groan his hand over his eyes to shut out the terrible sightfor terrible it was to him the son of marmaduke dean edith also gazed fearfully upon the heap of gold and glittering stones not doubting the truth of gebbs story yes said the detective raking the jewels together and replacing them in the bag in looking for miss gilmars confession i found these in the room of dean they were hidden on the top of a tall press in a dark corner and i felt rather than saw them the case against your father is clear enough mr ferris although i was doubtful of it at first mrs grix can prove that he spent the night of the twentyfourth of july away from the hall the ticket i found in miss gilmars room shows that he must have been there since no one but he could have possessed in this especial instance a ticket from norminster to london ill have the evidence of the stationmaster and the ticketclerk to prove his purchase of it shortly and finally the possession of this jewellery places the matter beyond all doubt there must be some mistake said edith when she found her tongue for although the evidence is against mr dean i cant believe him guilty he is an old brokendown man timid and cowed to plan and carry out so ingenious and remorseless a crime would need more spirit and determination than he is possessed of besides she added very reasonably if as we all think mr dean is guiltless of kirkstones death why should he kill miss gilmar that is rather an argument against than in favour of him said gebb quietly if she condemned him unjustly and bore false witness against him as i truly believe she did that very fact would make him all the more anxious to punish her for such perjury what do you think mr ferris what can i think groaned the young man the evidence seems to prove my fathers guilt still on the face of it i agree with miss wedderburn he cannot be guilty innocent men have been hanged on evidence as conclusive yet afterwards the truth has come to light a judge and jury found him guilty of kirkstones murder which we are now certain he did not commit so it is possible that despite the evidence to the contrary he may be innocent of this second crime mr gebb added ferris entreatingly you know the whole of this matter and are more experienced in such cases than miss wedderburn and myself tell us trulydo you believe in my fathers guilt the detective hesitated and looking from one to the other rubbed his chin in a perplexed manner i shall answer you honestly mr ferris said he after a pause i am not certain of your fathers guilt i said that the possession of this jewellery placed the matter beyond doubt but against that i must place the factestablished by strong circumstantial evidencethat miss gilmar received her assassin as a friend she was afraid of dean and even after the lapse of twenty years she must have recognized him in place of giving him wine and cigarettes her impulse would have been to cry out for help moreover without knowing all about her visitorpresuming he was disguisedshe would not have let him into her house on the whole i am doubtful the fact of the jewellery being found in his room proves his guilt the fact that miss gilmar conversed with him as a friend shows his innocence who can decide the matter i know said edith suddenlymr dean himself you say that he is in norminster gaol mr gebb well that is only a mile from here so let us all three go there and question mr dean with this evidence for and against him he must either declare his innocence or admit his guilt it is the most straightforward course said gebb with a nod what do you say mr ferris i am content to abide by my fathers word replied arthur rising anything is better than this uncertainty let us go to norminster gaol its rather late said gebb glancing at his watch however i dare say we shall have no difficulty in seeing the prisoner come along in the then tumbledown deserted condition of kirkstone hall there was no vehicle obtainable but the evening was pleasant and norminster no great distance away so the three walked briskly along the road in the cool grey twilight conversing about the case made the way seem short and they soon arrived in the little town and halted before the gates of the gaol a word from gebb procured them instant admittance and they were shown into the presence of the governor a retired major with a bluff manner and a twinkling eye which was not unobservant of ediths good looks well sir said gebb almost immediately and how is your prisoner clothed and in his right mind replied the governor he has given over his sulking and feigned madness and evidently seems resolved to make the best of things indeed i shouldnt be surprised mr gebb if he intended to make you his fatherconfessor for he has asked several times after you good said gebb rubbing his hands this looks like business he has thrown up the sponge will you see him now asked the governor with a side glance at edith at once if you please and i wish this lady and gentleman to be admitted with me well it is hardly regular to admit strangers at this hour mr gebb said the major still as you captured the man and it is as well for you to hear his confession if he wishes to make it i am content to accede to your request have you any interest in the matter he asked looking at edith inquisitively yes the man was hidden in my place under the name of martin she replied with a blush not deeming it wise to further enlighten the governor indeed you are miss wedderburn of the hall i thought so well go along all of you but dont remain more than half an hour with the prisoner i have to lock up for the night shortly and i may be tempted to keep so fair a lady in my castle you know laughing at his own mild joke the governor gave his visitors over to the guidance of a warder and they were soon ushered into a cell where they found dean sitting on his bed chatting cheerfully with the man who watched him he sprang up to receive them and after the warder had exchanged a few words with the watcher they both withdrew leaving the lamp in the cell gebb was much gratified by this mark of the governors trust and spoke to dean with great complacency i see you have come to your senses mr dean he said civilly enough but with point it is about time i think as you say about time replied dean who had been greeting edith and his son i have given over fighting against the injustice of the world i was condemned an innocent man some twenty years ago and i escaped from my prison in the vain hope of getting ellen gilmar to prove my innocence but she is dead and i am again in the hands ofi wont say justice but injustice but why did you kill miss gilmar asked gebb for ferris and edith sat by quietly letting him conduct the conversation as the most capable person i did not kill miss gilmar replied dean firmly and sadly god knows who sent that wicked woman to her last account but it was not i yet you uttered a threat against her i did in my first wrath at the injustice of my sentence but nearly twenty years of imprisonment removed revenge from my heart i came down to kirkstone hall not to kill her but to implore her to tell the truth and free me from undeserved shame but she had fled thinking in her guilty mind that i intended to harm her i told miss wedderburn that i did not also ari mean mr ferris you can call him arthur said gebb coolly i know that he is your son is this so asked dean looking with some surprise at ferris yes father i told mr gebb the truth or rather i admitted it as he had already learned my relationship to you from prain he knows everything and we have come to ask you to right yourself in his eyesto confess confess arthur do you believe that i killed kirkstone no said arthur with conviction i do not and you edith said dean looking at the girl is it your opinion that i am guilty of miss gilmars death no replied edith in her turn appearances are against you but i truly believe you to be guiltless and so i am for before you go on interrupted gebb looking up i think it will be best for you to approach this matter with more particularity were you not at grangebury on the night of the twentyfourth of july yes admitted dean promptly i was i went to see mr basson who had been my counsel about what about the confession of miss gilmar what cried gebb in surprise you found it i found it on the twentieth of july concealed in the yellow boudoir where ellen gilmar had hidden it i know now who killed kirkstone miss laura cried the detective knowing deans belief no miss gilmar herself was the murderess well i never said gebb and looked at edith and her lover who were not much astonished and where is the confession now mr alder has it was the unexpected reply alder why he believes you to be guilty he said so several times i asked him to replied dean quickly mr alder has been a good friend to me all through he has been a good friend to us all said edith touching arthurs hand does mr alder know who you are yes he had been present at my trial you know and in spite of my altered appearance he recognized me on one of his visits to the hall i begged him to keep my secret and he did i asked him to talk of me as guilty so that i might be the more effectually concealed i dont see how that would help you interrupted gebb sharply why not if alder had gone about insisting that i was innocent you might have suspected that he had seen me lately while by stating what everybody believed no questions would be asked true enough said gebb his brow clearing but i confess this disjointed information of yours puzzles me not a little suppose you tell us the whole story from the time you first masqueraded as mad martin certainly assented dean readily i intended to do so as i wish you to help me to establish my innocence also i owe it to my son and miss wedderburn to relate things i formerly kept from them we are all attention said edith and leaned forward eagerly when i was feigning madness at the hall said dean glancing at his three auditors i was wondering all the time how i could prove my innocence of kirkstones murder one night mrs grixwho had found out my true nametold me that miss gilmar had written a confession of the crime andas she believedhad hidden it in the house she gathered this from some words let fall by miss gilmar thenceforth it became the aim of my life to find that confession but although i looked everywhere i could not discover it then mr alder came visiting at the hall as you know edith and he guessed who i was feeling that i could not deceive him i confessed that i was really marmaduke dean and consulted him as to the possibility of proving my innocence alder scoffed at the idea of a confession being in existence as he said if miss gilmar were guilty she would not put the fact down in black and white he advised me to consult basson who had been my counsel and to see if i could not be cleared but this i was afraid to do lest basson should hand me over to the police oh he would never have done that said gebb remembering the personality of basson he is good nature itself so alder said continued dean still i was too afraid to venture and remained in hiding at the hall thankful that alder kept my secret i must say that in every way he acted like a true friend for he could easily have given warning about me to the authorities i wonder he did not do so for miss gilmars sake said gebb had he deemed me guilty he would have done so cried dean quickly but i told him the whole facts of the case and declared that laura being possessed of the knife had killed her brother alder in the end said he believed in my innocence but he declined to look upon laura as the assassin he fancied that miss gilmar had committed the crime and to shield herself and punish me for not being in love with her she accused me still he declined to believe that she had confessed her guilt in writing i was certain however from what mrs grix said that she had and this is all very well interrupted gebb quickly but it does not explain your visit to grangebury chapter xxiv proof positive impatient of the interruption dean looked at gebb in a quick irritable way like a man whose nerves are not under control but in his own interests he answered quietly enough i am coming to the grangebury visit shortly he said but it is necessary for me to explain what led to it so that you may not misunderstand my reason for going there i beg your pardon mr dean replied the detective pray go on as i said before continued the prisoner i was certain that miss gilmar had left a confession behind her and after months of search i found it where asked edith much interested in the yellow room it was sewn into the hangings between the satin and the lining and but for the particular minute search i made would never have been discovered i dare say ellen gilmar hid it thus safely so that she might not be accused of the crime in her lifetime but no doubt when dying she intended to indicate its hidingplace so that i might be set free and my character cleared after she was safe from the punishment of man as she is observed ferris bitterly leave her to god said dean slowly as she has sown so shall she reap and i wish her no worse fate well continued he you will understand that as soon as i discovered this proof of my innocence i was bent upon clearing myself but this was not so easy to do i had escaped from gaol and were i discovered would be at once taken back when as i fancied the confession might go astray or prove useless it was towards the end of july last that i found it and i consulted mr alder who came down about the same time to visit edith yes said edith colouring he came to ask me again to marry him alder advised me to place the confession in the hands of basson and offered to take it up to him but at the moment i was unwilling to let this proof of my innocence leave my hands and i determined to go up to london myself and see basson but thinking i might be discovered i feared to do soor at all events to go to bassons office i wrote and told alder this so he suggested that i should go to grangebury where mr basson was giving a lecture on the twentyfourth of july and he said i could come up late and see mr basson before the lecture place the confession in his hands with instructions what to do and then return by a late train to norminster thus he said in his letter i should be exposed to less risk of discovery the advice seemed good to me and i adopted it but where did you get the money to visit london asked edith for i never gave you any i borrowed it from mrs grix and told her i was visiting a friend explained dean also i asked her to tell you that i had gone into norminster in case you missed me i didnt miss you at all and there was no need for mrs grix to say anything said miss wedderburn all the same she added reproachfully you might have trusted me and me also interposed ferris i should have had the confession not basson you are right replied his father with a sigh i behaved foolishly i admit but i acted as i thought for the best on the twentyfourth of july by the five oclock train i went up to grangebury did you know that miss gilmar was there asked gebb with a glance at edith no i did not answered dean why do you ask because miss wedderburn knew of miss gilmars whereabouts that is true enough responded edith calmly but i did not think it necessary at the time to tell mr dean no one but myselfand later on arthurknew that miss gilmar was lodging in paradise row continue mr dean i arrived late in grangebury about six oclock and went to a publichouse where i had some tea and made myself as respectable as possible to go to the lecture i intended to see mr basson before it began and then take the nine oclock train to norminster had you a return ticket asked gebb remembering the one found in the yellow room yes a thirdclass return however in the publichouse i fell asleep being worn out with trouble and fatigue i did not waken until it was nearly nine oclock and then went to the town hall mr basson was already on the platform so i could not speak to him yet i was anxious to get back to norminster on that night as i did not want edith to know i had been in london but why said edith you must have been aware that you could trust me i wished you to know nothing my dear until basson proved my innocence replied dean sadly but i should have trusted you i see it now however i did not go back that night for i lost my ticket where did you lose it asked gebb eagerly for this was a most important point dean shook his head i cant say he replied i saw mr alder at the door of the town hall and told him that i was going back but gave him the confession and asked him to show it to basson he tried to get me to remain but i was bent on returning and knew that the confession was safe in his hands i ran to the station but there found i had lost my ticket where i know not i had no money to buy another so i went back to the town hall and saw mr alder again about halfpast nine oclock then to my surprise i saw edith enter the hall i had just returned from getting the necklace from miss gilmar explained edith i came up to grangebury after you did i did not know you were out of kirkstone hall said dean well i did not trouble to wonder why you were there but lest you should see me i kept myself out of sight i then explained my position to mr alder he gave me some money and advised me to stay all night at grangebury i was unwilling to do so but as the last train had left i was forced to stay i slept in the publichouse where i had been before and left by the early train next morning did you hear of the murder before you left no as i departed early so you see mr gebb i can prove an alibi for at the time of the murderten oclock it was the paper saidi was asleep in the publichouse the keeper of it can prove that i was what is the name of the publichouse the golden hind near the railway station gebb noted this name in his pocketbook and rose to his feet so this is all you have to tell me said he briskly alland enough too i dont know who killed ellen gilmar it was not i if the hotel keeper can prove your alibi that will be all right mr dean but this confession you say mr alder has it yes but i asked him to make no use of it replied dean for as i was in grangebury on the very nightabout the very hourthat ellen was murdered i was afraid if alder acted on the confession i might be accused of the second crime certainly i had a defence but the evidence was so strong against me that i did not wish to risk appearing do you know who killed miss gilmar no cried dean vehemently i do not then what about these said gebb and suddenly produced the jewels of miss gilmar these ornaments belonged to the dead woman they were taken off her body by the wretch who killed her i found them hidden in your room at kirkstone hall yet you swear that you do not know the name of the assassin what am i to understand by this contradiction its a plot to ruin me said dean becoming very pale i did not know that these jewels were in my room i never saw them before edith arthur what do you know of this we know nothing they said simultaneously come mr dean said gebb imperiously these ornaments would not have been hidden in your room without your knowledge if your alibi is to be believed you are innocent but on this evidence you must know who is guilty dean gave a long sigh and lapsed into his old sullen manner i know nothing about them he said in a piteous tone some one must have put them there i dont know who i have told you the truth but even that will not help one and i shall be condemned for the second timean innocent man oh god is cruelcruel and the tears ran down his cheeks after that there was little more to be said the old man was ill and feeble for the moment he had braced himself to tell his story and the hope of being righted had given him unnatural strength but now that all was told nature claimed her own and dean fell back on his bed thoroughly exhausted ferris desired to stay beside his father but when the warder came back they would not permit this and in the end the three left the prison in the street gebb turned to speak a few words to edith before leaving for town as he had decided to do what are your intentions he asked i shall stay here until tomorrow she replied i am too exhausted to return to london tonight but i must go up in the morning as i promised to see mr alder alder repeated gebb who had half forgotten the man how is he very illdying they say and he sent for me to see him i could not go today as i came here with arthur to see what had been done about his father do you think he is innocent yes i do replied gebb but i am puzzled about the jewels i cannot help thinking that dean knows something about them but he wont speak he may tomorrow morning said ferris quickly i think he is too exhausted tonight to remember much more his memory has been severely taxed today you know i shall speak to him tomorrow and whatever he tells me i shall tell you mr gebb very well replied gebb dubiously and walked briskly to the railway station as he was anxious to reach london to see parge and tell him what he had discovered also he desired the advice of parge regarding the jewels for despite arthurs promise he did not trust him altogether the young man had deceived him before and should occasion arise might do so again so gebb determined to act independently of anything which might be said by dean in the morning he was surrounded on all sides by people who with their own ends to gain were more or less unscrupulous so it behoved him to be wary otherwise he would never pluck out the heart of this mystery on arriving in town gebb went to his office and there found three letters for him two from the stationmaster and the ticketclerk of norminster station were corroborative of deans visit to town on the evening of the twentyfourth of july for both stated that mad martin the gardener of kirkstone hall had purchased a return ticket and had left for london by the five oclock train but knowing what he did this evidence came too late to enlighten gebb in any degree so he tossed the letters aside and opened the third one it proved to be from parge requesting him to call and see him at once on important business concerning the grangebury murder case these latter words being underlined he has found out something thought gebb i wonder what it is another maresnest i expect however well see ill call tomorrow at ten oclock next morning he was in pimlico and in the presence of mr parge who received him with a look of subdued triumph well absalom said he have you discovered who killed miss gilmar no i havent simon have you yes i found out the truth fromwho do you think i dont know said gebb impatiently mrs presk perhaps no not from the mistress but from the maidmatilda crane gebb looked at the exdetective in amazement why what did she know about it she knew who visited miss gilmar on the night of the murder i said you had not examined that girl properly absalom so i sent for her to put a few questions myself then i discovered that she had found cast into the grate among other papers a letter written by the assassin to miss gilmar here it is gebb took the bit of paper handed to him and read as follows dear miss gilmar i wish to see you on the evening of the th july between nine and ten oclock about some information touching dean get rid of every one in the house at that time and expect me for certain it will be better for us to be alone burn this yours truly john alder alder repeated gebb in amazement alder yes it was alder who murdered that wretched woman chapter xxv how the deed was done gebb quite agreed with parge regarding the guilt of alder and on looking back over the collective evidence he wondered that he had not suspected him before no wonder he had come forward to defend ferris for bad as he was the man had some conscience and did not wish to see a guiltless person hanged for his crime even though that person was his rival in love what gebb could not understand was why alder had been so kind to dean and it was to ascertain this amongst other things that he left parge as soon as he was able and went off to alders rooms the man was dying and for the clearance of all persons concerned in the matter it was absolutely necessary that he should make a confession of his guilt even at the eleventh hour i could tell you much that i have discovered said gebb slipping the incriminating letter into his pocket but as alder is dying there is no time to be lost in getting him to confess i agree with you replied parge promptly i knew that he was dying as i saw an account of his accident in the papers get him to confess and for that purpose take mr basson with you as a witness then come back to me and tell me everything i wish to write out all details concerning this very extraordinary case and put the report in my collection it certainly merits it replied gebb putting on his hat and i dare say this confession will be the most wonderful of all by the way why did not the servant give up this letter before because she is a cunning artful little minx burst out parge in great wrath and wished to make money over it she found it as i told you while cleaning out the grate when the room was stripped by alder the letter was torn across as miss gilmar evidently did not think it worth while to adopt alders advice and burn it it was lucky she did not or her death would have gone unavenged as it is as it is the man will escape the law interrupted gebb but i dare say hell be punished somehow im sure he deserves to be did mrs presk know of tildas discovery no tilda kept the discovery to herself and intended to sell her information to the highest bidder it took me two hours to wring the truth and the letter out of her but i did in the end and for the evidence i paid her five pounds ive no doubt miss wedderburn will pay you when she comes into the estate what the five pounds exclaimed parge wrathfully why i expect the reward but the reward was to be paid by alder himself argued gebb and although it was a blind you can hardly expect the man to pay for his own detection his next heir must pay it said the exdetective doggedly miss wedderburn is the next heir then ill apply to her cried parge im going to be paid for my trouble seems to me simon ive had all the trouble said gebb dryly youve sat in your armchair and done nothing ive found out the truth if you call that nothing retorted parge growing red ive used my brains which is more than you have done there is life in the old dog yet absalom and temper also rejoined gebb who was rather sore about the reward eh simon well well well argue the matter hereafter i must go to alder dont forget to take basson no i wont but if you are right about alder you are wrong about dean he did not kill kirkstone then who did grunted parge rather displeased miss gilmar herself retorted gebb and departed swiftly leaving to his friend thisto himindigestible morsel parge raged a trifle after gebb had gone as he did not like to be put in the wrong but when he recollected his triumph in the new murder case he was quite content to set it against his failure in the old one so he sat placidly in his armchair and enjoyed his success and the prospect of getting two hundred pounds with so little trouble all of which was satisfactory to his wife also as it kept parge in a good temper for one entire day a state of things which was little less than miraculous in that frequently disturbed household in the mean time gebb with a desperate fear in his heart that he might be too late went as quick as a hansom could travel to bassons rooms keeping the cab at the door he ran up the long staircase so quickly that he arrived at the top with failing breath and beating heart the perennial legend back in five minutes was still on the barristers door and gebb on knocking was again greeted by the boy in the small suit this latter admitted that his master was at home but stated that he could not be seen cos he aint well explained cerberus hes had a shock what kind of a shock an accident asked gebb no replied the boy after some consideration not that sort of shock quite another kind well im sorry to disturb mr basson said gebb but you must take him my card and tell him that i must see him its a matter of life and death the boy still seemed unwilling but gebb thrust the card into his hand and insisted so in the end it was taken to basson in less than a minute cerberus returned with the information that his master would see mr gebb at once with a nod the detective stepped into the dingy inner office and found mr basson with his arms on the mantelpiece and his head bent down on them in an attitude of dejection when he heard the footstep of his visitorand firm quick businesslike footsteps they werehe turned slowly and displayed a very pale face and eyes so red that they looked as though he had been crying what is the matter asked gebb rather taken aback by this evidence of grief ive had a shock replied basson using the very same words as his small clerk had done nothing serious i hope serious in one way not in another still i am glad to see you if you had not come to me i should have paid you a visit in the course of the day you have a right to know know what demanded gebb beginning to feel uncomfortable he knew not why that alder is dead dead gebb with a burst of anger unusual in one of his selfcontrol dashed his hat on the floor by he used a strong word so he has escaped me after all what cried basson leaning forward in the chair he had flung himself into you know i know that alder killed miss gilmar i heard it this morning i have the evidence of his own handwriting to prove his guilt when did you hear of it how did you hear of it i heard all about it at eight oclock this morning shortly before alder died then he confessed his crime he did i was sent for at seven oclock at his particular request and he told me the whole story in order to clear any innocent person who might be suspected i wrote down what he said and got him to sign it the doctor and myself were the witnesses and the confession is locked in my desk yonder i was coming round to your office later on in order to place it in your hands how did you find out the truth its a long story mr basson ill tell it to you some other time but i learned that he killed his cousin and i came here to get you to go with me and force him to confess he did so voluntarily said basson sadly and made what reparation he could for his wickedness do you wonder that i received a shock mr gebb it was terrible to hear a man i had known so long whom i had liked so much confess himself a murderer it is terrible i grant you replied gebb somewhat moved by the grief of the old bohemian i should never have thought it of him myself as is proved by the fact that i never suspected him he seemed a kindly honest pleasant gentleman perhaps however there is the excuse that he did the deed in a fit of rage from what i have heard of miss gilmar she was a woman to irritate an archangel basson shook his head there is not even that excuse he said the crime was committed in cold blood he planned and carried it out in the most ruthless manner but why in heavens name did he desire the death of his wretched cousin money mr gebbmoney alder was desperately hard upon the verge of bankruptcy and as his cousin refused to help him he killed her to gain her wealth was the motive of the act well added basson with a sigh he did not enjoy his illgotten gains long for in the midst of his prosperity the hand of god struck him down you have the confession you say here it is basson unlocked the drawer of his desk and took out a sheet or to be precise several sheets of paper and handed them to gebb the detective turned to the end saw the three signatures then slipped the papers into his pocket it will take too long reading this just now he said apologetically and i have much to do will you be so kind mr basson as to tell me the facts in your own way i am curious to know how so many people concerned in the case came to be collected in grangebury on the night of the murder alder collected them said basson nodding he planned the whole affair in a most wonderful manner so as to throw suspicion of the crime on every one but himself had he lived he would have escaped all suspicion i think not replied gebb feeling for the letter he had received from parge his own handwriting would have committed him this is one of those little accidents which mar the plans of the most accomplished criminals however that is neither here nor there let me hear the confession basson thought for a moment then began it seems that miss wedderburn was not the only person miss gilmar wrote to she corresponded also with alder about business matters for as she had left her property to him by will she did not think that he would betray her to dean as a matter of fact she was simply putting temptation in the mans way for alder was desperately hard up and was looking forward to the time when he would come into possession of miss gilmars money however she did not know that and kept him advised of her changes of address did he know that she was in grangebury oh yes but he did not visit her there for already he was thinking of getting rid of her by violent means the difficulty was how to do it without incriminating himself then two accidents helped him the first was that while on a visit to kirkstone edith told him that she was bent on getting the necklace for arthur ferris and was going up to grangebury on the evening of the twentyfourth of july to get it ferris she said was to escort her later on while alder was still in the hall dean told how he had discovered miss gilmars confession and wished to give it to me he was afraid however to come to my office lest he should be recognized afterwards alder induced me to lecture at grangebury and wrote to dean telling him to come up and see me there then he gave ferris tickets for my lecture and told him he could wait for miss wedderburn in the town hall while she went to see miss gilmar so now you see mr gebb that on the twentyfourth of july alder had these three people likely to be suspected on the spot a very ingenious idea said gebb i suppose he didnt care on whom suspicion fell i dont think he did admitted basson candidly but he preferred to be guided by circumstances and he really wanted the suspicion to fall upon dean as he had threatened to kill miss gilmar well you know about arthur and edith yes i know that he waited in the town hall and that she got the necklace and joined him later and that they both returned to london also i know that dean came up and as he was too late to see you gave the confession to alder but i dont know how alder managed to get away from the hall without suspicion oh that was easy replied basson he was busy seeing after the tickets on my behalf and looking at the house so none of the attendants knew where he was at the moment but believed him to be in another part of the town hall when edith came back with the necklace he sent her into the hall and got rid of dean who had missed his train by giving him money and telling him to stay all night in grangeburya fact which favoured his plans then the coast being clear he went alone to paradise row shortly before ten oclock and saw miss gilmar in accordance with his instructions she was alone in the house as she had sent mrs presk and tilda to my lecture she admitted him yes and locked the door after he was inside but he did not see where she hid the key he then told her that dean had found the confession and miss gilmar as you may guess was in a great state she immediately with her usual superstition got out the cards to see what would happen and she turned up the deathcard yes how do you know because i found it in her lap yes said basson again she picked up the deathcard and while gazing at it in horror alder who was striding about the room smoking slipped behind her and with a cord torn from the nearest curtain strangled her he then robbed her of all her jewels and slipped them into his pocket then he tried to get out but found the doors locked and did not know where the keys were mrs presk had the key of the back door and miss gilmar that of the front said gebb quite so but alder did not know that he did not dare to get out by the window lest he should be taken for a burglar and arrested so he stepped down to the kitchen and waited till mrs presk came home he heard her go upstairs and then call tilda so that he knew the crime had been discovered when the servant went up to the yellow boudoir alder ran out of the back door and returned to the town hall the people in charge of the money and tickets thought that he had been with me i fancied he had been with them and as no inquiries were made you see nobody could guess that he had been away and had committed a crime and why did he leave the jewels in deans room at kirkstone hall ah you know that said basson much surprised why he hid them so as to throw the blame on dean everything was suspicious against the man he was presumably guilty of the first crime he had threatened to kill miss gilmar he was in grangebury on the night of the murder and the jewelsas alder arrangedwere to be found in his room they were found said gebb i found them and for the moment believed dean guilty but about that ticket found in the yellow boudoir that was purposely dropped there by alder to further incriminate dean how did he get the ticket in giving the confession it fell out of deans pocket and alder picked it up so you see mr gebb that in every way chance played into alders hands the wicked flourish like a green bay tree but not for long said gebb grimly but tell me why was alder so kind to ferris oh that was his deceit said basson with a sigh he fancied that when dean was accused of this second murder edith would never marry ferris as being the son of such a man he was kind to him because he wanted to ingratiate himself with edith so that she might marry him after parting as he thought she would with ferris infernal scamp cried gebb swearing when he knew that the poor devil was innocent have you miss gilmars confession here it is alder gave it to me it clears dean entirely so i suppose hell receive a free pardon i suppose so said gebb putting the confession of miss gilmar into his pocket along with that of alder but his life is ruined im only sorry for one thing that alder did not live to be hanged well i cannot agree with you after all he was my friend said basson sadly he was a blackguard retorted gebb and took his departure chapter xxvi the end of it all one month after the death of john alder the two detectives parge and gebb sat in the room of the former discussing the now solved mystery of the grangebury murder case on the table there lay a cheque for two hundred pounds made payable to absalom gebb and signed by edith wedderburn the conversation was mostly about this cheque and how it should be divided between them so as to compensate each with due fairness the matter was a delicate one and could not be settled without some sharp words on either side after all simon remonstrated gebb in vexed tones i did most of the work and deserve the reward for my pains you dont deserve all of it retorted parge captiously i dont claim all of it i say divide it into two parts of one hundred pounds each that will pay me and much more than compensate you i dont know so much about that grunted the fat man ive done a deal of thinking over the case i can tell you and it was me who found out the murderer so in justice i ought to have the whole two hundred pounds gebb snatched up the cheque and slipped it into his pocket if you talk like that you wont have a single penny he cried wrathfully for he was disgusted with the avarice of his coadjutor in the goodness of her heart miss wedderburn considered that she should pay the reward out of the estate and did soto me there was no word of you mr parge when she signed this cheque i dare say not growled simon savagely thats gratitude that is yet if it hadnt been for me her fatherinlaw to be would have swung for a murder as he didnt commit dont you make any mistake about that simon replied gebb dryly mr dean could have proved his innocence without you in both cases the confession of miss gilmar shows that she killed kirkstone and the evidence of the hotelkeeper of the golden hind proves that dean slept there at the very hour of the murder he would have been declared innocent even if you hadnt discovered the truth well i did anyhow declared the other sulkily so did mr basson if you come to that rubbish cried parge he only heard the confession of alder well and didnt that reveal the truth as a matter of fact in the face of that confession miss wedderburn need not have paid the reward to any one however she thought that i deserved payment for all my work so she gave me this money it is only because you are a pal and because i know youve helped in the matter that i give you fifty pounds for yourself fifty pounds roared the fat man growing purple with rage you said one hundred just now so i did but ive taken off fifty for your greediness simon i dont need to give you a single stiver if it comes to that ill never help you again much i care retorted gebb i can get on without you and i cant say as i care to work with a man as doesnt know when his friend is doing him a good turn you say another word simon parge and ill reduce your reward to twentyfive pounds if parge had been able to move he would no doubt have fallen on gebb but chained as he was to his chair he could do nothing but glare at his junior with a fierce eye and a very red face he knew very well that gebb was acting in the most generous manner in offering to share the reward so fearful of losing all by opening his mouth too wide he sulkily signified that half a loaf was better than none i dare say it is said gebb tartly but you only get a quarter of a loaf i brought two fiftypound notes with me but as you have been so avaricious you shall only have one there it is and gebb clapped a bank of england note into the hand of parge which closed on it readily enough and you keep one hundred and fifty he said with a frown i do and ive earned it simon by the sweat of my brow but now that ive behaved towards you a deal better than you deserve ill go and bank my money youll not see me here again in a hurry no no cried parge seeing that his greed had carried him too far and softened by the money which after all had been earned very easily dont go absalom i cant do without you havent i been generous simon yes you have dont take a man up so short sit down and have a pipe and a glass of grog and a talk over the case with some dignity gebb accepted the olive branch thus held out and resumed his seat afterward parge seemed so repentant of his late behaviour that the dignity of absalom disappeared altogether and moreover the whisky and tobacco proved strong aids to patching up the quarrel in ten minutes the pair were chatting together in the most amicable fashion well absalom said parge with a plethoric grunt and how does the matter of that grangebury case stand now you know im shut up here and never hear a word of whats going on tell me the latest news miss wedderburn has inherited the kirkstone property she owns the hall then yes she inherits the hall and also miss gilmars personal property it was left to alder first and failing him to miss wedderburn so she is now a rich woman and i dare say will make a better use of her money than the old skinflint who left it to her shell buy a husband with it i suppose said parge illnaturedly dont you make any mistake contradicted gebb friendly to both edith and arthur she was engaged to ferris in the days of her poverty and shell not throw him over now that she is rich but there is no purchase about the matter i dare say ferris will yet succeed with his pictures in the mean time he is to marry miss wedderburn and good luck to both of them say i they are as decent a young couple as i know when docs the marriage take place next month old dean cant live long and he wants to see the pair man and wife before he leaves this very unjust world unjust world echoed simon incredulously dean has been pardoned has he not absalom of course pardoned by the state for a crime he never committed after passing nearly twenty years in gaol for miss gilmars sake i dont wonder the old fellow is dying he is worn out with trouble and a sense of harsh injustice he has one foot in the grave now and i expect hell drop into it as soon as his son marries edith wedderburn and he didnt kill kirkstone after all no replied gebb with something of a dismal air it appears from the confession left by miss gilmar that she struck the blow do you remember the bowieknife mentioned in the evidence as belonging to dean yes the knife with which the man was killed said parge the sister borrowed it from dean didnt she yes and it appears that in her rage against ellen gilmar for presuming to love dean she threatened her upstairs with the knife while kirkstone and dean were quarrelling in the smokingroom ellen wrenched the knife away and said she would take it at once to dean in the yellow room she went down with it and found that having quarrelled dean and kirkstone had parted the former having gone up to bed ellen entered with the knife in her hand and laid it on the table then kirkstone who was in a bad temper began to insult her she retorted and in a short space of time they were at it hard then when miss gilmar said something unusually cutting to kirkstone he rushed at her to strike her she snatched up the knife to defend herself and held it point out in his blind rage he dashed against it and the point pierced his heart he fell dead on the spot oh said parge reflectively then it was really an accident yes but miss gilmar was so terrified that she hardly knew what to do then remembering that the knife belonged to dean and that he had been fighting with kirkstone also that he despised her love she determined to inculpate him so as to avenge herself and save her own life she ran upstairs and told him that kirkstone wished to see him again in the yellow room dean fell into the snare and came down only to find kirkstone dead with the knife in his heart then he was seized with a panic and fled back to his room whence he was dragged when that wicked old woman accused him of the murder didnt dean suspect her no he fancied that laura to whom he had lent his knife had struck the blow but afterwards when reviewing the circumstances in prison it occurred to him that miss gilmar might be guilty but how did miss gilmar quieten laura easily enough she told her that dean had taken the knife and had killed kirkstone but it seems to me said gebb meditatively that if laura had only given her evidence clearly the truth about the knife would have been found out i dare say rejoined parge tartly but if you had been in charge of the case as i was you would have found out when too late that laura being weakwitted and under the thumb of ellen gilmar was afraid to tell the absolute truth nevertheless the case was muddled insisted gebb absalom cried parge fiercely you can take the best part of the reward if you choose but you shant throw discredit on my past work i conducted the kirkstone murder case to the best of my ability and punished the wrong man that was the force of circumstances it was the want of getting the necessary evidence retorted gebb with some heat however we have improved since then in detective matters as in others oh have you growled parge then why did you arrest the wrong man in the person of ferris you have me there simon you have me there laughed gebb which admission put parge into great goodhumour and criminals nowadays are just as stupid as they were in my youth he said waving his pipe for instance why did alder kill miss gilmar because he wanted her money well by threatening her with dean he could have got her to allow him a good income there was no need for him to strangle her perhaps not and especially in poor mrs presks front parlour she hasnt been able to let it since and to make matters worse matilda crane has gone away with the five pounds you gave her mrs presk had better give up the house at once said parge nodding no one will occupy a room in which a murder has taken place taint natral to live with ghosts what about that yellow boudoir at kirkstone hall oh mr and mrs ferris are going to pull it down when they come back from their honeymoon i expect they will build another wing by the way is ferris going to stick to that name well no but all the same he isnt going to call himself dean then he is going to take his wifes name i suppose suggested parge gebb shook his head by the will of that ancestor who left the hall to his descendants all who live in it not being kirkstones have to take that name if alder had lived he would have called himself john kirkstone like the one that was murdered a bad omen well he never had a chance of changing his name but i expect ferris and miss wedderburn will call themselves mr and mrs arthur kirkstone well said parge raising his glass i hope they will be lucky so do i responded gebb if only because they paid this two hundred pounds of which i got only fifty grumbled parge and so got the last word after all the end
