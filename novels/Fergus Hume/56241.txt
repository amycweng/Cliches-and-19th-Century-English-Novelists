epilogue the indian bangle prologue part i a letter from mrs purcell of bombay to miss slarge of casterwell england th of may my dear sister by this time you will have received my previous epistle in which i announced the apoplectic seizure and subsequent demise of my beloved husband joshua ezekiel purcell lately a faithful and distinguished servant in the indian civil service of her most gracious majesty the queen and empress as over a month has elapsed since my lifelong companion joined the angelic choir i am now becoming more resigned to my widowed condition and i begin to contemplate with equanimity the prospect of a solitary future enlivened i trust by the acceptable companionship of sympathizing friends in thus submitting myself to the inevitable i have obeyed the inspired advice of the great lexicographer as expressed in his masterly ethic poem 'the vanity of human wishes' 'pour forth thy fervours for a healthful mind obedient passions and a will resigned' thus in some measure i may emulate as a christian gentlewoman should the philosophic composure of the sage doctor johnson passing to more mundane considerations i may mention that the late partner of my joys and sorrows has left me fairly well endowed with worldly wealth notwithstanding his elegant hospitality and the regrettable depreciation of the rupee he contrived to save and invest considerable sums of money the interest on which has been assured for life to his mourning widow by a generous and provident testament on entering into the necessary details with my worldly adviser mr deson the lawyer i find that my income will slightly exceed the yearly sum of two thousand pounds sterling an amount which will amply suffice to maintain me in the dignified and easy position to which i have hitherto been accustomed on my decease these moneys will be divided amongst the relatives of my late husband thus i shall be unable to devise any personal property by will other than that which i save or become possessed of during my widowhood this consideration troubles me but in a minor degree for as you my sole surviving relative are in no need of pecuniary aid it is only just that after i have done with earthly vanities my late husband's riches should benefit those of his blood who deserve well of his generosity my position being thus assured i have decided to leave the 'gorgeous east' as the sublime milton fitly terms our indian possessions and i intend god willing to spend my declining years in the country of my birth whether i shall establish my abode in the metropolis or seek the retreat of the country must remain a matter for future and careful consideration for the present it is sufficient to state that in three months for i cannot complete my duties as executrix in less i shall return to the island home of my youth to lay in due time my bones with those of my kindred in the family vault at casterwell but prior to my departure from this torrid clime it is my dutiful intention to erect over the remains of the most beloved and generous of men a monument of stainless marble inscribed with an appropriate tribute to his excellent qualities and an explanatory inscription of his widow's grief and now to touch on lighter topics and thus relieve my mournful mind let me inquire my dearest sister about your health and concerning your interesting attempt to prove that the romish church is the inheritrix of the babylonian superstitions so frequently condemned by the hebrew prophets also i must not omit to request special information regarding your charge olive the daughter of my dear but alas departed friend mr bellairs i trust that the girl who was singularly controllable if i remember rightly is growing in beauty and wisdom and that she is beginning to reflect on the responsibilities of wealth and position which the near approach of her twenty first birthday will shortly render it incumbent upon her to assume with such a companion as you my dear rubina and with so admirable and conscientious a guardian as the rector of casterwell i feel satisfied that our beloved olive has become possessed of those elegant and necessary accomplishments which should embellish the character of a young gentlewoman the moral mr brock in his double capacity of clergyman and adviser must also have succeeded in impressing on her plastic mind the sacred precepts of the established church and the needful principles for the guidance of her conduct towards virtue and discretion when i meet her again if an over ruling providence should permit the occurrence of so much desired an event i shall expect to find miss olive bellairs the model and paragon of our sex do not let us forget my dear rubina that as a twig is bent so does the tree grow and that early moral training in a refined and christian circle is invariably productive of a happy result in those fortunate enough to have been placed by their maker is so enviable a position the mention of olive leads me by an obvious sequence of thought to speak of mr angus carson to whom by a family arrangement she has been engaged since her early childhood i have lately had the gratification of a somewhat lengthy interview with that young gentleman and i made use of my opportunity to observe and question him closely so that i might transmit to you an accurate estimate of his character he informed me that his respected father lately departed this life and that he young mr carson was passing through bombay on his way to england by the peninsular and oriental steamship pharaoh it is his declared intention to complete the family arrangement spoken of above entered into so many years ago between mr bellairs and dr carson both now deceased as it is not improbable that in your arduous studies you may have forgotten the precise details of this matrimonial scheme which concerns so nearly your charge and thereby yourself i think it advisable to recapitulate the same that it may be freshly impressed upon your mind this long and explicit letter is mainly written with this object in view and i beg that for your own sake and for the sake of olive you will give your whole attention to the details which i am about to recount concerning the physical and mental attributes of angus carson we are informed by a very excellent proverb that 'forewarned is forearmed' therefore my communication if read with due care will place you in the position of knowing mr carson so to speak before you make his personal acquaintance the benefit of such knowledge having regard to the fact that neither one of this engaged pair has seen the other will be of incalculable value to you their well wisher and supervisor this being the case i shall proceed to relate firstly the details of the domestic contract entered into between the parents of our young friends and secondly the impressions i derived after conversing for two hours not unprofitably with young mr carson it is a matter of general knowledge that between the years ' and ' of this century our supremacy in hindostan was endangered by the revolt of the native troops during that disturbed period mr mark bellairs and dr alfred carson then young and ambitious soldiers were united in the bonds of ardent friendship and afterwards they gave their affection to mr julian brock then a missionary labouring amongst the benighted heathen these three friends were together during the time of the disturbance and side by side they witnessed the horrors of cawnpore and lucknow as you have often heard the ingenious mr bellairs relate when to quote dr goldsmith 'he fought his battles o'er again' in the retirement of his luxurious and stately home in the year ' these comrades on many a field were parted by the exigencies of existence and while mr bellairs and the rev mr brock returned to settle on their native shores dr carson having an unconquerable passion for orientalism preferred to remain in india however no doubt wearied of warfare he beat his sword into a ploughshare and withdrawing himself from public life secluded himself in the near neighbourhood of the gigantic range of mountains which are known to geography as the himalayas i understand that he dwelt there as a solitary for ten years at the end of which time feeling that it was not good for man to live alone he contracted a marriage with a young eurasian lady it is sad to state that his marital happiness was not destined to continue more than twelve months for in the year ' his wife died in child bed leaving behind her a son the angus i speak of to solace his distracted surviving parent in the meantime mr bellairs by the death of his father had become possessed of the ancestral acres at casterwell and had taken up his abode in the family mansion to superintend his heritage and enact the agreeable part of an english squire as a mark of his constant friendship for mr brock and in token of his appreciation of a blameless and moral character he presented him with the living of casterwell a position which our reverend friend has held these many years to the satisfaction of all who are acquainted with his manifold good qualities mr bellairs as you know also remained single for a considerable period but bethinking himself that for the dignity of his name and the welfare of his tenants it was incumbent upon him to beget heirs of his body he followed the example of his medical friend and married the accomplished miss sophia seymour in the year ' by a strange coincidence which you my dear sister will have no difficulty in recalling the lady of mr bellairs also died within a year of her nuptials leaving as a pledge of love to her sorrowing husband our dear olive on hearing of his friend's loss and gain dr carson wrote a kind and judicious letter in which he proposed that further to cement their early friendship his son angus should be contracted in marriage with mr bellairs's daughter olive to this proposition mr bellairs readily agreed with the proviso that the ceremony should not take place until his child attained the age of twenty one years on this basis the matter was arranged and for the last twenty years olive and angus have been betrothed although the first dwelling in england and the second restrained by filial duty in india they have never met to enjoy in one another's company the pre nuptial pleasures of cupid's votaries but these chaste delights will no longer be deferred for now that the lamented father of young mr carson has journeyed to that bourne whence no traveller returns' the impatient lover is hastening to greet his lovely but alas fatherless mistress what joy it will be to you my dear rubina to witness the coming together of these young hearts to contemplate their amiable qualities and discreetly to superintend their joyous meeting mr carson is a gentle and well bred youth of twenty five not without parts although of too retiring a nature to display them in company he is tall slender elegant in shape and from his mother inherits a somewhat swart complexion indeed so apparent are the traces of his foreign blood that in england doubtless he will be taken for a native of italy his hair and eyes and the thick moustache which adorns his upper lip are black in the extreme resembling in their hue that 'raven down which clothes the night's vast wings' and although i own to a predilection for the golden fairness of our saxon race yet i cannot deny that this young gentleman is prepossessing in no ordinary degree i regret to say however that like many half castes he is delicate in health and owns that his heart is weak so much so indeed that when excited in any violent degree he is liable to be so overcome by emotion as to lapse into a state of insensibility therefore my dear sister when he greets your charge be careful that you restrain his transports of joy else it's more than probable that you will see him extended at your feet a calamity which may cast a shadow over the united pair i must admit that mr carson is somewhat effeminate in his dress and looks he even goes so far as to wear a bracelet of gold on his right wrist in india we term this a bangle and frequently such an ornament is worn by native princes who yet retain barbaric tastes but i ventured to remark to mr carson that in england the wearing of a bangle by one of the male sex would not be looked upon with favour i am bound to say that he took my expostulation in the most good humoured manner and he explained that the bangle was a sacred ornament taken from a hindoo idol it had been presented to his late lamented father by a certain notability or rajah whose son he had skilfully cured of a deadly disease upon the symptoms of which young mr carson did not dilate he also informed me that the bracelet had originally been placed on his arm above the elbow by his ayah or indian nurse when he was a boy as gradually he attained to the full size of manhood the bangle was slipped down by degrees to the wrist whence it cannot now be removed without filing through the broad band of gold of which it is composed no very easy operation as you may guess moreover quite recently mr carson hurt his hand while out shooting in the hills whereby some of the small bones have become diseased and the breadth of the member much extended indeed the whole hand is largely swollen i advised him to undergo an operation in england and at the same time have the bracelet removed in fact i imagine this would be necessary he promised me the suggestion should receive his most careful consideration he was then pleased to exhibit the bracelet for my inspection and i examined it with much interest and curiosity it is a broad band of ductile gold wrought with the idol figures of the hindoo trinity bramah siva and vishnu interwoven with the sacred lotus flower and other heathen symbols i confess that i was weak enough to covet this work of art for it is not only extremely beautiful as an exhibition of how exquisitely a goldsmith can manipulate the precious metal but it is also an ornament of great antiquity and being sacred no doubt there is attached to it a strange and eventful history mr carson has had golden wrist buttons made to match this unique bracelet wrought after the same style but of vastly inferior workmanship on the whole my dear rubina i am prepossessed in favour of my visitor as he appears to be modest and intelligent and high principled notwithstanding his delicate health and effeminate looks i am confident that he has a strong will and a somewhat stubborn nature both of which may be productive in the future of either good or evil if olive be soft and yielding her married life with young mr carson will no doubt be happy and easy as he requires i suspect to be deferred to in every way having full confidence in his own judgment if on the contrary she be wilful and refuse to acknowledge her husband as the head of the house i fear that their union will not be so perfect a one as we could wish to use a trite image mr carson resembles the iron hand in a velvet glove so of this you will do well to warn olive 'verbum sat sapienti' as the latin poet has it the same may be stretched my dear to include our own sex although in the estimation of the male we are not considered to be gifted greatly with wisdom of course i dissent from this view and but you know full well my opinion on the subject therefore i will not add to this already lengthy epistle by enlarging upon it mr carson is accompanied to england by a certain major horace semberry who is i understand an officer in one of our native regiments he has obtained leave of absence in order to act as a kind of social tutor to our young friend i was informed that the major met dr carson whilst shooting in the himalaya mountains and so won his goodwill by an attractive exterior and fascinating manners that the doctor asked him to conduct angus to europe and arranged most generously that he should be paid a handsome stipend for his services thus it comes about that young mr carson and major semberry are travelling in company but i must confess that the late dr carson might easily have shown more wisdom in the selection of a companion for his son major semberry is a fair handsome man an excellent sportsman a well bred gentleman and he is possessed of a charm of manner which would impose upon many people however it did not impose upon me my dear for i judge this horace semberry to be one of those plausible scamps who roam the world like social satans seeking whom they may devour this is a strong sentiment i admit but no stronger than is necessary for you know that i am an excellent judge of character and that it is not my habit to quote holy writ unless the occasion demand it the occasion my dear rubina demands it now and my earnest advice to you is to discourage the visits of major semberry to the manor and to break off if possible the intimacy which now exists to my great regret between him and olive's future husband i speak for his sake as i speak for hers and you may take my word for it that the less they see of this military belial the better it will be for both of them and now my dear sister i must conclude my long but i hope not uninteresting letter by inquiring after our mutual friends and acquaintances i trust that young lord aldean is in good health and that he is benefiting to the utmost extent of his mental powers not that i think much of them by the instruction of his tutor the amiable mr mallow whom i esteem greatly for his many admirable qualities if lord aldean only emulates the moral and social and scholastic example of his friend and tutor i am convinced that he will prove a useful and ornamental member of our house of peers in which doubtless he will shortly take his seat let me also inquire after miss ostergaard the young lady of danish extraction from new zealand you will remember how highly i approved of her on the occasion of my last visit to casterwell it is to be desired that olive should make an intimate friend of this charming young gentlewoman in order that she may have constantly before her eyes a character of such sterling merit miss ostergaard is a particular pet of mine and i could wish our dear olive no better fortune than that she should become just such another delightful girl i presume that dr drabble is still in our parish practising his profession during his intervals from political excitement and radical speeches it is to be regretted that such a firebrand should endanger the peace and rustic charm of our quiet corner of england and as i always said it would be much more to dr drabble's credit if instead of promulgating dangerous dogma he gave more attention to his hard working wife and her too numerous family the man is a red anarchist a subverter of law and order and i fully expect that he will end by throwing a bomb into casterwell church a circumstance which is the more likely to occur from the fact that he is an atheist and an ardent follower of monsieur voltaire to say nothing of the infidel thomas payne and that abominable american colonel ingersoll concerning myself my dear sister i am in moderately good health considering the recent loss of my beloved husband for my friends here are all that can be desired in the way of sympathy and kindness also i have the company of pontius pilate who though only a dog is so intelligent as to afford me the greatest comfort in my terrible and overwhelming affliction the dumb animal seems to be aware of my bereavement and in his own way tries to solace me with caresses and canine attentions generally therefore you will see that the solitariness of my position is in some degree mitigated and here i must conclude this long letter with the hope that we shall shortly meet again in england when i can find in you my dearest sister a relative upon whose bosom i can recline and pour out my sorrow for the loss of the best and most excellent of men god bless you my dear and may his shield be extended in protection of our dear olive such my dear rubina is the heartfelt prayer of your affectionate and resigned sister priscilla purcell ps on my arrival in england i wish you to accompany me to paris in order to assist me in the choice of my widow's garb of woe for i am but ill pleased with such garments as i have been able to procure here part ii peninsular and oriental steam navigation co ltd head office leadenhall street london ec june notice rms pharaoh arrived this morning at gravesend she is expected to dock by the afternoon tide in the royal albert docks part iii extract from the morning planet dated june a startling discovery was made yesterday at no a athelstane place bloomsbury thomas gale a baker of tottenham court road complained at the local police station that for two consecutive days he had been unable to see the occupant of the house as the window blinds were drawn and the doors locked he believed something to be wrong inspector jain and a constable proceeded at once to athelstane place and after vainly ringing and knocking forced the area door the house proved to be empty but in the drawing room the dead body of a young man was found mutilated in a shocking manner on an examination being made by dr rayner of bloomsbury square it was discovered that a steel knitting needle had been thrust into his heart and that the right hand had been cut off at the wrist the missing hand was afterwards found in the grate dr rayner is of opinion that the deceased was murdered about two days prior to the discovery of the body the police have taken possession of the house and corpse and are actively searching for evidence which shall throw light upon this atrocious crime the result of their inquiries will be made known at the inquest which is to be held to morrow in the bloomsbury coroner's court part iv extract from the morning planet june mr mappin held an inquiry yesterday afternoon in the bloomsbury coroner's court into the circumstances attending the death of the unknown man who was found dead in the drawing room of no a athelstane place mr julian pyke owner of the house in question deposed that it was rented from him on june th last by a tall fair haired man with a beard who wore smoke coloured spectacles and gave his name as francis hain he informed witness that he was a scientist and that he required a quiet retreat in london in order to carry out certain experiments the nature of which he did not disclose mr hain took the house furnished for six months and paid a quarter's rent in advance an arrangement which was considered entirely satisfactory by the landlord witness saw the man but once as the agreement on a printed form was approved and executed at one interview he knew nothing of the man's antecedents and his business with him was confined solely to the business as between landlord and tenant thomas gale of tottenham court road baker deposed that on june th a woman called at his shop she stated that she was the housekeeper of mr hain a athelstane place and requested him to supply the house with bread she did not give her own name her appearance was refined and ladylike she spoke excellent english though she had a foreign accent witness concluded that she was either italian or french she was of medium height with a particularly pale face large black eyes and smooth black hair untouched with grey she was not a young woman about forty witness thought her hair was worn in bands and she was dressed entirely in black witness presumed she was a widow at all events she looked like one she herself took in the bread each day and paid for it on the spot he saw no one else in the house although he called there up to june th witness never saw deceased richard brass of tottenham court road butcher gave much the same evidence the same woman called on him and gave a similar account of herself he was to call each morning for orders at a athelstane place he did so up to june th and was paid cash on delivery of the meat up to the th the woman appeared to be the only person in the house and he saw her last on june th but on the th and th no meat was taken in and the house appeared to be deserted he thereupon informed the police witness never saw either mr hain or the deceased amelia rankin said that she was employed as a domestic servant at the house opposite to no a she saw a tall fair bearded man enter it on several occasions also a pale dark haired woman but she did not pay much attention to either once she noticed a young gentleman with a dark moustache looking out of the first floor front window he was laughing and talking with some one inside whom she did not see he appeared to be quite happy she believed after viewing the corpse that the young gentleman she saw was the deceased she heard no noise and saw nothing likely to arouse suspicion in any way as a rule she was in the kitchen with her mistress who kept a boarding house and it was seldom either of them was in the front of the house during the day it was possible many people might have gone in and out without her being aware of it several witnesses resident in athelstane place gave much the same evidence some saw mr hain some the housekeeper but none save amelia rankin caught a glimpse of the deceased nearly all the houses on either side of and opposite to no a are boarding houses from which the lodgers are absent all day and as the landladies and their servants are mostly occupied in the back premises no a was not observed in any special degree indeed there was nothing about the house to arouse remark in any way dr rayner of bloomsbury square stated as the result of a post mortem examination that in his opinion death was caused by a wound in the heart apparently inflicted by some such instrument as a steel knitting needle the clothes over the breast that is to say the waistcoat shirt and undervest were unbuttoned tending to show that the deceased was unconscious when the wound was inflicted with an instrument of the kind supposed it would probably be necessary to open the clothes the right hand had been cut off and judging from the neatness of the operation a surgical instrument would seem to have been used for this purpose the hand itself distorted and swollen was found in the grate the bones of the hand were diseased but not sufficiently so to warrant amputation witness was of opinion that the hand had been cut off by a surgeon he did not believe that an untrained person could have performed the operation with the requisite skill deceased had been murdered judging from the condition of the body two days before the discovery of the remains on june th that is to say on june th in answer to a question put by one of the jury witness stated that there was no smell of chloroform perceptible about the clothes of the deceased or in the room inspector jain who discovered the body said that it was lying on a sofa placed behind the drawing room door the clothing over the chest and region of the heart had been disturbed and the collar and necktie removed the shirt studs sleeve links and watch of the deceased were missing and the pockets were empty the marks on the linen had been cut out there were no rings on the fingers of the left hand the deceased was tall and dark complexioned with smooth dark hair and a small black moustache from the condition of the body the nails for instance were extremely well cared for deceased had evidently been a man accustomed to the refinements of life his underlinen was of the finest quality and the suit of grey tweed was evidently the work of a high class tailor the boots were of russia leather and were particularly well shaped witness thought deceased must have been a gentleman in easy circumstances on searching the house neither trunk clothes linen nor papers of any kind were to be found in fact nothing which would be likely to reveal deceased's name or position the only strange thing he had noticed was the fact that the clothes smelled strongly of sandal wood the furniture and appointments of the house were the property of the landlord but neither mr hain nor the housekeeper had left anything behind them by which they could be traced up to the present in spite of all efforts no clue to the whereabouts of either the tenant or his housekeeper had been found after a brief deliberation the jury returned a verdict of 'wilful murder' against some person or persons unknown part v extract from the morning planet july despite the triteness of the proverb we are constrained to remark with regard to the athelstane place murder that once again truth is stranger than fiction had one of our writers of detective stories imagined so extraordinary a crime as having taken place in the heart of a busy neighbourhood within hearing almost within sight of hundreds of people he would have been scoffed at for exceeding the bounds of probability it would we assert have been termed exaggeration of the wildest order but it has been proved possible in fact and no a athelstane place bloomsbury now enjoys the distinction albeit no enviable one of having provided london with a mystery so unfathomable that it is extremely doubtful whether it will ever be plumbed by the keenest of detectives for the unravelling of so complex a riddle we need the sergeant cuff of wilkie collins or the monsieur dupin of edgar allen poe in a word a fabulous detective such as we have not at the present time amongst us plainly stated the facts are these a house is taken by a man who calls himself by the to us obviously false name of francis hain beyond the fact that he wore a pair of smoked glass spectacles there appears to have been little about him to cause remark the payment of a quarter's rent in advance appears to have answered satisfactorily those questions which the landlord would otherwise surely have felt it incumbent upon him to ask at all events the usual formalities with respect to references were in this case entirely dispensed with ostensibly the house was rented with the object of carrying out certain experiments of a scientific nature a nameless woman calling herself the housekeeper is the active agent between mr hain so called and the local tradesmen observe the butcher and the baker see no one but this woman they neither of them see the tenant of a or the deceased by chance a domestic servant sees both but naturally enough takes small notice of either up to june th the housekeeper herself receives the food from the tradesmen and pays them for it in cash this of itself might or might not be indicative of a preconceived intention to leave the house suddenly after the th the housekeeper is seen no more and on the th the house is broken into and the dead man's body is discovered the medical evidence goes to prove that he was done to death on the th and it is from that day also that we lose sight of mr hain both tenant and housekeeper vanish as completely as if the earth had swallowed them up thus we are deprived of the only two persons who at this time seem to have had any connection with the dead man their disappearance coincident as it is of itself arouses suspicion moreover by the careful removal of all marks from the linen of the deceased we are left without what otherwise might have lent an important clue to his identity here then is the problem with which our detective force is confronted for ourselves in a case like this where the elementary facts are so completely concealed we can at most theorise and surmise for some reason impossible to guess the victim would seem to have been inveigled into the athelstane place house as his right hand was diseased it is not impossible that he went there or as we think is more likely was taken there by some accomplice ostensibly to have an operation performed that a surgical instrument was used we may safely conclude from the evidence of dr rayner mr hain called himself a scientist and he may have been that and that only but at all events he if he it was was evidently skilled in surgery so far as to be able to accomplish an amputation at the wrist neatly let us then assume that mr hain was to operate upon the hand of the deceased the first thing he would do would be to administer an ansthetic this in all probability would be chloroform for as the body was not discovered until two days after death and as the air was warm during the interval it is likely that the chloroform would evaporate we take it therefore that the deceased was choloroformed by mr hain with his own consent since he was about to undergo a painful operation up to this point our assumption is comparatively clear but when we are asked to say why this mr hain should have preferred a knitting needle to either of the two means which were at his disposal for the accomplishment of his end we refer of course to the instruments which he must have had at hand and to the chloroform and further why the diseased hand when amputated should have been thrown into the grate we confess ourselves absolutely in the dark in short our assumption such as it is becomes hopelessly worthless when separated from evidence wholly circumstantial and circumstantial evidence is as we know frequently misleading before we can hope to obtain data more reliable it is necessary first that the deceased be identified and further that one if not both of the persons who were known to be occupants of the house be traced we presume that in the ordinary course a full and sufficiently minute description of the deceased man will be disseminated by the police he is apparently a gentleman and may be said therefore to have occupied a certain social position it is fair to assume that he has friends and acquaintances who will recognize some if not all of the characteristics put forth in the description further he probably has a home if not relatives somewhere in the kingdom and if he does not return within a reasonable time inquiries will doubtless be made it is probably by some such means as this that the deceased will be identified once that is done there may be some chance of capturing his murderer it is remarkable that the deceased's clothes smelled of sandal wood this is essentially an eastern perfume and a man especially a gentleman living in england would hardly be in the habit of using it we are not aware indeed if it is used even in the east as a scent though many nations of the far east such as the indians and the chinese particularly the latter make chests of sandal wood if then this unknown man had at any time lived in the east it is possible he might have been in the habit of keeping his clothes in such a chest which would account for the odour detected by inspector jain this clue is slight still it is tangible and it is moreover possible to assume from it that the unknown man came from the east and further that his arrival in england must have been comparatively recent since had he been here for any length of time he would surely have exchanged this cumbersome box for the portmanteau of western civilization we suggest therefore to the police that supposing of course nothing be forthcoming from the deceased's relatives or friends a thorough search be made through the shipping offices and the neighbourhood of the docks for the existence of any passenger answering to the description of the deceased who might recently have disembarked from one of our great liners again we say the clue is a slight one but in such a case as this no fact however insignificant is unimportant and the most slender circumstance may if rigorously followed up ultimately lead to results wholly unlooked for and disproportionate to it here then is a splendid opportunity for our detectives to cover themselves with glory and by the capture of the perpetrator to prevent this one of the most terrible crimes of recent days from being relegated to the already too well filled limbo of unfathomable mysteries the story the first scene at casterwell chapter i david and jonathan towards the first week in july two young men were seated in a smoking carriage on the midday express from paddington to reading they were alone in the compartment and at the moment there existed between them that peculiar silence of sympathy which can be only the outcome of a perfect friendship the jonathan of the pair was slim tall and dark with a military uprightness of bearing and a somewhat haughty expression on his clean shaven face his david was younger in years but considerably greater in size and like his namesake of judah was ruddy and of a fair countenance the one was an eager anxious highly strung celt with his irish impulse and impetuosity trained into well nigh complete obedience by years of experience the other a phlegmatic saxon of small brain and much muscle jonathan's nineteenth century name was laurence mallow david answered to the title of lord aldean they had been tutor and pupil respectively and they were still fast friends the elder possessing the stronger and more imperious will continued to control the younger mallow was not popular nor did he wish to be so he chose to be feared rather than loved he was brilliantly clever and therefore had many admirers on the other hand his intolerance of stupidity lost him many friends so that to his expressed satisfaction he moved more or less isolated amid a crowd of fair spoken back biting acquaintances and yet perhaps it was a knowledge of the guarded manner in which he was received that made him cling the more to the solitary friend he possessed people thought and people said that there was but little about good natured thick headed aldean to attract the brilliant young irishman there were those who went so far as to hint that the boy's title and wealth explained all that albeit mallow was well nigh aggressively independent left an orphan with comparatively little money at an early age he had won prizes and taken scholarships at a great public school and had maintained himself at oxford by these early efforts he left the university with a full brain and empty pockets and he had undertaken the tutorship of aldean to gain breathing time while he cast around him for choice of a career when aldean came of age mallow left him a fair enough scholar and an admirable athlete and went himself to london he became a journalist and a power with his pen he attached himself to a weekly publication of high aim and small circulation conducted by a genius who had failed to profit by his pen because he could not write obviously enough for the taste of the general public mallow became one of the props of this journal when it failed by reason of its too lofty aims he went to india to write letters about the incomprehensible east for a newspaper a while after he returned and published a novel which was much condemned and widely circulated at the present time having netted a few hundreds out of the book he was going down to casterwell to stay with aldean and to renew his friendship with olive bellairs whom he loved ardently though knowing full well that she was engaged to a certain mr carson hopelessly in his own peculiar wrong headed way aldean who was now twenty four and as good naturedly stupid as ever was in truth more akin to goliath than to david he was a gigantic son of anak considerably over six feet in height and as wide as a church door he was sparing of his words and he usually assented to whatever was said to him as the safest way out of an argument but in spite of his lack of conversation and the rareness with which he gave expression to such ideas as he possessed he had a fund of shrewd common sense which in his position was worth far more to him than genius would have been it was with all his heart and soul that he admired mallow and the very naivet with which he would express his admiration endeared him to the young irishman habitually mallow's tongue was razor like in its acerbity but aldean though he took full advantage of the friendship between them and spoke pretty plainly when he judged his lordship deserved correction he invariably spared where he would have spared none else they had indeed established their friendship on a very durable basis by the extremely simple process of shutting their eyes to one another's faults and opening them very wide to one another's virtues the young irishman had his brilliant flashes of silence it was on these occasions that he found aldean so agreeable a companion in fact the boy was as a pet dog to mallow agreeable company and not given to criticism aldean eh yes what asked his lordship looking up from ally sloper have you read the account of this athelstane place murder yes fellow killed with a knitting needle isn't it yes thrust into the heart devilish queer case the morning planet seems to think the unfortunate beggar came from india who told the 'mp' so no one apparently it is a theory based on the fact that the man's clothes smelled of sandal wood bosh there's plenty of sandal wood in england no doubt but englishmen are not by way of scenting their clothes with it i shouldn't be surprised to find that the planet was right at all events it's some sort of clue aldean shook his head i thought you said it was a theory so it is but a theory may develop into a clue retorted mallow lighting another cigarette if only i had the time there is nothing i would like better than to follow up a case like this well surely you have the time i have not i am giving you what spare moments i have you are now but at casterwell miss bellairs i guess will see a good deal more of you than i shall the moth and the candle eh not at all aldean your simile is quite inapt i am not a moth neither can miss bellairs be compared to a candle she is not the kind of girl to scorch any poor butterfly that flutters round her all right old chap you needn't take one quite so seriously but as you do i may as well be serious too do you know i am thinking of getting married no that's news to me and whom do you intend to honour so far may i ask miss ostergaard if she concurs aldean heaved a huge sigh by george she's a ripping girl certainly you might do worse replied laurence musingly she's a very good girl and clever too does she reciprocate i don't know she laughs at me that may be just her method of showing her affection she will be hard to please if she is not satisfied with a titled hercules like you oh i don't think she bothers in the least about the title said his lordship dolefully she is quite a radical a a what do you call it anarchist you know dr drabble has been converting her he's a proselytising beast that drabble oh that's all rubbish 'in the spring a young girl's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love' not anarchy but it isn't spring said the literal aldean and miss ostergaard isn't the girl to marry for rank then make love to her properly and she'll marry you for love i wish i could but i'm not a clever chap like you mallow my dear boy i'm not clever on the contrary i'm a fool a perfect fool for do i not love miss bellairs like an idiot when all the while i know well she is going to marry this carson man from india so she is that's queer said aldean reflectively queer how do you mean oh nothing old man i am thinking of this murder case and the fact of both men coming from india struck me that's all you see carson's just on his way home now is he i didn't know that said mallow alertly yes miss slarge you know the babylonian mark of the beast woman told me that her sister in bombay had written carson was on his way home by the p and o liner pharaoh the pharaoh arrived some time back said mallow gloomily he must be at casterwell by this time he was not there two days ago when i ran up to town well it must be quite two weeks since the pharaoh arrived what an ardent lover the chap must be i wish i stood in his shoes that's all i wouldn't let the grass grow under them on the way to my 'own true love' not that miss bellairs can strictly be said to stand in that relation to a man she has never set eyes upon the very fact that she has to marry him should be sufficient to make her hate him by jove what a rum go it would be if carson turned out to be the man murdered in athelstane place mallow stared what on earth put such a wild idea into your head he said i don't know nor do i know why you should be so ready to call it wild the man who was killed came from india as you say i don't say so it is the theory of the morning planet it is just possible that it might be carson seeing that he hasn't turned up at casterwell continued aldean not heeding mallow's interruption really jim i didn't credit you with such a vivid imagination oh of course it's merely an idea mallow but what strikes me is that if carson arrived two weeks ago he certainly ought to have put in an appearance at casterwell before this if only out of curiosity to see his future wife my dear fellow carson may need a kit before he calls on miss bellairs he surely would wish to create a good impression and i don't suppose he would present himself in sandal wood scented clothes i never said he would but even so that wouldn't take him a fortnight mallow leaned back and pinched his chin reflectively he had no great faith in his friend's prognostications still he could not help being struck by the suggestion coupling carson with the victim of athelstane place it was certainly queer that this man from india should be two weeks in england without fulfilling the very object for which his journey had been made he had arrived in the pharaoh on the th of june the murder had been committed on the th yet so far he had not presented himself at casterwell the prime facts certainly coincided it was very odd mallow could not deny that but the idea is incredible he said aloud hundreds of men arrive from india every week besides carson never was in england in his life miss bellairs told me so why should he be murdered immediately on his arrival where was the motive you have found a mare's nest jim i dare say replied aldean stolidly it's a bare idea a very wild and a very absurd one my boy there is nothing to connect the sandal wood man as you call him with carson perhaps not mallow but if carson does not turn up soon i shall begin to think that my idea is not so ridiculous as you say if he does not turn up repeated mallow with emphasis that's just it but he will turn up if it is only to take from me the only girl i ever really cared about a trite saying no doubt but a true one in this case every fellow says the same thing said aldean as the train slowed down into reading station here we are casterwell lies as every one knows or should know seeing that it is one of the prettiest villages in the home counties amongst the berkshire hills some ten miles from reading lord aldean's cart was waiting for himself and his friend mallow walked leisurely out of the station into the sunshine and watched the porter transfer his portmanteau to aldean's groom whilst he was standing on the edge of the pavement a plump little man rosy in face and neat in dress stopped short before him he carried a black bag but dropped this to hold out a friendly hand to mallow well well he chirped just like an amiable robin and who would have thought of seeing you here mr mallow you're here on business i presume i have come down to stay with lord aldean at casterwell mr dimbal replied mallow graciously miss bellairs' busi ah here is his lordship how d'ye do my lord on the road to casterwell eh i'm going there myself to see miss bellairs did you say asked mallow impatiently there's nothing wrong i hope good gracious no why should there be anything wrong why indeed said aldean laughing lawyers and wrong never go together ha ha very good my lord but we are a much maligned profession no mr mallow nothing is wrong with miss bellairs on the contrary everything is very right i bring her the good news that mr carson has arrived oh said mallow with a glance at aldean have you seen him yes he called yesterday at my office and to morrow he comes to casterwell to see his future wife well well good day good day i see my fly i must be off good day mr mallow my lord good day and the little lawyer bustled off so carson isn't the sandal wood man after all observed aldean no god forgive me i wish he were replied mallow and frowned chapter ii the sealed letter casterwell is an aggressively antique village the delight of landscape painters and enthusiasts of the hand camera it has been painted and photographed times without number and its two crooked streets its market cross its medival church and ruined castle are all of them familiar enough to the frequenters of london art galleries bicycles converge to it from the four quarters of england transatlantic tourists twang the melodious american tongue under the gabled roof of its principal inn the omnivorous kodaker clicks his shutter at donjon battlement and ivy covered tower and unscrupulous authors thieve its local legends for the harrowing of the public in christmas numbers and magazines the name is obviously of latin origin and from the castraville of the middle ages we have the casterwell of to day on the brow of an adjoining hill the circumvallations of the ubiquitous romans show that the village originally received its name from a military post of the days of caractacus and boadicea but the imperial legions have marched into the outer darkness the baron of the castle is a handful of dust the founders of the church lie mouldering in their ornate tombs and casterwell survives them all a quaint pretty peaceful spot beautiful even in its decay the village lies in a dip of the ground hardly to be called a valley between two wooded hills swelling gently from the surrounding plain on one of these rises a square palace of white free stone ornate and conspicuous by force of its many windows and lofty tower this latter well nigh offensively incongruous with the general architectural design this grandiose barrack is kingsholme the country seat of lord aldean in it he lives like a mouse in a haystack it is many times too large for a single young orphan and it takes much more of the orphan's income to keep up than he likes thither aldean and his friend spun as fast as a quick trotting mare could take them as they turned into the park mallow cast a wistful look towards the other hill where surrounded by its ancient woods lay embosomed the dwelling of miss olive bellairs the lady of casterwell manor the soul of this hapless lover was full of regret in that he was not the occupant of mr dimbal's fly and he sighed as he mastered his feelings in subservience to the exigencies of social intercourse a necessity for the moment but one by no means to his taste meanwhile the fly the tortoise to the aldean hare crawled doggedly along the dusty road mr dimbal with a complacent smile on his rosy face and his black bag established safely on his knees glanced absently out of the window through incessant clouds of dust he caught glimpses of the flowering hedges and now and again behind them of the corn waving in the hot wind then a cottage or so with its thatched roof and tiny garden marked the proximity to the village and soon he was rumbling through casterwell high street at last the avenue leading to the manor house came in sight and as his eye rested on the mansion mr dimbal heaved a sigh of relief to think that he was at his journey's end three hours of continuous travelling on a hot midsummer day are not exactly the height of bliss to a comfortable elderly gentleman the house was typical of its kind here were diamond paned casements tall oriel windows lofty tiled roofs surmounted by stacks of twisting chimneys terraces of grey stone with urns and statues in fact all and everything which we are accustomed to associate with the conventional old english manor house the whole place was radiant with roses the walls of the house were draped with them they clambered over the balustrades of the terraces they flamed in the wide mouthed urns they clothed the antique statues and rioted round the lawn in prodigal profusion dazzling the eye with their glorious tints and filling the air with their perfume a dwelling fit for flora truly it was an unusual flight of fancy for dimbal but he gave way to it even as he stepped from out his dusty old fly he raised his eyes and lo the lady of flowers was waiting to greet him in truth she was comely enough this young woman for the most beautiful of goddesses not an ideal venus perhaps or an imperial juno but an eminently healthy and withal dainty goddess of spring was olive bellairs a trifle reminiscent maybe of hebe the girlish and ever young neither divinely tall nor unduly slender her figure was neatness exemplified her hair was brown so were her eyes while did you seek to compare her complexion you must perforce fall back upon the well worn simile of the rose leaf she was dressed in pure white and how are you mr dimbal she said for a whole hour have i been watching for you if' like the lord chancellor in 'iolanthe' i were possessed of wings my dear you would not have had to wait at all well now you are here i'm sure you're very hungry lunch is quite ready come along yes my dear and i am quite ready too but i should not eat my luncheon in peace did i not first discharge at least the more important part of my mission oh dear pouted olive won't the horrid thing keep for an hour my dear said dimbal taking the girl's hand in his own let me make myself quite clear i am here to impress upon you the terms of your father's will which as you know has been in my possession since you were a baby and to hand to you a sealed letter which he left for you until this is done i cannot eat my meal in comfort a sealed letter queried olive leading the way into the drawing room why was it not given to me before because your father's instructions were that you were not to have possession of this letter until after the arrival of mr carson in england well mr carson has arrived he was in my office yesterday so you see i have lost no time olive sat down and took off her sun bonnet she looked put out i know that mr carson is in england she said i got a letter from him three or four days ago in which he says he is coming down here at the end of the week oh well i hope you are pleased said dimbal looking dubiously at her the kind hearted little lawyer feared from her expression that she was not no mr dimbal replied the girl decidedly i cannot pretend that i am you must remember i have never seen the man indeed i do not want to see him and i am very sure i do not want to marry him but you must marry him olive i don't see that i must marry anybody i don't like i am sure i shall hate him my dear you really must not talk like that remember you lose a large sum of money if you do not fulfil the conditions of the will i would rather lose anything than marry him said olive recklessly i don't love the man why i have never seen him how can you how could papa expect me to marry him he may be horrid indeed i am sure he is horrid mr carson is a very charming and handsome young man was dimbal's reply as he opened his bag you will find that he is everything your heart can desire my heart does not desire him at all i object to being married without being consulted but olive dear child remember you loved your father yes the girl's face grew very tender my father was the dearest and best of men i loved him very dearly better than any one else in the world you know i love his memory still then you will surely obey his last expressed wish said dimbal persuasively in that way alone can you show your love and affection for him mr bellairs's heart was set upon your marrying the son of his oldest and best friend where is this letter mr dimbal asked olive irrelevantly all in good time my dear let me first explain the will to you do you wish miss slarge to be present said olive as the lawyer spread out the formidable parchment oh that is not necessary i suppose she is busy olive shrugged her pretty shoulders she is hunting i believe through layard's nineveh in search of nimrod she answered lucky aunt rubina she hasn't got to marry a man she doesn't care two pins about i don't suppose miss slarge would marry any one my dear she has always been the consistent advocate of celibacy i only wish my father had been the same would that really please you said dimbal he knew a good deal more about miss olive's likes if not about her dislikes than she had any idea of i met mr mallow at reading station the artful lawyer continued significantly oh said olive the colour mounting to her face yes he has come down to stop for a week or two with lord aldean i i well i really don't care why do you look at me like that mr dimbal don't please mr mallow is really nothing to me or you to hecuba well if you don't know olive i'm sure i don't let us get to business by this my dear he said smoothing out the parchment you inherit all the real estate of your father consisting of the house lands farms tenements etc etc all of which combine to bring you in an income of some three thousand pounds per annum into possession of this you will enter upon your twenty first birthday that is next month said olive nodding quite so on august th you attain your majority you will then receive your rents and become absolute mistress of the estate without conditions certainly without conditions those of which i am about to speak apply only to the personal estate this consists of some fifty thousand pounds excellently well invested in railway stock and shares for the most part though some small portion of it is in the government funds if within a month of your majority you become the wife of angus carson this money passes to your husband and he is to use it for the benefit of you both oh indeed and i have no say in the matter i suppose well not legally speaking although mr carson can only obtain this money by marrying you that done he has full legal possession of it and although there is no absolute charge upon the capital providing for it there is a strong wish expressed by your father so strong as to amount to an absolute obligation in the mind of any right thinking man that the sum of a thousand pounds per annum shall be set apart from out of the interest of this money by your husband for your own separate use but of the principal you understand he has absolute control but suppose mr carson is a scamp and a spendthrift we will not suppose any such thing my dear i admit added dimbal looking at the document i admit that the powers given to mr carson are very great and should perhaps have been controlled if not restricted in some measure indeed i suggested something of the sort to your father but he contended you were amply provided for by the real estate and he had every hope that young mr carson would prove to be as good and as honourable a man as his father had been before him what is your opinion of him asked olive abruptly my dear i saw mr carson but for half an hour so i can scarcely be expected to answer that question he appeared to me to be an amiable and pleasant young gentleman and i have no doubt he will make you an excellent husband oh i dare say that is of course provided i consent to marry him said miss bellairs tartly well mr dimbal thank you i quite understand all you have told me when i marry mr carson he gets fifty thousand pounds to do exactly as he likes with well certainly that is one way of looking at it but you must not forget that he is to pay you quarterly the sum of two hundred and fifty pounds said mr dimbal hastily quite so i get one thousand to his forty nine no no my dear not at all oh well in any case he has the best of it said olive wilfully if he chooses to make ducks and drakes of the capital there will be but a small chance of my getting any income that would be to argue mr carson a thorough scamp my dear i do not think he is that how do you know you say yourself you only saw him for thirty minutes you can't read a man's character in that time perhaps not but mr carson appears to me to be an exceptionally well conducted young gentleman and after all olive supposing he does waste this money you have always three thousand a year of your own which he cannot touch and a husband i don't want she replied bitterly well mr dimbal suppose i refuse this arrangement well in that case my dear the whole of the money goes to the reverend manners brock rector of casterwell yes so i remember you told me before why may i ask does it go to him really my dear i can hardly say mr brock was the most intimate friend of your father and dr carson failing the fulfilment of his primary wish it is evident your father decided to pass on the money to his best friend that is how the will stands though as i have said it is not easy to approve of it in all respects it is a hard and cruel will said olive despondently i am sure i don't wish to rob mr carson or any one else of the money but on the other hand i have no wish to become the wife of a man who is a complete stranger to me my affections are not a regiment of soldiers to be ordered about in this way well said mr dimbal fishing up a blue envelope with a red seal from the depths of his black bag well olive here is your father's letter it may perhaps explain his reason for making what i allow is a most extraordinary disposition of his personalty olive took the letter in silence and rising from her chair opened it at the window with her back to the lawyer it contained a single sheet of paper on which were written eight lines in her father's well known hand they were shaky and faint as though they had been penned as indeed they were by a dying man my darling olive when you read these lines you will know that it is my last wish and command that you should marry angus carson to whom you have been engaged since your birth marry him i implore you not so much for the money as because if you do not become his wife evil terrible evil will come of your refusal if you ever loved me if my memory is dear to you fulfil my dying wish and marry angus carson within a month of your twenty first birthday if you refuse god help you your loving father mark bellairs as white as ashes olive let the paper flutter to the floor what does it mean she murmured faintly my god what can it mean chapter iii at the manor house what about to day mallow asked aldean as with his friend and mentor he enjoyed a morning pipe pacing the terrace of kingsholme the day is right enough replied laurence morosely and he looked with a jaundiced eye on the green country stretching beyond a fringe of trees towards the blue and distant hills i don't think you are retorted his lordship you have not spoken two words the whole of breakfast i'm never fit for rational conversation till noon aldean i should be tied up this morning liver grunted aldean with a fond look at his pipe let's get out the 'gees' and shake ourselves into good humour mallow placed his hands on the young man's shoulders and swayed him to and fro that is all the shaking you need jim said he in a more amiable tone if i were as good humoured as you i should be content all the same i wish you would confine yourself to the queen's english your speech is like a hornet the sting's in the tail have you read the papers this morning no replied mallow listlessly what's in them the usual nothing france is abusing us germany is envying us russia is warning us and the usa are beginning to see that blood is thicker than foreign ditch water and what are we doing holding our tongues and picking up unconsidered geographical trifles silence is ever golden annexation with us upon my word jim said mallow with good humoured astonishment you are getting beyond words of one syllable you can actually construct a sentence with a visible idea in it i am growing up mallow age is coming upon me well jim suppose we take a walk aldean laughed and pointed with the stem of his pipe towards the red roofs of the distant manor house over there i suppose jim you have no tact if our steps do tend in that direction wandering in devious ways i i well i have not forgotten that miss ostergaard is paying a visit to to miss slarge true enough replied jim winking let us pay a visit to to miss slarge we might do worse said mallow and sighed i expect we'll do better was aldean's response mallow groaned oh jim jim i am a fool i know that she is going to marry this carson and yet and yet i cannot help making myself miserable by calling to see her buck up old man she isn't spliced yet james you are incurably vulgar if you pay me any more compliments mallow i shall forget the respect to my former tutor and chuck you out of this gangway come for a walk so mallow allowed himself to be persuaded and in due time as he knew they inevitably would do they found themselves in the grounds of the manor house striding up and down the lawn was an elderly lady with a lack lustre eye and the gait of a grenadier how do you do miss slarge said the visitors almost simultaneously and they waited for the priestess of minerva to wake up and return their salutation miss rubina slarge was a maiden of forty five years she was sufficiently well looking to have married a score of times however early in life she had become convinced that it was her mission to expose the errors of the romish church and she felt that for this purpose she should dispense with a husband her knowledge was extensive but apt to be inaccurate it was her firm impression that the idol worship of babylon still existed in the papal church and she was writing a voluminous book to prove this nimrod and his wife semiramis were still worshipped she declared and the festivals and ritual of modern rome were identical with those of ancient babylon she thought of little else and lived in a world of biblical prophecy and mythological lore therefore although she was supposed ostensibly to look after olive that clear headed young lady looked after her and the house to boot olive called her aunt ruby but she was really only a distant cousin connected by blood with the late mrs bellairs absent minded and dogmatic aunt ruby was nevertheless amiable and kindly and olive was really fond of her but it was rare for her to leave rome or babylon to speak on commonplace subjects she was difficult to manage and required no little humouring on seeing two young men standing bareheaded before her she stopped and looked bewildered then she recognized them both and smiled finally she pointed a lean finger at lord aldean septem alta jugis toti qu presidet orbi' said miss slarge solemnly what does that mean lord aldean great scott gasped jim cramming his hat on his head i don't know yet you call yourself a scholar sir no i don't miss slarge i call mr mallow a scholar what is it mallow the lofty city with seven hills which governs the whole world translated mallow i know that snapped miss slarge it is a simple sentence from virgil but what city rome of course what other city has seven hills i was certain of it cried miss slarge triumphantly the chief seat of idolatry under the new testament mystery babylon the great that is rome is it indeed said aldean for her eyes were fastened upon him what a rum idea jim jim reproved mallow smiling it is a very wonderful idea said miss slarge reproachfully do you know mr mallow i made a most remarkable discovery last week the two horned mitre of the romish bishops is nothing but the mitre worn by dagon the fish god of the babylonians i do not quite understand miss slarge it is not difficult replied the lady dagon was depicted as half man half fish i know cried aldean he had a fish's tail like a mermaid true enough assented mallow but that does not explain the mitre miss slarge became excited the head of the fish with open jaws was worn on the god's head she cried and the scales and tail formed a cloak the bishops of the papal church don't wear the tail but they place the open jawed head on their brows and call it a mitre now do you see oh yes it is truly wonderful miss slarge osiris also wore such a mitre mr mallow how then can you doubt that the pope of rome is not the modern representative of the philistine of the babylonian deity why if by this time miss slarge was taking a breather on her hobby horse and might be expected to gallop that tiresome animal for a considerable time so leaving mallow to endure the martyrdom lord aldean edged away from the pair by degrees the cunning rascal had caught a glimpse of miss ostergaard out of the tail of his eye and preferring flirtation to instruction managed to place himself by her side whilst she was filling a small basket with roses all this apparently without her knowledge the young lady from new zealand was one of the most charming of young ladies and aldean went so far as to make no reservation in favour of any one she had been sent to england to be educated and having gone to the same school as olive a close friendship had sprung up between them as rapidly as had grown jonah's gourd happily the friendship was more enduring than the plant and for three or four years these two had been like helena and hermia two cherries on one stem miss ostergaard whose christian or rather maori name was tui loved olive as her other self and frequently came to stay at the manor house she was now twenty years of age and so pretty that she won every heart left uncaptured by olive with dark hair dark complexion and two wonderful dark eyes like wells of liquid light she made such havoc amongst young and susceptible males that she should have been shut up as a too delightful damsel dangerous to the youth of the community her last victim was the hapless aldean having impaled him on a pin she was watching him wriggle not that jim objected to the process indeed he rather liked it for if he wriggled on the pin no one else could for the time being and thus he secured all the sweet torment unto himself a most gratifying monopoly of course tui knew that olive was in love with mallow and equally of course olive was aware of aldean's passion for tui and of course both of them discussed their lovers to their hearts' content tui was distinctly in favour of mallow as a suitor for her darling olive and was enraged at the mere thought of her friend being handed over with fifty thousand pounds to an unknown suitor from the back of beyond therefore she was glad to see him and she hoped that he would rescue olive from the indian dragon as a true knight should for olive was very wretched and very tearful and had been so ever since the departure of mr dimbal poor dear sighed miss ostergaard thinking of her friend that is me isn't it asked the artful aldean you said the lady snipping vigorously as if i was thinking of you lord aldean oh you men you men and they say that women are vain you have something to be vain about said aldean seeing his way to a compliment i have indeed with you no i was thinking of olive you know that she is going to be married aldean cast a commiserating look at his friend who was still being assailed with babylonic information by miss slarge and nodded but she may not marry the chap after all you know oh yes she will mr carson is coming down here in three days and olive has fully made up her mind to accept him i am so enraged cried tui that i could snip cut his snip head off snip snip she has never seen carson has she no that's the worst of it fancy marrying a veiled prophet a mokanna never heard of the johnny miss ostergaard who is he he is a fable lord aldean pity this carson man isn't said his lordship with a grin i wish he were sighed tui walking towards the house i am sure he is a beast a beast with a big big b who deserves a big big d cried aldean emphatically oh what a beast are you talking of the beast from the persian gulf cried miss slarge who having pulverized mallow had glided behind them the beast who taught the babylonians arts and sciences this beast comes from india said aldean smiling at tui and with a side glance at mallow he is called car oh there is olive interrupted miss ostergaard waving her hand olive here are two visitors and olive pale and listless descending the steps turned yet paler at the sight of the man she loved and who loved her chapter iv a queer coincidence when olive saw who was standing on the lawn she felt very much inclined to fly from so dear yet dangerous a foe but maidenly pride came to her aid and doing violence to her feelings the better to conceal them she saluted mr mallow with so much frigidity as rather to disconcert that young gentleman mr dimbal told me that you were here she said he saw you at reading station yesterday mr dimbal is very kind to save me the trouble of announcing myself said mallow' dryly so unimportant a person as i am should feel much flattered no friend is unimportant mr mallow reproved miss bellairs gently i believe that when there is something substantial to be gained from the friendship what a cruel remark cried tui shaking her head i hope you do not practise what you preach mr mallow mallow's bark is worse than his bite chimed in aldean and the horse is the noblest of all animals said mallow' ironically go on aldean i love these dry chips from the tree of knowledge the hebrew tree of knowledge was stolen by them from the chaldeans said miss slarge loudly the serpent legend so intimately connected with it came from the same source well young people i must really return to my studies lord aldean mr mallow i hope you will both stay to luncheon aldean consulted mallow by a side look but seeing no encouragement in his moody face refused the invitation on behalf of them both whereat miss slarge shook hands in the nineteenth century fashion and returned to her studies and the primval days when nimrod began to be a mighty one on the earth the four young people were left standing and a short silence prevailed which was broken by mallow 'hence loathed melancholy' he spouted theatrically we have had enough of that dismal goddess miss bellairs smile aldean make a joke miss ostergaard laugh for goodness' sake i can't replied the last named lady until lord aldean makes his joke one can't make bricks without straw or mirth without jests i always have to think out my jokes said aldean innocently which remark brought forth the required mirth you are like the man whose impromptus took him years to invent said olive beginning to be merry mr mallow what is the latest news from town men are in love thieves are in gaol and women still use looking glasses also queen anne is dead laughed tui swinging her basket oysters and news should both be fresh yet you talk truisms have you heard of that awful murder put in aldean murder oh the horrid word you make me shudder aldean is like the fat boy in pickwick said mallow and quoted i wants to make your flesh creep' is that the athelstane place crime lord aldean asked olive yes fellow was killed with a knitting needle i wonder who did it a woman you may be sure what makes you think so miss bellairs demanded mallow quickly because men don't use knitting needles and women do replied the girl i dare say it was a case of jealousy perhaps but even a jealous woman would hesitate to cut off the right hand of a dead lover unless she came from the east said aldean suddenly why should she come from the east well the morning planet says that the man came from india from india cried olive and tui in one breath and their thoughts centred at once on angus carson oh that is only a theory of the newspaper said mallow hastily can't you find a pleasanter subject to talk about aldean yes replied aldean looking meaningly at tui only only i am wasting my time and you are helping me to do so cried that young lady briskly i must tie up my roses let me help you i am afraid your help would be a hindrance said miss ostergaard as she moved towards the house followed by her huge admirer however if you are very very good you may hold the ball of string left alone with mallow olive felt in so dangerous a position that she assumed a demeanour even more reserved so mr carson has arrived in england remarked the young man gloomily yes who told you so mr dimbal the lawyer of course it is an open secret that you are to marry him i see no reason why it should be a secret at all retorted olive with a flush if my father wished for the marriage no one can say a word against it i am not saying a word against it if i did i should probably say too much then don't let us discuss the subject said olive hurriedly you only make my position the harder do you consider it hard you have no right to ask me that question mr mallow i beg your pardon said the young man reddening i admit that i have no right unless you give me one mr mallow i really do not understand you i don't understand myself miss bellairs usually i am not timid when i should be bold 'be bold be bold but be not over bold' quoted olive trying to turn off his speech with a laugh an attempt which mallow resolutely refused to countenance i suppose you will marry mr carson he inquired anxiously i suppose i shall replied miss bellairs with a coolness she was far from feeling is it absolutely certain olive felt a quiver pass through her frame and it was with difficulty she prevented her emotion from overcoming her she thought of the man who was coming to claim her the man she had never even seen of the undeclared lover who was by her side dreading the answer which she should give finally the memory of the sealed letter with its menace of coming evil passed through her mind and dictated the reply it is absolutely certain absolutely in that case there is nothing for me to do but to offer you the customary congratulations on your your good fortune my good fortune she burst out my good oh yes of course thank you mr mallow i congratulate you in my turn on your penetration and before he could recover from his amazement at this attack she flitted across the lawn swept past the astonished couple on the steps and vanished into the house this incident brought the visit to a close for as olive did not reappear to explain her sudden anger mallow said good bye to miss ostergaard and departed with the reluctant aldean the young lord guessing that his friend and olive had come to words more than expected to have a peevish companion for his homeward walk instead of which mallow was quite uproariously merry by this time he had fathomed the cause of olive's wrath and he cursed himself for a fool not to have seen and known that she was not the woman to wear her heart upon her sleeve her sudden retreat after her foolish speech had been the result of fear at having betrayed her real feelings these were not for carson he was sure of that now but for himself olive loved him and whether the pre arranged marriage took place or not nothing could alter that fact as the thought became conviction mallow found it impossible to suppress the joy he felt and he forthwith indulged in antics which would have shamed a schoolboy what is it asked aldean amazed at this conduct in so grave a man what do you think it is jim lunacy i should say on the face of it no my boy but a word much the same in meaning which begins with the same letter larking guessed the obtuse jim with a grin i can't say much for your penetration lord aldean said mallow with a laugh love is the word i mean love is the feeling which thrills me for 'to day the birthday of my life is come' one would think you had been celebrating the occasion with strong drink retorted jim soberly have you spoken to miss bellairs no sir i have done nothing so foolish then has she perhaps given you to understand of course not do you think for one moment she is the woman to do such a thing i don't know once or twice girls have pretty near proposed to me i've had some trouble with them i can tell you then how do you know it is all right because i do know that isn't an answer it's a statement then you will have to take the statement for your answer my dear old thickhead olive loves me the angel that she is she ran away from you i know she did but she loves me she was in a pelting rage i saw her face i know she was but she loves me oh come home growled aldean putting his arm within that of his enigmatic friend you're a human cuckoo mallow laughed and went back to kingsholme with an excellent appetite which went to prove that he was no lover out of a sickly romance for the next two or three days he made no attempt to see olive but lived on the memory of her self betrayal in spite of jim's insidious hints that the pleasantest walks tended towards the manor house laurence kept away with his host he rode and drove and played golf he spun over the country on his humber and fought jim valiantly in singles on the tennis lawn then the news came that angus carson and his friend major semberry had arrived and were in possession of the garden of flowers and presumably of the nymphs who haunted it mallow's spirits suddenly went down to zero and in a moping mood he worried aldean for two whole days on the third he resolved to meet his rival face to face so taking advantage of aldean's absence at reading he walked over to the manor house and was duly shown into the drawing room remembering their last meeting olive blushed as she gave mallow her hand then to cover her confusion she presented mallow to a tall slender young man in a grey tweed suit with his right hand in a black silk sling mr mallow this is mr carson laurence bowed and as he did so he became aware of a faint drowsy odour it was the perfume of sandal wood chapter v the suspicions of laurence mallow o all things odours are the most powerful to stimulate a dormant memory to bring back in a flash an especial scene a peculiar face a particular conversation nothing was further from mallow's mind than the mysterious murder of athelstane place yet the moment that whiff of sandal wood titillated his nostrils he recalled at once the theory of the newspapers and the wild suggestion of lord aldean for the moment he was so bewildered that he stood tongue tied before mr carson that young gentleman on his part appeared to be amused if a trifle astonished you have seen me before he asked in a pleasant voice with a slight and agreeable accent no is there anything strange about me then that you i i i really beg your pardon stammered mallow scrambling out of his unpleasant position as best he could but i that is i fancied i did know your face you have been in india then yes mr carson i was in india some months ago then it is quite possible that we met there mr mallow although i cannot recall having seen you this is the first time i have visited england forgive me if i am somewhat lax in the observance of your social customs one always shakes hands here i believe when presented you must let me then give you my left hand is your right disabled asked mallow shaking the hand this affable young man extended i am sorry to say it is mr mallow i hurt it some months back shooting in india the bones are diseased and since my arrival i have been having it attended to by one of your clever london surgeons i am relieved to say that he did not consider amputation to be necessary here again was another circumstance which immediately struck mallow as peculiar the right hand of the dead man in athelstane place had been cutoff the right hand of mr carson was diseased and had narrowly escaped amputation this was a strange coincidence i am charmed with your country mr mallow continued carson who seemed bent upon making himself agreeable after the arid plains of india these green fields are very refreshing to the eye yet i have seen marvellous verdure in the himalayas replied mallow carson shrugged his shoulders oh yes every land has its season of greenness you know but india is undeniably dry how do you do mr mallow said a voice at the young man's elbow and he turned to see the lean form of miss slarge we have quite a large gathering to day have we not major semberry dr drabble and mr carson last and least smiled that gentleman mallow laughed also seemingly out of politeness and glanced round the drawing room at the people referred to by miss slarge major semberry a fair handsome soldierly man was paying great attention to miss ostergaard who had apparently forgotten aldean in the ardour of her present flirtation and dr drabble tall and thin as a telegraph pole and with about as much figure was talking loudly with olive bellairs when laurence withdrew his eyes miss slarge who was quite modern at the present moment was chatting with carson in her high pitched voice my sister mrs purcell describes you as being like an italian she was saying and i quite agree with her don't you mr mallow certainly mr carson has the appearance of a tuscan my mother was eurasian explained the young man i am supposed to take after her there is a great similarity between dark people don't you think so yes well putting negroes out of the question i suppose there is more or less assented mallow he thought carson much more like the pure italian than the englishman of mixed blood certainly there was no hint of the anglo saxon about him so mrs purcell has been giving you my character said carson smiling blandly on miss slarge oh dear me yes she wrote me quite a long account of you all about your looks and conversation and i don't know what else really i feel flattered by the notice she has taken of me i confess i should very much like to see that letter if you like i will read you those parts of it which refer to you said miss slarge amiably you will see then how keen an observer my sister is excuse me i will fetch the letter as miss slarge slipped out of the room on her errand mallow detected a sigh from carson a sigh that sounded like one of relief at the same time he appeared so mallow thought to be uneasy and while continuing his conversation he frequently glanced at the major semberry instinctively became aware of this and once or twice turned his head finally he left miss ostergaard and came slowly across the room as though drawn in spite of himself to the side of his friend again mallow heard from carson a sigh of relief after which his uneasiness gave place to a more confident manner and he presented major semberry to laurence with perfect ease we need no introduction said mallow smiling major semberry and i met at simla some few months back ah yes replied semberry in his crisp abrupt way mallow the sportsman i remember say rather mallow the scribe in india major it was my mission to scribble out there by george yes read some of your letters in paper you dropped on us hot mallow deuced hot what are you doing in these parts idling major at the expense of lord aldean met him in london said semberry staccato nice boy make good army man no brains plenty muscle oh aldean has a good deal more mental power than people give him credit for dark horse eh well he may yet prove to be so as to your no brains for the army' major i fancy you depreciate your profession they don't make the fool of the family a soldier now they certainly did not in your case the major acknowledged the compliment with a bow but did not reply do you know semberry that i am about to hear my character said carson blandly eh what from our friend here no explained mallow it seems that mrs purcell has written an account of mr carson to miss slarge and your friend is to hear it verbatim from long exposure to the sun the natural hue of semberry's complexion was brick dust yet at this it became still more red and he put up a hand and tugged uneasily at his moustache his manner reflected the recent anxiety of carson and mallow was at once on the alert to discover the cause of their joint discomfort there was a hint of mystery about the swift glances they exchanged which piqued his curiosity and from that moment he was silently observant of their every look and word what he expected to learn he hardly knew but that there was something to be learned he felt convinced but then mallow was distinctly prejudiced against carson as his rival when the major's hand came down from his moustache he observed that mrs purcell was a charming woman and that she wrote an amusing letter he then turned to face olive who was approaching with dr drabble it is not kind of you three gentlemen to exclude us from your conversation she said brightly what are you talking about mrs purcell's letter said carson with a glance of proprietorship miss slarge has promised to read aloud the character which her sister is so good as to give me it is a better one than you deserve replied olive ha ha roared drabble who was a noisy creature at best isn't his character to your liking miss bellairs if it is not said carson before the girl had time to answer olive shall make it to her liking in two months miss ostergaard who had joined the group laughed can an old dog learn new tricks she said mischeviously a young puppy might muttered mallow whose hot irish temper was rapidly rising both at carson and at olive he was enraged at the mere fact of the man calling the girl by her christian name and he was annoyed at the complacent way in which she seemed to listen to him and his babble luckily for the peace of the moment his remark passed unheard by all save tui and she nodded approbation what ridiculous things you say tui said olive with pretended severity extraordinary name 'tui' called out drabble elegantly what does it mean miss ostergaard it means me in the first place dr drabble she replied smartly and in the second it is the native name for the new zealand parson bird by george parson bird why rookery miss ostergaard or to be more precise why parson bird because it is all black mr mallow a beautiful glossy black with two white feathers in its throat like a parson's cravat we have christened it the parson bird the maoris call it the tui it is inappropriate to you miss ostergaard said carson smiling you never preach i am sure oh yes i do but i keep my sermons for olive ho ho i should like to be a member of that congregation as an anarchist dr drabble you are not fit to be a member of any you don't like preaching other people's preaching i mean that depends upon the preacher miss ostergaard madame death in life for instance with a snarl drabble turned on mallow who had made this remark what do you know of madame death in life he snapped only that she is the most noted anarchist in europe retorted mallow coolly why not i know her you know her the police know her and a few stray kings will know her some day to their cost if she isn't guillotined as she ought to be' i wonder you know such a horrible woman mr mallow said olive oh my acquaintance with her is not personal miss bellairs neither is mine said drabble who had recovered his good humour i don't approve of madame death in life's methods it is not my plan to terrorize the world by bombs and murders the pen sir the pen is mightier than the explosive so is the tongue pamphlets and lectures that is my system for bringing about the much needed social millennium the woman you speak of does harm to the cause she should be suppressed just what i said and by the guillotine no sir thundered drabble no legal crime if you please anarchists prefer illegal murder said semberry smiling grimly and no punishment to follow remarked carson arranging his sling except that of their own conscience chimed in olive no anarchist possesses one said tui at which all present burst out laughing at the expression on dr drabble's face in the midst of this merriment miss slarge returned with the letter and an apology it took me some time to find she explained to carson listen this is how my sister describes you perhaps it is better not to give it to you in my sister's own words for her style is founded upon dr johnson's and is apt to be prolix paraphrase the description miss slarge said mallow mr carson said miss slarge glancing at the letter is twenty five years of age gentle well bred not without parts and modest the gentleman in question clicked his heels together in quite a foreign fashion and bowed low mallow noticed the continental air of the whole action and remembered it he is tall slender elegant in shape of a swart complexion inherited from his mother and his eyes and moustache are of the deepest black he looks like an italian by george carson mrs purcell describes you exactly said the major and in his heart mallow who had followed the description closely was obliged to confess that this was true he is delicate in health and has a weak heart i know that to my cost sighed carson and a swollen hand does mrs purcell mention that fact yes she does mr carson and she also says that you are effeminate ha ha bellowed drabble effeminate eh carson reddened and why miss slarge because you wear a bracelet that is true enough assented the young man but i can't get it off and it has been on my wrist all my life in fact ever since it was placed there by my ayah oh do show us the bracelet cried tui she had a thorough woman's love for jewellery bracelet hum bangle india muttered the major and tugged his moustache show me the bangle angus said olive persuasively and mallow winced mr carson with great care and evidently with some pain took his arm from the sling and drew up his shirt cuff loosely encircling his wrist appeared a broad band of pale gold elaborately wrought with the hideous forms of three hindoo gods as he displayed it miss slarge read aloud the description of the ornament from her sister's letter it is a broad band of ductile gold curiously wrought with the idol figures of the hindoo trinity bramah siva and vishnu interwoven with the sacred lotus flower and other heathen symbols most extraordinary said mallow looking at it good trade mark eh mr carson none genuine without this device what do you mean sir cried carson pulling down his sleeve with an angry jerk mean why what should i mean replied the irishman and smiled innocently chapter vi the reverend manners brock the young men were seated on the terrace in the warm summer twilight the plains of corn beyond the dark trees were filled with floating shadows and the pale radiance of the long set sun still lingered in the western skies overhead a few stars shone with mellow lustre in the warm purple arch but the moon had not yet rolled her wheel over the distant hills and the dusk was faintly luminous so that the landscape was indistinctly visible as through a filmy veil there was no breath of wind and the trees seemed to extend their opaque shadows even to the verge of the glimmering white terrace at intervals a nightingale filled the dusk with silvery strains and occasionally the hoot of a distant owl sounded like depreciative criticism of the bird music so still so dreamy so peacefully beautiful it was a magic night for love and lovers for dancing elves and poet's singing yet this unromantic pair were talking the crudest commonplaces harsh music for such an hour for such a scene but there are times when man sympathizes with nature as little as does she with him well jim said mallow after a pause and a sip of warming liqueur it is now a week since those marplots came on the scene what is your candid opinion with a flick of his finger aldean sent the stump of his cigarette flying over the balustrade that is what i should like to do he said in his deep voice chuck them both into space i did not ask you what you would like to do to them but what you think of them they are two bounders at least semberry is one you are prejudiced my james said mallow coolly semberry is a well bred man but carson ahem carson is not a gentleman in other words carson is not carson upon my soul jim i don't believe he is mallow jumped up and balanced himself on the railing of the terrace immediately before his friend i don't believe he is he repeated he is supposed to have come from india well he knows precious little about india although i have questioned him repeatedly he talks with a distinct foreign accent his every action is suggestive of continental society and he looks like an italian see here jim he slipped down clicked his heels together and made a stiff bow from the waist is that english he mimicked carson's speech you think so yes is that english jim i ask you plainly is there anything english about the man well he isn't english you know was jim's reply his father was a saxon and from all accounts a public school boy a university man gently born and well bred why isn't his son if this man be his son more like him the poor chap hasn't had his father's advantages mallow his mother was a half caste and i suppose no pattern of breeding he has been brought up in exile amongst niggers and has received a scratch education i don't see what you can expect carson's pretty good considering his disadvantages confound you jim don't desert to the enemy cried mallow in a huff i'm not deserting but i see both sides of the question and you don't you believe that the real carson is dead and that this man is an impostor and if i do said mallow defiantly it was you who put the idea into my head aldean laughed you don't usually take my suggestions so seriously he said smiling besides i had no proof for my assertion and you however much you wish to can't find one on the other hand there is ample evidence to show that carson is the man he declares himself to be mrs purcell's letter describes him exactly he has a weak heart and an injured hand also he wears the golden bangle which as he showed mrs carson in bombay cannot be removed finally carson has been in semberry's company ever since he left his father's death bed semberry is a plausible scamp growled mallow biting his fingers i heard no good of him in india perhaps not but a man can be a scamp without being a blackguard pooh pooh you split straws that is a distinction without a difference well rejoined aldean with equanimity let us say that a fellow can be a spendthrift and a don juan without being dishonest i hardly think mallow that semberry would risk his commission and his position in the world by supporting an impostor such as you believe carson to be you have certainly found your tongue jim said the irishman recovering his good humour and your arguments are moderately convincing but you seem to forget that some fifty thousand pounds are involved in this marriage contract who told you so miss slarge she is a dreamy up in the clouds old lady as you know but she can open her eyes and descend to the contemplation of ordinary things occasionally olive is the apple of her eye and her wish is to see the girl happy therefore she does not approve of this marriage' isn't she pleased with carson no she dislikes him thoroughly and she believes that he is marrying olive solely for the sake of the money now major semberry is a chronic bankrupt and half even a quarter of fifty thousand pounds would be a great temptation to him aldean looked earnestly at his friend i see what you mean he said slowly your idea is that carson was murdered at athelstane place and that semberry has substituted this impostor so that the marriage may take place and they may share the proceeds my dear mallow if you argue thus you argue a rope round the major's neck bosh did i say that semberry was a murderer i am only bringing your argument to a logical conclusion mallow if the real carson has been murdered semberry must know of it else he could have no reason to substitute the false one admitting as much he must either have killed carson himself or he must know who did in either case he is a criminal qed mallow shook his head even assuming that i am right semberry could not have murdered carson as it would be sheer folly for him to support an impostor when the real simon pure was his friend however i don't say that the real carson has been murdered nor do i identify him with the athelstane place victim although added mallow seriously it is a strange thing that the clothes both of the living and the dead should smell of sandal wood it is strange admitted aldean and not to be easily explained but we have argued the subject threadbare what is your final opinion my original opinion carson is not carson mallow you are developing a monomania come and unbend your great mind over billiards the irishman laughed and agreed for the next hour or so they were taken up with cannons and breaks and they left further discussion of carson's identity to a more fitting occasion the argument was not renewed that evening and mallow retired to bed with his mind less taken up with the subject than usual and had a good night's rest however he woke early the next morning and his thoughts at once reverted to olive and her doubtful lover beyond the fact of the sandal wood perfume he had no reason for connecting the man who had put in an appearance at casterwell with the victim of athelstane place and his good sense told him that this was but a slender foundation upon which to build the superstructure of an imposture and yet there remained with him an instinctive feeling that all was not right do what he would argue as he might he could not get rid of the idea that semberry and his friend were brother rogues bent upon obtaining the dowry of olive i cannot believe in carson until i find some one who can identify him thought mallow as he dressed himself if mrs purcell were only in england she would settle the question at once but according to miss slarge she will not be back for three months and this man is to marry olive in two on the th of august she comes of age by the terms of the will she must become mrs carson before the th of september after that date be the man genuine or an impostor i am powerless the matter agitated him so greatly as to render him irritable and restless unwilling to inflict his state of mind on aldean as it was yet early he slipped out of the house and walked down to the village he found the rural population astir and busy in the freshness of the morning air during his tutorship of aldean he had become friendly with many of these villagers and those who met him now were glad to renew acquaintance with him after strolling through the quaint high street admiring once again the old fashioned houses with their black beams diapered on the whitewashed walls he turned into the churchyard and strolled round the sombre grey building which was the oldest of all the old things in casterwell the blackened tombstones their queer inscriptions half obliterated by brown moss and yellow lichen toppled askew amongst the uncut dewy grass and from out the general untidiness rose the ecclesiastical fabric its obtuse roof hidden by the open stonework and crocketted pinnacles the massive square tower draped with fresh green ivy loomed out at the western end and round it the swallows were wheeling and glancing like flying arrows thrush and blackbird and starling piped in the adjacent thicket white pigeons whirled overhead and wreaths of smoke curled from the village chimneys mallow enjoyed to the full the freshness of it all the mellow sounds of waking life the atmosphere surrounding him the peace and beauty of it soothed his mind and he fell to musing he started when a voice at his elbow greeted him ah good morning mr mallow this is an unexpected pleasure mr brock cried the irishman turning suddenly i thought you were away so i was rejoined the rector holding out his hand i have been recruiting by the sea i only returned last night i see you are like myself mr mallow you love the freshness of the early morning i felt restless within doors mr brock and came out to be soothed the rector nodded approvingly 'you fly to nature's breast for nature's balm' he quoted in a deep rolling voice it is to be regretted that all young men are not so sensible well mr mallow and how are you i am in capital health and spirits replied laurence lightly and you you are not looking quite so fit as usual age sir age years are beginning to tell on me after sixty the human frame begins to fail i lose tone my recent visit to the seaside was to restore it mallow thought to himself that the result had not been wholly successful for mr brock looked sallow and wrinkled and hollow eyed he was a handsome burly man and he carried himself with an air of importance which many a bishop might have envied his face was clean shaven and his features were clean cut his skin was of the particular hue one associates with old ivory and a halo of silvery white hair lent an air of benignity to his expression the reverend manners brock had been vicar of casterwell for over twenty years and was as well established as the church over which he presided he was an industrious worker an excellent orator and a general social favourite with rich and poor alike there was not in england a rector more popular or more admired he might certainly have been a bishop and granting that the welfare of the community was the aim of those in power he perhaps stood a good chance of becoming one that he would adorn the position as he adorned the rectorship of casterwell there could be no doubt but so far there had been no hint of any such elevation for mr brock as he strolled up and down chatting with mallow the click of the church gate was heard simultaneously they turned to see a dark young man with his arm in a sling advancing along the grassy path mr brock started when he saw the face of the newcomer and clutched the arm of his companion who who is that he asked his face grey and drawn and his frame literally trembling with nervous agitation that is mr carson said mallow wondering carson oh my god carson do do the dead return mallow feared the old man was about to faint chapter vii margery carson with his usual amiable smile came jauntily along the path looking directly at mallow and the rector he appeared to be amazed at the white and perturbed face of the latter but ignoring it he held out his left hand in greeting to laurence good morning he said pleasantly i see you are an early bird like myself i have been accustomed to rise at dawn in india and to drop old habits is difficult is it not yes india gasped the rector before mallow could reply do you come from india yes i arrived in england only a few weeks ago your name is carson angus carson at your service and the young man clicked his heels and bowed the son of my old friend alfred carson pursued the rector who was recovering his self control somewhat yes are you mr brock are you my father's friend yes i am said the other in a voice of emotion ah no wonder i felt queer when i saw your face it was as if the dead were come to life i am supposed to be very like my father returned carson easily i don't wonder you were startled my dear father often spoke to me of your devotion to him yes yes poor alfred the rector seated himself on a flat tombstone and fought down his natural feelings i wish i had known you were here angus your great resemblance to your father has given me a shock i feel ill i i feel very ill shall i go to the rectory and fetch you some brandy said mallow who was sorry for the old man if if you would be so kind muttered mr brock burying his face in his handkerchief poor alfred and his emotion again overcame him carson stood by and looked sympathetically on at this proof of a long remembered friendship but he made no remark until laurence returned from his errand thank you mr mallow you are most kind said brock gratefully as he swallowed the brandy believe me i am sorry my sudden appearance should have so alarmed you said carson politely did you know that i was coming to this place no certainly i was aware of it answered the rector in a stronger voice for miss slarge read me a letter from mrs purcell i also saw the communication you addressed to olive from bombay advising her of your coming but i have been absent and i returned only last night and the sight of your face your extraordinary resemblance to your father startled me not a little such emotion is natural said mallow the more so as you were so attached to mr carson mr brock rose and sighed he was my dearest friend he said sadly and even thirty years have not banished his memory from my heart i feel like a father to you angus you must permit me to call you angus i beg of you to do so answered the young man gracefully giving his left hand to the rector who should do so if not you the oldest friend of my father and the guardian of my dearest olive mallow bit his lip and turned away to conceal his anger for after all being engaged to her the man had every right to speak of olive in affectionate terms angus who had long since discovered that the irishman was his rival smiled blandly at this exhibition for it did not escape him of jealousy but he had sufficient discretion to make no remark with an inclusive nod to both men laurence walked away and his feelings on climbing the hill on his way home were anything but enviable he felt that fate was dealing hardly by him have you hurt your hand asked brock when the unnecessary third person had vanished through the gate yes many months ago while shooting replied carson indeed it was this hand that detained me from paying my respects to olive and yourself earlier i arrived on the twenty fourth of last month and intended coming here at once but my hand was so painful that i waited in london to see a surgeon about it where did you stay asked the rector with my friend major semberry in st james's street semberry took rooms there and i made it my home indeed my luggage is there at the present moment st james's street yes that is a little street off it duke street i believe it is called no b no b duke street st james's repeated brock slowly the first address you gave me was somewhat misleading my ignorance of social customs in your large city replied mr carson with a charming smile i am quite a barbarian am i not yes indeed no if olive is not pleased with you she will be hard to satisfy i think she likes me mr brock but she does not love me oh love is a matter of custom with young girls you will gain it sooner or later if not before marriage then afterwards i fear olive has no love to give me said carson shaking his head it is my impression that she has already given her heart to that gentleman who has just left us to mallow nonsense she looks upon him as a friend as a very dear friend don't you think yes that may be rejoined mr brock gravely she has known him for many years for mallow lived here a considerable time as tutor to lord aldean but i am sure olive is not the girl to disregard her father's dying wish she will become your wife angus be sure of that i shall endeavour to deserve my good fortune mr brock by the way angus did your father send no message to me he spoke of you kindly and tenderly on his death bed replied angus gently but he sent no message he gave you no letter for me none had he done so i would have sent it on to you i suppose he told you about our early friendship well no he spoke always of you with affection yet he gave me no details of your association with him yet bellairs and i were his nearest and dearest sighed the rector but i should not complain a man might forget many things in thirty years poor alfred he was one of the best men i ever knew i hope you will try to emulate his virtues angus i shall do my best mr brock said carson glancing at his watch it is getting near breakfast time i must return to the manor house no said the rector taking the young man by the arm i cannot so readily part with the son of my old friend who brings back all my youth to me you must breakfast with me this invitation did not appear to please carson over much and he would fain have declined it but the rector was peremptory so in the end he accepted mr brock was pleased and showed his pleasure i am a bachelor he said showing his young friend the way through the quick set hedge but i have an excellent housekeeper and an admirable cook you shall have a good breakfast angus well sir i bring a good appetite answered carson and arm in arm with his father's old associate he passed into the rectory grounds making himself as agreeable as he knew how mr brock became rejuvenated in the presence of his old friend's son and questioned the young man closely concerning the dead and gone companion of his youth it was a merry breakfast enough in one way yet in another it was sad in the hereafter it afforded mr brock much food for reflection but if a man will be so rash as to raise the ghost of a dead past he cannot expect to be other than melancholy honest enough to avow that his suspicions concerning carson had proved baseless mallow was not patient or amiable enough to discuss the matter with aldean after a short explanation laurence passed on to more agreeable subjects and his friend was in no way unwilling to leave unprofitable argument for pleasant conversation the irishman concealed his disappointment and deciding that there was little sense in crying over spilt milk made himself as entertaining as possible he enjoyed his meal with aldean after which in completion of his cure as mallow put it they rode together returning late in the afternoon they came upon the residence of dr drabble a slatternly looking dwelling it was on the outskirts of the village here laurence announced his intention of paying a visit to the doctor's wife aldean expressed himself agreeable he liked the doctor's children infinitely better than he liked the doctor beckoning two small boys to hold their horses they went up to the door as untidy as ever i see remarked laurence as they walked up an overgrown brick path through a wilderness of neglected flower shrubs aldean shrugged his shoulders what can you expect he said the doctor is one of your world reformers who sweeps every doorstep but his own reformation never begins at home with these fanatics more's the pity had mrs drabble heard this last statement she would probably have endorsed it she was a weary looking white faced woman worn out with family cares and domestic worries seven children one servant and a neglectful and exacting husband were enough to account for her aspect the room into which the visitors were shown was as untidy as the garden and mrs drabble was as untidy as the room she gave her hand to lord aldean with a wan smile and greeted mallow with an apologetic air for indeed i am quite ashamed that you should find us in such a state she complained languidly but i have so much to do that i can do nothing the epigram was if unintentional none the less true the poor weak head of this domestic martyr was literally dazed by the constant abuse of her neglectful husband and the burden of her clamorous children that mrs drabble was a byeword in casterwell for untidiness was not altogether her fault in truth she possessed neither the strength nor the capability necessary to reduce her domestic chaos to something like order a more helpless hopeless creature never lived she had been a pretty girl enough when she had married drabble and that would be reformer was largely if not entirely the cause of her degeneration and how is my young friend margery asked aldean who had known mrs drabble and her household ever since he was a small boy in petticoats oh margery is well enough sighed mrs drabble she naturally took a despondent view of life her brain is too big for her body and lately she has taken to writing poetry as if that would help one then there is cade and brutus and danton all of them growing boys who eat enormously and spoil their clothes dreadfully i'm sure i often wish their father was more of a parent and less of a radical finished the poor lady i can't do everything it's not to be expected nobody can deny that a crowd of children all named after notorious republicans at that moment surged past the sitting room door which would not shut giggling and whispering they appeared and disappeared like rabbits in and out of their burrows shortly margaret the eldest tripped into the room and shook hands with precocious composure she was a pretty little girl of some twelve years with a nobly formed head a profusion of curly reddish hair a complexion of cream and dreamy grey eyes altogether a noticeable child she already displayed considerable brain power and indeed she was the only one of his children in whom dr drabble took the smallest interest the display of his affection took the form of inculcating her with pernicious anarchistic doctrines the meaning of which the poor child intelligent as she was was quite at a loss to understand as hamilcar made his son take an oath of eternal hatred for rome so did dr drabble instil into his small daughter a detestation of the world and the world's social system poor little margery innocently piped diatribes which would have done credit to the hags of the revolution well margery daw said mallow kindly have you forgotten who i am oh no answered the child in her pleasantly low voice you are the gentleman olive is so fond of lord aldean laughed mallow coloured and mrs drabble much shocked apologized for her daughter's candour but indeed she is such a sharp little thing that there is no keeping anything from her wailed mrs drabble and the doctor i am sorry to say tells her many things that a child should not hear i am a red anarchist like father announced margery proudly we intend to make everybody equal do you indeed laughed aldean drawing the child to his knee and what is to be done with me you are to be called mr aldean and made to work you will indeed be clever if you can make mr aldean work margery said mallow smiling i have never been successful so far please excuse her lord aldean said the shocked mrs drabble it is her father who puts these ideas into her head margery how can you oh we all know that the doctor is working for the social millennium mrs drabble the time when there will be neither rich nor poor and we shall all practise communism i'm sure i wish the doctor would practise his profession lord aldean but mr dyke that new man gets all his best cases whilst he is constantly in london working for the cause as if preaching in trafalgar square is of any use to me i never know the day when he may be in gaol and then what shall i do with these seven children i'll support us all with my poetry mother said margery grandly poetry said mallow laughing and pray what kind of poetry do you write young lady the poetry of revolt that is what father calls it and margery stretching out a lean arm proceeded to recite these terrible lines tyrants tremble in your beds we shall cut off all your heads take your money and your land and as freemen take our stand this is not a foolish gabble but the word of margery drabble the young men roared both at the poetry and the fierce attitude of the child you are quite a revolutionist margery said aldean and a poetess to boot e b browning sappho in a phrygian cap eh the little girl shook her red curls i aspire to be like louise michel she said solemnly the noblest of all women wouldn't you rather grow up like miss bellairs said mallow persuasively ah groaned mrs drabble dismally where are the education and money to come from i love olive i am very fond of olive said margery judiciously but i do not approve of her choice of a husband don't you indeed laughed mallow no i have advised her to marry either you or lord aldean margery margery do not be so pert i am not pert mother i am a thinker with a large t said aldean rising well margery you must come and see me soon and we will ravage the orchards apples strawberries peaches oh my cried margery a child for the nonce i should like to have as many as i could eat well i dare say we can satisfy even your appetite come soon and bring us some more poetry with you mr mallow and i must be going now there dear you won't refuse that will you and he slipped a half sovereign into the child's hand no replied margery the communist 'what's yours is mine' father says so but thank you very much mr aldean lord aldean margery corrected her mother father says there are no lords mother this is plain mr aldean there is a reflection on your lordship's good looks said mallow well margery when you begin cutting off heads i hope you will spare us eh fear not said margery dramatically i'll stand by you in the day of trial chapter viii jephthah's daughter save her honeymoon probably the happiest time in a woman's life is the period of her engagement the time when she is being adored by her lover congratulated by her friends and is delightfully employed in expecting and receiving the customary offerings of her friends and acquaintances and in making those varied and numerous purchases which seem to be considered de rigueur on such occasions for the time being she is at all events the supreme centre of interest amid her own immediate circle her life teems with pleasure and expectation generally a beautiful halo is around the most commonplace of things the present is enjoyable the future entrancing and she the luckiest of women surely dances along over her rose strewn path under her cloudless sky happy in the conviction that smiles and eternal sunshine are to be her lot what if after marriage the sky is ofttimes clouded and the path of life grows stormy and the smiles disappear in frowns and we know that such a change does sometimes come over the spirit of the most beautiful of matrimonial dreams what if some of the early illusions are mercilessly murdered there is always that pre nuptial period to be looked back upon with fondness if also with regret she has snatched from fate at least one hour of supreme and unalloyed delight there is true satisfaction in the thought and happy is the mortal who enjoys even that much happiness in this troublous world the years of the moorish caliph were sixty and more his hours of perfect bliss five olive had she been engaged to mallow would have enjoyed her supreme hour with all the zest of a naturally happy disposition as it was she was wretched in the extreme she detested her affianced husband and she knew how deep was her love for the man she would have had in his place tossed about like a shuttlecock by these extremes of feeling she anticipated her wedding day with dread almost with terror the loss of the money would have been of no account with her it was the dying wish of her father that she felt she could not disregard to say nothing of the hint of unknown evil which the sealed letter contained why her father should have expressed himself so strongly and yet so vaguely she could not conceive she could only conclude that he had committed some error in his life for which she was to pay the penalty jephthah vowed rashly and circumstances brought about the sacrifice of his daughter that he might not be forsworn likewise she was to suffer for her father's sake by contracting this loveless marriage there were times when she was resolved to throw all to the winds to let fate do her worst rather than suffer what was before her but in the end her affection for her dead father prevailed and she bent her will to the force of circumstance on the subject of such unqualified obedience her friend tui did not hesitate to express herself strongly for she was an independent young lady with ideas the reverse of favourable to what she termed family slavery that any parent should command or expect to receive blind and unquestioning obedience was not her way of thinking she was therefore exceedingly wrathful at her friend's decision when a human being arrives at years of sense he has every right to shape his own life said she ex cathedra our religion teaches us that every one has to answer for his own sins therefore certainly he should choose his own wickednesses you speak in the masculine sense dear rejoined olive besides i do not intend to commit any sin that i am aware of i speak for woman as well as for man olive and if you marry a creature you don't care two straws about you will be committing a sin and a very great one oh tui darling it's no use saying 'oh tui darling' replied miss ostergaard vehemently you know in your own heart that i am right do you or do you not love laurence mallow i do with all my soul then why don't you marry him he hasn't asked me yet replied olive with attempted carelessness i do not even know if he loves me my dear you know well enough that he does why he would give his ears to make you his wife and it is only his scruples about this wretched engagement that makes him hold his tongue believe me obedience can be carried too far olive and it is absurd and wrong that you should wreck your life just because your father commands you to marry the son of an old friend of his but the sealed letter tui oh that's a bogey what evil can come to you you have your own money good health and the love of a most delightful man i should defy that letter but you forget i shall lose fifty thousand pounds dear what of that reported the romantic tui i am sure mr mallow is worth paying that price for he's a darling i think if you don't marry him olive i'll make love to him myself there what about lord aldean lord aldean is a donkey a dear sweet donkey all the same he is too young to know his own mind indeed he is two or three years your senior well i never as if you didn't know that a woman is always twice the age of a man but you are getting away from the subject do you really intend marrying this horrid mr carson i must sighed olive ruefully my father oh dear me your father again interrupted tui pettishly as if he had anything to do with it there is too much talk of obedient children and not enough of reasonable parents why should people be born when they don't want to just to be miserable slaves to those who put them in the world against their will would you marry against your father's will yes i would if what he wanted was to make me miserable i would suffer for no one and i don't see that any one be they father or mother has a right to expect it tui you have been listening to that horrid dr drabble i know i have dr drabble is a very sensible man does he treat his wife sensibly dear we are not talking about his wife said tui evading the point but about him i don't agree with everything he says but i approve of a great deal every one should be a free agent marry mr carson and you will be miserable become mrs mallow and you will be happy and father or no father i know which of them i would choose oh tui what nonsense you talk sense sense sense i talk reason sound reason and you know i do i know nothing of the sort then you ought to exclaimed tui with heat now you are going to be nasty dear so i shall leave you till you recover your temper and miss ostergaard holding that discretion was the better part of valour hastily retreated the wretched olive did not know whether to laugh or cry deserted by tui who had gone over to the enemy she was more than ever bewildered miss slarge too was all against carson olive had long seen that although neither her opinion nor help was of any great value olive felt desperate the wedding day was only a few weeks distant and almost immediately she would have to come to a definite decision should she accept or reject carson should she forego the money and ignore the letter the more she put the question to herself the more bewildered she became when they first arrived major semberry and his friend had been guests at the manor house but as miss slarge who was nothing if not conventional did not approve of a lengthy visit they had removed to the village inn however they still spent a great deal of their time at the manor house and it so happened that whilst olive and tui were pursuing their discussion they came in for luncheon olive heard their voices on the lawn but feeling that she could meet neither of them in her present state of mind sent a message to her chaperon and slipped out of the house she walked through the woods and out on to the hills turning over and over again in her mind her ever present dilemma now as though to settle the matter offhand fate had inspired mallow with a spirit of restlessness and he in his turn feeling little inclined for aldean's chatter or company had strolled out alone thus it came about that on the breezy space of the downs the two young people met having met they could scarcely pass without greeting and they ended in sauntering side by side over the springy turf fate had trapped them and fate would have to answer for the consequences it was a perfect day bland and sunny and redolent of summer fragrance and peace an early shower had fallen and the raindrops sparkled on the grass while the sheep straggled on the hillside and the fitful breeze dispersed the sweetness of the land a circling lark lost in the blue rained down its music and the grey rabbits scuttled into their burrows at the approach of the lovers for lovers they were though their love was undeclared side by side they walked on scarcely speaking scarcely looking they were alone on the lonely downs under the roof of god's sky standing on the variegated pavement of god's temple the strongest passion nature knows gripping them at their heart strings at first their conversation such as it was turned on trivial things they skirted as it were the sole thought which filled the hearts of both but their joint attempt to evade it was doomed to failure nature would have her own and she seized it by force their idle talk dwindled into monosyllables even these grew rare and low and then a long silence ensued mallow felt his mouth dry and his heart beating furiously he turned his eyes eloquent with unspoken passion on the woman by his side with a thrill half of joy half of fear she winced and shrank back don't she said faintly holding up her hand i beg of i must said mallow hoarsely as her voice died on her lips olive darling what is the use of our keeping up this pretence i i i love you i must i will he seized her hand and fixed his eyes on her flushed downcast face i love you you love me we are for each other you cannot deny that what i say is true i can see the truth in your face in your eyes olive olive my olive laurence mr mallow you forget my position i do not you are engaged to a man for whom you do not care whom you shall not marry i forbid you to marry this carson you have no right i have every right the right of love deny it if you can if you go to the altar with carson you go with a lie on your lips you are mine mine only and i swear to god that i will not give you up dearest tell me what is in your heart do not deny me one little word you love me you love me say that you love me the overwhelming force of his passion swept her away she could no longer struggle against him against herself i do love you she faltered then with a sudden revulsion of feeling she tore herself away from him and shrank back covering her face with her hands i knew it he cried in triumph you love me you are mine you will not marry this man i must i must she murmured terrified by the way in which she felt he was breaking down the barriers of her will you must not i tell you olive you shall not i am you lover your master your husband not that feeble foolish jack o' dandy with his silly smile and feeble will give him up give him up i command you give him up laurence you are brutal darling forgive me pardon me i am beside myself i am your slave your worshipper oh my heart my love my dearer self be kind to one whose life is yours olive dried her eyes and became more composed as mallow changed his tone she turned towards him with face as white as marble laurence she said quietly for i dare call you laurence i love i have always loved you and i always shall love you but i am not my own mistress i would to heaven that i were but i am helpless i must marry this man not for the money ah no the money can go but because my dear father left a letter for me in which he urged me to obey his dying wish and marry angus carson if i do not evil will come of my refusal evil olive what evil i do not know my father's letter gave no explanation it simply said that terrible evil would come if i did not obey his wish i dare not refuse i dare not ignore that solemn command much as i love you i must sacrifice it yes and you to the memory of my father you will marry carson asked laurence his face growing pale olive bowed her head what else would you have me do she asked pitifully do with a burst of passion he seized her again in his arms do i would have you become my wife my father your father had no right to condemn you to lifelong misery it shall not be you are mine i will not give you up cruel cruel when you know how i suffer she sobbed if you love me you would let me go you would urge me to fulfil the wish of the dead almost rudely he flung her from him go then he said bitterly i want no love so feeble that it bends to another's will obey your father if you think fit marry carson and leave me to go how dare you to speak to me like that cried olive passing from tears to fury if you suffer do not i suffer i loathe to marry this man i would kill myself if i dared i you talk like a child he said roughly i feel like a woman she retorted heartily you think only of your own misery what is it to mine you are not forced into the arms of a woman you detest if you go you go to carson of your own free will oh laurence how can you say that i go to another man of my own free will when you know how i love you it is unjust cruel if my father were alive i might have the courage to refuse as it is how can i disobey if i refuse angus carson some evil will surely follow and if i marry you i involve you in it too would that be right olive i would go to hell for you and with you laurence you do not love me you cannot love me or you would not make it harder for me your feeling for me is not love it is selfishness i must bow to your will i must flout my father in his grave i must cast all to the winds that you may gain your wish olive his voice was husky and broken i would do all that and more for you but since you hold my love so low let us forget that i have told it let us part here now and for always laurence laurence my heart will break and for a shadow olive no no she cried no shadow no folly this it is only too real you are right let us let us say good bye you tell me to go i tell you to go then listen to me i love you and i intend that you shall be my wife i don't care for carson or the money or the threatened evil or anything else i sweep all these away i say good bye now and i go to london to athelstane place olive looked bewildered in god's name why she faltered to learn if the man who was murdered there was the man you should have married i i why i am to marry mr carson it is yet to be proved that this man is mr carson what do you mean i will tell you what i mean when i come back and without a handshake or a glance at her white face mallow walked abruptly away chapter ix twenty one on calm reflection mallow did not consider that he had behaved very well to olive his passion and impetuosity had carried him beyond himself he had been too rough too masterful instead of suing with soft words he had sought to dominate by sheer strength of will a cave man of the stone period could scarce have wooed in style more savage and when mallow had regained his self control he was heartily ashamed that his fiery temper had got the better of him but his pride would not allow him to apologize to olive nor did he even excuse himself by letter he preserved an absolute silence and kept away from the manor house he had not been quite sincere when he declared his intention of proceeding at once to athelstane place but for very shame he could not now withdraw from a position taken up so definitely accordingly on the day preceding olive's birthday he announced to aldean that he was going to london oh hang it i do call that shabby cried jim with a look of dismay you promised to stay here at least two months i'll come down and complete the term shortly aldean oh you don't wish to be here when miss bellairs marries carson i suppose miss bellairs shall never marry carson if i can help it perhaps not mallow but i don't exactly see how you can help it this morning i saw carson and he tells me the ceremony is to take place in a fortnight a great deal can be done in a fortnight jim old man questioned jim with a stare have you anything up your sleeve only my mistrust of carson as carson what that old game you are becoming a maniac on that subject mallow it's all bosh you know carson is carson right enough mrs purcell semberry mr brock they've all said as much no doubt replied mallow dryly but not one of them has explained why carson's clothes should be impregnated with sandal wood as were those of the man in athelstane place you'll find nothing there to help you said aldean shaking his head what the police couldn't do you won't then i shall go to the police themselves you'll look for a needle in a haystack you mean however if you have made up your mind i suppose you must go on your wild goose chase when may i expect you back from it before carson marries miss bellairs does that mean at the end of a fortnight if i make no discoveries associating carson with the murder it does oh lord do you want to hang the man as well as rob him of his wife jim i'm not vindictive goodness only knows what you are mallow well least said soonest mended go and good luck go with you after this conversation in which it will be noticed mallow gave no hint of his interview with olive he went to london and was absent for the greater part of a fortnight olive too kept her own counsel about that stormy wooing but she felt a strange joy in recalling to herself its every detail it was the joy of a woman who loves to be dominated and to be ruled by the man she adores had mallow cut the gordian knot of her difficulties and in the face of all her objection forced her to marry him secretly she would have been pleased and relieved as it was he had left her with an enigmatic utterance which she could not understand yet this time of trial was in some ways beneficial to her it strengthened the better qualities of her nature which otherwise might have weakened in the sunshine of perpetual good fortune the ills of this life like drugs are unpleasant but necessary they brace our mental organization as do tonics our physical olive's twenty first birthday was celebrated by a dinner to her friends and tenantry the manor house and its grounds were thrown open in the old fashioned hospitable style and a plentiful spread was provided under a temporary tent here farmers and labourers toasted their young mistress in the strongest and most stinging of ales speeches were made and congratulations were offered and had mallow but been present in the character of her future husband olive would have been completely happy as it was she had to introduce carson in his place but she accepted the encomiums passed upon his pleasant face and amiable speeches with such show of pleasure as she could command from herself she could not deny that the husband chosen for her by her father was both attractive and agreeable that he was even lovable in some ways perhaps in his very weakness laurence was pre eminently a man of strength a man imperious and self sustaining a man who would love a woman and master a woman and fulfil the fundamental law of nature that the male is the lord of creation from an oyster to a wife in short a man stable as the universe fixed as the stars angus was pleasant good tempered handsome and weak he would have made a charming woman olive thought with contempt the indian bangle was not much out of place after all upon his wrist on this festive occasion even poor mrs drabble took a holiday she brought with her margery danton and brutus of whom the first named clung to olive's skirts most of the day she had brought with her and presented to olive a birthday ode in its way a marvel of rhyme and of spelling oh may no ethly cares anoy olive bellairs and may she never fear her birthday every year but give up teres and sighs till she most hapy dyes thank you margery said olive kissing the little poetess who was anxiously watching the effect of her ode i hope your good wishes will come true and she sighed i have brought charlotte corday remarked margery holding up a battered doll with a red cap on its head poor dear she has had no pleasure since we cut her head off who cut her head off asked aldean who was close at hand brutus because he said she must 'dree her weird' it should have been danton of course but danton was at school i have glued her head on again but she will never have a strong neck but i love her all the same shall i give you another doll said carson smiling amiably no thank you replied margery shaking her curls i must keep charlotte corday after she has suffered so much for the cause ah that is my margery roared drabble she's a true chip of the old block true chip of the gallows growled semberry who hated the doctor when our day comes there will be no gallows retorted dr drabble guillotines only i suppose said aldean with a twinkle there will be love and fraternity and equality be my brother or i will kill you quoted tui i've heard that sentiment before dr drabble miss ostergaard i thought you were a disciple of mine i stop short of murder doctor major semberry appeared disturbed nasty word 'murder' in a young lady's mouth he jerked let's talk of something agreeable of olive for instance smiled angus olives are always agreeable after dinner only said miss bellairs spoiling the pun i don't feel complimented angus by your comparison my dear you are a flower a rose and you are a smiling cabbage muttered tui turning away lord aldean take me to the tent the major is not engaged hinted aldean slyly neither am i retorted miss ostergaard so there is still a chance for your lordship and she led him away wondering if he could not construe a confession of love from her last remark while this desultory conversation was going on miss slarge had the rector well in hand and was bombarding him with hard babylonic facts our good friday hot cross bun is an emblem of idolatry she was saying we should tread it underfoot rather than eat it oh my dear lady remonstrated the shocked mr brock it is stamped with the sacred symbol of our religion i don't care what it is stamped with it is none other than the sacred bread of babylon which was offered to the pagan queen of heaven fifteen hundred and more years before the christian era even the name is the same the sacred cake was called 'boun' our good friday cake is termed 'bun' a bun interposed the rector with or without the article it is the same thing 'boun' 'bun' what can be plainer the first is pure chaldee the last scottish i don't understand chaldee miss slarge said mr brock in hope of changing the conversation what a pleasant scene this is the scene is all right snapped miss slarge but it would be better if mr carson were not here ugh i can't bear the sight of him why not he seems to be a pleasant young man no backbone mr brock if you dropped him into the mud he would stay there mrs purcell said that he had a strong will and a stubborn nature but i can see neither myself it is of course possible your sister may have been mistaken perhaps so but in every other respect her description of him has been particularly accurate even to the bracelet he wears bangle bracelet said miss slarge with contempt the idea of a man decking himself out like a woman still he is agreeable enough miss slarge and you must remember that to me he is always the son of my dear old friend in memory of his father he intends to present my church with a new altar cloth marked 'ihs' i suppose mr brock well yes it is customary to mark them with the sacred letters what do they stand for 'iesu hominum salvator' nothing of the sort cried miss slarge delighted that the rector had fallen into her trap they are the initials of the egyptian trinity isis horus and seb miss slarge how can you treat sacred things so lightly i don't treat sacred things lightly retorted miss slarge ihs is a heathen symbol and i am not an idolater i hope really i do not know what to say you should study more said miss slarge satisfied with her triumph as she walked away leaving the rector quite angry i wonder where she can find all this rubbish murmured the outraged mr brock it is really not respectable the way she talks eh what is that shouting he asked a bystander the tenants are toasting mr carson as miss bellairs' future husband i suppose said the rector cheerily ah what a pity that mark and alfred did not live to see this happy day chapter x a pre nuptial contract though the passing of each hour brought her nearer to her hateful marriage olive felt relieved now that the celebration of her coming of age was over she was little disposed for gaiety or for company of any kind her thoughts were continually with laurence she missed him daily hourly his face was constantly before her and his words echoed everlastingly in her ears it was not surprising that on meeting lord aldean in the village she should question him as to mallow's return i sometimes wonder if he is coming back at all she finished hastily oh mallow's coming back right enough said aldean he is certain to return before your marriage please don't speak of my marriage lord aldean she cried impetuously have you heard from mr mallow since he left only once miss bellairs he is well and busy in athelstane place jim was not a little taken aback by this last question he was in total ignorance of what had taken place on the downs what do you know may i ask about athelstane place he said looking sharply at the girl mr mallow told me something about it and about mr carson oh that is one of mallow's crazy notions said aldean vexed i suppose he told you that carson was an impostor then believe me it is all nonsense miss bellairs mallow has built up this theory on a foolish remark i happened to let drop his idea is that the real carson was murdered and this fellow has stepped into his shoes you don't believe that cried olive breathlessly certainly not replied jim' vehemently and please don't repeat what i say i have a horror of scandal carson is carson right enough this is only a mad idea of mallow's but why should mr mallow persist in such a strange idea lord aldean shrugged his shoulders the dead man's clothes were perfumed with sandal wood and carson's you know have the same smell it is on this ground i think that mallow goes chiefly he fancies there must be some connection between the two and is there asked olive no but mallow is ready to grasp at straws to stop your marriage miss bellairs reddened and turned away that is impossible she said in a low voice yes if it is to be stopped only by proving carson to be an impostor i agree with you don't worry your head about such folly perhaps i ought to tell mr carson said olive thoughtfully no for goodness' sake don't you'll only cause unnecessary trouble by doing that there is no doubt about carson being the genuine article he carries the trade mark of this indian bangle and mrs purcell describes him exactly in her letter besides mr brock recognised him from his resemblance to his father miss bellairs said no more on the subject she saw that it annoyed aldean not to be able to defend mallow in this eccentricity of his but on returning home she asked her aunt for mrs purcell's letter and read it through most carefully she copied out verbatim the portions relating to angus carson and committed them to memory so that when he called in the afternoon she was able to view him through mrs purcell's spectacles a stealthy and careful examination convinced her that mallow's fancies were moonshine without doubt carson of casterwell resembled carson of bombay in every particular the graphic sketch of mrs purcell was an admirable portrait of the man as he stood there unconscious of her scrutiny whatever way of escape from this detested marriage might open out to her it was not here and olive resigned herself to her fate predestined her eyes followed her future husband with a look of contempt as he crossed the room with a cup of tea for tui his weak good nature and incessant amiability were aggressive to her she might compel herself to marry him but she felt that she could never feel the least respect for his character the mere sight of his ever smiling complacency made her resent her position more and more overbearing rough or even brutal he might have been and she might have resigned herself to him with more content at least he would have been a man she thought of pope's cruel portrait of lord hervey that thing of silk spurns that mere white curd of asses' milk if as mrs purcell declared he possessed a powerful will he concealed it only too effectually a stubborn nature and a full confidence in his own judgment he might have they were more in harmony with his weakness still he was to be her husband that was certain and it only remained for her to make the best of it and of him penny for your thoughts miss bellairs said semberry at her elbow they are not worth it retorted olive taking the cup of tea he held out to her i'll sell them as bankrupt stock can i give you another cup of tea if you please and the major took his seat beside her much to her satisfaction for she felt that she would rather talk to him than to his friend by the way miss bellairs said semberry other day you said something about a maid yes i want a new maid i am looking for one now friend of mine wants to find a situation for a good maid thank you very much but i think i shall have no difficulty in finding one to suit me in casterwell but this is a london girl very smart urged the major wants to live in country friend recommends her no end who is your friend may i ask mrs arne fashionable woman clever woman thinks a lot of this maid wouldn't part with her only girl wants to live in th' country spoke to me said i'd speak to you it is very kind of you to trouble about it major she said very kind indeed you must let me think the matter over will you pleasure replied semberry scribbling on a page of his pocket book and tearing it out here is mrs arne's address write soon might lose the girl what is her name lord 'fraid don't know miss bellairs never trouble 'bout these things as a rule mere chance i heard of this thought you'd like to know hallo who's this by george that radical doctor can't stand the man dr drabble bustled noisily into the drawing room he announced his own arrival in a stentorian voice with his cunning grey face and close cropped red hair and lean hungry aspect he resembled nothing so much as a prowling winter fox sniffing round a hen roost how are you miss bellairs there's nothing much the matter with you that's easily seen he roared gripping her hand miss ostergaard you look like yourself people generally do don't they doctor ha ha very good but i'm paying you the hugest possible compliment if you only knew how to take it and where is miss slarge she is engaged doctor said olive resigning herself too with a sigh to the company of this bull will you take some tea thank you thank you no sugar should advise sugar drabble growled the major insolently sweeten your nature my nature sir is that of primeval man simple childlike and lawless put in carson smiling the doctor mounted his hobby at once if by lawless you mean the obedience of man to the dictates of his own noble nature independent of a tyrannical government then i am lawless he said oratorically i and my fellow workers wish to reinstate the simplicity of primeval days i thought you went even further said olive and wished to revive chaos chaos reigns now proclaimed the reformer chaos means disorder and what is the world now but a disordered mass look at the military burdens of europe at the overtaxed poor at the insolent rich and tell me if things are as they should be no one said they were doctor remarked carson but it is not by pitching bombs at people that you are going to mend them bombs sir there is no such word there are no such articles in my scheme of reform i would enlighten those in power by pen and speech if they will not listen then their blood must be upon their own heads for the masses will rise and sweep them from out their counting houses hurl them from their thrones tear them from the bench of justice on which they sit to administer evil laws to stamp out tyranny the earth as it now is must be churned up deluged with the blood of the unjust devastated in short from pole to pole you bring a torch for burning but no hammer for building quoted olive who had read her carlyle and remembered him the torch first the hammer to follow to build up we must first pull down and on the ruins of the past build utopia another name for dreamland muttered semberry olive grew rather tired of drabble and his diatribes not so tui however she listened to the doctor's cheap philanthropy with parted lips and eager eyes she hung upon his every word and seeing that he had at least one sympathetic listener drabble addressed his conversation almost exclusively to her observing this olive slipped out on to the terrace where much to her disgust she was speedily joined by carson i thought you liked listening to dr drabble she said coldly no he talks commonplaces i prefer romance romance echoed olive thinking of their relative positions so far removed as they were from the ideal romance here and where else will you find it if not in this rose garden tell me olive he went on without waiting for her reply why do you avoid me have i offended you you she replied with contempt you could not offend any one i never knew so harmless a being it is better surely to be harmless than harmful said carson complacently i shall make you a good husband you shall never be my husband retorted olive flushed with anger carson looked scared i understood we were to be married in a fortnight he said under his breath so we are i marry you not because i love you but because i respect the wish of my father i can be a wife to you in name only olive what do you mean what i say cannot you comprehend plain english when we are married you and i can be no more to one another than we are at this moment and if i refuse he said with a faint show of anger then i cannot marry you answered olive quietly my desire is to carry out to the letter the will of my father and by becoming your wife give you the control of this fifty thousand pounds more than this i cannot do i pay you this money for my freedom you are free to accept it or refuse it as you will angus looked mortified and indignant a flush was across his weak but handsome face do you then hate me he demanded angrily i am indifferent to you i do not love you for that reason i make my bargain i understand you love that insolent mallow i should advise you to make no assertions and to mention no names replied olive keeping her temper what i say i intend to do you marry me on these terms or not at all i will marry you said carson frowning if only to humble you olive turned on him you you humble me you a foolish weak go away angus or i may say much we may both regret i will not go away he said the latent obstinacy of his nature asserting itself let us make our bargain once and for all i will marry you and be my husband in name only yes he whispered with so strange a glance that she started back in name only i agree to your terms for my own private reasons but should this mallow return leave mr mallow's name out of our conversation interrupted olive imperiously there is nothing between us that you need trouble about i do not conceal things do i asked carson with bland inquiry ask yourself angus she looked at him hard what do you know about athelstane place chapter xi the new maid any belief that olive might still have entertained in the accuracy of mallow's suggestion was speedily dispelled by the expression of sheer amazement upon carson's face he remained cool and perfectly colourless what do i know of athelstane place he repeated blankly why i never heard of athelstane place you don't read your newspaper then no after living all my life in india the english newspapers contain nothing likely to interest me but why do you ask me these strange questions i will tell you if you will answer me a still stranger one what is it asked carson apparently much mystified why do your clothes smell so of sandal wood is that all why because i keep them in a sandal wood chest which you brought from india yes i bought it from a chinaman in bombay i like the scent of the wood is the odour disagreeable to you i hope not had i known i should have bought new clothes in london the odour is not in itself disagreeable replied olive but in athelstane place a man was murdered whose clothes also smelt strongly of this sandal wood that is strange said carson biting his finger nails very strange i remember now semberry did mention this murder to me but i thought you said you had not heard of the locality for the moment i forgot i recollect now that he mentioned the name casually but he said nothing about any smell of sandal wood i should like to hear more about that very strange said carson musingly but what may i ask can this murder have to do with me if the man was acting his powers of simulation were marvellous olive did not think he was acting he had not the strength or self control to mask his feelings so completely the last shadow of doubt vanished from her mind there could be no question as to the bona fides of the man if you do not know i do not she retorted and walked back to the drawing room carson remained where he was deep in thought murdered man that sandal wood odour he muttered drawing his brows together i cannot understand it i must ask semberry the meaning of this as he spoke he removed his right arm from the sling with a sigh of relief and let it hang for a minute or so the bangle slipped down from under his shirt cuff on to his wrist carson's eye caught its glitter and he laughed outright satisfied that mallow's fancies had no foundation in fact and having closed her bargain with carson olive resigned herself to the inevitable and commenced to prepare for her wedding she retailed to tui semberry's proposal about the maid and miss ostergaard warmly approved of it what might suit her as olive bellairs would not do in her position as olive carson she observed and it was far better at once to engage a smart young woman thoroughly conversant with her duties than to rely upon the primitive notions of some country girl she advised olive to lose no time in writing to mrs arne for the girl's reference and if it proved satisfactory to engage her olive concurred she wrote immediately to mrs arne and by return of post received a reply clara trall was a perfect treasure and the writer was more than sorry to part with her but the girl's health demanded that she should live in the country to which argument mrs arne felt she could not but yield though it was with the greatest reluctance she did so all this and much more set forth on fine creamlaid note in a firm masculine hand the result was that olive engaged the girl asking that she should come to commence her duties at once within a day or two of her summons clara trall drove up bag and baggage in a hired fly from reading station she was a tall sallow faced girl carrying herself with a certain hauteur her dress was plain though stylish her manner respectful and self contained and she had a habit of drooping her lids over her black eyes demurely as though repressing herself on the whole she came well through her mistress's examination and cross examination her knowledge of her work proved thorough she was quick had excellent taste and did everything she took in hand as well as it could be done after some experience and careful observation olive agreed that clara's qualifications had not been overstated by mrs arne she congratulated herself upon the discovery of a jewel and availed herself thoroughly of the girl's usefulness finally she thanked semberry for his information and advice glad it's all right miss bellairs said the major politely mere chance i heard of her you know a fortunate chance for me major you can't think what a comfort it is to have a maid one can thoroughly trust hard thing trust any one in this world mumbled semberry however you'll have a husband to look after you soon i can look after myself quite well thank you said olive my marriage will make no difference to me in that respect make a heap to me miss bellairs i've been constantly with carson last six months got him as a kind of legacy from his father you know but i s'pose this marriage'll put me on one side shall miss the boy awfully you are devoted to mr carson oh yes weak beggar but good sort been a kind of father to him you know glad to see him married though even at m'own cost oh said olive i hope you will not let me interfere with your friendship in the least must jerked semberry shaking his head when a man marries you know leaves friends clings on to his wife 'sides my leave's up soon i must pull out india way in month or so you will stay for the wedding i hope major oh thanks s'pose so must see carson turned off usual style olive was becoming a trifle restive she soon wearied of trying to manufacture conversation especially for a man like semberry so she seized the first opportunity of slipping away and leaving him to tui that young lady's management of the soldier was quite masterly she was a born flirt a free lance of free lances all unclaimed hearts came alike to her and she was ever ready to annex them but however much occupied she might be in that direction she ever kept a watchful eye on aldean a confession of one half the interest she really felt in him would have saved that young gentleman many a wakeful night and many a heartache but after the mystic manner of her sex she was careful to hold her tongue on that particular subject and poor jim's powers of penetration were not of the highest order hence he was utterly wretched he assured himself she was a coquette that she had no heart he used language which sorely taxed the recording angel's supply of asterisks but still she drew him back still she tormented him until he had a mind to turn celibate and retreat to the handiest monastery withal he managed to write now and again to mallow and to report to him as best he was able how olive looked what she said and how she passed her time the knowledge that mallow was as miserable as himself was some small comfort to him poor jim took many long walks he would then repeat to himself such poetry as he remembered which was not much sauntering home in the twilight one evening flogging his memory for rhymes as usual he noticed through a gap in the hedge close by two persons talking together closer inspection discovered a man and a woman the man was carson the woman he had never before seen carson's arm was about the girl's waist and she was alternately raging and sobbing yet with a degree of caution which went to show that the meeting was a stolen one neither of them saw aldean who did not slacken his pace until he was out of both eyesight and earshot then he swore infernal shame he growled once more increasing his stride to cool his rage here's this fellow going to be married next week yet he carries on with another girl if i were to tell mallow how this cad is deceiving miss bellairs there'd be some trouble i wonder who the girl can be i never saw her before to my knowledge it chanced however that he was soon to see her again for on calling at the manor house a day or so after he came face to face with a tall sallow faced young woman in whom he had no difficulty in recognizing carson's inamorata she was handsome enough in a way he thought but he did not like her mouth and those dark eyes splendid as they were did not blaze in her head for nothing she stood on one side as lord aldean passed her and took him in as it seemed at a glance servant thought jim as he entered the drawing room hum doesn't look like one for all that carson's a well carson's a blackguard i fear to satisfy himself on this point after some desultory conversation with olive he put a leading question you have a new face about the manor i see he remarked tall girl dark and rather handsome who is she my new maid clara trall replied olive somewhat surprised for it was not aldean's habit to notice new faces she seems a superior class of girl for a servant yes she is indeed lord aldean she has been with me only a few days but i am more than satisfied with her i have to thank major semberry for finding her for me really aldean was puzzled so it was semberry who had brought this girl whom he had seen weeping in the gloaming on carson's shoulder to casterwell there was something queer about this little guessing his thoughts olive proceeded to relate the details of clara's engagement and after a few civil words congratulating her upon the possession of such a treasure aldean went home more puzzled than ever what the dickens can it mean he murmured the woman doesn't look like a servant it is clear semberry got her here and it is equally clear carson makes love to her there is something very queer about it all it's too bad goodness knows i'm not by way of being the acme of morality myself but well it's too bad altogether making love just before his marriage to his future wife's maid tui coming round the bend of the road scattered lord aldean's contemplations to the four winds he hurried forward and took off his cap with a blush and a bow i have just been up to the manor house he explained but you were not there tui laughed you see lord aldean strange as it may appear to you i do take a walk occasionally for the sake of my health oh said jim i too have been walking for my heart's sake really i hope your heart is much benefited by the treatment said tui demurely does dr cupid recommend solitary ambulations he recommends strongly that i should show you the neighbourhood ah but you see he isn't my doctor lord aldean so i don't feel called upon to obey his orders oh but i say you know blurted out her victim you really should let me show you round our country you can have no idea how charming he is charm depends so much upon one's companion doesn't it now major oh i know he is delightful interrupted jim wrathfully at least you think he is do i indeed and who told you so may i ask nobody but i have good eyes but not good manners i fear lord aldean nor good temper inwardly jim groaned i used to be considered an amiable sort of chap he said sadly but somehow i've gone wrong lately i miss i miss mallow the shaft went home oh i know how very fond you are of mr mallow when is he coming back that you may be amiable i cannot say he does not tell me in his letters no then i presume he intends letting that horrid mr carson marry olive i suppose so i do not see how he can very well prevent it oh he is blind and so are you cried tui indignantly if he loves olive why on earth doesn't he marry her mr carson's a smiling cheshire cat mr mallow indeed he ought to be called mr feeble mind if i were a man and loved a girl i'd tell her so suppose the girl wouldn't let the man get that far said aldean significantly what nonsense as if any man who was really and truly in love ever stopped from speaking his mind well i am in love you lord aldean i am not speaking about you but about mr mallow you can tell him from me that i am ashamed of him he's a hesitating frightened come i say miss ostergaard nervous feeble minded rabbit so there and tui having brought her string of epithets to a triumphant conclusion walked off rapidly with a glance that forbade aldean to follow the young man looked after her open mouthed my word she has a power of speech he murmured i wonder what she'd call carson if she knew of his little game with the maid chapter xii wedding bells when mallow returned to casterwell he found the village keeping high holiday in honour of olive's marriage the streets and houses were gay with flowers and flags under the arches of green boughs festooned with many coloured blossoms the people moved about gazing not without admiration it must be confessed at their own handiwork the same profuse hospitality which had distinguished the coming of age of the lady of the manor was repeated on a still larger scale the bells of st augustine's were clamorous in the old tower the sleepy old churchyard was for the nonce alive with voices and the sun in sympathetic mood at so brave a sight was shining with all his splendour but the idol does not ever rejoice with the worshippers and she was the most miserable girl in the whole village laurence was perhaps scarcely less so he had not advised aldean of his return but had come from reading in the hired fly dusty and battered it contrasted discordantly with the spruceness and gaiety of the street and mallow seated far back in it his cap drawn over his eyes winced more than once as the full meaning of it all forced itself upon him i wonder does she feel as wretched as i do he thought bitterly i suppose she does my poor iphigenia my poor girl her father has much to answer for lord aldean received his friend in unbounded astonishment he had not expected that mallow would return on this of all days and he fell to the conclusion that he must have been successful in his search and have returned to stop the marriage at the eleventh hour yet mallow certainly did not look as if he had succeeded his dress was careless and his face was haggard and he formed a striking contrast to aldean in the smartness of conventional wedding going garments indeed as he arrived jim was on the point of leaving for the church he signalled to his coachman to wait and drew mallow into the library well he said breathlessly what have you done nothing absolutely nothing replied mallow throwing himself into a chair with a weary sigh i was afraid your journey would turn out a wild goose chase said aldean with a shrug so carson is the right man after all i have found nothing to prove that he is not what about the sandal wood perfume that is still a mystery jim and so far as i can see is likely to remain one i went to athelstane place and i saw most of the witnesses who gave evidence at the inquest but i could find out nothing new i called at new scotland yard but with no better result the case remains exactly as it did when the man was buried has his name not been discovered no nor have his friends if he had any communicated with the police then you can't in any way connect carson with the dead man in no way two parallel straight lines cannot meet carson's existence can have nothing to do with the unknown man who was murdered i suppose you made no inquiries about carson well yes i did and i found out something oh come that's better i thought you said you had done absolutely nothing well what i did learn is of so little moment jim that it amounts to nothing i called at the p and o office and inquired about carson the clerk i spoke to told me that i was the second man who had asked for him aldean looked surprised considering that carson has no friend in england that's curious how long ago was the first inquiry made two days only before the pharaoh arrived did you ask what kind of man he was who inquired for him yes a black haired black bearded man shabbily dressed he wished to know if carson was on the pharaoh and if so when he would arrive the clerk showed him the name of angus carson in the passenger list and told him that the boat was due on july th did this man ever return no he thanked the clerk and left the office that was the last seen of him he gave no name of course not said mallow peevishly why should he give his name in connection with so simple an inquiry you can see now for yourself that this information amounts to practically nothing it neither proves nor disproves carson's identity and it certainly does not in any way connect him with the murder still the mere fact of carson's being inquired for is strange when we know that he has not a single friend in england said jim reflectively before his arrival too that is even more strange mallow shook his head i thought of that myself he said but it does not help us in any way it certainly cannot assist us towards circumventing this wedding i see you are going to it running his eye over jim of course there is an invitation for you also if you care to accept it i do not are to replied mallow quietly it is quite painful enough for me to be here on the day of the sacrifice without attending it then why did you come my poor old chap because i wish you to take this letter and deliver it personally to mallow paused to mrs carson he finished slowly with some hesitation lord aldean took the envelope extended to him he was doubtful i hope it does not contain reproaches he said no it merely sets her mind at rest about about her husband mallow could hardly get the word out and tells her that if she needs me i am always ready to do her bidding well said jim placing the letter in his pocket i'll deliver it with the greatest of pleasure it is not unlikely that she will need you some day what do you mean jim oh i don't mean anything in particular he said carelessly you know i neither like nor trust carson i am quite with you said mallow bitterly but unfortunately neither our dislike nor our distrust can assist us to avert this ceremony no that's true what will be will be and with this morsel of philosophy they parted aldean for the ceremony at the church mallow to rail at fate for having so cruelly deprived him of olive it was not until after the breakfast that aldean found any opportunity of delivering mallow's note to olive as he slipped it into her hand she flushed crimson guessing instinctively from whom it came with a grateful glance at aldean she ran upstairs and hastily tore it open it contained only a few lines forget what i said in my anger about your husband he is truly angus carson and i pray heaven that you may be happy with him but if in trouble you should need a friend remember that i claim the right to serve you the lines were unsigned and ill written olive sat with them crushed in her hand the tears falling down her face tui discreetly held her tongue for she had guessed that the letter was from mallow she roused olive to action whilst the maid busied herself with her mistress's clothes a frown on her face and dark circles under her eyes clara seemed little less sorrowful than her mistress come dear said tui you must dress quickly your husband is waiting for you clara looked round strangely my husband said olive hopelessly yes he is my husband now but dear said tui you married with your eyes open yes and with my hands bound retorted mrs carson rising well i suppose i must go on now to the bitter end help me clara on the terrace below dimbal was conversing hurriedly with the newly made husband in a few days the stocks and shares will be transferred in your name he said rubbing his hands but i suppose you won't care to be troubled with business for a while oh i don't know about that said carson smiling i don't believe in neglecting business for pleasure i will run up and see you next week i presume i have full control of this money you are aware of course that the capital is charged with the payment of a thousand per annum to your wife yes i will pay her the first year's income at once said carson generously i suppose i can realize quickly certainly without difficulty but i hope mr carson you won't sell out the money is admirably invested before he could answer olive came out of the house in her travelling dress she looked pale though composed with a nod to the lawyer carson hurried forward and offered his arm having already said good bye olive took it and stepped into the carriage then amid a shower of rice and shoes amid smiles and congratulations and the usual sprinkling of tears they drove off major semberry chuckled complacently as the carriage disappeared thank god he muttered from the terrace of kingsholme mallow watched them he looked ill and haggard heaven help her and me he said with a sigh the second scene at sandbeach chapter i the happy pair sandbeach is a rising watering place on the south coast it has been rising for the last ten years yet in the opinion of its inhabitants it has not yet reached that pitch of elevation to which its merits entitle it the guide book emphatically declares that it is healthy pleasantly situated within easy distance of london and inexpensive but for all this eulogy sandbeach remains unpopular a sand and shingle beach curved between headlands of crumbling chalk a stone faced esplanade with wooden shelters like dolls' houses three or four dozen queen anne residences fronting some public gardens a courtesy term surely such is sandbeach in the rear huddle a score or more of untidy cottages these represent the original village of thirty years back there is the usual monster hotel invariably under entirely new management for each season it succeeds in bankrupting its unhappy proprietor there is also an aggressively ornate band stand where play local musicians who seemingly vie with their predecessors in the staleness and worthlessness of their music golf links tennis courts bicycle track all are there but all are more or less deserted sandbeach possesses every attraction of the modern seaside resort yet people for some inscrutable reason decline to fill its hotel or to occupy its apartments even in what is facetiously termed its season it is but sparsely populated 'tis a marine doctor fell and no man knoweth the reason of its unpopularity olive it was who had selected this dismal spot in which to pass her honeymoon her one desire was to have solitude no solitude deux but solitude absolute and complete her husband in no way interfered with her desire he sauntered about smoking endless cigarettes and scanning such samples of modern french fiction as came to hand every few days he ran up to town what he did there olive knew not nor did she trouble herself to inquire but she did notice that he invariably appeared highly delighted with himself on returning from these jaunts left to her own devices olive amused herself as best she could but she thought more of mallow that was consistent with her own peace of mind olive said angus one day at luncheon i have paid your first year's income in to your account thank you that is very kind of you replied olive cheerfully but was it necessary to pay in the whole amount at once no i need only pay it quarterly but as i wished to be perfectly free to handle the money i thought it best to get it done is it about the money that you have been so often up to london well yes i have been seeing after it and how is mr dimbal i have not seen him mr dimbal has nothing to do with the business now save in so far as your income is concerned my affairs are in the hands of another firm of lawyers olive was vaguely troubled of course i have every confidence in you she said but i am sorry you did not leave the business with mr dimbal he is so very trustworthy there are other honest men in london replied carson with his usual smile by the way how long do you intend to stay here we have now been exiled for three weeks i was thinking of going home in another fortnight or so if that will suit you oh as to that don't consider me i am going to london myself you surely do not mean to let me return alone you really must not think how everybody will talk carson shrugged his shoulders i do not care what they say he replied without the least show of temper to tell you the truth i am rather tired of this farce you refuse to treat me in any way as a husband you surely cannot complain if i betake myself elsewhere i thought our relative positions were quite clear said mrs carson coldly i married you simply and solely in obedience to my father's dying wish you married me well you married me i suppose for the fifty thousand pounds that went with me in other words our marriage is a bargain if you please it matters little what we call it a pleasant position for me said carson good humouredly his wife sat silently looking at her plate while he continued to eat his luncheon with the utmost indifference perhaps the position is a trying one for you she said at length but i dictated the terms of our union very clearly in the first instance you were perfectly free to accept or reject them you accepted them your reasons were your own no doubt they were good ones quite right ours is purely a business marriage or bargain we can call it that between ourselves if you were a different kind of man if you cared for me things might perhaps be different but you do not care for me you do not know what love is excuse me if i say that you are hardly in a position to judge replied angus quietly and are you not a trifle inconsistent if i loved you in what position should i stand seeing that your affections are very definitely engaged excuse me if in my turn i say that you are not in a position to speak as to that you may think so but i am not blind oh no it's too late in the day to talk of love i wish to do my duty retorted olive rather weakly it must be confessed you have done your duty said carson amiably you have obeyed your father and you have brought me fifty thousand pounds you do not love me neither do i care two straws about you then why did you marry me for the money solely he replied shamelessly i served your turn you served mine were i in love with you do you think i would rest content with the purely nominal position of your husband by no means for the money's sake i made you my wife i agreed to your terms because it suited me to do so have i ever gone contrary to you in any way no you fulfil your part of the bargain admirably she said scornfully then you can ask no more of me i shall not return to the manor house with you to hold an ignominious position our mutual ends are accomplished let us part do you intend to leave me then she asked feeling herself at a disadvantage i do i shall go to london perhaps even abroad at all events i intend to lead my own life but think of the position i shall be placed in think of the position i am placed in he replied emphatically people will talk if you leave me so soon after our marriage i must leave you to make the best excuses you can the position is of your own making you can say that my health is bad or that the doctor has ordered me abroad i'll pay you a visit every now and then to keep up appearances more you cannot ask of me more i am not disposed to grant olive rose and struck the table with her open hand i protest against your attitude she cried indignantly as i do against yours you are not treating me fairly she said keeping back her tears with an effort as fairly as you treat me surely if i agree to be your wife if i no he interrupted i prefer matters to remain as they are it is useless to feign what we neither of us feel having so far humiliated herself olive was not prepared to go further she realized that his position was every whit as strong as her own she could resent his behaviour in no way seeing that the original compact was of her own making dismayed at the predicament in which she found herself she retired to her room to consider what she should do finally she determined that should he leave her she would go to london for a few months mrs purcell was on her way to england and had expressed her intention of taking a house in london the old lady would gladly have her to stay with her perhaps she might even invite tui to join them she would blind the casterwell people at all events they would not know that angus had left her so soon it was the only possible solution she could think of that evening she dined in her room she had no fancy for a renewal of the discussion it could avail her nothing if her husband had made up his mind to go go he would all she could say or do would not serve to deter him silence was the only dignified course open to her so she brought to bear upon herself as much of her little stock of philosophy as she could muster but she had to confess it was poor consolation she felt lonely and very miserable later in the evening her maid came to her with a request that she might take a walk the girl was looking far from well and olive did not hesitate to let her go she had become attached to clara she found her a woman of refinement and capacity and withal respectful never had she shown the slightest inclination to take advantage of any favour olive might have shown her yet there was something strange about the girl which puzzled her mistress not a little more than once she had surprised her weeping bitterly and there were times when olive had thought she was unnecessarily jubilant olive had questioned her about these emotional outbursts but with no satisfactory result so in time she ceased to notice them the girl was always perfect in the performance of her duties she saw clara go out for her walk but no sooner had she gone than olive felt more restless and ill at ease than ever the atmosphere of the house stifled her she wished she had asked the maid for her hat and things before she went she felt she must give way to hysterics unless she did something she could neither read nor write nor could she sit still she felt she must get into the fresh air she put on her hat and cloak and went out the night was windy and rather cold but this suited her overstrung nerves rapidly up and down the esplanade she walked drinking in the keen air and watching the dark clouds drive across the sickly moon up and down up and down until her limbs grew weary and with her fatigue her excitement abated at last slowly climbing the steps to the top of the cliffs she returned to the hotel her way lay through a small shrubbery parted from the road by a slight iron railing beside which a gas lamp flared in the wind she could see a man and woman talking earnestly together they did not hear her as she drew near the man stooped and kissed the woman the next moment she swept past them wrathful and resentful she had recognized her husband chapter ii the brooch half an hour later carson sauntered into the sitting room he found olive awaiting him he had not seen her as she passed him in the darkness and was therefore at a loss to comprehend the full significance of her present expression he was at a loss to know why she was waiting for him she did not usually seek him at so late an hour however he opened the conversation in his usual easy going way hallo said he not in bed yet you'll lose your beauty sleep will you be so kind as to sit down replied olive coldly i wish to speak to you and on no very pleasant subject i should say returned carson taking a chair well what's the matter with a yawn have you no regard for decency angus as much as my neighbours i suppose how have i been transgressing by meeting that woman to night carson started what woman he asked irritably i do not know retorted olive with some heat i did not see her face nor would i have recognized her if i had your associates are not mine still i do not understand said angus composedly but seemingly relieved there are none so blind as those who won't see i was taking a walk just now and i saw you speaking to a woman under the gas lamp opposite this hotel dare you deny it i don't deny it why should i angus how can you be so shameless i saw i saw that well that you were more than friendly with her you seem to have seen a great deal sneered carson coolly may i ask what right you have to spy upon my actions what right the right of your wife pardon me you are not my wife he returned ironically you are my partner in a business transaction i thought we were agreed on that point once and for all when do you go to london again she asked to morrow he answered have you anything to urge against my going no i claim no right to control your actions i can only say that as you agreed for a large sum of money to act as my nominal husband you should fulfil your part of the bargain so far as to treat me with respect and how have i failed to do so by meeting that woman to night nonsense no one saw me but yourself and i must deny your right to call me to account in any way however that has nothing to do with my going to london have you any objection to that i would advise you to stop there i never wish to see you again the wish is mutual i assure you said carson rising in his turn i am glad that we have come to an understanding at last i will do as you suggest i think it very much better that you should our marriage is a very great mistake pardon me i do not agree with you it is surely an unqualified success inasmuch as we have both attained our aim but any blame there is must attach itself to you as much as to me you might of course under ordinary circumstances have had the right to object to my meeting a lady as i did as it is you can have no shadow of a right to do so at least you might conduct yourself as a gentleman whilst you are here returned olive bitterly but i suppose that is asking too much a great deal too much you can ask me nothing carson shrugged his shoulders this is hardly conversation he added at all events you must excuse me if i say it does not interest me as you say we had better part after i leave for town in the morning i will trouble you no more thank god said olive moving towards the door of her room at least i shall be spared the indignity of living with you allow me said carson stretching forward to open the door for her good night and good bye you contemptible cur said his wife disappearing and slamming the door behind her he smiled as he looked after her a cur am i it is lucky for you miss bellairs that i do not use my teeth more fully to substantiate your simile i could you know ah well drawing a long sigh of relief thank goodness that's over what a weary dreary time it has been however at last i can enjoy the fruits of my labours after all the money is well worth the trouble and mr carson proceeded to the bar to drink a toast to his release in a glass of lemonade temperance was one of his good points when olive rose next morning he was gone bag and baggage he said no word of farewell nor did he even leave a note behind him she felt immensely relieved yet she could not help feeling she had debased herself that her self respect was sullied it had been a fatal mistake but olive was not the woman to sit down with ashes on her head and bemoan her fate suppressing the fact that her husband had left her that she intended to explain personally later she wrote to miss slarge that after a further two weeks' stay at sandbeach she intended leaving for london i don't feel like returning to casterwell at present she wrote i would rather spend the winter months in london please let me know when you expect mrs purcell i am most anxious to see her when i am settled in town you and tui must come up that we may all be together she sent kind messages to mr brock and to miss ostergaard and she inquired if mallow was still with lord aldean miss slarge did not omit to answer this last query he was still there it was the greatest comfort to her to know that a few days later came a letter from mr dimbal which seriously alarmed her it drew her attention to the fact that carson had recently sold the securities in which her money was invested and transferred the proceeds to the crdit lyonnais in paris suspicious of carson's behaviour generally more especially when it came to taking things altogether out of his hands mr dimbal had made inquiries and had ascertained what he now wrote to olive she could not understand it at all and had she known his whereabouts would straightway have written to him for an explanation but he had left her without an address he had vanished completely out of her life apparently it was his intention that these funds should vanish with him probably the thousand pounds paid to her credit was all she would ever see of it the position was certainly becoming serious she recalled mrs purcell's letter and her description of carson she read over the extracts she had made with the result that she wrote again to casterwell this time of all people to mrs drabble that lady's reply roused the strongest suspicions in her regarding her husband and she felt the time had come when she could no longer cope with things unaided her first impulse was to call in the assistance of mr dimbal but on second thoughts she refrained the little jog trot solicitor was hardly the man to deal with a clever scoundrel of carson's type for scoundrel she now fully believed him to be there was mallow he was capable beyond a doubt and by his love for her had he not claimed the right to serve her in time of need she would write to him without loss of time the next day he was at sandbeach olive was in her sitting room when the servant brought up his name in the adjacent bedroom clara was attending to her work ah mrs carson he said he had schooled himself to say the name i am indeed glad to see you again but but you are not looking after yourself oh i am well enough really said olive giving him her hand but i am terribly worried worried repeated mallow sitting down near her worried what about before olive could reply the door leading to the bedroom opened abruptly and clara came in with a hat in her hand i beg your pardon ma'am said the maid but do you wish this hat left out from the packing yes of course replied olive astonished at her asking so unnecessary a question thank you ma'am the girl retired olive would have been more than astonished had she seen her a minute later the door was left slightly ajar and the girl's ear was taking in every word she could catch that young woman is still with you i see observed laurence yes she is a very excellent servant replied olive why oh nothing i merely remarked the fact said mallow who had his reasons for keeping his own counsel but to continue our conversation why are you worried i will tell you everything shortly meanwhile i want you to read this olive placed in his hands the extracts she had copied from mrs purcell's letter and pointed out to him one paragraph in particular mr carson has had golden wrist buttons made to match his unique bracelet wrought in the same style but of vastly inferior workmanship well now look at this she detached her brooch and laid it on the table it was a circular gold ornament carved with the three faces of the hindoo trinity encircled by a lotus wreath a handsome but odd piece of workmanship an indian wrist button said mallow looking at it carefully imitated from carson's bracelet no doubt i suppose it is one of those referred to by mrs purcell it is i am sure of it carson gave it to you no he did not it was a wedding present from margery drabble she told me it was her doll's locket i did not notice it particularly at the time but on reading mrs purcell's letter again it suddenly dawned upon me that it was one of carson's wrist buttons and how did margery come by it well i wrote to mrs drabble about that and she replied that margery had taken it from her father's desk on the mine is thine principle now said olive what possible connection can there be between dr drabble and my husband chapter iii clara's letter mallow stared at her astonished at the earnestness with which she spoke i am afraid i don't quite follow you he said at length of course carson knows dr drabble he met him at casterwell that is just the point was it for the first time he met him at casterwell i i suppose so but so far as i could see he was never very intimate with the man then why should he present him with a pair of gold wrist buttons said olive especially the pair he wore himself the pair he had made to match that bracelet yes that is strange admitted mallow it would be if it were a fact said olive but i do not for one moment believe that he gave them to drabble at all then how do you suppose drabble came by them that said olive is just where i am at a loss and where i need your help that is what we must find out but mrs carson one minute mr mallow am i mrs carson well i presume so you were married to him said mallow somewhat bewildered i was married to some one yes but is that some one angus carson mallow jumped up hurriedly you are not thinking of that absurd story i told you i am not that i think it absurd now on the contrary i am coming to believe more in the sense of it each hour no no said mallow i made every possible inquiry in london immediately before your marriage i visited athelstane place i questioned the police but i could find nothing absolutely nothing to connect your husband in ever so remote a degree with that murder besides look at the facts in his favour mr brock recognized him simply from his resemblance to his father and his appearance corresponds exactly with the description of him given by mrs purcell even to the wearing of his bangle i don't remember seeing him wear the wrist buttons said olive women you know are observant of these little things do you remember mrs slarge reading out her sister's letter in the presence of angus yes perfectly it was then carson showed us the bangle yes well i looked then for these wrist buttons but i noticed he wore silver sleeve links on that particular occasion perhaps but he never wore the others retorted olive again and again i watched for them this is the first i have seen and it comes from margery not from angus did you speak to your husband about it no as i say i was busy when margery gave it to me and i slipped it into my pocket without thinking it was only on looking at it again the other day that its resemblance to the bracelet struck me i wear it as a stud rather than as a brooch you see it has no catch pin well i think perhaps the best way would be to ask your husband how dr drabble comes to possess a wrist button so similar to his bracelet olive turned suddenly pale and hung her head i cannot she said faintly he has left me left you repeated mallow scarcely able to believe his ears why when nearly a fortnight ago it was not possible for us to continue living together i hated him and he did not care in the least for me it was solely for my money that he married me and now that he has it he has no further use for me we agreed it was best to separate i was glad to do so and this is the man you left me for not of my own free will you know i was the victim of circumstances i told you everything about my father's letter here it is read it yourself and tell me if i could have acted otherwise in silence mallow took the letter from her he noticed that her hand trembled in silence he read it through it was a strange letter and it had apparently been written under stress of great mental excitement the man might have been in mortal terror when he penned those lines the warning at the close was a very cry of anguish what do you say now asked olive i can say nothing we seem to move in a world of mystery you admit that i acted rightly i admit that you were forced to obey the letter answered mallow whether you acted rightly is not quite the same thing you are not just to me cried olive passionately i loved my father dearly he was always so good to me i should have been wicked to ignore so solemn a command had it been only a question of money i would readily have surrendered it all to mr brock but my father's dying wish i could not disregard it i could not i admit that said laurence reluctantly but what a miserable result it is olive covered her face with her hands i know i know she cried the sins of the father are visited on the children oh what can there have been in my father's life to make him sacrifice me so cruelly mr brock was your father's oldest friend he might perhaps know he does not know for i asked him the very day before this hateful marriage of mine he could give me no answer he could not understand the letter both in india and in england he said my father's life was above reproach yet there must be something mused mallow there are few men who have not a turned down page somewhere in the book of their life and as a rule it is not shown even to the dearest and closest of friends 'we mortal millions live alone' as arnold puts it well it can't be helped said olive despairingly there is nothing to be gained by probing the past but in the present we may be able to do something to return to those wrist buttons in the first place carson never wore them one moment interrupted mallow you must be quite sure of that before we can accept it as evidence of any value it is always possible he may have had them by him yet not have worn them whether or no he gave them to dr drabble is another matter you had perhaps better write and get mrs drabble to ask her husband that is exactly what i did but she replied that it was more than she dared to do you know she is frightened to death of him on the contrary she implored me not to tell him lest margery should get into trouble the man can hardly blame her for following his own teaching said laurence grimly he has been at some pains to teach her to look upon other people's belongings as her own naturally the child thought she was doing no wrong so mrs drabble won't speak to her husband well i must do so myself then when i get back to town have you the doctor's address there yes it so happens that he has been trying to enlist my sympathies towards his revolutionary projects he gave me his town address and asked me to call mallow took out his pocket book poplar street soho that's where he lives a veritable hotbed of foreign rascality no doubt well that disposes for the present of one more piece of evidence what else have you two days ago said olive i received this from angus producing a letter he said that he was going to london possibly even abroad he has evidently gone abroad for this is written from florence so i see said mallow glancing over the letter florence as an address is somewhat vague he fears i may follow him i suppose pray read the letter mr mallow laurence did so there were merely some half a dozen lines to the effect that the writer did not intend to return that he gave his wife her full freedom and apologizing for anything he might have done to distress her he is a bad lot said mallow in disgust still i cannot see how this letter is going to help you nor for that matter what doubt it casts upon his identity can't you see burst out olive why he wrote that himself and moreover he wrote it with his right hand i have seen the writing of his left it can be read only with great difficulty this is perfectly plain and easily legible yet when he was here he always declared his right hand was much too painful to use in any way yes i admit there may be something in it said mallow but might not some one else have written it for him perhaps that is of course just possible but i doubt it i don't believe his right hand was hurt at all he merely feigned its uselessness for his own ends but mrs purcell declared that it was useless she alluded to carson's hand this man i tell you is not carson i remember one day when we were out we climbed a slight cliff i scrambled up first on looking back i saw angus climbing up with both hands there were other times too when he forgot himself i have even seen him take his arm right out of the sling and use his hand perfectly freely when i spoke to him about it he always would have it i was mistaken i tried to get him to remove the bandages and show me his hand but his excuse was that the doctor had strictly forbidden him to do so no believe me mr mallow i am right that letter was written by the man himself and with his right hand carson is an impostor really that is very well argued said mallow puzzled but there are flaws however we can consider those later pray go on what is your third reason mr dimbal writes to me that angus let us call him that for the present has realized all securities and has placed the proceeds to his own credit at the crdit lyonnais in paris now the real angus carson would not do that i don't quite see why he should not said mallow but i admit of course it is strange still even so i find it difficult to believe the man is an impostor without more direct and convincing evidence he is i tell you he is replied olive resolutely i truly believe that man who was murdered in athelstane place was the real carson the right hand the diseased hand you remember was cut off no doubt to procure the bracelet for this impostor this man's clothes smelt of sandal wood a most unusual perfume so did those of the poor wretch who was killed the newspaper description of the dead man corresponds exactly with the man who calls himself my husband he never by any chance spoke to me of his father or of his life in india he never cared for me and was only too ready to part from me his only action of note since we were married has been to sell the stock and transfer the proceeds to a foreign bank where he can deal with it i am convinced mr mallow that he was not angus carson i go even further i believe that he murdered angus carson in order to impersonate him i am as sure of it as i am that well that i am alive and god help me i am married to the wretch olive became so agitated that mallow begged her to lie down do and say what he would he could not shake her conviction when he saw her somewhat more composed he left her and started off for a good brisk walk that he might turn things over in his mind it was quite dusk when he got back to sandbeach half an hour later and he would probably have failed to see a small white package lying on the path way he was in a narrow side street leading from the esplanade to the railway station as it was he not only saw it but took the trouble to stop and pick it up it proved to be a somewhat bulky letter addressed to jeremiah trall esq poplar street soho london mallow's instinct as soon as he read this was to drop it but the tall figure of a woman coming quickly round the corner arrested his attention he saw that she was eagerly searching for something she came up to him my letter sir she ejaculated hurriedly i dropped it thank you she snatched it from him and before he had time to recover himself she was gone clara trall he gasped thunderstruck shall i follow her no i have no right to do that yet the address of that letter is the address of dr drabble in london more mystery more scheming what on earth can it mean but it was many a long day before mallow found an answer to that question chapter iv more mystery for various reasons mallow had not taken up his abode in the same hotel as olive he had found a clean unpretentious little place near the station which suited him well enough in his present mood here he ate a solitary dinner cooked and served in thoroughly english style invariably fastidious over his food laurence was not now inclined to be any more particular about it than he was about his lodging he ate but little a good cigar and some strong black coffee he felt would do more for him just now than any food he inquired from the waiter how the trains ran to london for he had no doubt that on the morrow it would be necessary for him to use them curiously enough the waiter knew all about the trains notwithstanding the fact that he was an aboriginal as well as a waiter on'y two decent ones from 'ere to lunnon said this ganymede you'll see 'em sir in the time tables there's one leaves ten 'o the mornin' an' another at six at night you gits to lunnon in about three hours so yer see they ain't express like even then ten in the morning mused mallow ah that's a trifle too early i may as well have another day with olive to cheer her up the evening train will suit me i can see drabble in soho the next morning that is if he is in town mallow finished his coffee and cigar then he lit a fresh one slipped on his coat for the night was chilly and strolled round to the big hotel he was shown at once to mrs carson's sitting room he found her almost as much agitated as she had been when he left her oh laurence she said calling him by his christian name in her excitement how glad i am that you have come she has gone she has gone who has gone asked laurence pausing in the act of removing his coat clara my maid replied olive i cannot understand it at all she appeared perfectly content with her place and said nothing about leaving it was only when i sent for her to dress me for dinner that i found she had gone what can it mean it probably seems extraordinary to you replied mallow coolly but i confess i am not surprised your clara has gone to join carson olive gasped to join my husband she said incredulously what has clara to do with him that is what i should like to know carson has been in the habit of meeting this girl for some time past before you were married aldean saw them together but he carefully refrained from letting me know anything about it until quite recently i suppose he was afraid of what i should do to the scoundrel save under the present circumstances i should not have told you but as i have little doubt she has gone to him it is right you should know oh cried olive suddenly recollecting then she was the woman i saw the night before my husband left me i saw him talking with a woman quite close to the hotel i recognized him but her face i could not see yes it must have been clara the scoundrel murmured mallow there is clearly something between him and the girl she was probably a spy a spy on me for what reason semberry could probably explain that i understand that he was instrumental in finding the girl for you that's true a mrs arne whose address he gave me was anxious to find a place for her so i wrote of course in the usual way for her reference it was an excellent one and i did not hesitate to engage her so far as that goes she was a first class servant' she probably was no servant at all said mallow bluntly she had neither the appearance nor the manners of one even aldean noticed that by the way have you mrs arne's letter olive nodded i keep all my letters for six months before i destroy them she said rising i should have hers wait one moment i will go and fetch it mrs carson returned with the letter mallow read it through carefully but could gather nothing from it he noted the address amelia street kensington and commented on the firm masculine character of the writing mrs arne is evidently a woman of strong will and considerable character he said replacing his pocket book for all we know she may be mixed up in this plot plot echoed olive looking scared what plot well said mallow i can hardly say definitely there is certainly a plot of some kind sooner or later we shall know more about it at present we must be content to know its object which was undoubtedly to secure this fifty thousand pounds for whom that is the question carson semberry clara trall or even dr drabble they all seem to have something to do with it then you think there is some connection between my husband and that horrid doctor yes i do i must tell you that shortly before six o'clock this evening as i was coming home from my walk i picked up in one of the small streets here a letter dropped evidently by this clara of yours for just as i was reading the address on it she came rushing round the corner snatched it from my hand and flew off with it before i had time to do more than notice that it was she it is more than probable that she left by the six o'clock train for london no i don't think she went to london oh i see you think she has gone off to florence to my husband yes i think that and something more mrs carson the letter i picked up was addressed to jeremiah trall poplar street soho clara's father i suppose well it may be her father or it may be dr drabble poplar street happens to be the town address he gave me it would not surprise me in the least to find that in pursuit of his anarchistic schemes he found it useful to have well let us call it a nom de guerre but why should he take clara's name we don't know that trall is clara's real name retorted mallow mind you this is purely hypothetical jeremiah trall may or may not be drabble at all events the address is the same and soho is the hotbed of anarchism in london the possession of that wrist button by drabble seems to me clearly to point to some intimacy with carson the so called carson interrupted olive well we have not quite proved that yet the links of the chain run something like this mrs arne whoever she may be gives clara whoever she may be a character which is palpably false i mean false as regards her identity not her capability for that you proved to be all that was said for it from this fact we are justified in concluding that she mrs arne is in some way implicated i feel convinced myself that clara was not a servant semberry induces you to engage her that proves his connection and carson meets clara several times and clearly is intimate with her the wrist button would seem to connect drabble with carson and the soho address associates him with clara save the address and the wrist button which of course are substantial facts the rest is deduction pure and simple but it is logical deduction and to my thinking it points strongly to a secret association for some secret purpose between all these people the purpose i take it was to secure this sum of fifty thousand pounds but what makes you think that clara has not gone to london that letter replied mallow promptly it was very bulky i believed it contained a report of our conversation here to day clara was in the next room you remember how when she heard my voice she came in with an obviously feigned excuse i noticed when she returned to the bedroom she left the door ajar overhearing us of course she became aware of your doubts as to carson's identity she probably became alarmed lest you should go further and discover her connection with him that i think is the reason of her sudden departure whilst the very existence of the letter seems to me to show that london was not her destination had she been going there she need not have written it she could have called at poplar street soho and said what she had to say do you follow she has probably got out at some station on the way up and is now on her way to dover en route for italy olive passed her hand over her forehead it's all very confusing she said in a troubled voice and all very fanciful you might add rejoined mallow are you sure she has taken her box the chambermaid said so mallow shook his head we had better not rest content with second hand evidence when we can have first said he where is her room can we go and see oh yes i should have gone before but i have been so confused with one thing and another let us go and search it at once taking a lighted candle from a side table olive led the way along the corridor the room was not far away they could find no box there she must have removed it while i was out said olive in dismay i took a stroll shortly after you left my head was aching so oh what a wicked artful girl she is probably quite used to these fittings said mallow looking round the room hallo torn up paper in the grate we must look at this hold the candle a moment please mrs carson clara had not been fool enough to leave behind anything likely to betray her but one envelope which mallow found proved the truth of one of his suppositions it had an italian stamp on the corner and was addressed miss clara trall grand hotel sandbeach inghilterra my husband's writing cried olive as mallow rose and dusted his knees yes and from florence dated four days back look at the post mark this puts the matter beyond a doubt mrs carson your husband wrote to her to join him in italy she has gone to dover not to london but surely what can clara be to that man an accomplice certainly they returned to the sitting room mrs carson sat down looking hopelessly bewildered what are we to do now she asked communicate with the police no said mallow we have no facts to give them we know that carson has possession of the money but you must remember he has legal possession of it we know that he is in italy and that clara has joined him there is nothing there for the police is there beyond this we can say nothing not even that carson is an impostor but it will not be long now before we are able to settle that point mrs purcell arrives from india in a couple of days' time and a portrait of carson i have one interrupted olive he was so vain that he actually had some done by one of these men on the beach there were some copies in this room i dare say i can find them but tell me mr mallow what do you intend to do now whilst she was hunting for the photographs mallow explained i think he said i had better go to london and see this mrs arne then i shall look up semberry and after that well then i think i'll drop in on dr drabble in soho will you broach the matter directly no i don't think it would be wise to do that if things are as i suspect we have to deal with a dangerous lot i'll find out all i can without letting them have any suspicion that is to say from mrs arne and semberry as for drabble i intend to join him i shall become an anarchist become an anarchist echoed olive turning round the photographs in her hand yes it is my only chance of gaining his confidence i must do it if i am to get at the truth but you will bring trouble upon yourself oh no laughed mallow i shall stop short of throwing bombs i promise you oh it is dangerous said mrs carson sighing how can i thank you sufficiently for all the trouble you are taking here are the photographs laurence glanced at one it represented carson standing straight and stiff against a stone wall for all the world as if he were going to be shot it was not a work of art but the likeness was excellent mallow nodded as if he were well satisfied it will serve our purpose capitally he said putting it in his pocket mrs purcell should have no difficulty in saying if this is or is not the man she saw in bombay well mrs carson he added abruptly i must say good night good night what time to morrow do you leave not until the evening train six o'clock mrs purcell does not arrive for two days yet so i have plenty of time good night thus did mallow take his first step on the dark and tortuous way he was to follow it led him downward into an under world of crime and danger but he found some good even in those sordid depths doubt and mystery surrounding him holding his life in his hand on and on he went never flinching never yielding never losing sight of his clue until at last it led him to the truth the third scene in london chapter i mysterious mrs arne for a long time past mallow had been turning over in his mind the scheme of a new novel upon which he was most anxious to commence work but now that mrs carson had called upon him to aid her to the solution of the many mysteries by which she seemed to be surrounded he was obliged to put all thought of it from him with all the energy he could command he threw himself into the business on hand here was a romance in real life surpassing the most elaborate inventions of fiction it was his task to round it off to a satisfactory finish and this was not easy of actual fact he had but little to guide him neither could he hope to extract much from those chiefly concerned he was forced to grope his way in well nigh utter darkness only by the light of fresh material yet to be gathered would he be able to use to advantage that which was already at his command and of procuring such fresh material he saw but small chance at present here as in most things it was the first step which was so important he inclined to think that two heads were better than one from sandbeach he had written at some length to his friend aldean telling him all that had taken place there and how he had shifted olive's troubles so far as he was able on to his own more capable shoulders the result was that aldean came up to london almost immediately and presented himself at mallow's chambers in half moon street full of curiosity and anxiety to assist in the crusade against carson and company in substantiation of his belief in the old proverb mallow accepted his offer here was another head at all events if not an exceptionally brilliant one and so aldean took up his quarters at his house in kensington and prepared himself for an exciting time it is good of you jim said mallow at their first meeting i know you would much rather be at casterwell playing with amaryllis in the shade according to your habit amaryllis comes to london next week replied jim with something of a blush mrs purcell has invited her oh in that case your patience will not be put to so great a test has mrs purcell arrived yes she is in town now settled in a friend's house which she has taken over for the winter miss slarge showed me a long johnsonian missive in which mrs purcell stated she was 'elevating her shingle' in guelph road campden hill and how may i ask did mrs purcell translate 'elevating her shingle' into english oh i can't remember the old lady's long winded sentences but she is now in guelph road miss slarge with miss ostergaard comes up next week of course mrs purcell knows nothing of mrs carson's matrimonial troubles or i dare say she would have asked her too she must ask her said mallow hastily i shall call on mrs purcell and explain the circumstances it will never do for mrs carson to be left alone in her troubles take care mallow your interest in mrs carson may be misconstrued oh rubbish mrs purcell is a woman of sense i am sure so long as i keep my own counsel she can say nothing i want mrs carson to revert as much as possible to the condition of affairs before this unhappy marriage when all this mystery is cleared up she will be able to start fresh that will depend of course mainly upon the identity of this man carson said aldean nothing of the sort contradicted mallow sharply but wincing all the same whatever he is she is his wife there's no getting past that fact she may get a divorce carson's gone off with that girl quite so but he has not so far treated her with cruelty and well you know the idiotcy of the dc for heaven's sake jim drop mrs carson all right assented aldean i see your nerves are jumpy on that subject let's get to the matters in hand about this carson mess what do you think of it a big business jim a nasty painful business with a strong element of criminality it it of course it is all very vague and confused on the surface but beneath i am convinced there is a very orderly and well constructed conspiracy progressing mallow sat down and lighted his pipe now let us look at the facts he said there can be no doubt that semberry forced that girl on mrs carson as a spy carson too must have known her before he came to casterwell or he would not have been meeting her on the quiet so soon after she came there she overheard my conversation with her mistress in the sitting room of the hotel unfortunately it was not till i was about to leave that i noticed she had left the bedroom door ajar or i would have closed it however she lost no time in reporting what she had heard to poplar street which you understand is the same address that drabble gave me as his own that i consider brings him into the business then she bolted to join carson in florence that i think is proved by the envelope which i found in the grate of her bedroom these are the main facts and you really think that drabble is in the swindle i do from the fact of that address and also from this wrist button turning up so far as we know he could only have got it from carson that would seem to show that he knew carson somewhere before he came to casterwell presents argue a certain degree of intimacy that is one view said jim quickly but there is another if carson is a fraud you may be sure that it was the real man who was murdered in athelstane place the sandal wood scent forms a link between the true and the false well admitting that even then the wrist button must have passed through the false carson's hands to reach drabble we have nothing to lead us to suppose that the doctor had anything to do with the murder humph the papers said you remember that only a surgeon could have amputated the right hand so neatly that is a wild theory said mallow let us stick to the facts whoever carson may be you forget we have yet to prove him an impostor the one thing we are sure of is that clara trall was a spy do you intend questioning semberry about her no that would put him on his guard at once i shall go to amelia street and see this mrs arne the same thing applies to her surely no i shall merely call on mrs carson's behalf to inform her that clara left her mistress's service without warning of any kind and ask her if she can throw any light on her eccentric behaviour it is quite natural mrs carson should wish to know i shall thus throw the onus of any explanation on her she will only lie to you she may not even do that probably she will express her very great regret and confess her inability to understand it well of course that is probable i must chance it she may let fall something of value aldean put on his hat and coat so you intend to begin with this clue he asked dubiously well i think it is the most likely to bear fruit and what about the murder asked aldean mallow pointed to a neat pile of newspaper cuttings i am refreshing my memory on that point but for the present i think i shall leave it alone we have not yet anything sufficiently strong to connect carson with it that sandal wood is not enough i believe in going slowly and relying on facts only well old man good bye and good luck said lord aldean see you again soon and he took himself off to transact some small business of his own the same afternoon mallow dressed himself smartly and strolled down to kensington through the park without any difficulty he found amelia street it proved to be in the centre of a fashionable locality and its inhabitants were evidently people of wealth as he mounted the steps of no he could not help wondering at mrs arne's connection with the very shady matter he had in hand for the moment the clue did not look promising is mrs arne at home he asked the footman who came to the door mrs arne sir said the man with a stare i know no one of that name sir mallow felt a sudden shock of surprise at the unexpectedness of the answer but this is mrs arne's house surely he asked hastily no sir replied the man mr dacre lives here is mr dacre in demanded laurence after a few moment's reflection he is not sir mr dacre is at present out of town sir mrs dacre is at home sir in that case please give her my card and ask her if she will be so good as to see me for a few moments the footman departed and shortly returning conducted mallow upstairs to a magnificently furnished drawing room where he was received by a pretty though vulgar looking woman shrill of speech and horribly over dressed at a glance mallow guessed she had become possessed of unlimited cash late in life mr dacre had probably made a fortune in the rapid manner which is characteristic of our latter days and his wife was now in the throes of acclimatization to her altered circumstances in all directions there was copious evidence of a huge banking account mr mallow said mrs dacre assuming a dignity which suited her not at all and looking at his card through an eye glass yes i have taken the liberty of calling upon you to ask you if you know anything of a mrs arne who lived here mrs dacre looked at him in surprise i do and i do not know mrs arne she is hardly an acquaintance of mine i only know her as a dressmaker a dressmaker repeated mallow with a gasp she is not really even that continued the voluble lady pray be seated mr mallow mrs arne is in fact a person who goes out sewing she was recommended to me as an intelligent needlewoman by one of my friends as i wished some costumes altered i employed her for a few weeks is she here now mrs dacre oh dear no she finished her work and i dismissed her some weeks ago do you happen to have her address no indeed i have not what should i do with such a person's address i engaged the woman she did my bidding i dismissed her i am not likely ever to see her again may i ask this with increasing stateliness if this person is a friend of yours no i have not even seen her replied mallow hastily but a lady friend of mine in the country requires a maid and she heard that mrs arne had one for whom she wished to find a situation mrs dacre grew scarlet with anger absurd ridiculous she burst out why mrs arne was quite a common person clever with her needle i admit and quite respectful but the idea of her recommending a maid nevertheless she did so said mallow taking a delight in touching upon the weak spot of the purse proud little lady my friend wrote to mrs arne at this address and received this reply as mrs dacre's eyes through the medium of her double glasses fell on the letter which mallow placed in her hand she almost screeched my own paper she gasped the hussy she must have stolen it clara trall she recommends clara trall a creature of whom i have never heard as a good maid a maid oh and she herself a sewing woman too a common vulgar dressmaker mr mallow mr mallow what are the lower orders coming to that is a very large question mrs dacre at present perhaps we had better confine ourselves to this one do you happen to know a major semberry no i never heard of him did mrs arne ever mention him not that i know of but of course i spoke but little to her i will say she knew how to hold her tongue did major semberry know her i believe so at all events he gave my friend this address as mrs arne's and he a major too upon my word it doesn't sound at all respectable 'enry she lost her h's simultaneously with her temper 'enry shall know of this mrs arne recommending maids from our 'ouse on my writing paper mallow shrugged his shoulders he had got all the information he was likely to get so he prepared to take his leave mrs dacre was too intent upon her own grievance to attempt to stop him at the door whither she followed him he asked her one more question what was mrs arne like mrs drace can you give me any description of her appearance a dark foreign looking person with eyes always on the floor and a tread like a cat i think she was a foreigner for all her english never never shall a foreigner enter these doors again mallow bowed himself out stopping at the door for a word with the smart footman mrs arne was in this house for some time your mistress tells me how is it you did not tell me so i've only been here a week sir replied the man mallow gave him a shilling and went off a dark foreign looking woman he repeated strange again that is very much like the description the newspapers give of the housekeeper at athelstane place and semberry knows her and carson of casterwell is semberry's bosom friend humph i shouldn't be surprised if the murdered man was the real carson after all chapter ii mrs purcell after his interview with mrs dacre mallow's first impulse was to see semberry and tax him with the deception he had practised upon olive but he was not a man who gave way to his impulses he quickly realized that to do that at this stage would simply be to put the major on his guard plainly he was connected in some way with mrs arne and it seemed more than likely from the description of her given by mrs dacre that this so called dressmaker was identical with the so called housekeeper of athelstane place in dealing with people so astute and so dangerous mallow saw that his only chance lay in gaining their confidence in some way his next move must be to see drabble if necessary in the character of a convert to his views the doctor's vanity would be flattered and in his enthusiasm he would not hesitate to welcome him as a member of the band once let him become acquainted with the schemes of these anarchists and he might hope for much knowledge which by any other means would be unattainable the risk was considerable that he knew well for thus to connect himself with a set of fearless fanatics was to play with fire with a vengeance once the oath taken he was the tool of these ruffians if he broke it and that might be necessary for olive's sake he became their prey he had no fancy to be blown to pieces or to be stabbed in the dark but that was a risk he must perforce accept if he was to carry the thing through he decided to take it and affiliate himself with the brotherhood his mind made up on that point he found himself even looking forward with a certain thrill of excitement to the risks he was about to run plainly speaking he was a spy venturing into an unknown land of snares and pitfalls the least false step might prove fatal not only to his hopes but to his life however before actually involving himself he called on mrs purcell he was anxious to tell her all about olive and to induce her to take the girl under her protection for the time being he presented himself at campden hill one afternoon about five o'clock and was graciously received by the old lady with whom he was an especial favourite tui and miss slarge had already arrived and were established there as mrs purcell's guests but olive was still at sandbeach she shunned meeting even tui and miss slarge she knew that they would ask questions which would necessitate her explaining the invidious position in which she was placed they were still under the impression that her husband was with her and wondered why the happy pair did not return to the manor house on this point mallow preserved a judicious silence for the present though he had fully made up his mind to take mrs purcell into his confidence that would be necessary in order to enlist her sympathies for olive and to carry out his purpose the subject was a delicate one and would require careful handling a majestic female was mrs purcell with a haughty eye and a roman nose she was as stout as her sister was lean and was draped with funereal pomp in silk and crape and ornaments of glistening jet she moved slowly and spoke slowly and she modelled her speech on the best traditions of her hero dr johnson her looks were monumental her conversations ponderous she resembled the ideal britannia without be it said helmet or trident in domestic life she had flippantly been compared to gibbon's decline and fall and indeed there was something of the epic about her awe inspiring and stately she had never made or enjoyed a joke in her life pallas lady macbeth hannah more mrs purcell was a combination of all three mr mallow she said bearing down on the visitor with full canvas i am glad to welcome you to my temporary hearth with my sister as with the vivacious miss ostergaard you are already acquainted we expect lord aldean but for the time being our circle is limited as you observe mallow greeted the two ladies and how is your book getting on the authoress sighed only moderately well mr mallow she said wearily i am at present employed in identifying the etruscan lituus with the pontifical crosier and some of the accounts are so contradictory that it is not easy to reconcile them how is olive demanded tui irrelevantly is she well and happy is not that a superfluous question under the circumstances replied mallow evasively tui looked at him hardly or i would not have asked it on the contrary her letters give me a different impression i fear from them that she does not get on well with her husband tis difficult observed mrs purcell who had returned to the tea table for a newly married pair to live in complete accord with one another the effect of their respective trainings has to be taken into account and only the influence of time coupled with forbearance on either side can adapt the idiosyncrasies of one to those of the other olive has been reared in our island home mr carson has not therefore it is not unlikely that they experience some difficulty in blending their respective dispositions into one harmonious whole east is east and west is west said mallow and two parallel straight lines cannot meet let us hope that in this case judicious yielding on the part of each of these young people will create an exception to the invariable truth of that axiom mr mallow can i give you a dish of tea thank you mrs purcell ah here comes our mutual friend aldean entered he was welcomed by mrs purcell with all the pomp she considered due to a member of the nobility tui was joyous i thought you were never coming she said i see that it is out 'of sight out of mind' with you by jove i wish it were sighed jim i should be a happier man oh surely i don't make you miserable never mind it is misery i would not be without tell me how is major semberry good gracious lord aldean how should i know i have not seen him for years 'tis to be hoped that you will not again come into contact with major semberry said mrs purcell wagging her turban he is not a suitable acquaintance for a young lady no i am quite sure he is not assented aldean upon which tui at once took up arms on behalf of the absent major semberry is the most charming of men she declared with a pout the serpent rebuked mrs purcell is ever beautiful to the eye but unfortunately is possessed of noxious qualities which far exceed his beauty rubina in my letter to you i think i stated my opinion of major semberry from that opinion i have seen no reason to depart in plain english mrs purcell you consider semberry a rascal mr mallow i consider him a profligate and an undesirable acquaintance how dr carson came to entrust his son to such a man i cannot understand they got on very well together then the one or the other must have changed very much lord aldean in bombay mr carson was by no means friendly with his travelling companion his rigid sense of right and wrong did not allow him to countenance major semberry's laxity of principle you like mr carson asked mallow quickly my acquaintance with him was not of sufficient duration to enable me to speak quite so definitely as that but i consider mr carson to be an admirably conducted young man calculated to render any woman happy in the matrimonial state oh lor muttered jim how he must have altered well said tui outright i don't like mr carson at all i never did you surprise me said mrs purcell in her most majestic manner my judgment is seldom at fault and i considered mr carson when i saw him in bombay to be the type of all that is most excellent in the male sex the discussion had not the remotest interest for miss slarge indeed she had already drifted back to babylon observing vaguely that the great red dragon of revelations was the fiery serpent of chaldean worship she left the room to return to her beloved studies and mrs purcell was left with her three guests lord aldean was carried off by tui to a distant corner where she could torment him without fear of interruption and mallow at once seized the opportunity for a talk with his hostess about olive it took all mrs purcell's philosophy to hear unmoved his tale of carson's treachery mrs purcell said mallow plunging at once in medias res you are aware that i have known mrs carson for many years and that i take a deep interest in her welfare i am sorry to tell you that she is very unhappy in her marriage did she inform you of this fact said mrs purcell with some displeasure she did i received a letter from her asking me to go to sandbeach where she was spending her honeymoon on arriving there i found that her husband had left her mr carson has left olive yes he is now in italy and i believe with another woman you amaze me mr mallow i may say you pain me what is the meaning of this terrible state of affairs ah that is a difficult question for me to answer my only way of doing so is to tell you all that i have learned concerning mr carson and major semberry and leave you to judge for yourself that will be best mr mallow i shall then be enabled to deliver my unbiassed judgment thereupon laurence related all that had taken place since carson's arrival at casterwell and particularly detailed the steps which had led to the engagement of clara trall so you see mrs purcell he concluded she can hardly help being unhappy her husband has left her and has taken her money to spend it i presume on another woman she is now alone and worried at sandbeach i want you to ask her up here and take her under your wing she needs a friend you will be that friend you may depend upon my doing what is just and right said mrs purcell vigorously i will communicate with olive at once yes and i will invite her to come here that mr carson should behave so basely is a matter of the most profound astonishment to me i had read his character otherwise i can but ascribe this deterioration to the counsel and wiles of major semberry that is one way of explaining it said mallow taking out his pocket book but there is yet another and more conclusive one this is a portrait which mr carson had taken at sandbeach may i ask you to look at it carefully and to tell me what you think of it mrs purcell took the photograph and examined it this is either an extremely bad portrait or mr carson has altered sadly for the worse she said at length mallow felt his heart beating furiously in what way has mr carson altered he asked anxiously oh his whole expression is quite different mr mallow when last i saw him mr carson's face was replete with intellectual vigour he was sad and sombre too not bright and smiling as he is depicted here his moustache was very much heavier and he certainly was not so tall as this picture represents him to be it would not surprise you then mrs purcell if i were to tell you that this was not mr carson's portrait at all no mr mallow it would not at first glance i did not notice many things that appear to me as i look into it mr carson's face may of course have changed the circumstances of his life may have caused his expression to brighten it is possible too that his moustache may be of less luxuriant growth but i confess i do not understand how he can have become less of stature no mr mallow the man here represented is not mr angus carson chapter iii a private inquiry agent the same evening laurence had a long and confidential conversation with mrs purcell he made known to her all his suspicions and theories and the grounds upon which he based them she listened attentively to all he had to say then she read through the newspaper reports and once again scrutinized the portrait of carson taken at sandbeach she prided herself upon the possession of a clear head and a logical mind and she brought both to bear upon the case as mallow presented it to her she arrived at the conclusion that carson was an actual impostor and a probable murderer a stage further than that at which mallow had been able to arrive if you believe as i do that the man is an impostor she argued surely he must be guilty of the murder also else how could he have become possessed of the bangle and the wrist buttons but mrs purcell i cannot absolutely prove that he is an impostor even though i firmly believe him to be one sir said the lady in her most impressive tone our human judgments are fallible i admit but with such evidence as is before us there can be no possible doubt that the husband of olive is not the man whose name he bears she herself does not believe in him and her reasons are in every respect sound his dealings with her money for instance his silence regarding his early days in hindoostan his use of his right hand on several occasions when he forgot the part he was playing the letter from italy too is of great weight seeing that the writer of it also wrote to the woman trall that is proved by the handwriting which is in all respects identical the letter to his wife the man might possibly have dictated but the peculiarly private nature of that which he wrote to the girl makes it highly improbable that any hand save his own was instrumental in penning it moreover this is no left handed writing the letters are far too firmly formed the right hand of the man must therefore have been uninjured which again proves that he was an impostor now although i am not actually prepared to swear in a court of law that this portrait is not the portrait of mr angus carson yet i feel quite satisfied in my own mind that it is not for the reasons which i have already given you you make out an excellent case against him mrs purcell said mallow but it is only right to say that the man did know something about india naturally she interrupted he would obtain whatever information was necessary for his purpose from his friend major semberry then you agree with me in making semberry an accessory certainly you know my opinion of major semberry mr mallow he is a man utterly without conscience without scruple without religion he cultivates the most extravagant tastes while possessing means insufficient to gratify them to place himself beyond the pinch of poverty i am convinced that he would hesitate at no crime so long of course as he saw his way clear to avert the consequences well said laurence there is one method of throwing light on the matter which i would like to propose it is that you permit me to bring semberry here to you that you may tax him with this fraud to his face and in my presence by all means do so mr mallow you may depend upon my acting with all discretion in the mean time i will communicate with olive at sandbeach and invite her to come to me as soon as she can and mr mallow permit me cordially to thank you for the infinite pains at which you have been to place me completely in possession of the facts of this very terrible matter together we will go into it and see whether we cannot unravel what at present appears to be a mystery of the most complex order good night mr mallow good night good bye mrs purcell i am afraid we shall find our task no light one not light perhaps but not impossible and what is not impossible is always possible is it not mr mallow with this consolatory truism mrs purcell dismissed her coadjutor and addressed herself to the task of writing to olive she did not tell her how much she knew of her story but merely that she was aware of her husband having deserted her she invited her to come at once to london and urged the advantage of her being on the spot while affairs were being investigated mrs purcell rejoiced in her character of dea ex machin and poured forth pages of ponderous english such as would have done credit to the conduct of a political intrigue the rle appealed to her she imagined herself a true madame de stal mallow could have chosen no better assistant he got no sleep that night his mind was full of his projected visit to semberry in the morning he started off for marquis street but found that early as it was semberry had already gone out on business according to his valet though as to the nature of the business the man maintained complete ignorance leaving word that he would return about one o'clock mallow wandered about aimlessly until bethinking himself that he was wasting valuable time he determined to try his luck in soho and look up drabble he had no sooner turned into poplar street than he came face to face with semberry judging from his expression the major was in no very good tune it was more than probable he had been calling upon drabble and the interview had not been to his liking good morning semberry said mallow blocking the way i'm glad to see you morning he grunted and made as to pass a move which mallow soon thwarted i see you're in a hurry he said amiably so i'll just walk a bit of the way with you there is a friend of yours most anxious to renew your acquaintance very kind of him who is he it is not a he but a she mrs purcell of bombay as was his custom when nervous the major's fingers sought his moustache oh mrs purcell he said with a desperate effort to appear at his ease what does she want to see you and carson if you can bring him nothing to do with carson now better ask his wife 'bout him as to m'self no time to hang round old woman leavin' town mrs purcell will be very sorry said laurence smoothly are you going abroad don't know depends what makes you think so well i fancied perhaps you might be anxious to join carson join carson he stopped short and paled a trifle what do y' mean carson's on his honeymoon oh no he isn't retorted mallow carson's honeymoon is at an end has been for two weeks or more he is in italy now in italy damme how d'you know that well about a week ago he wrote to his wife from florence it would seem he has gone abroad to look after the money of which he has become possessed by his marriage what you don't tell me he's got the money with him i believe so mrs carson heard from the solicitor that he had sold the stocks and shares to a large amount and had transferred the funds to the paris branch of the crdit lyonnais with effort semberry repressed himself a string of forcible epithets was obviously on the tip of his tongue although he was probably aware that carson had left sandbeach it was evidently news to the major that he and the money were together on the continent seems carson and his wife don't pull was all he said i fear not said mallow coolly in spite of the old adage carson seems to have preferred the maid to the mistress what d'ye mean growled the major tugging savagely now at his moustache i mean that the girl clara trall has joined carson in florence it's a lie she wouldn't dare here the major evidently thought he had said more than enough for he stopped short i am not accustomed to be told i am a liar sir beg pardon mallow excuse slip o' the tongue and why should clara trall not dare don't know replied semberry uneasily shouldn't think a maid would dare clear out with her mistress's husband i am afraid clara is a bad lot major why did you recommend her didn't mrs arne did who is mrs arne friend o' mine snapped the major shortly 'scuse me must be getting on kind regards to mrs purcell see her when i get back and the brave soldier picking up his guilty conscience under fire of mallow's too searching questions fairly ran away mallow decided to postpone his visit to drabble he had gained nothing of value from his brisk little interview with the major on the contrary he feared he had given away a very definite piece of information for he felt convinced that an hour ago semberry had been ignorant of the fact that carson and clara were in florence he was fearful lest he should have aroused his suspicions in any way he might perchance act upon the knowledge he had just obtained mallow determined he would have him watched there and then he proceeded to a private inquiry office of which he had informed himself in case of need he asked for an agent to be placed at his disposal the payment of a sum down secured this without difficulty and in due course a personage said by his employers to be one of the cleverest detectives in europe was told off to serve him in appearance hiram vraik for that was the man's name might well have passed for one of the worst of the class he was employed in pursuing he was assuredly a most villainous looking creature he was exceedingly small and lithe as a ferret his face was white and pasty his ears were enormous and his eyes red rimmed as those of a rat his crop would have done justice to any prison barber he approached mallow with a cringing slimy politeness which coupled with his appearance made him doubly repulsive however argued mallow dirty work needs dirty tools i want you to watch a man he said when he had got vraik to himself in the parlour of a public house near at hand here are his name and address now listen and i'll tell you all about it yes sir it's best to trust me all in all sir if i know everything i can do as much as any man but if i don't well sir i may as well hand you back your money straight off as he proceeded to relate the details of the case to vraik the little man's eyes lit up and he became more rat like than ever it's a big job he said but i'm your man sir and if i get there with it i'll expect to be mighty well paid oh you'll be paid well enough i promise you that replied mallow very good sir i know what i've got to do and i'd better go and do it whatever this major does and wherever he goes you shall know i'll lose no time as soon as i've got anything to report whew the athelstane place business i am in luck and vraik wriggled himself off chapter iv one of us so at last you come to us roared drabble rubbing his hands as you see answered mallow equably though for me it is a leap in the dark never mind man there'll be plenty of light soon yes the light of infernal machines and incendiary fires i presume retorted the neophyte drabble rubbed his hands again and winked devilishly you shall know all our schemes as soon as you are fit to know them said he significantly when will that be may i ask of that madame death in life must judge oh i thought you did not know that lady nor do i in casterwell in soho it is quite another matter they were in a dingy mean room of the upper story of no poplar street soho a neighbourhood notorious for anarchists and pickles any longings after wealth were ruthlessly repressed here a deal table a few chairs a bookcase filled with revolutionary literature and fiery pamphlets in every european tongue and a ragged chintz covered sofa with a hard and suspiciously round looking pillow was all the room contained by way of luxury the dirty floor boasted no carpet or covering of any kind and the iron shutters by which the solitary window was protected and a brace of revolvers reposing on the mantelshelf added in no way to the cosiness of the apartment in all the force of blacklead and whitewash the walls displayed fierce denunciations of many things more particularly of the various forms of law and order dust was over everything and in the corners cobwebs abounded the triumph of anarchy was here again the apotheosis of the unwashed the worship of the sansculottes mallow contrasted strangely with these surroundings near him lounged the doctor sleek and pale and still clothed in his invariable black but this was not the hearty would be genial doctor of casterwell but a savage angry vicious anarchical doctor drunk with copious inhalations of the atmosphere around him the atmosphere of organized disorder of crime and ruffianism and bribery this was the real drabble he was at home here no one would have known him save perhaps his wife mallow as he looked at him found himself pitying her the sheer abandonment of the man revolted him well and how are the turtle doves getting on he asked vulgarly if you are speaking of mr and mrs carson replied mallow they have parted i believe and carson has gone off to italy h'm growled drabble as a matter of fact semberry told me so the maid clara has joined him i hear it is highly probable carson is a blackguard he is worse than that mallow he is a thief i understand he has gone off with his wife's money now it was quite clear to mallow that for wife's money he might with safety substitute our share of the plunder but for the present he must keep that to himself it did not do to be foolhardy especially at no poplar street so he gave the doctor no hint perhaps the word 'thief' is a trifle strong doctor was all he said after all it is more a question of conscience or rather lack of it than anything else no man with a spark of decency would have taken advantage of a position which gave him full possession of his wife's money by virtue of the mere fact of her being his wife blackguard my word is i think the more applicable he is a fool said drabble fiercely but let him take care i am not to be trifled with i wonder what trall will say to his niece bolting with carson oh said mallow recalling clara's letter then there is such a person as jeremiah trall of course there is he is one of us but how did you know him mrs carson told me remarked mallow carelessly clara used to talk about her uncle the fool muttered drabble i always said that girl was not to trusted not to be trusted echoed mallow then she too is one of us the doctor looked at him with something approaching a scowl your wisest plan he said is to ask no questions in this place but you forget i am quite uninitiated yet retorted mallow i don't care about committing myself to a definite course unless i am quite sure what i am about do you know what the jesuits do with their pupils asked drabble irrelevantly yes as a rule they make scoundrels of them rather say they make machines of them machines because they are blindly obedient to those set in authority over them that is one of their rules it is one of ours also once you join us you neither think for yourself nor act for yourself you become a machine and if i transgress once you have taken our oaths i don't think you will care to do that rejoined the doctor coldly if you do well i won't answer for the consequences are you a machine drabble no i am one having authority i direct others execute really said mallow and you fancy that a man of my capacity and experience will consent to become your tool understand then drabble if i join you i must know your ends your aims your ways and your means i also must be one having authority on no other conditions will i join you to speak plainly i do not quite see why you want me it is not for my money for i possess none it is not for my influence or my position for what i have of either is not likely to serve you i can only conclude then that it is in an intellectual capacity i am likely to be of use to you yet you propose to place me in a position subservient to your own no my friend and mallow stood up if it is a fool you want go out into the streets and choose if you want a man and a man with brains i am ready but i claim to be treated with the respect which is my due if you cannot assure me that this will be i must bid you good day sit down my dear fellow said drabble hastily you know one cannot generalize in these sort of things and that is what you have been doing i quite agree with all you say generally speaking but whether it will apply to you individually it is impossible to decide for the moment rest assured that you will have every opportunity of exercising your capacity ours is not a system of government under which the clever man is repressed government said mallow i always understood that no government was the very essence of your being a common fallacy replied the doctor dryly on the part of many who misunderstand our aims there is considerable method in our so called madness but madame death in life will explain all this to you far better than i can we shall see her very shortly as he spoke a distinctive rap came at the door and on the invitation to enter being given by drabble a tall bulky man shabbily dressed with a puffy red face entered the room his whole appearance was suggestive of alcohol in a severe form but at his first words mallow recognized that he was a man of breeding for the present he was quite sober and he appeared to be in a bad temper probably mallow thought as a result of his unwonted condition i beg your pardon drabble he said in a refined voice i did not know you were oh i am not engaged to the extent of excluding you said drabble sharply this is mr jeremiah trall mr mallow mr mallow echoed trall with a stare it was evident to mallow that his thoughts straightway reverted to the report he had received from clara a new recruit explained drabble looking at him sharply but mr mallow wishes to be quite sure of our aims before he finally consents to join us our aims are to make a heaven out of a hell said trall taking the third chair that requires strong measures necessarily replied mallow one doesn't clean stables with rosewater no our methods are a trifle more forcible than that chuckled trall when we try this new there there interrupted drabble that is quite enough we will not go into details just at present mallow could see even thus early that there was no love lost between these two the alcoholic man scowled angrily at the doctor and mallow made a mental note of his attitude he evidently stood in fear of his superior what is it you want asked drabble after having reduced the man to silence madame wishes to see you replied trall sulkily she did not know any one was with you i am bringing this gentleman down to see her very shortly said the doctor coolly you can go one moment cried mallow as trall shuffled to his feet have i ever seen you before not that i know of h'm your face seems familiar to me yes it is the face of a sot said drabble brutally not an uncommon sight i have to thank you for making it so stuttered trall savagely i should not be what i am had i not come under your thumb but take care i may be one too many for you some day this is not the first time you have threatened me said drabble take you care lest i make it the last you drunken hound clear out by the way did you get your letter from sandbeach asked mallow of trall as he slouched towards the door with fierce resentment in his eyes eh what cried drabble looking sharply from one to the other what letter oh merely a letter from clara saying she was leaving mrs carson answered trall hastily why didn't you tell me i didn't think it worth while everything is worth while that concerns carson rebuked drabble where is the letter you fool in the fire there were only half a dozen lines but how do you know that clara wrote to me added trall turning to mallow well she happened to drop her letter when about to post it i picked it up and naturally i saw the name and address oh well it was only a little letter a very little letter mumbled jeremiah and slipped out of the room little or big roared drabble after him you bring the next one to me come mr mallow let us go and see madame mallow followed the doctor along a dark passage and into another room in the front of the house here at a window overlooking the street sat a pale little woman with dark hair arranged smoothly in bands she wore a plain black dress without trimming or ornament of any kind her pallid face was bent intently over some wool work she was knitting she looked up when the two men came in and rose to her feet mrs arne said drabble graciously this is our new recruit mr mallow mallow turned pale and felt his heart beating wildly in this woman introduced as mrs arne he recognized the housekeeper of althelstane place chapter v madame death in life as mallow at drabble's elbow stared at the demure little figure clothed in black he realized that this was the fate controlling all things in connection with the affair he had in hand instantly he recognized in her the newspaper descriptions of the unknown housekeeper who had vanished so mysteriously and so completely from athelstane place by name she had just been made known to him as mrs arne and he now learned that she and madame death in life the notorious madame death in life who was dreaded throughout europe were one and the same person he was face to face with the terrible woman with the terrible nick name the stormy petrel of anarchy at the mere rumour of her presence in their city those in authority were wont suspiciously to look about them and doubly to safeguard their rulers the continental police would have given much to have had her safe in monte valerien or spandau or siberia hitherto she had always evaded them at the last moment had thwarted their most zealous endeavours and carefully laid plans she was italian by birth and had married an englishman she was now a widow and had made her husband's country her permanent home as she sat before him now so peacefully knitting mallow thought of madame defarge i am delighted to see you mr mallow she said in excellent english with but little trace of foreign accent i have been expecting you for some time you can go doctor but i want to you can go doctor repeated mrs arne in the same unemotional voice without another word drabble the bully stole out of the room mallow was amazed it is necessary to preserve discipline here said madame observing his expression pray be seated mr mallow if you do not mind i will continue my knitting i do not mind at all replied mallow seating himself mechanically he watched her firm plump hands clicking the shining needles together as she wove her web of red wool work she divined his thoughts you wonder at my employment she said without a smile it is very feminine is it not not quite in keeping perhaps you think with my reputation but you see i am turning fiction into fact madame defarge i suppose you mean she nodded a wonderful character in a wonderful book the 'tale of two cities' and your carlyle's 'revolution' are my favourite reading what times what people what glory i had rather work with guillotines than with bombs but with a shrug what would you we have improved on all that i speak your tongue well do i not excellently well madame you are never at a loss for a word i am never at a loss for anything my friend returned madame arne composedly but we must get to business tell me why did you look so fixedly at me when you entered the room madame your celebrity tell me the truth please well it was your name as a celebrity no as the lady who used mrs dacre's house as the means of introducing clara trall to mrs carson ah so you know of that you have been making inquiries why because clara has turned out badly and has gone off to italy with her mistress's husband quite so i know it from major semberry i presume is he too he is what i please answered mrs arne with an odd look we will speak of him another time so you are the man who is in love with mrs carson oh don't trouble to deny it i know it you made inquiries about me from mrs dacre on her behalf a man does not take up a woman's burden not a burden of this kind unless he has something more than a platonic interest in her welfare excuse me mrs arne but there are other subjects we can discuss more profitably as you please the subject has no interest for me but i may explain that i purposely went to mrs dacre's in the capacity of a dressmaker that i might answer mrs carson's inquiry from a good address i was determined that she should engage clara as a spy yes admitted the woman nonchalantly as a spy it was necessary that i should have carson watched but your spy has betrayed you so much the worse for her she shall die how or when i have not yet determined mallow shuddered the woman repelled him there was something uncanny in her bare statement of fact even a suggestion of the melodramatic would have relieved her assertion of its sheer brutality but there was not a tinge of it she merely stated that the girl should be killed and went on knitting you are not used to these things she continued death is as nothing to us to kill or to be killed we are always ready have you no fear gasped mallow of the law no of god that is a matter between him and myself ah well said laurence recovering his self control we had better perhaps avoid anything approaching a theological discussion but tell me one thing who is this carson why who should he be well he might for instance be impersonating the unfortunate man who was murdered in athelstane place mrs arne's hands never stopped her colour never changed you have imagination i see she observed coldly that is a pity it is apt to get people into trouble oh as to that i have trouble enough and now that i have determined to join you i shall probably have a good deal more that is very possible we are hunted like rats why do you wish to join us god knows said mallow with a shrug i also know it is because mrs carson will have nothing to say to you it is in your despair you come to us to throw your life away mallow breathed more freely now for the moment he had been unprepared he had no excuse ready he had relied upon the supreme egotism and enthusiasm of drabble to get over any difficulty as to his intentions but here was the most excellent of reasons already provided for him by madame death in life herself silently he acquiesced she saw in him the foolish lover rejected dejected yielding to despair mallow's silence convinced her she was right you do not speak she said glancing at him well there is no need for you to do so i am usually right in my conjectures we have to thank mrs carson for providing us with a promising brother mallow protested i am not a brother yet said he emphatically and before i become one i must ask to know your exact aims and the means by which you hope to accomplish them our aims said mrs arne laying aside her work we have but one aim to establish the equality of man the rich oppress the poor there must be no rich no poor no oppressed that madame is absolutely impossible arrange it as you will to day you will be where you were to morrow i think not replied mrs arne we intend that each person shall work for the general good and that he shall be paid by the state if he refuse to work then neither shall he be paid nor shall food be allowed to him in the midst of plenty he shall starve to death a somewhat drastic arrangement surely said mallow by no means it is an absolutely necessary one at any cost the lazy and the idle must be wiped out under such a rgime no man need starve whilst he is willing to work his life will be in his own hands and it is by the hurling of bombs and such like missives you hope to bring about your millennium mr mallow the world and its rulers will not listen to us so long as we are what those in power choose to call good citizens' the injustice the great wrongs under which we suffer now will remain unaltered if we are to be heard we must perforce make a hearing for ourselves supplication is useless hopeless by terror alone can we wrench the attention which is our right that is why we resort to force that is why you hear of bombs mr mallow for the safety of their lives even a king an emperor must heed us persistence in that direction will in the end secure to us the attention which we claim the attention which is our right that will be the dawn of the new era mr mallow for we shall conquer till then but there said madame resuming her knitting i have much to do i must leave you i will place you in the hands of an instructor from whom you will learn everything that is needful then you can come to me and say if you will join us or not i hope you will we want men with brains and money particularly money said mallow contemptuously he was not to be convinced by all her rhetoric i do not deny it we cannot have too much was it not a pity then to lose carson and his fifty thousand pounds we have not lost it or him yet said mrs arne with a long breath think you that italy is in the moon that my arm cannot reach him then you did intend to have that fifty thousand i did it was my scheme and to a point it has been a successful one in that case said mallow deliberately major semberry is with you no doubt without him you would have been helpless major semberry has not taken the oath said mrs arne coldly but he is one of us how does he reconcile that with his allegiance to his sovereign mrs arne knitted rapidly you don't know our power she said in every grade of society we have our adherents yes even in your army i was introduced into mrs dacre's house by a friend of the cause i am not a dressmaker but it suited me to assume that capacity for the moment i told semberry to give mrs dacre's address to mrs carson if i could not have got into that house i should have given another address mrs carson wrote and her letter naturally was given to me i replied and secured for the girl the position i designed for her a friend in society helped me there and there are dozens of people who can place me in any position i choose you don't know my power but enough of this she rose and pressed an electric button i will introduce you to monsieur rouge he will instruct you i have other things to do that personage was not long in making his appearance a mere spectre of a man was monsieur rouge with complexion hair and eyes of a painfully washed out hue a cadaverous lantern jawed unholy looking person in common with the generality of workmen of his nationality he was french monsieur rouge was addicted to dark blue he wore trousers blouse and peaked cap all of that colour he had a habit almost equine of blinking and glancing out of the corners of his eyes he was evidently a nervous man and seemed but poorly fitted for the bold and daring path he had chosen to follow mallow was surprised at his appearance as he was at the fact that mrs arne should have chosen him for his instructor but that lady evidently knew what she was about after a few curt and explicit directions conveyed to m rouge in his own tongue she introduced him formally mr mallow she said this is m rouge at least that is the name by which he is known among us he has been a member of the brotherhood for some three years you will find him a most enthusiastic disciple of our cause vive l'anarchie a bas les tyrans whispered m rouge in endorsement keep your enthusiasm for a more fitting occasion my friend said mrs arne as mallow thought with somewhat unnecessary severity go with this gentleman and tell him all that is permitted to be known by one who has yet to take our oath you turning to mallow will come to me when you have made up your mind for the present good bye or rather au revoir chapter vi another link on the whole mallow was interested in his anarchistic friends he possessed a goodly supply of the right sort of curiosity and this new milieu in which he found himself was unlike anything he had experienced before he was groping in an under world of fanaticism and crime premeditated and it fascinated him not a little he threw himself heart and soul into the whole question and in company with monsieur rouge explored many queer corners east and west for the time he made these people's cause his own they were a small minority determined ruthlessly determined on becoming a majority and he was curious as to the methods by which they intended to accomplish their end of necessity he was brought into contact with many creatures of low order creatures often needlessly ragged and unkempt he thought he could only conclude that their reckless condition was of value to them as a perpetual reminder of the terrible wrongs under which they suffered but to their fiery crusade against their better dressed neighbours and to their bloodthirsty plans for the removal of public buildings and public personages mallow lent a patient and ever attentive ear he was surprised to find their crusade directed against the aristocracy of intellect as well as against that other and larger aristocracy of wealth and caste it sufficed for a man to loom large on the horizon of public affairs be it as warrior orator or inventor for him to mark the bull's eye for their aim they were abominably indiscriminate in truth with this very aptly named monsieur rouge at his elbow ever ready with some fresh diabolical inspiration of his turbulent brain mallow could not help likening himself to a modern dante bent on the exploration of a new and more terrible circle of hell with a degraded virgil for his guide but though all very fine this was not war as the french say and mallow felt he was losing sight of his purpose olive was in london safe under the wing of mrs purcell waiting patiently to see what time and his endeavours on her behalf were to bring for her she had taken miss slarge and tui into her confidence but for her hostess she had reserved a somewhat abridged version of her recent experiences but with one accord all these ladies were consumed with feminine fire and virtuous indignation against her husband he was a downright impostor they declared and no doubt he it was who had murdered the unfortunate mr carson they were strenuous in their endeavours to induce olive to put the whole matter in the hands of the police but to this she was not to be persuaded although she went so far as to consult mallow upon the advisability of such a course he speedily convinced her that the case required a manipulation much more delicate than that which it was likely to receive at the hands of the police besides said he once let the police take it up and you will have all your details large as life in the columns of the morning papers to say nothing of the evening ones than which it is difficult to conceive a more direct method of courting failure if not disaster still i don't know that the straightest course is not the best course after all said olive judiciously why not bring major semberry face to face with mrs purcell and insist upon an explanation for two reasons first the major is keeping out of the way second he will lie like ananias to save himself from getting into trouble no mrs carson let my man continue to watch him and when he is caught tripping as he will be mark me sooner or later then will be the time to drive him into a corner can you trust this man vraik i think so i have promised him a large reward if he pulls the case through to my satisfaction and he is the kind of man to sell his miserable soul for money he looks like a being of the lowest type said olive who had seen vraik then he looks what he is it is a mere accident of course that he is with the law instead of against it but i dare say he finds honesty is the best possible policy so far as cash goes which is all that concerns him have no fear mrs carson money will keep vraik true to us if nothing else will unless these anarchists find out what you are doing and treat him still more liberally oh i'm not afraid of their find out laughed mallow mrs arne and he gang are by no means so clever as they fancy they are she particularly is blinded by her own egotism besides even if they did get at vraik they could not bribe him they want money badly these people in fact it was to your fifty thousand pounds they looked to put them in funds unfortunately carson we may still call him carson has gone off with the plunder do you think these anarchists will kill him as mrs arne threatened in the end no doubt but not till the money is safe in their hands at present it lies in carson's real name whatever that may be it is possible they may induce him to hand it over but it will only be to save his life while he has that money he is safe enough it would not serve them to kill the goose with the golden eggs these people may not be so clever as they imagine but they are not fools enough for that mr mallow i tremble when i think of the dangers to which you are exposed don't these wretches suspect you no that is one of them does jeremiah trall looks queerly at me at times because he has read clara's report of our first conversation i fancy he is suspicious that it is something more than zeal for the cause that has caused me to join but he is safe enough he hates drabble and has told him that the letter is burnt he is not likely to trouble me besides he is i think but a very lukewarm member of the brotherhood i don't trust any of them nor i but i am safe so far and they are not likely to give vent to any of their explosive propensities here in london and so run the risk of being turned out of the only country in europe which shelters them but i must be off mrs carson rouge is waiting for me round the corner oh laurence do take care of yourself implored poor olive anxiously be sure of that for your sake and mallow left the house sighing to think that he had now no right to say even so much to olive whosoever carson was olive was his wife and yet he started as the thought crossed his mind was she his wife was it not possible her marriage might be illegal if the man were an impostor he had not made her his wife under his real name marriage under a false name is no marriage surely by jupiter i'll lose no time in taking dimbal's opinion about this muttered mallow to himself there may be some way of releasing her from that scamp's clutches after all but the money will have to go well let it go she will gladly pay even fifty thousand pounds for her freedom round the corner that is to say in the back of a convenient little public house m rouge the devil's advocate was waiting for mallow it was late after seven o'clock and laurence needed no clock to tell him it was dinner time but that day he had received a note from rouge begging for an appointment at this especial hour he felt obliged to keep it lest the man might wish to say something important as colourless and shrinking as ever rouge stood up cap in hand when laurence entered i am glad to see monsieur he said in french is it that monsieur is aware that madame desires he should come to the great meeting next week no replied mallow carelessly what for rouge spoke again in the husky whisper he usually affected and looked steadily at laurence it is to take the oath he said laurence winced rouge saw his momentary hesitancy and smiled in that uncanny fashion of his which often caused mallow to think he was not quite right in his head it is not too late if monsieur is afraid said he with a shrug and a sneer monsieur is not afraid retorted mallow sharply but monsieur is wise enough to consider all things before committing himself past recall when does the meeting take place on wednesday next monsieur that is a week hence where in the cellar of the house in poplar street monsieur in the cellar repeated mallow much surprised will that be large enough rouge laughed oh monsieur does not know all the holes in which we foxes hide holy blue it must not be that he know before he swears to be true for he might speak to the police the wretch's expression was feline as he whispered the last word but this cellar it is a great one c'est norme madame had it made madame preferred it if the police came piff paff whirr houp l he pointed upwards i see we dance on a volcano said laurence uneasily rouge nodded we would all die the best and the worst sacrifice your own lives yes and those of others monsieur when we take the oath we are already as dead let monsieur reflect monsieur has reflected said laurence giving the man money i shall be at poplar street next wednesday at what time nine of the evening it will be a great meeting a grand meeting and monsieur will take the oath mallow nodded yes monsieur will take the oath he repeated and after a second inquiring look rouge with the money in his pocket glided out of the room the cat like movements of the man his glistening eyes and sibilant whispers inspired mallow with nothing but repulsion still he was kind to him and knowing the poor wretch often went without a meal frequently gave him the price of one whether rouge was grateful mallow knew not but he gave no sign of gratitude and watched the young man unceasingly he never told him his real name nor spoke of his past in any way his conversation for the most part consisted of extracts from revolutionary pamphlets imprecations upon those in power and expressions of jubilation for the day when a tide of blood should roll over europe to mallow he was a veritable creature of nightmare on leaving this red hot destroyer of human civilization mallow walked quickly to his lodgings in half moon street the walk did him good it cooled his blood and cleared his brain as he passed by hyde park he noticed he was being followed a man was dogging him like a shadow pausing when he paused and following him steadily at no great distance brave as he was mallow felt a qualm he wondered if the anarchists suspecting him of treachery were having him watched he felt that suspense was worse than danger so he determined to right about face and know the worst at once he turned up a side street for half a dozen yards then he faced round and walked back by this manoeuvre he almost ran into the arms of his follower jeremiah trall exclaimed mallow recognizing him in the lamplight what do you want why are you following me trall looked round swiftly and beckoned mallow into the comparative darkness of the side street i wish to speak with you privately he said in his refined voice i am afraid of being watched come to my rooms then no replied trall they would follow my life would not be safe better here he led mallow up some distance into a gloomy corner mr mallow he said sinking his voice why are you joining us what is that to you asked mallow fencing you have some scheme in your head and i wish to know it you are no true anarchist you don't care two pins about the cause mallow reflected the man might be trying to trap him into some incautious speech duly to be reported to mrs arne trall guessed the cause of his hesitation and laughed you may as well tell me he said i know so much about you that i may as well know the rest what do you mean trall that letter of clara's she reported to me all that passed between you and mrs carson you are bent on dissolving that marriage and getting back the money well suppose i am i can do that and still be true to the cause no you can't mr mallow carson was married to miss bellairs to get that money for the cause then the husband of miss bellairs is not really carson no he is not he is a tool in the hands of this infernal drabble as i am what is this man's name his real name asked mallow i don't know i swear i don't know hush i can't go on speaking to you here they have spies everywhere but i just want to tell you that no one but myself read that letter and that it is in the fire i know you are not in earnest for the cause and i am glad of it and why may i ask are you glad of it you are one of them i am not denied jeremiah fiercely i am a drunken fool under the thumb of drabble i wish to god the cause was at the bottom of the sea and drabble kicking his heels in gaol or the scaffold if i could only get him there i had a position once mr mallow i am an outcast now solely through drabble who has been the curse of my life he treats me like a dog but a dog can bite and bite him i will when he least expects it he has ruined me he has brought my niece clara into his cursed schemes she too is under his thumb oh my god if only you knew my life's history you would pity me some day i'll tell it to you if only to show you how lost a man can become body and soul drabble is a devil curse him hush don't speak i'll go i'll go i only wanted to tell you that the secret of your real intentions is quite safe with me if you can ruin drabble and with him that stony hearted jezebel do it do it i say tread them under foot make them suffer as i have suffered as they have made me suffer trall gripping mallow's hand shook it violently and disappeared round the corner of the street mallow was too much astonished to follow him he walked on home almost at his doorstep a hand was laid upon his arm he turned to see the villainous face of vraik smirking at him i've come to report sir whined the spy i've seen major semberry in conversation with a light haired light bearded man who is he francis hain sir the man who was concerned in the murder i'm sure of it chapter vii an unexpected meeting francis hain stammered mallow amazed impossible you must be mistaken you have never seen francis hain vraik rubbed his hands and leered that's as true as true he croaked but if i ain't seen 'im other people 'ave when you told me as 'ow you thought as all this business was mixed up with the murder i went and saw the landlord and all them tradespeople in and about athelstane place from the description i got of hain i know 'im as well as i know my own partner i follered that major cove all these days till i'm fair worn out and when i saw him talkin' to a light 'aired man with a beard as long as yer arm it didn't take me long to recognize hain i tried to sneak up close and listen but they got their matter done and parted afore i could hear a word where did you see them in poplar street and when they parted you followed one of them which that major cove of course didn't you tell me to keep an eye on 'im mallow was annoyed i wanted you to use your own discretion he said you should have tracked down hain and handed him over to the police i didn't like to do that without orders whimpered vraik you see i 'adn't got no orders so far as he was concerned h'm well of course it is possible the man may not be hain after all well if 't'aint it's 'is twin goin' by the description said vraik with emphasis but you just ask the major cove about him i intend to but i'm pretty certain that the major cove as you call him won't tell the truth you let me tackle him mr maller and i'll soon screw it out of 'im no said mallow sharply i'll call on him myself you continue to watch major semberry until i have seen him but if you should chance to meet hain again give him in charge i'll take the responsibility oh as long as you do that i don't care i'll just get back to marquis street and keep an eye on the major cove but it's hard work sir and precious dry here's half a sovereign said mallow tossing him the coin don't get drunk on it vraik slipped the piece into his pocket with a grin lord bless you sir i weren't born yesterday i'm square i am and he slunk away in the darkness leaving mallow more than a trifle disgusted at being obliged to come into contact with so degraded an animal the various side paths along which mallow had so carefully travelled began now to show signs of convergence they were pointing clearly to one principal highway and that promised to lead directly from soho to athelstane place but in no way did he lose sight of the fact that if at all possible the capture of the money itself was greatly to be desired that was an additional reason for refraining from putting matters into official hands for in that event fearful of extradition the pseudo carson would probably cease to affect florence as a place of residence on the contrary as likely as not he would decide to place a considerable expanse of water between him and it he decided it would be best at once to force from semberry a complete confession if possible always duly heedful of course of that gentleman's anarchist connection and consequent powers it would be necessary to be more than ever circumspect next morning therefore he proceeded to marquis street st james's he found his warrior busy with the consumption of his morning meal his reception was he thought unusually cordial had he known it the major's first impulse had been to refuse to see him but second thoughts had prevailed he determined it would be best to brazen it out in the face of danger the weak brain is ever cunning thus it was that mallow's reception was sufficiently jovial and hearty to have disarmed his suspicions entirely but they were on too solid a foundation for that and though outwardly reciprocative he was every bit as alert as the major mornin' said semberry shaking hands with his visitor you're out early had breakfast yes thank you i must apologize for calling at so unusual an hour but the fact is i want to consult you about carson nothin' to do with that chap now said the major wagging his head he has gone his way i go mine and your way i perceive is also italy said laurence whose keen eyes had not failed to see a cook's tourist ticket lying open on the table at lucerne to chiasso semberry had overlooked it he was somewhat disconcerted but he hastened to make the best of a bad job yes just goin' there to see carson said he sweeping the tickets into the pocket of his smoking coat as matter of fact promised to take a box over for him oh is it a sandal wood one how the how do you know he has a sandal wood box why easily enough he explained as much to mrs carson when she asked him why he had that everlasting smell about him so you intend taking the box over yourself do you you are indeed a good friend major the major was not appreciative of his position but he replied bluffly enough goin' for m' own sake carson owes me money not likely to see it unless i go m'self carson's a bit of a rogue you know are you sure he isn't somewhat more than 'a bit' major are you quite sure he is angus carson course i am who else would he be said semberry with an admixture of indignation and ignorance in equal parts oh don't ask me replied mallow carelessly only it was strange was it not that mrs purcell should say the picture taken at sandbeach did not represent her friend mr carson of bombay bad likeness perhaps growled semberry he was really uneasy now on the contrary it is a very good one of the man who married miss bellairs angus carson if you like to call him so semberry jumped up with a scowl do you mean to insult me doubt m' word he said savagely carson's been with me since his father died didn't lose sight of him till marriage 's matter fact don't 'prove the way he's treated wife that's another reason i'm goin' italy to bring him back and see things square before i return t'india if you can do that major you will be extremely clever but i doubt very much your being able to persuade this stray lamb to return make him if only to prove you and mrs purcell wrong oh i i have nothing to do with it carson may be the great cham for all i care but mrs purcell will not be so easily satisfied you know her rather interferin' old cat that she is says carson isn't carson does she what the deuce does the woman mean you had better ask her semberry and settle the matter offhand i'll ask her said the major furiously what's more i'll bring back carson himself to give her the lie hang it she reflects on m' honour as an officer and gentleman oh you know what ladies are replied mallow laughing but observant once get an idea into their heads and there is no getting it out again mrs purcell on the authority of that portrait declares that the man who married miss bellairs is not carson an idle theory of hers if you will but one she is bent upon proving she can't contradicted semberry testily man is carson right enough i ought to know and i say so will bring him back i tell you just to prove it whole thing's silly nonsense mallow yawned dare say doesn't interest me in the least i am sorry for mrs carson and i think she has been disgracefully treated but i should like if possible to see her husband return to her however as you are going over to fetch him i have no doubt that will arrange itself didn't intend to fetch him grumbled semberry but will now just to shut up mrs purcell can't afford to play the doose with m' reputation when i'm in the service carson's box is here if mrs purcell would like to see it now a sight of this precious box and its contents would mallow felt be very acceptable but he could not say so without rousing semberry's suspicions in such a position many a man would have jumped at the major's offer and have brought mrs purcell to marquis street but mallow knew better of all things caution was most essential he merely laughed oh i'll tell mrs purcell if you like said he affably i don't think it's the box she wants to see so much as the man why not call on her before you leave what's the use she would not believe me i'll bring back carson i tell you and he can shut her up himself i ain't going to argue with mrs purcell well perhaps she is rather a difficult subject major when do you go to morrow night train ah well pleasant journey by the way who was that fair chap you were talking to yesterday the man i saw you with in poplar street excuse my asking but i can't help thinking i know him the major started and looked searchingly at mallow who remained unmoved oh a friend of mine ics man he answered carelessly why oh nothing i fancied he was a doctor i had met somewhere doctor repeated semberry nervously no he's not a doctor civil engineer he builds bridges of sorts you don't know him he's been india way these last twenty years ah strange too i am convinced i know him said mallow rising just shows how apt one is to confuse faces i could have sworn he was a doctor well i must be off shall i take any message from you to mrs purcell no you can tell her if you like that i'm going to bring back carson said the major grimly and if i don't prove he's the man he says he is she can write to the war office and say i'm a swindler have a peg before you go no thanks too early for strong waters good day day replied semberry curtly accompanying mallow to the door when his visitor was fairly off the premises the major drew a long breath and returned to his breakfast time i got off he muttered wonder what the chap's driving at i was a fool to leave those tickets about but who'd ha' thought he'd have spotted them who'd ha' thought o' seeing him now for the matter o' that in the street mallow was looking for vraik he knew he was somewhere not far off shortly he espied a ragged pavement artist at work on a series of glaring presentments in coloured chalk within sight of the major's door mallow strolled across the road to drop a copper into the man's hat as he did so he spoke hurriedly the major's leaving town to night or to morrow watch him charing cross or victoria and wire to my rooms at once when he goes i'm fly said the pavement artist with a grin and mallow satisfied that semberry was under proper surveillance went his way easy in his mind round the corner as fate would have it he ran almost into the arms of a stout elderly gentleman in black oh my dear sir my dear sir protested the stranger puffing you knocked the wind out of me why it's mr mallow mr brock said mallow recognizing the vicar who would have thought of meeting you here surprising indeed said brock shaking hands but i'm on my way to see major semberry perhaps you can tell me where is marquis street mr mallow just round the corner so you are visiting the major my dear young friend i wish to speak with him about angus carson with pain and grief i have heard of this terrible trouble between my old friend's son and olive i have thought it possible that major semberry might use his good offices to bring about a reconciliation' i'm afraid that is beyond the major's power sir said mallow shaking his head was it mrs purcell who told you of this separation it was i received her letter two days back and came up as soon as i could i have not yet seen olive i decided i would see the major first this very painful matter must be settled mrs carson is not to blame mr brock her husband alone is at fault so mrs purcell said said brock solemnly dear dear angus is not behaving in the way his upright father would have had him behave his father h'm said mallow wondering if it would be wise to tell brock that carson was an impostor on second thoughts he decided to hold his tongue the open street hardly lent itself to explanations of the kind he suggested that the vicar should call on mrs purcell after he had seen semberry certainly it is my intention to do so mr mallow we will put our two old heads together and see what we can do good day good day and brock trotted off chapter viii the light haired man when mallow returned to his rooms he found lord aldean seated in his most comfortable arm chair his expression was extremely thoughtful and withal a trifle anxious polyphemus as laurence sometimes called him in allusion to his size was not usually given to a gentle melancholy mallow could only conclude there must be something wrong with the boy you here jim said he throwing hat and gloves on a near table what is the matter with you man you look as miserable as an owl mallow you lack the delicacy of perception necessary for the correct understanding of the feelings of a man in my condition besides your simile is rude oh i see miss ostergaard has been crushing you as usual on the contrary she is particularly amiable that ought to encourage you it does said aldean miserably so much so that i have made up my mind to propose to her this very day one would think you had made up your mind to be hanged from your expression why so dejected mallow i know what fear is now my heart is in my boots is it then you had better reinstate it before you go on your knees what are you afraid of you jackass miss ostergaard won't eat you she might say 'no' groaned the wretched jim he paled at the bare idea of so terrible a catastrophe she might on the other hand say 'yes' replied mallow consolingly come polyphemus you needn't go out in a coach and four to meet your troubles look at mine they come right to my very door confound them mallow you don't know how fond i am of that girl i must indeed be dull of understanding then said he for you have endeavoured to bring me to a very clear comprehension of your feelings upon several occasions cheer up old man he clapped jim's broad shoulders you have every chance of success the girl's in love with you do you really think so said jim brightening then with a deeper groan no no she is always teasing me of course she is but it is only her way some women are like that especially when in love you must interpret them contrariwise like dreams you know in that case i may hope yes hope and put your fortune to the test also if you think you are in a fit condition to do so answer me a question what is it asked aldean accepting a cigarette do you put love before friendship well er no that is not your friendship you do not seem very certain on the point said mallow dryly however i am about to ask your aid at present i cannot leave london i am too heavily involved with these anarchists and i must remain on the spot to watch mrs arne and drabble now i saw semberry this morning and learned thanks to his carelessness in leaving tickets about that he is off to italy i want you to follow him there and watch his little game with carson oh i'll go of course said jim with rather a long face but how do you know semberry is going to carson because that blackguard is in italy moreover i told semberry about mrs purcell's assertion that the man who married olive is not carson it is now the expressed intention of our good major to bring back his friend and as he says put his identity beyond doubt do you believe him no jim i do not semberry funks mrs purcell he knows perfectly well that the man is an impostor he is simply going over to italy for the purpose of securing his share of the plunder then he will slip down to naples or brindisi and board the next out going liner for india where he hopes to be safe this is why i want you to hang on to his tail and stop him clearing out i'm your man mallow but i don't see how i can stop the beggar without a warrant oh a warrant is out of the question besides you can frighten him without that interview this scamp who calls himself carson and get the truth out of him if you can of course i can't exactly forecast events for you but you must use your common sense you have plenty of it you know at a pinch if the major tries a bolt tell him you will communicate with the war office in fact threaten him with the most merciless exposure but i can't do that i can said mallow with decision there is a man called trall who can prove that the fellow whom semberry introduced as carson is a fraud and i hope also when i get the evidence to prove that the real carson was murdered in athelstane place with semberry's connivance tell him this i don't think you will find him refractory then he is only the more likely to skidaddle i should think in that case he'll have to chuck the army said mallow if the war office communicates what i know to semberry's colonel he will not only be cashiered but brought back to england under arrest however as i say i can't foretell events you must use your discretion i'll do my best said jim feeling his muscle as though the question were best settled that way when does semberry start either to night or to morrow he says to night but i don't trust him i have that man vraik watching him and as soon as he clears a wire will be sent here if i am in when it comes i'll advise you but in any case come round and keep a look out for it yourself open it open any letter i have no secrets from you but won't you be in this evening perhaps yes perhaps no i can't say i have heard from vraik that the man hain who was concerned in that murder is hanging round poplar street he was seen talking to semberry yesterday i must watch for him so if i'm not back when you receive the wire don't wait for me start straight away for italy lose no time go by the same train if you can or follow by the next it's a case of life or death jim you can depend on me said jim shaking mallow's hand i'll hang on like grim death if he gets away from me he'll be a smarter man than i take him to be but i say mallow don't you get into trouble with these beastly anarchist chaps they're a queer lot you know no fear my boy i know them if i should get into any mess however for accidents will occur look up vraik at the private inquiry office i told you about he knows trall and trall is my very good friend he hates drabble and will help me so far as he is able in any little difficulty i understand said jim with a nod my poor polyphemus this will put an end to your courtship lord aldean looked somewhat rueful i am not likely to be away more than a week or so am i and i dare say tui will still be free when i get back oh you call her tui now do you laughed mallow in my own mind i do not to her face that will be a pleasure to come seriously jim i am greatly obliged to you for your readiness to help me believe me i shan't forget it oh that's all right mallow our friendship is more than a name i hope said jim with another shake of his whilom tutor's hand he then took his departure in be it said a considerably more cheerful frame of mind that same afternoon mallow walked as far as soho with the intention of seeing mrs arne and telling her that he had decided to take the oath as a matter of fact he had not but as there were eight days to the time appointed for his installation he hoped that something might turn up in the interval which would render it unnecessary for him to go so far it was four o'clock when he arrived in the neighbourhood of soho the sky was growing darker every minute but there was still light sufficient to distinguish the passers by at the entrance to poplar street he was passed by a man walking swiftly a tall fair bearded man who looked neither to right nor left but raced on breathlessly towards no instinctively mallow guessed this was his enemy francis hain to a certainty he muttered under his breath light hair light beard tall thin the exact description given in the papers will he enter no at no surely enough the man pulled up and admitting himself evidently with a latch key disappeared within mallow's hot blood was at boiling point here was the wretch who had murdered the unfortunate carson within his grasp heedless of the danger he was running he knocked at the door of no it was opened almost immediately he had given the signal knock which rouge had taught him the door keeper recognized him at once and the next minute he was standing in the dark passage of that dangerous den where is the gentleman who entered just now he asked the door keeper breathlessly upstairs he goes to see madame replied the man who had no idea that anything was wrong mallow had given the signal and his face was known to him the door keeper was quite easy in his mind up the narrow stairs mallow sprang two at a time reckless and full of fierce courage he was determined to face hain and wring the truth from him at all costs caution wisdom fear all went to the four winds the hot irish fighting blood fizzled through his veins burned in his cheek rash and unthinking he dashed forward with a courage absolutely blind the courage which wins or loses all on the first landing he caught a glimpse of a tall figure he heard the click of a turning door knob the next moment mallow the hero mallow the fool had flung open the door and stood on the threshold of mrs arne's room she was there and near her stood the man hain at last cried mallow between his teeth at last i have got you what does he mean demanded madame in her metallic voice it means that i want francis hain for murder the tall man slipped back a pace his voice quavered i am not hain he said keeping a wary eye on mallow you liar mallow sprang forward you are hain the murderer you and that woman one of you killed young carson madman carson is alive in italy carson is dead murdered you killed him you are hain he is not hain said mrs arne simply i am not hain repeated the man something in the tone of his voice sounded strangely familiar to mallow no you are not hain said mallow throwing himself at the man's throat i know you now you are drabble his hand twitched away the light beard and the doctor's clean shaven face was revealed drabble the murderer kill the spy breathed madame death in life he knows too much enough to hang you both mallow threw drabble on one side ran past mrs arne and dashed his gloved fist through the window help help police police kill him kill him shrieked madame fiercely spy roared drabble the two men swung and reeled across the floor neither uttered a word with clenched teeth and muscles tense they battled fiercely in the small space madame rushed to the door and flung it open a spy a spy danger up up up she cried down the well of the staircase immediately there was a noise of rushing feet a babel of fierce voices mallow heard rather than saw the room filling he had a firm grip on drabble's throat and the man was staggering and gurgling for want of breath then a hundred hands as it seemed plucked him back he was hurled to the ground and beaten and trampled into insensibility chapter ix man proposes may i ask lord aldean if you have ever perused the biography of the celebrated dr johnson of auchinleck yes mrs purcell i have mallow made me read it when i was cramming for the 'varsity made you read it echoed mrs purcell majestically the word 'made' is misapplied surely well it is a teaser isn't it said aldean frankly shouldn't read it to keep myself awake boswell's a bit long winded ain't he boswell lord aldean whatever he may be is not frivolous i don't read anything as a rule confessed jim except the papers mrs purcell frowned the general slovenliness of style of the daily journals is not such as dr johnson would have approved said she in her deep voice the very letters of the illustrious lexicographer have the roll and volume of ethic poetry 'paradise lost' said miss ostergaard everybody talks about it and no one reads it i have read it tui observed miss slarge rousing herself from her brown study it afforded me useful hints on idolatry moloch who is mentioned therein is identical with the baal or bel of the babylonians the romish festival of st john at the midsummer solstice is simply the relic of the chaldean worship of tammuz one of bel's names was oannes the latinized form of john in the sacred language of the papists joannes remove the 'j' and you can see how the idol was converted into the prophet most interesting said aldean groaning as this deluge of hard names rattled about his head do you write like dr johnson miss slarge alas rubina does not sighed mrs purcell rather does she adopt the antithetic style of macaulay the historian the conversation was taking place in mrs purcell's drawing room round a cheerful fire in the next room olive was writing letters she was in truth somewhat depressed by the non appearance of mallow whom she had expected that evening and felt little inclined for conversation true to his promise aldean had called at mallow's rooms after dinner but finding there neither his friend nor a telegram had come over to enjoy himself at campden hill but that the business on hand might not be neglected he had left word that if a telegram came it was to be sent on to him at mrs purcell's house mallow's absence had not surprised him he concluded that he was in the neighbourhood of poplar street hain hunting as it was mallow was at that moment a prisoner in the anarchist den and by his very warning to aldean that his absence might be indefinite he had done away with all chance of rescue jim's true errand to campden hill was to propose to miss ostergaard he was determined to know the worst or the best before leaving for italy but it chanced that mrs purcell's johnsonian mania was strong upon her for she pestered the poor boy with a hundred and one details concerning her celebrated samuel until he fervently wished that he or johnson had never been born not to speak of bean goldy reynolds and all other illustrious old bores idolized of mrs purcell he was hopelessly dazed with it all and looked it nor did it add to his comfort in any degree to find tui heartily laughing at his plight it became too much for the wretched jim he grew both desperate and rude seems to me the most creditable thing about johnson said he crossly was that he didn't murder boswell murder boswell gasped mrs purcell murder his biographer i mean the fellow who was always asking questions explained jim i can't think how johnson put up with his silly gabble fancy a fellow asking another fellow what he'd do if he was shut up in a castle with a baby such bosh y'know lord aldean said mrs purcell solemnly rising you are evidently not aware that it was boswell's object to afford the great doctor an opportunity for the display of his unrivalled fund of argument and of contradiction hinted tui sweetly mrs purcell shook her head sadly i perceive that you are both of you of the earth earthly she said pityingly the solemnity of the learned lexicographer's periods is lost upon you rubina let us leave these unideaed young people to their own puny foolish ways yes priscilla said miss slarge rising i must return to my desk no rubina not with my consent you shall do no such thing to tax your brain at so late an hour is the height of folly in the next room we will play draughts it is a cheerful amusement miss slarge sighed but complied she knew from experience the futility of attempting to argue with her ponderous sister as they left the room aldean stepped forward to open the door hope i haven't been rude mrs purcell rude certainly not lord aldean but it must be confessed that you are sadly ignorant your style of conversation is neither elegant nor well considered jim returned to the fire and tui unabashed he was bent on proposing and tui by some peculiar instinct purely feminine knew it what is more she intended to let him have his say lately it had dawned upon her that it was possible to play her fish too long he might sulk away from the hook and she had no intention of allowing that to happen so she sat and looked at the fire and jim sat and looked at her while the hearts of both beat a lively rataplan utterly incommensurate with so tranquil an occupation i say began jim gracefully you don't think mrs purcell's on her hind legs do you oh no responded tui still confining her interest to the fire women never get on their i mean never lose their tempers don't they said aldean this as a simple interrogation not an assertion of course not i am a woman i ought to know how silly you are i'm unideaed mrs purcell says so she made the same remark about me she stole the word you know from boswell who got it from johnson it seems we are both of us tui sighed 'unideaed' it's a kind of bond between us isn't it dear me lord aldean how should i know silence for a few moments during which the ordinary medium for conversation proving unsuitable recourse was had to certain more subtle means chiefly ocular finally a combination seemed to be decided upon aldean gloomily i hate dr johnson don't you tui viciously not so much as i do boswell the nasty poll pry aldean so he is so he was that's another bond between us insinuatingly ain't it tui repeating herself how should i know lord aldean silence aldean desperately do do you think that marriages are made in heaven tui faintly i i have heard that they are aldean speculating i wonder when they whoever they are will set about manipulating ours tui with a maidenly perturbation ours lord aldean what do you mean by ours aldean moving his chair closer you know no answer i'm sure you know tui ridiculous deserts the fire for the hearthrug aldean intercepting the field of view tui oh with a gasp tui certain physical demonstrations followed amid which the dental emissions necessary for the iteration of the name tui crackled like volleys from a machine gun oh lord aldean implored tui collecting her senses don't don't what tui said jim seizing her hand get up if mrs purcell came in what would she say she would say i was proposing tui and she wouldn't be far wrong say 'yes' why should i say 'yes' because i love you and you love me i haven't said that i love you said tui rising in feigned alarm i don't need you to say it i can see it henceforth for some time conversation became superfluous if not impossible at length jim came to the point my darling he implored say that you will marry me how can i it's so sudden you're so so so very demonstrative no no i won't i can't oh very well miss ostergaard cried aldean suddenly releasing her i'm a fool and you're a hard hearted coquette and he turned his back to fold his arms and sulk lord aldean said tui faintly there was no reply lord aldean she repeated still no reply finally in desperation jim oh tui tui his arms were round her will you will you i will murmured tui with accents well nigh liturgical dearest then there was a great silence and what is perhaps best expressed by typographic constellations there came a knock a discreet knock be it said at the door and shortly following it the footman a concrete being indeed his signal gave rise to a very elegant little manoeuvre whereby the width of the hearthrug was speedily if somewhat obtrusively placed between these two under his breath jim muttered hang it m'lord said the apollo in livery if you please m'lord there's a person below who wishes to see your lordship what sort of a person a low sort of person m'lord his business is important he says hope nothing's wrong with mallow poor chap mumbled aldean driving the footman out of the room then he went downstairs in the hall he found a disreputable marionette who at the sight of him at once commenced profusely to scrape and bow this creature confessed to the name of vraik and addressed lord aldean in a husky whisper presumably that the lordly footman should not hear mr mallow told me to send a wire to his rooms m'lord said the man that is when i saw the major cove off but bein' a bit late for a telegram i thought i might as well trot round myself mr mallow wasn't in and they told me you'd left a message for this place m'lord yes i did well what about the major he's off to the continong m'lord cleared off by the nine hexpress from victorier took three boxes with 'im went off to night did he mused jim that is just what mallow expected he's a bit of a liar that major very well he said to vraik i will convey your message to mr mallow what am i to do now m'lord call and see mr mallow to morrow he will give you your orders you can go now vraik foggy night m'lord fog will get into the throat som'ow aldean construed the remark correctly and produced half a crown the creature slipped it into his pocket and sneaked out with the abasement he judged befitting to the occasion well said aldean re ascending the stairs i can't say mallow's particular as to whom he employs but one can't work in mud i suppose without getting a bit dirty h'm so the major's off that means i'll have to go to morrow there's a nine o'clock i think as well as the midday mail from victoria i had better take it i suppose hang it grumbled jim just when she's said 'yes' this comes of sticking closer than a brother on re entering the drawing room aldean found tui the centre of manifest congratulations olive and mrs purcell assisted by miss slarge who had returned from babylon for the purpose were showering upon her many expressions of delight osculatory and otherwise tui of course was weeping how things had progressed thus far in so incredibly short a space of time jim was at a loss to comprehend he felt a little out of his depth and wondered if all was as it should be he supposed it was all natural enough still he was obviously disconcerted when the trio bore down upon him brimful of compliments and general expressions of goodwill he blushed and sought a corner with as much speed as he felt to be compatible with politeness but even so he was only protected in the rear olive shook one hand and said oh lord aldean i am so glad mrs purcell took the other and continued lord aldean i congratulate myself that beneath my roof you have met the future partner of your joys and sorrows i knew it would be all right said miss slarge beaming one marriage invariably brings another that superstition we can trace back to the land of uz thanks awf'ly muttered jim nervously then once again tui became the centre of attraction dearest tui said olive my sweet girl said miss slarge it will be a pleasing spectacle for me to witness the progress of love's young dream rolled mrs purcell still majestic oh dear you are all very kind wept tui how how how very happy i am i fear you are not to see the progress of love's young dream just yet mrs purcell blurted out aldean i am going away you know going away echoed the combined trio oh jim wailed tui oh jim aldean steeled his heart major semberry has bolted to italy he said i must follow him promised mallow' and why has major semberry departed so suddenly guilty conscience mrs purcell he's gone off to see carson to see my husband cried olive turning white are you following him yes by the nine train to morrow don't want to go but promised mallow i can't break my promise you know tui jumped up and kissed him before them all jim she cried you are a darling chapter x woman disposes for a young gentleman to face with equanimity four ladies each one more or less gifted in her particular way especially when the said young gentleman has just proposed to one of them and been accepted requires a considerable amount of moral courage aldean confessed he felt the want of it when tui kissed him and the three onlookers smiled sympathetically it was only when they quitted romance for reality and became interested in olive's troubles in place of his engagement that jim recovered his equanimity mrs purcell adjusted the situation to the lower and less romantic topic with her usual majesty be seated lord aldean she said enthroning herself on the nearest and most comfortable chair let me hear your opinion on this unexpected and suspicious departure of major semberry my opinion is the same as mallow's replied jim bluntly semberry has gone off to get his share of this money it is my business to stop him getting it that will be difficult said olive despondently it would be mrs carson if the major were irresponsible as well as a scamp and if he did not happen to be in the service as it is i have the pull over him and so has mallow we are in a position to prove carson's imposture through a third party and as semberry must have been accessory to the swindle i can get him cashiered if he doesn't leave the money alone and make a clean breast of his conspiracy how can you prove that olive's husband is an impostor asked tui by bringing forward a man called jeremiah trall as a witness clara's uncle said olive nodding i know mr mallow told me all about him oh and i am married to this man no you are not mrs carson or rather i should say miss bellairs lord aldean cried mrs purcell while olive remained silent too amazed for words i trust that you are not about to inform me that this profligate has contracted a previous matrimonial alliance no but he is not angus carson and he therefore married miss bellairs under a false name to do this wittingly nullifies a marriage are you certain of that asked olive pale and anxious certain mallow saw dimbal about it and to make doubly sure they took counsel's opinion on the subject you are not married tui threw her arms round her friend's neck oh olive she said aloud and then whispered slily i know why mr mallow consulted the lawyer the iniquity of the fellow is preposterous said mrs purcell in her most stately tone nevertheless if our dear olive can be freed from her matrimonial bonds i shall rejoice sincerely and without reserve i should like to punish the wretch cried tui vehemently i'll punish him for you murmured jim in her ear shall i kick him or wring his neck or throw him into the arno well i think the last would be best it might wash the sin out of him water was used for lustration by the chaldeans said miss slarge her ruling passion strong within her then the genuine woman asserted herself olive my poor love i trust indeed that this may be so and that you will escape from the power of this bad man i was never in his power cried olive proudly he was never my husband i hated him i will throw the ring no she stopped suddenly and replaced the wedding ring on her finger i must not cease to wear this until i am certain of my freedom lord aldean she asked suddenly you go over to italy to morrow yes by the nine o'clock express from victoria and you will see this this man who calls himself carson it is probable i must put a stop to his game and semberry's i promised mallow to do so then i will go to florence with you mrs purcell stared her face assumed an expression of horror my dear she said aghast are you in your right mind of course i am i must and will know the truth about this man and what is more i intend to hear it from his own lips but but that woman gasped miss slarge if i am not married to the man she is nothing to me lord aldean will you take me to florence certainly said jim promptly and i think that you are brave and right to face your troubles so boldly she is a heroine cried tui then whispered softly and you are a dear pray consider the feelings of society boomed mrs purcell i prefer to consider my own thank you it is no use talking my mind is made up and lord aldean has consented to take me i must know how i stand towards this man i must hear from himself that he is not carson and i must recover the money stolen from me oh dear me wailed miss slarge can't you wait until mr brock calls he is in town he writes to say that he will visit us to morrow afternoon can't wait struck in aldean judiciously promised mallow to follow semberry next train must be off nine sharp i shall be at the station at half past eight cried olive you get the tickets and engage a carriage lord aldean consider the feelings of mr mallow' oh he will be glad i am going mr mallow is not a prude i'll write him a note to night perhaps he will be at the station in the morning no need to write said aldean rising i am going round to his rooms now i'll tell him if i see him though it's just possible i may not see him he's so mixed up with these anarchists that he never keeps regular hours now i cannot but condemn this insane determination oh but mrs purcell you can trust olive with lord aldean coaxed tui i am sure you ought to when i trust him with her i have a great mind to undertake the journey myself cried mrs purcell with energy but i fear that the excessive travelling would prove highly injurious to me two days and two nights hinted aldean it's a corker of a trail you must not think of going mrs purcell said olive resolutely i will go alone with lord aldean so that is all about it good night lord aldean there is none too much time i must go and pack when olive had left the room both aldean and tui brought their persuasive powers to bear upon mrs purcell after no small amount of trouble they succeeded in reducing her to a more pliable state of mind she confessed that olive's position was so extraordinary that perhaps extraordinary measures were justifiable for the adjustment of it in the end she went further and expressed her opinion that it was right the girl should go but for her own sake said mrs purcell severely the more so seeing that she has been so wantonly deceived by that unprincipled profligate you must take the greatest care of her lord aldean i will treat her as i would a sister of my own said jim this seemed to suffice mrs purcell she fussed out of the room to help olive with her packing followed in a few minutes by miss slarge tearful and doubtful the room was empty and the two young people grasped their opportunity for saying good bye after their own fashion and in their own time jim in this instance at least was nothing if not thorough and fully twenty minutes elapsed before he descended the staircase as he lay in bed that night he confessed to himself that the love scenes of fiction were not so highly coloured after all the course of his true love had at last begun to run very smooth indeed but before going home to dream of his good fortune lord aldean had not forgotten to call at mallow's rooms only to learn from the night porter that their occupant was still absent little thinking how laurence's impulsive irish spirit had led him into difficulties jim scribbled a few lines on his card to say that major semberry had left that evening for florence and that with mrs carson he intended to follow by the nine o'clock morning mail from victoria this card he gave to the porter with strict injunctions that it was to be handed to mr mallow immediately on his return that done aldean abandoned himself with a clear conscience to the full enjoyment of his dreams shortly before eight o'clock next morning he drove to the station arriving there on the stroke of the half hour he quite expected to find mallow waiting for him but there was no sign of him jim could only conclude he had not received the card been out all night i suppose grumbled aldean in no very good temper in the thick of it with the brutes in soho i expect i only hope he won't get into trouble with them must have spotted and followed hain he's probably hanging on to him till the police run him in it was a cold raw morning and jim in a fur lined coat rolled about the platform like a giant bear he took two through tickets to florence bought a couple of morning papers and some illustrated weeklies and with the assistance of the guard engaged a carriage supplied with foot warmers hardly had he completed his preparations when olive made her appearance accompanied to his great delight by miss ostergaard both ladies were in the best of spirits but i don't see mr mallow said olive her face falling somewhat does he not know that i am going told him so last night that is i left an explanatory card for him but he can't have got it oh lord aldean i trust nothing is wrong with him no fear of that replied jim confidently you can trust mallow to look after himself besides he told me he might very likely be away for some time over this hain business is that the man connected with the murder yes vraik reported that he had seen him talking to semberry in poplar street so mallow determined to catch him himself talking to major semberry said tui thoughtfully that looks as though the major had something to do with poor mr carson's death i have not the slightest doubt about it semberry knows a good deal more than he is inclined to tell but you needn't worry about mallow mrs carson or shall i say miss bellairs no no said olive hurriedly don't please do that for the present have you the tickets yes tickets and carriages and papers everything is square are you well wrapped up asked tui with an air of proprietorship warm as toast said jim laughing and they walked down the platform you have left nothing behind jim nothing except my heart and that is in good keeping said olive smiling lord aldean wait in the carriage with tui while i buy a paper plenty of papers here said the stupid aldean not seeing her kindly intention tui more quick witted turned over the journals telegraph morning post daily mail sketch and graphic she counted and not a single fashion paper amongst them so like a man jim looked depressed and olive went off laughing in search of publications of a more particularly feminine nature tui and her lover were left alone in the carriage oh what a donkey she said shaking her head for the moment aldean failed utterly to understand then a comprehension of her meaning dawned upon him and doubtless he did his best to make amends tui's farewell left him in a state of ecstasy which endured long after the train rolled out of the station he stared solemnly out of the window and olive who knew well where his thoughts were had not the heart to break so sacred a silence she let him dream on and secluded herself behind her morning paper he had been indulging himself for the best part of half an hour when a startled exclamation from olive aroused him oh how dreadful she said 'what's the matter said jim shortly anything wrong i should think so poor mr brock has been run over by jove you don't say so when where yesterday evening in marquis street said olive referring to the paper he was crossing the road when a hansom coming too quickly round the corner knocked him down his leg was broken and they took him to charing cross hospital poor old chap said aldean sympathetically deuced hard lines on a man of his age marquis street did you say why that's where semberry lives he intended calling on major semberry i know said olive in his letter to miss slarge he said so dear me i am sorry for him so am i he's a good old chap is brock may i see the account olive passed him the paper he read the account but beyond being sincerely sorry for his friend the vicar he attached no especial importance to it little did he think how significant it really was this particular ill wind in common with others of its kind blew great good to somebody that somebody was major semberry how good a wind it was for him they neither of them knew till it was too late the fourth scene in florence chapter i on the long trail the efforts of some people to convert what is purely a business errand into one of pleasure are rarely crowned with success though there are times when the process can be inversed with some degree of profit an extreme busyness is an invariable sign of a deficient vitality there never was a greater truth than that complete enjoyment of the picturesque argues the possession of a large capacity for dreaming and dawdling one must so to speak supply one's own atmosphere steep one's self in romance acquaint one's self with the mystery of the past for the toning down of an all too obvious present the successful pursuit of pleasure is every whit as arduous as the compilation of pounds shillings and pence nay more so because for every man who achieves the one there are a thousand who achieve the other true enjoyment is of all prey the most elusive the most horribly tantalizing you think you have it and heigh presto the wily thing is right about face and grinning at you half a mile away call art a jealous mistress if you will pleasure is twin sister to her she demands and will have the absolute abandonment of you all or nothing and so it was that neither aldean nor olive succeeded in extracting any pleasure out of their well nigh meteoric flight to florence they could not give themselves up to the thing their object was ever before them and they were conscious only of it and the hundred and one petty annoyances of a continental railway transit they ate they slept they talked they read not for the sake of eating talking or reading but merely to pass the time they were acutely aware of an all pervading mustiness of the rumble of wheels and of the fussy interference of various individuals terming themselves officers customs and otherwise each station seemed more draughty than the last and with each mile it seemed to grow more cold at last in the early morning of the second day they found themselves at the florence centrale in a temperature and fog which would have done credit to the estuary of the thames from milan aldean ever practical had telegraphed for rooms to the hotel magenta and thither they proceeded in course of time in what is known as an omnibus a good breakfast and both of them felt more at peace with themselves though olive had to give in and lie down for an hour or so aldean whom nothing seemed to tire shaved and bathed he dressed himself in fresh clothes and felt as fresh as paint the simile was his own then lighting a strong cigar former experience had proved to him the luxury of tobacco in these parts he took a brisk walk for the consideration of campaign details in a city of the size of florence you have the disadvantage of being able to run up against your next door neighbour half a dozen times a day from the via tornabouni haunted by forestieri to the end of the lung 'arno or cascine gardens is no very great stretch and here in the hyde park of florence aldean had a notion that his stroll might prove most profitable failing that the gentleman of whom he was in search having no very pronounced artistic cravings he argued that giacoso's rather than the duomo the gambrinus bier halle rather than the uffizi should prove remunerative as a hunting ground but nowhere had he any luck perchance it was that messieurs semberry and friend were resting for the moment at all events they showed no signs of life and aldean having drawn blank returned to the hotel olive was up and waiting for him sufficiently refreshed she said to get to business straight away that their conversation might be unfettered it was certain to revolve round the one topic they lunched in a private room aldean deplored his bad luck it's worse than looking for a needle in a haystack he declared have you examined the visitors' list asked olive no no use semberry only arrived yesterday they require somewhat longer notice for these things in this part of the world as to carson well of course he will not be known as carson here and for his other name we can hardly look seeing we don't know it what do you think is best to be done then well mrs carson said aldean reflectively i think perhaps you had better stay in this afternoon it might frighten these young birds did they happen to see you they won't take so much notice of me at all events they would not be likely to connect me with the business i'll walk round the town and keep my eyes open somewhere about five i'll drive in the cascine if they show anywhere it will probably be in the gardens and if you do see them oh i'll keep them in sight be sure my next step then will depend upon what they say or do semberry i can manage by threatening to report his conduct at the war office but it will not be so easy to deal with carson i think it will said olive scornfully the man is a poor cowardly creature you can terrorize him into obedience in that case i'll bring him here and let you deal with him when we get the truth out of him i shall let me see mused aldean did i promise tui to kick him or drown him one of the two i'm sure i almost despair of ever getting the money back said olive depends upon what he has done with it i expect we shall have to get him arrested after all and prove that he has annexed that fifty thousand pounds under false pretences the british consul will help me in all that in the mean time i'll bring him here if i can olive agreed that this seemed about the most feasible line of action she remained at home glad indeed of the opportunity for rest while her coadjutor cast around for the trail but in all his peregrinations jim caught no glimpse of those he was in search of in no very good temper he hailed a carriage and drove to the cascine gardens his last hope lay in that direction if i don't see them here he grumbled there's no chance of coming across them to night i dare say i shall have to persuade the consul to take up the matter after all as the wretched vettura bumped over the pavement of the lung 'arno aldean scanned the faces of the chattering and gesticulating crowd the sun was dying in splendour over bello sguardo hill the river yet to be swollen by its winter rains caught up the golden light and spread it over its vast gravel bed to the green avenue of the cascine a variety of carriages from the springless conveyance of the streets to the imposing equipage emblazoned with armorial bearings commensurate in size only with the age of the families they represented were hurrying there to parade between the mounted gendarmes at either end these latter were quite admirable in their capacity of ornate signposts aldean found plenty to amuse him but still there was no sign of either fugitive his patience was beginning to show signs of wear though there was no one to observe them but the cocchiere and he was impervious to everything of that nature just then he became conscious of a man and a woman talking and laughing together in a smart green victoria they were travelling in the same direction as himself and as they passed him he noticed the coachman was in livery with something like a sigh of relief aldean leaned forward to instruct his man to follow a somewhat difficult task to him for his italian was none of the best in his calmest of moments cocchiere carozza la carozza verdi subito presto the italian jehu nodded and cracked his whip at the same moment the green victoria was stopped in the crowd in another moment he would have been alongside no no shouted aldean laying his hand on the man's arm the bewildered cocchiere pulled up then carson's carriage began to move out of the throng si si cried aldean in answer to the interrogative aspect of his coachman adagio piano slow you fool jim's driver became suddenly inspired he caught sight of a lady in the green carriage he was evidently driving a jealous husband bent upon the spoliation of an intrigue this appealed to him in every way with the greatest skill he kept in the rear of carson's vehicle and turned only to hold up his five fingers twice dieci lire he said as his inspirations now aspirations took definite shape si si venti lire si vi piace adagio comprenez parlezvous francais non ah quelle dommage allez piano go slow you ass thus did aldean frantically endeavour to make himself clear but those two words venti lire had done their work and jim congratulated himself on his linguistic attainments easier job than i thought he said to himself i'll stick to carson till i catch him the brute he doesn't know i am at his tail gigglin' and laughin' with that girl hang him hang her hang 'em both by this time it was getting dark and people were beginning to leave the cascine for dinner quite ignorant that he was being followed carson in the highest spirits drove along the lung 'arno and in a short time his carriage turned into the piazza santa trinita where it stopped before the door of the hotel du sud opposite to the column clara and her friend alighted and disappeared into the hotel aldean jumped down and bidding the coachman to wait ran up the steps in mortal terror lest he should miss them the concierge a vision of gold lace and moustache advanced with a smile and in french begged to know what monsieur might require i want to see the lady and gentleman who have just come in replied aldean in the same language signor and signora boldini said the man assuredly monsieur they are on the first floor shall i present the card of monsieur there is no necessity take me upstairs and show me the room signor boldini expects me said aldean making the best excuse he could think of at the moment in that case i shall conduct monsieur with pleasure replied the gold laced personage in his magnificent way will monsieur give himself the trouble to ascend monsieur did and was speedily ushered into a gilded and ornate salon in italian the man announced that a gentleman desired to see signor boldini he closed the door leaving aldean face to face with carson clara paled somewhat as she recognized the visitor but she kept her head she evidently meant to see things through carson shrank back at the sight of aldean as though expectant of a blow and collapsed into a chair nerveless and terrified jim looked on grimly well mr carson he said in no very amiable tone you have given me a considerable amount of trouble what have you to say for yourself what need he say cried clara seeing that her accomplice was incapable of speech how dare you come in here uninvited lord aldean dare is not a word young woman that i am accustomed to hear from domestic servants i am no servant replied clara with a flash of anger thought not said jim coolly i never believed you were but i hardly expected to find that your real profession was that of spy a spy a spy what do you mean oh i think you know pretty well the report you made to your uncle jeremiah was the work of a spy my uncle gasped clara steadying herself by the table yes your uncle i know all about him so does mr mallow so does miss bellairs my wife murmured carson speaking for the first time oh you have found your tongue at last have you cried jim striding over to the trembling coward i wonder why i don't throw you out of the window this violence this insult panted the man oh don't be afraid i'm not going to make a mess of you just yet how dare you call miss bellairs your wife i i was married to her you were under a false name to rob her of her money perhaps you are not aware that such a marriage is void miss bellairs is not your wife her money is not yours i am going to give you the chance of handing it over take it or go to gaol like the swindler you are how dare you call him a swindler said clara savagely because i like to call things by their right names it's a case of speaking by the book i know all about your anarchist schemes and madame death in life drabble rouge and all the rest of the gang however i didn't come here to waste breath on either of you you come along with me carson or boldini or whatever else you choose to call yourself where do you want me to go whimpered the wretched creature looking up at the towering figure of aldean to my hotel come along up with you clara dashed to the bell i'll call the landlord and have you turned out she said viciously you can't bully us don't want to sorry if i'm not conducting the business according to etiquette you know more about this sort of thing than i do ring the bell by all means and i'll have up the police ring go on no no clara don't shrieked boldini leaping out of his chair at the mention of the police he knows too much hold your tongue said the woman between her teeth he can prove nothing you fool the police can judge of that replied aldean quietly ring but miss trall did not ring she knew better she recognized that whatever he might know lord aldean knew quite enough to make the intervention of the police unpleasant the game was up she saw plainly so reluctantly she yielded we can do all that is to be done here said she sullenly fighting every inch i'm afraid not answered jim suavely my hotel is the best place there's a cab waiting then seeing that clara was still irresolute he took out his watch i'll give you just two minutes clara moved slowly across the room to where boldini sat in sheer terror what shall we do she asked in a low voice go go moaned the man we must go perhaps we can make terms aldean overheard the remark it is my right to make terms he said and i make these give back the money confess the whole conspiracy and you can go where you will for a moment or two the pair looked at one another clara bent forward and whispered something in boldini's ear he nodded and a gleam of hope passed across his face as he rose holding a handkerchief to his mouth we are ready to go with you said clara turning towards aldean very good come on chapter ii one portion of the conspiracy certain features of the present position appealed to lord aldean it was his first experience of the kind and perhaps what gratified him most was the consciousness of the power which so suddenly had become vested in him the knowledge that in this human rubber he held all the trumps in no wise lessened his enjoyment of the situation there still remained to play them and he felt pretty confident that in the end he and his partner would not have many tricks to deplore for the moment his antagonists were absolutely in his hands the man frightened to death of his skin the woman believing that for the time being at least discretion was surely the better part of valour he hurried them off to the hotel magenta there to be dealt with by the woman they had deceived and plundered as he fully expected olive was greatly agitated he supposed it was womanlike for her to show most anger at the sight of her whilom maid her husband after all had at no time been anything to her for him she had nothing more than the contempt she had always felt she ignored him completely how dare you come into my presence she said to the woman how can you have the face to look at me after the shameful way in which you have behaved blame your friend for that answered clara doggedly i would not have come at all had i known you were here exactly that is why i did not think it necessary you should know of mrs carson's presence here exclaimed aldean smoothly mrs carson sneered clara with a contemptuous laugh oh yes mrs carson of course olive looked at the woman with a flush of anger no insolence if you please she said and you turning on her shrinking husband who and what are you pray carlo boldini he replied almost inaudibly are you an italian my father was he married an englishwoman so i am signora boldini said olive bitterly clara laughed again oh yes signora boldini she repeated seating herself complacently beside her companion the two sat there like prisoners in the dock aldean began to feel positively judicial the woman was horribly insolent i would suggest for your own sake that you endeavour to restrain yourself he said moving to the end of the room in search of pen and ink you are in quite enough trouble as it is oh i don't mind her insolence lord aldean said olive quietly she can do me no harm don't be too sure of that flashed out miss trall vindictively clara clara implored boldini it's best to say nothing least said soonest mended aldean arranging his writing materials on a table at olive's elbow looked up i fear you will find that proverb doesn't apply to what is to come said he cheerfully mrs carson as this lady may be called for the present will question you sufficiently closely as to the various details of the conspiracy you will answer her questions categorically while i write them down the little prcis will then be signed by you both and witnessed by myself and if we refuse this confession as you call it questioned clara who withal was obviously uneasy oh in that case as i have told you before i hand you over to the police now then come along we have no time to waste on you begin jim dipped his pen into the ink and waited while olive after a sharp glance at the two before her launched into the examination reversing her previous attitude she addressed herself exclusively to boldini she judged a studied indifference to be more effectual from woman to woman who are you she asked i have told you that my father was an italian named boldini my mother was an englishwoman i was brought up and educated in london are you an anarchist yes i was affianced to the cause by my aunt mrs arne oh so mrs arne is your aunt my father's sister explained boldini who was recovering his self possession somewhat he was an anarchist but he is dead my mother also is dead is major semberry in florence no said clara loudly before her accomplice could speak useless to lie said aldean looking up we followed him here from victoria station suppose you put your question in another form mrs carson where is major semberry staying amended olive at the albergo della pace on the lung 'arno replied boldini seeing it was hopeless have you seen him yes once this morning have you known major semberry long since he came to england in the pharaoh i never met him before but i had heard of him from whom from dr drabble and my aunt is he an anarchist no his connection with us has to do merely with this money you have the fifty thousand pounds in your possession yes part of it is in paris and where is the remainder boldini wriggled uneasily and looked at clara she gave him no assistance but kept her eyes fixedly on the floor i have the other part of it at my hotel in circular notes on the crdit lyonnais how many have you and what is the value of each i have twenty of one thousand pounds twenty thousand reckoned olive major semberry's share i presume she added with unconcealed scorn y e s said boldini reluctantly with another wriggle and the remaining thirty thousand is at the crdit lyonnais in paris you say yes that is my share we will talk of the money later she said by the way with a glance at boldini's hands i observe you have recovered the use of your hand it was never in need of recovery snapped clara i guessed as much one of the smaller embellishments of your very ornate conspiracy boldini since you confess that you are not mr carson please to hand over that bangle boldini shook it down on to his wrist you can have it with pleasure said he sullenly but i can't get it off how was it got on asked aldean it was filed through and joined on my wrist ah well i am afraid that process will have to be reversed to morrow it can't be done here to night who gave you that bangle dr drabble' was it he who killed angus carson asked olive with embarrassing suddenness i don't know come come cried jim sharply the truth please i am telling you the truth retorted boldini i do not know who killed carson i did not even know that he was killed until miss bellairs there asked me about the smell of sandal wood then as i read the account of the murder in the morning planet it occurred to me that the dead man might be the person i was representing i asked semberry about it and he admitted i was right but he refused me all details then angus carson was really murdered in athelstane place according to semberry yes did semberry say that he had killed him asked aldean no he swore he did not kill him and that he did not know who did drabble also declares himself innocent you are all innocent according to your own showing said olive ironically but i can hardly believe signor boldini that you were so simple as to assume the impersonation of an original of whom you know nothing clara looked up with a strange smile on her sallow face you evidently know nothing of the anarchists she said coldly implicit obedience is the first law with them carlo was told to represent a man called angus carson he did so without asking questions how much longer is this to go on she cried furiously it is now seven o'clock i am tired of it i don't care for the socratian method myself observed aldean blandly on the whole i think it would be best perhaps for boldini here to acquaint us with the particulars of his share in the conspiracy straight away tell them carlo commanded miss trall shall i tell them everything whimpered boldini everything she repeated emphatically we have cut ourselves off from the brotherhood so it really does not matter lord aldean has promised to let us go if we tell the truth you had better tell him tell the truth and restore the money murmured jim politely boldini winced at the last remark but nevertheless applied himself to his most unpalatable task he evidently intended cutting it as short as possible he started off at top speed aldean wrote down the gist of what he said as i told you i am an anarchist he explained shortly and by the oath i took to the cause i was bound to render obedience in june last drabble came to me and stated that the brotherhood could obtain a sum of fifty thousand pounds and that i was to help he introduced me to major semberry and told me that i was to assume the character of a man called angus carson from india semberry had a portrait of this man and i altered my appearance in some degree so as to more clearly resemble it this was not difficult as i was very like the portrait i cut my hair short and parted it at the side instead of in the centre i let the ends of my moustache droop instead of twisting them up then drabble told me that i must pretend that my right hand was injured and wear it in a sling which i did the bracelet was produced by drabble and placed on my wrist major semberry then told me all about carson's life in india and took some trouble in seeing that i acquired a sufficient knowledge of the country he took me to his rooms in marquis street st james's and made me dress in carson's clothes which he showed me in a sandal wood chest afterwards i think that he and drabble must have seen the leader in the morning planet about the sandal wood scent for they took carson's indian clothes from me and supplied me with new ones in place of them but how was it that mr mallow smelt sandal wood on your clothes if this was so boldini explained there was a smart coloured waistcoat he said which belonged to carson which i admired very much when drabble took the clothes from me i kept that back without his knowledge when i met mr mallow i was wearing it and of course it was scented by the box that was how he noticed the perfume did you never suspect that this smell was in some way connected with the murder no how should i i did not know that the real carson had been killed and although i myself read the leader in the morning planet which was the only report of the case i did read i never thought for a moment that the dead man was the one i was representing when you miss bellairs spoke to me of this sandal wood odour and athelstane place i was really and truly ignorant of the murder it was only on reflection i put two and two together i remembered the severed hand and the sandal wood perfume referred to in the paper i knew also that the carson i represented came from india then it was that i made semberry tell me the truth he admitted the murder but swore he was ignorant as to who committed it then i married you miss bellairs and got the money for the anarchists or for yourself for myself and clara admitted boldini shamelessly i hated the anarchists and grasped the opportunity to be free from them i sold out the stocks and shares and transferred the proceeds to my real name at the crdit lyonnais i have the twenty thousand pounds here in circular notes because i have to give them to semberry to morrow why did you not give them to day because i would only give them to him in return for the sandal wood box and the clothes of carson which it contains why do you want that chest boldini showed himself in his true colours i like carson's clothes said he with the simplicity of a child he had nice clothes i am to have them to morrow and then i will pay him the twenty thousand pounds i am afraid you will have to forego both those pleasures said aldean grimly your vanity must in this instance be sacrificed to your safety i will trouble you to hand over those circular notes they are at my hotel said boldini rising with alacrity shall i go for them oh pray don't trouble miss trall can go for the notes clara looked at boldini and boldini looked at clara aldean made a shrewd guess that the man was attempting a trick to gain time for every now and then his hand wandered mechanically to his breast pocket it was probable that the notes were there jim expected a fight for the spoil but clara laid down her arms without a murmur and instructed boldini to do the same give him the notes said she curtly one by one they were counted and laid on the table before aldean boldini winced as if he were having a tooth drawn olive counted them and found them correct there were twenty notes of the value of one thousand pounds each printed in francs on the crdit lyonnais paper good said aldean with a nod now for your cheque book i won't i won't cried boldini childishly the rest of the money is mine we need not argue that question over again said olive coldly write a cheque in my name for thirty thousand pounds that is seven hundred and fifty thousand francs if not lord aldean shall call up the police oh clara what shall i give it to them she interrupted fiercely what is the use of fighting with tears of rage in his eyes boldini wrote the cheque and gave it to olive she looked at it with a nod and passed it on to aldean so far so good said the latter cheerfully now signor boldini sign this confession without a word the man took pen and signed it jim attesting it with a flourish i think that is all he remarked rising you can go now am i not to sign it asked clara scowling there is no necessity beyond that you are a spy you are of small account i am of this account said clara furiously that carlo is my husband your husband exclaimed olive yes we were married a year ago in st chad's church marylebone carlo boldini to clara trall i am his wife not you thank god said olive oh thank god you are an infernal scoundrel cried jim advancing on boldini i have a good mind to wring your neck clara threw her arm round the man let us go lord aldean no words can alter things now i am clara boldini and she pointing to olive is nothing i am a free woman at least heaven be praised i never was that man's wife i know now why you agreed so readily to our bargain she said turning on boldini go you miserable creature and lead a better life if you can i have no money said boldini will you give me some we will arrange that to morrow struck in aldean sharply you don't deserve any help but as the anarchists are after you miss bellairs and i will give you some help the anarchists repeated clara and boldini both paled to the lips without another word they left the room at last aldean saw how it was throughout he had been a trifle uneasy at the extreme and unexpected smoothness with which things were progressing he had not looked for the process of disgorgement to be accomplished with so little difficulty boldini's attitude had been subservient clara's altogether too unreal to convince him in the most abject coward there is at least a modicum of obstinacy when at bay and he could not understand how a plunder thus arduously come by should be disgorged with so little resistance the mention of the word anarchist explained everything to him the effect of it upon both miscreants left nothing to the imagination they were thoroughly scared this then was what they had dreaded for this it was they had been ready to throw everything by the board for silence exposure to the police would have revealed their immediate whereabouts to their fellows that meant pursuit speedy and relentless and that in its turn meant death to them both for some minutes after they had left neither jim nor olive spoke he occupied with his ruminations she with her own innermost thoughts jim broke the silence poor devils he said closing the door they have worse before them than what they have just been through and i think they know it at the hands of their brethren they are likely to meet with treatment a good deal less clement but what may i ask are you thinking of mrs i mean miss bellairs you look most supremely happy i am thinking of your friend and mine said olive chapter iii the sandal wood chest well lord aldean asked olive when she met her companion hatted and gloved in the saloon next morning what next the next item on our programme is an official visit to semberry answered the young man promptly a bit early for a call perhaps but i'm the bird you know after the worm the major's the worm won't do you know to let him and the boldinis come together and arrange their little plans union's always strength isn't it miss bellairs miss bellairs repeated olive after him with a long breath of satisfaction how good that sounds but about major semberry for all we know he may have seen the boldinis last night aldean wagged his head judiciously not likely they'd not seek him believe me now that we have semberry's share of the loot both boldini and his wife would rather be excused that interview they are too anxious about their little selves to bother him perhaps at all events let us hope so shall i come with you i'd rather you didn't if you don't mind better let me tackle semberry in my own way he won't climb down like boldini you know in fact i don't anticipate he will be an easy customer to deal with at all he'll fight said aldean so shall i i can't understand now why the boldinis gave in so utterly had to no choice for them replied jim promptly case of devil and the deep sea you know let's assume we are the deep sea and the anarchists and police and all of that ilk are the well the other thing you see police would have meant publicity and publicity would have meant extinction for them so far as this world is concerned and that though probably a relief to them in the future state was not exactly what they sought at present could we have them arrested even now asked olive well perhaps with an infinite amount of trouble and red tapeism we might get the british consul to help us so far but that sort of thing takes time and they might bolt at any moment i'm glad they had the sense to climb down it's all right now we have the money and the confession they are no use to us any longer yes we have the circular notes and they i suppose are safe said miss bellairs reflecting but that cheque lord aldean boldini might stop it by telegram he'll only tumble back into the pit if he does said aldean decisively but i won't trust him any more than you do before i see semberry i'll drop in at a bank i know here and ask them to cash the cheque they won't cash so large a cheque without inquiry surely that's just the point if not the banker'll have to wire to the crdit lyonnais in paris and we'll soon know if boldini's been up to hanky panky that's the worst of playing a game like this with a rascal added aldean musingly he's always got an ace somewhere we must watch his sleeve laughed olive well lord aldean off you go to major semberry and i'll wait here till you return bringing my sheaves with me said jim with a grin and forthwith departed left alone olive sat down and wrote a long letter to tui in which she praised lord aldean's common sense and willing help in the most glowing terms with joy she told tui of her freedom how clara was boldini's alias carson's true wife and how everything had gone off so much more quietly than either of them had dared to hope her letter ended with a casual inquiry after mallow and expressed a hope that tui had seen him as the strength of a chain lies in its weakest link so the strength of olive's letter lay in the pointedly trifling allusion to mallow small wonder if tui smiled to herself at the studied indifference of those few lines women understand those things as olive directed and stamped the envelope a knock came to the door and a smiling waiter entered with a letter addressed in lead pencil to miss bellairs she did not know the writing but when the man had gone she soon discovered that the letter was from clara there were two hurriedly pencilled pages commencing abruptly without date or address as follows i don't want you to think worse of me than you do for the trouble i brought on you was not of my making i am or rather i was a tool in the hands of the anarchists and against my will i was forced to play what i know was a mean part my father michael trall was a gentleman and at one time very rich but he gambled away all his money and left my mother and myself to starve in london i am now thirty years of age but never since an infant have i seen my father neither have i heard of him nor do i even know what he is like in appearance but i do know that he was a bad father and a bad husband who broke his wife's heart my poor mother died when i was only two years of age and i might have been an outcast in the streets but that my good uncle jeremiah took charge of me he had a little money and until i was twenty we lived on that he was kind to me but alas he was the slave of drink and by indulgence in it so weakened his will and self respect that he was the prey of any scoundrel who cared to meddle with him dr drabble met him ten years ago or more and seeing in him a useful tool inveigled him into the toils of the anarchists i tried to rescue my uncle as he had rescued me but in vain so to protect him i also took the oath to the brotherhood i was forced to implicit obedience i was ordered to casterwell as your servant in order to spy upon you i confess that in one sense i went willingly for i am carlo's wife and as dr drabble had arranged that he was to marry you for the sake of the money i was jealous i consented to keep quiet only because i wanted the fifty thousand pounds i had made up my mind that carlo and i should use it and once and for ever free ourselves from the brotherhood you have taken that hope from us but i don't blame you even now the money was yours and we swindled you carlo and i are going away and you will never see us or hear from us again he is a poor weak creature in your eyes but in mine he is the man i love and i hope to be happy with him in the future if only we can escape the relentless hand of the brotherhood if i knew who killed carson i would tell you but i do not i suspect drabble since he brought the bangle to carlo but this is mere suspicion did you know the miserable life i have had you would pity me i am sorry if i was rude last night i do not wish to be rude but i am surrounded on all sides by terror and death and care not sometimes what i say or do you have been very good to me and i thank you marry mr mallow i know he loves you and forget carlo and the miserable woman clara boldini ps when carlo and i are safe and settled we intend to send for my uncle to live with us we will rescue him from the brotherhood carlo is not a bad man indeed he is not weakness is his only fault with me he begs your pardon for his wickedness but remember his character his oath his helplessness and forgive him cb it was a sad letter written by a woman who surrounded by better people and under good influence might have remained true to the better part of her nature by the tides of life she had been swept to the lee shore of disaster olive felt that in no small degree fate had been against her and in her generosity she was unwilling to be the one to cast a stone at the unfortunate woman on the contrary her impulse prompted her to help clara with money and advice to rescue her and her weak husband from their danger and to help them to their first step on the way to a new life with such philanthropic intentions she started off to the hotel du sud an hour later aldean returned followed by a man with a hand barrow it was laden with a curious looking chest of yellowish wood bound with brass dismissing his porter aldean had the box taken upstairs and placed in a corner of the salon he was disappointed that olive should be absent when he returned with this trophy of his victory over semberry but to pass the time he set to work to examine the chest's contents a thin brass key unlocked it and aldean was soon so deeply interested in his search that he almost forgot the absence of his fellow worker by the time he had reached the bottom of the trunk the floor of the room was strewn with wearing apparel of all kinds the chest was literally packed with garments of every colour and pattern imaginable shooting suits of rough home spun tropical garbs of white boots riding breeches high brown boots shirts scarves collars under wear all more or less impregnated with the scent of the wood but amongst all these now useless articles not a scrap of writing aldean was disappointed he had fancied that a stray letter or a journal or even a card might have been forthcoming to throw some light on the owner's past yet he might have guessed that all evidence likely to inculpate semberry or drabble or mrs arne would have been removed by one of them before the chest left london two out of the three at least were old hands at obliterating tracks with an observant eye and a careful ear aldean overhauled the box outside and in he rapped at the sides pushing here and tugging there but so far as he could see there was no hollow space either at the sides or below the chest was plainly made of five thick slabs which sounded dead and dull when he tapped them then aldean turned his attention to the lid which was clasped with two broad brass bands dividing it into three equal spaces these were carved in the laborious chinese way with impossible flowers and stiffly flying birds rum thing muttered jim shaking the lid looks like an overgrown glove box round the lid ran a deep rim fitting down on to the lower portion of the box when locked and on examination of the inner side of this aldean found a row of brass nails ostensibly mere ornaments with infinite patience he pressed every one of the decorations hard he found that one behind the hasp yielded with difficulty to pressure two other nails one near each end of the lid proved equally loose jim pressed and pressed all three until suddenly with a click the whole inner skin of the lid fell down and between this and the top there proved to be a narrow space extending to all four sides with the lid fell a long blue envelope sealed with a coat of arms in red wax clever dodge said jim picking up the envelope and admiring the workmanship which so skilfully concealed the space in the lid but a chap could hide only thin things in it there's no room for anything else he looked at the envelope the rev manners brock casterwell he read jupiter that's queer wonder what's inside feels like dozens of pages 'spose this is a letter from carson senior to his old friend wonder why carson junior hid it so carefully while he was turning it over his fingers itching to break the seal and see if the contents could in any way explain the mystery of carson's death olive came hurriedly into the room without stopping to comment on the disordered floor or the extraordinary figure of lord aldean grovelling before the chest with the blue envelope in his hand she burst out into excited speech the moment she saw him lord aldean they have gone away clara and boldini they left the hotel last night about nine o'clock i'm not astonished replied jim getting on to his legs where have they gone to the people at the hotel couldn't tell me said olive exasperated somewhat at his calm reception of the news they paid their bill packed their things and went off in a cab to the central station a porter wanted to go with them and look after their luggage but clara would not allow him they have gone' best thing they could do miss bellairs dare say they are afraid of the anarchists tracking them here wonder where they have cleared to i went to the station to try and find out said olive disconsolately but although i saw the stationmaster and described the appearance he could give no information i believe they disguised themselves well it doesn't matter much said aldean soothingly we have the money and their confession let 'em go if they want to how did they get away without money they said they had none another lie i suppose said aldean sagaciously must have had some coin somewhere don't you bother miss bellairs we're done with them yes and with semberry too look here and aldean produced a packet of papers from his inside pocket here's the major's confession did he confess gasped olive taking the papers rather what's more he wrote out his confession and i stood over him until he did there it is signed by him witnessed by me and giving a full account of the conspiracy from first to last wonderful however did you manage it i threatened him with the war office replied aldean complacently told him that boldini had owned up and let him see that i knew quite enough to have him cashiered if nothing else then he didn't show fight as you expected oh yes he did he blustered about his name and position but i told him i'd take 'em both from him if he didn't own up in the end he did you have the gist of it in your hand he'd have wrung my neck if i hadn't told him i'd wring his if he tried that game first class fighting man the major and what is all this asked olive with a glance at the sartorial chaos oh this is carson's chest which semberry was bringing over to boldini i made him give it to me and for the last half hour i have been hunting for papers and things to see if i could find out anything of importance and you have found nothing yes a secret hiding place look at it miss bellairs clever thing isn't it found it by chance only a letter in it addressed to mr brock olive took the letter and read the inscription it's from dr carson i suppose she said turning it over i wonder what's in it don't know can't be anything about the murder if carson senior wrote it if we are to believe boldini and semberry the whole scheme was invented by drabble and this madame death in life and which of them killed poor carson ah jim shook his head gravely that is just the one thing semberry could not tell me he doesn't know chapter iv another portion of the conspiracy olive and aldean could not but confess themselves well satisfied with the results of their journey their achievement had been very tangible not only had they extracted from these prime movers of the conspiracy a full and clearly set forth confession but they were in a position comfortably to contemplate repossession of the money itself in the space of two days they had done this and as they now sat at luncheon they could not refrain from mutual congratulation the only thing about which there was any doubt in their minds was the wisdom of accepting from boldini the cheque for thirty thousand pounds in truth aldean now that the pair had flitted blamed himself heartily for having done so he was a trifle young and inexperienced more particularly in the shady financial tactics to be expected from people such as he was dealing with and at the moment it did not occur to him that the risk he ran in taking boldini's cheque was considerable seeing that there was really nothing to prevent the man bolting right away certainly he had confessed that he had no money but aldean realized now that either this obstacle had not proved insurmountable or that it had not existed long habit had made him so accustomed to look upon cheques as equivalent in value to the sum they represented he decided to dismiss the uncomfortable sensation that was creeping over him and to hope for the best he said nothing more about it to olive and now lord aldean said that young lady joyfully we can return home you no doubt will be as glad as i to do that you can measure my pleasure by your own miss bellairs we are both in the same galley i think olive blushed at this allusion to her feeling for mallow and thereby of course only accentuated its truth when shall we start she asked to night by the express said jim promptly unless you want to have another look round the city before you go i would rather get back to casterwell lord aldean let us get away to night there is nothing to detain us except that cheque what about that oh that's all right miss bellairs i sent a wire through the bank this morning to paris they'll have a reply this afternoon but are you sure you can bear the fatigue of another long journey so soon oh yes i'm quite recovered now in that case i'll drop in at cook's and get the tickets we'll return in glory bringing our sheaves with us mrs purcell shall deliver an address in her best johnsonese and tui shall oblige on the piano with 'see the conquering heroine comes oh no protested olive you have done the work tui shall hold to the original text but seriously she added stretching out her hand which jim grasped warmly i give you my best and most sincere thanks lord aldean for the great kindness you have shown me i shall never never forget your good humour and attention and all your hard work on my behalf oh please please don't miss bellairs protested jim flushing only too jolly glad things have turned out so well can't help being sorry i didn't kick boldini though i promised tui i would you know i am very glad you didn't so abject a creature doesn't merit even a kick from you by the way is major semberry returning to england what to fall into the clutches of his anarchistic friends i think not he knows better than to do that india's his goal that's where he's making for even mrs arne can't reach him there but what's the use of bothering about any of them now let 'em all go to jericho or any human rubbish heap they fancy for that matter will you come out with me miss bellairs and see about the telegram and tickets no i think i'll stay in and devote myself to major semberry's confession oh you'll enjoy that i'm sure it's like the concluding chapters of a sensational novel i'll leave you to read it then while i see about these things after he had gone olive settled herself in a comfortable chair that is to say as comfortable a chair as is to be had in that country by the window and plunged eagerly into semberry's confession jim having promised that the statement should be kept strictly private the major had not been at all half hearted about it but had set forth his iniquities in extenso indeed his vanity would seem to have led him to make the most of his misdoings as a human document the confession of major horace semberry was well worth perusal it ran somewhat after this fashion i am one of those unfortunate devils who have extravagant tastes and no money with which to gratify them i was brought up extravagantly by an extravagant father went from an extravagant school into an extravagant regiment and have had my tastes so fostered by luxury that it is absolute pain for me not to satisfy their cravings in every way i am always in debt and never out of difficulties and i would willingly dispense with the necessaries of life if only i could procure its luxuries by nature i am not a bad man it is the want of money that has induced me to do many things i would not otherwise have done it led me from borrowing to swindling but i have stopped short at that if i am accused of murder i am wrongly accused angus carson was not killed by me by whom he was killed i know no more than the man in the moon four or five years ago while on leave in london i met with dr drabble he is about as big a scoundrel as ever deserved the gallows he is moreover an anarchist and by means of his dupes in society of whom there are many he contrives to mix with very good people to do him justice he hates and despises them all but 'for the good of the cause' words which are never off his lips he feigns an interest in those with money or position solely that he may recruit his infernal army of destroyers somebody once called drabble 'a wrecker of humanity' and the title fits him well enough though it by no means does justice to his devilish ingenuity and wickedness why he should approach me with friendly advances i could not understand at the time but when i came to know him i learned the truth when he likes drabble is a fascinating man and by finding out the weak spot in people's characters he usually contrives to net them somehow or other he soon found out my weak spot want of money and insisted on being my banker like a fool i borrowed at first a little then more and more until i was so deep in his debt that he had it in his power to force me to leave the army he was not wealthy himself and i was always puzzled to know how he came by his money when i was completely in his power he told me he was an anarchist he said and the money he lent me was taken from the funds of the brotherhood to repay that money and something more he suggested that i should help him in a scheme of his for obtaining a sum of fifty thousand pounds this was the story he told me it appeared that at casterwell where drabble was the parish doctor there lived a young lady named miss bellairs who by a family arrangement was to marry one angus carson by name this man she had never seen miss bellairs as the doctor had discovered in some way was possessed of fifty thousand pounds on her marriage this money was to be paid over to carson her husband drabble's scheme was this he knew that i came from india and was returning there hence the reason of his friendship he proposed that i should make the acquaintance of dr carson and his son angus and when the latter came to england to marry miss bellairs that i should contrive to accompany him i was to introduce carson to drabble and let him persuade the young man to join the brotherhood so that he when married should hand over the money for their benefit 'become intimate with carson' said drabble 'make yourself indispensable to him and when you bring him to england introduce him to me i'll do the rest' seeing that drabble could easily have introduced himself when the young man arrived at casterwell i naturally asked why he wished to employ me as a go between to this he answered that it was his desire carson should join the anarchists before seeing miss bellairs that is before he went to casterwell at all as were he to fall in love with the girl which considering she was both pretty and attractive was more than probable he might point blank refuse to join drabble in his scheme for the regeneration of mankind to make a long story short i agreed to take part in the conspiracy provided i received twenty thousand pounds out of the fifty but i swear solemnly that neither at the first interview nor at any subsequent one with drabble was there any mention of murder i was to bring carson home i was to introduce him to drabble and when his enthusiasm had been roused sufficiently to induce him to hand over the fortune which he would acquire by marriage i was to receive twenty thousand pounds is there any roguery in such a scheme i think not shortly after making this arrangement i returned to india and for some months i had to pay with hard work for my holiday i was compelled so to attend to my duties that i had no chance of seeing the carsons however i made inquiries and learned that the doctor was a recluse somewhere up in the hills and that he kept his son constantly under his own eye to educate him for miss bellairs i presume after several disappointments extending over twelve months i obtained leave of absence and started out on a shooting expedition in the neighbourhood of this modern hermit as i made it my business to become acquainted with him it was not long before i attained my object how there is no need for me to explain i became very friendly with dr carson also with his son and in time the friendship ripened to intimacy i got on better with the doctor than with angus the latter was a solemn prig i thought with the most puritanical ideas still i adapted myself to his humour and i think he liked me fairly well but it was no easy task to break down his stiff reserve for two or three years i visited regularly the elder carson until i became so old and so good a friend in his eyes that one day he told me what i already knew of course about miss bellairs and her fortune i suggested that as angus was still young the possession of so large a sum of money might lead him into dissipation and i further suggested the advisability of some one accompanying him to england so that there might be at least some check upon him there dr carson approved of my idea and when he died about a year afterwards he made angus promise that i should accompany him to europe at once i wrote to drabble and assured him of my success after which i left india for london with my charge so far all had gone well lord aldean informs me that mrs purcell wrote to her sister a full description of carson of his looks and dress and priggish conversation and of the sacred bangle he wore on his right wrist i hated that bangle it seemed to me effeminate and foolish but it would not come off owing to carson's swollen and diseased hand and he refused to have it removed i had written to drabble about this hand being diseased and when the pharaoh arrived at brindisi i found a letter from him containing the programme of the plot that letter i kept and now attach to this confession at lord aldean's request drabble from my description of the state of carson's hand declared that an operation would be necessary and suggested that i should state to the young man that he drabble was a skilful surgeon who would perform it if carson consented i was to take him to a house in athelstane place and there introduce him to drabble as the surgeon drabble on the excuse of the hand engaged to keep carson there for some weeks and hoped by his own persuasions and those of mrs arne another anarchist to inspire carson with a desire to benefit humanity he and mrs arne hoped to talk carson into a state of red hot enthusiasm so that he might take the oath to the brotherhood once he did so and bound himself to this band of wild fanatics he would have to part either with his money or his life drabble and i and mrs arne were in great need of this money but there was no suggestion that the goose with the golden eggs should be killed i followed closely the directions in drabble's letter i talked to carson about the necessity of getting his hand cured and said that i knew a skilful surgeon called mr francis hain the name supplied to me by drabble who could cure it carson whose hand gave him pain readily agreed to try the effect of an operation and it was arranged between us that i should take him to mr hain's house on our arrival from plymouth i wrote to drabble advising him of this and when the pharaoh docked i first took carson and his luggage to the rooms in marquis street which i had already engaged and afterwards to athelstane place the luggage including the sandal wood chest was left at my rooms and with only a small portmanteau carson arrived at night at the so called hain's house mrs arne was the housekeeper drabble the surgeon under the name of hain and all was highly respectable carson had no suspicions and when drabble said that he would have to remain in athelstane place for at least three weeks while his cure was being effected he readily agreed to do so he gave me a letter to post to miss bellairs telling her how through this operation he was detained but of course i destroyed this i left carson in athelstane place and i returned to my rooms in marquis street that was the last time that i saw the poor fellow alive a day or so afterwards i was hurriedly summoned to the house in soho by drabble and mrs arne with much agitation they declared that carson was dead had been murdered i asked with horror if they were guilty both denied it in the strongest manner carson they said had been left alone on the previous night as they were both obliged to attend to some anarchistic business when they returned they found him dead on examination drabble discovered that death had been caused by a knitting needle thrust into the man's heart it had evidently been taken from some wool work of mrs arne's which had been left in the drawing room where the body had been found mrs arne searched the house but could find no one the doors were all closed the windows also however in carson's bedroom she discovered his portmanteau open and the contents tossed about as though the murderer had been searching for something both declared again that they did not know who had killed carson and in the end seeing that they had no reason for murdering the man i believed them i thought the whole conspiracy was at an end not so mrs arne or drabble the doctor produced the bangle which he had obtained by cutting off carson's hand at the wrist and declared that mrs arne's nephew carlo boldini who greatly resembled carson could impersonate the dead man and wear the bangle at first i refused then as i was in desperate straits for money i agreed carlo was called in and told that he was to represent a man called angus carson wear the bangle and marry olive bellairs that done he was to hand over the money to drabble and myself being already married to clara trall he declined at first to act the part but his aunt forced him to do so in the end it was not till long after this that carlo knew of the murder of carson at all we dressed him in carson's clothes taken from the sandal wood chest but afterwards on reading the leader in the morning planet we changed these clothes for new ones lest the scent should arouse suspicion the bracelet was placed upon his wrist and i instructed him in carson's history manner of speech and action it took me some time to train him in but at last he was turned out with so close a resemblance in appearance and personality to carson that he might well have been taken for the dead man's double i then accompanied him to caster just as olive reached this part of the confession lord aldean very red in the face entered the room hurriedly here's a pretty kettle o' fish he cried carson's cheque's no good i'm very much afraid we've lost that thirty thousand lost it cried olive starting up is the money not then in paris no not to boldini's credit at all events bank have received a reply to their wire saying that the money was withdrawn a fortnight ago and the account closed not a cent has the beggar got at the crdit lyonnais the cheque is mere waste paper they either have the money with them or have transferred it to the place they are bound for what a what a fool i was i might have known there was something dicky up the brute's sleeve when he gave in so meekly they didn't mind dropping semberry's share but they were determined to stick to their own what an ass the devil must have thought me i fear we shall have a bit of a job to trace them now here the presence of olive must be held responsible for the string of peculiar sounds proceeding from aldean they were comparable to nothing and cannot be expressed in type never mind said olive soothingly at any rate we return with twenty thousand and the confessions half a loaf is better than none we have lost much but on the other hand we have gained more than i a knock at the door interrupted her and a waiter entered with a telegram for lord aldean it proved to be from tui come back at once mallow in danger read aldean blankly olive turned grey and literally dropped into her seat the anarchists she cried with a gasp oh lord aldean we must go back at once but the thirty thousand pounds miss bellairs what do thirty forty a hundred thousand pounds matter if laurence is in danger cried olive excitedly we must not lose an hour god grant we may not be too late amen to that said aldean gloomily by ten o'clock that night they were on their way to london the fifth scene in london chapter i the missing man clothed and in his right mind hiram vraik sat in the bare room which he and his brother tenant grandiloquently termed the office he was absolutely at a loss to account for his employer's disappearance for several days he had called regularly at half moon street only to be told as regularly that mr mallow was still absent the porter of the chambers was not alarmed by mr mallow's continued failure to put in an appearance as that young gentleman was most irregular in his comings and goings but vraik's reasoning differed from the porter's perhaps because he knew more than the porter mallow was involved with a dangerous gang of anarchists and it was always possible indeed probable that some incautious speech or misguided confidence might get him into trouble the more vraik reflected on this possibility the stronger became his belief that mr mallow was now in difficulties up to his neck in them he'd hev tole that young lord chap if he'd bin goin' to stop away said vraik stroking his newly shaven chin but the lor' chap he tole me to git mr mallow's orders nex' day so he don' know nothin' an' he's gone arter the major cove as i foun' out by follerin' him to the stashun but mr maller here's a rum go later on vraik put things in this way before his partner a heavy jowled coarse faced military ramrod who answered publicly to the name of serjeant jorran privately to the endearing appellation on the part of vraik of m'pal it's a rum go this m'pal said the little man gravely an' i'm blest if i knows what's come t'him he may have gone abroad with lord aldean suggested the sergeant he ain't i sawr the lor' chap orf at victorier an' he went with a gal no m'pal i'll lay any odds as them revolutionary busters hev laid mr maller by the heels why don't you find him then said jorran tartly the job's in your hands and it's a paying one if mr maller doesn't turn up we'll lose the money i knows that m'pal none better an' i'm looking for him proper mr maller's bein' makin' free of that crib in popl'r street an' i dessay he's got onto trouble there can't you find out his whereabouts from some of these anarchists i'm goin' this very minit to pump one of 'em said vraik looking at his watch a swipy ole cove called trall mr maller he interdooced me to him an' tole me t'look arter him th' cove's loose in the shingle so i may get somethin' out of him has this man trall anything to do with the poplar street den he's shoe black and bottle washer there i thinks replied vraik jumping up i'd like to fin' all about that crib i would an' put a stop to their blowin's up there'd be noospaper pars and lots of coin in a job like that it isn't a bad idea said jorran reflectively keep your weather eye open vraik and let me know when i can sail in to help vraik winked and whistled through his teeth after which pantomime he swaggered into the street conscious of an exceptionally smart appearance but he never promenaded the main thoroughfares publicity was contrary to his principles of business like the rat he was he slunk through alleys and by streets down passages and into disreputable quarters until he found himself in poplar street here he strolled casually past no and took a stealthy survey of its battered front then he dived into the squalid depths of soho to cut the trail between himself and poplar street and came to the surface in the greasy little parlour of a public house in bloomsbury here jeremiah trall dissipated but still gentlemanly of aspect was seated at an oilcloth covered table with a glass of whisky before him he had arrived at his cross drop and was in no very good humour when his visitor sneaked into the dingy room i have finished three glasses while waiting for you said he in a complaining voice so you will have to pay i have no money y'never have anything except a thirst replied vraik sitting carefully down on a horsehair sofa lanlor' 'nother scotch cole for this gentleman and gin for me smart as y'know how provided with such refreshment the two men came to business that is vraik did for trall's energies were in the main devoted to a dreamy contemplation of the liquor before him i'm glad you've turned up mr trall said vraik raising his glass here's m'respec's t'you now you an' me's got to tork d'want t'make money i should not mind replied trall on whom the fourth glass was now exerting its soothing influence how can i earn it vraik came to the point at once by tellin' me 'bout mr maller said he bluntly the question had a paralyzing effect on trall he dropped his glass and his jaw at the same time turned a dingy yellow colour and cast a terrified glance round the four corners of the room i i i do not know anything about mr mallow he gasped vraik's eyes glittered and he lifted a lean admonitory forefinger mr maller he interdooced us pals an' he tol' you i was helpin' him with this case as you knows of so i arsks you agin ole cove where's mr maller i i don't know vraik still shook the warning finger lyin' agin an' at yr'age i'm ashamed of y' i noo y' was an anarchist but not hush entreated trall with another glance round some one may hear not they ole cove there ain't none of 'em about here you don't know you never know moaned trall shaking and white they hide everywhere they see everything they listen and punish lor' t' 'ear y' tork one 'ud think this was africay it is worse much worse there men fight openly here the brotherhood stabs in the dark hush oh hush have they stabbed mr maller in th' dark no he is safe quite safe oh said vraik briskly y' know that much do you now where is he i don't know don't ask me oh won't i but i will vraik bent across the table and spoke rapidly in trall's ear mr maller is in that poplar street crib no no he is not trall shrank back ole cove why d'y' lie he is there y' knows it if y' don't tell me 'bout him blest if i don't have the perlice into that den you you would not dare i mightn't but the peelers would lor' vraik wriggled himself jes' to think of the coppers raidin' that crib an' you bein' blown kite high for splitting on yer pals wot a sun'y school picter i have told you nothing moaned trall thoroughly terrified don't i know that snapped vraik ole cove i knows enough 'bout you an' them t'make y' tell m'all if y' don't i'll go strite to the perlice an' 'ave a raid on yer den then i'll say 't was you rounded on the lot trall moaned again and wrung his hands drink and terrorism had destroyed the man's brain and nerve the mere suggestion that vraik would tell the police about the soho house was enough for him if a raid were made there and he were denounced as an informer his life would be at the mercy of those who were truly merciless ave some more comfort said vraik who was watching the beads of perspiration roll off his victim's forehead then y' can tell me 'bout maller more whisky was brought trall dispensed with all water now he saw that he was in a cleft stick and since vraik knew so much the only way to save himself was to tell him more moreover trall hated drabble and if he could do so with safety to himself would with pleasure ruin him he stretched a trembling hand across the table swear you will keep my name out of the business he said looking round again i swear said vraik promptly bless y' i don't want t'arm y' i on'y wish t'save mr maller cos i won't git m' money paid if i don't now where is he tell me strite in that house in soho is he a prisoner ole cove yes he said too much so drabble and mrs arne had him locked up drabble and mrs arne repeated vraik who's they trall shut up promptly oh you don't know so much if you don't know who they are ho that's it is it squeaked the rascal with a puckered forehead now i jes' tell y' ole cove i knows enough to mess up you and them bomb pitchin' cusses so you speak strite who's mrs arne an' t'other chap anarchists faltered trall but it's not necessary to talk about them he went on rapidly but about mr mallow he is a prisoner in the soho house 'ow can i git im out you can't get him out except at the risk of your life said trall coldly vraik twisted his lean body and winced i've on'y one life not bein' a cat said he and i ain't goin' to chuck that away for mr maller's but i'm agoin' to 'ave 'im out if i rip that blessed shanty of yours from top to bottom there is only one man who can help you and that is monsieur rouge who's he another of 'em wot's he like tall and lean pale light dressed in rummy blue bags a furrin' cove ho i've seed him goin' t'yer rabbit 'ole and 'ow can 'e 'elp me trall rose heavily ask him if you dare to i'll tell him you want to see him right y'are he won't bring bustin' things with him no trall reflected where's lord aldean he asked mr mallow talked of lord aldean he's gone to the continong he'll be back soon then take rouge to lord aldean i don't think he'll deal with you my h'eye won't he spluttered the little man e've horty pride ain't it oh no well jes' you fetch this cove along 'ere to morrow at this time i knows where lord aldean lives an' i'll take 'im there i'll tell rouge he shall meet you here to morrow no larks min' said vraik sharply if 'e ain't 'ere the perlice 'ull be at soho y'bet rouge shall come but keep my name quiet i'm dumb y'treat me strite an' i'm yer pal if y'don't well y'know my game on this understanding the conference came to an end and trall rolled off half terrified half assured if the anarchists could be captured if his tormentor drabble could be imprisoned he would be free i can join clara and carlo then thought the poor sot and be happy for the rest of my life ah michael had the head of the tralls if only i had been like michael he heaved a sigh and finding sorrow thirsty work lurched into the nearest bar for another drink in the meantime vraik took a dive into the depths and wriggling westward in his own slimy way rose once more to the surface in the respectable neighbourhood of campden hill he knew that lord aldean visited at the house there and he had made up his mind that he would see the occupants and get them to communicate to lord aldean mallow's peril confident in his new clothes he stepped jauntily up to the door and rang the bell it was answered by the footman who remembered his face from his previous visit by means of a very free use of lord aldean's name in addition to some capital lying vraik succeeded in introducing himself into the presence of mrs purcell and tui to them he told his story that is to say as much of it as he deemed necessary to fetch back lord aldean to london mr mallow in the power of those wretches cried tui tearfully oh what will olive say what is to be done the officers of the law began mrs purcell when vraik cut short her stately periods 'scuse me lady he said but if the peelers come in there'll be a mess there will and mr maller 'ull git the worst of it y'jes wire the lor' chap to come back an' i'll striten out the rest yes yes cried tui let us wire to lord aldean at once the matter shall receive my immediate attention said mrs purcell and if this individual i'm orf lady but i'll come back an' see when the lor' chap 'ull be here it's dry work this tho' ain't it after which speech vraik retired with five shillings clinking in the pockets of his new clothes ten minutes later mrs purcell sent off a telegram of recall to lord aldean in florence chapter ii monsieur rouge is confidential at breakfast under his own roof tree aldean reviewed the events and incidents of the last six days without doubt they had been fast and furious but even qualified as it was by the news of boldini's trickery his work had been largely successful the more so considering that four days out of the six had been spent in travelling the telegram bringing such serious news of poor mallow had made it absolutely impossible to take any steps towards following the boldini pair first and foremost mallow's position whatever it might prove to be demanded his entire energies on arrival the previous evening he had listened earnestly and anxiously to mrs purcell's majestic account of vraik's visit but all that her ponderous periods succeeded in conveying to aldean was the mere fact that mallow was a prisoner he felt he must know more at once and he there and then despatched a wire to vraik which brought the little man to campden hill in an incredibly short space of time from him aldean learned all details among them that rouge had refused to move in the matter until brought into personal communication with himself he arranged with vraik to see rouge the next morning between ten and eleven he felt he could do no more that night save comfort olive with the assurance that mallow should be rescued at all costs moreover for once in his life aldean felt physically exhausted he hoped much from the mysterious monsieur rouge though at first thought it was difficult to see how so red a sans culotte was going to help him as a devoted anarchist it was the duty and no doubt the wish of rouge to keep mallow in prison and prevent all attempt at rescue rather than assist towards it yet trall who was plainly against the brotherhood had hinted that monsieur rouge could and would play the part of a beneficent deus ex machin the more he thought of it the more puzzled aldean became at this dodge of vraik's he finished two pipes trying to solve the problem and concluded by hoping as usual for the best monsieur rouge announced lord aldean's valet just as he was filling a third pipe all right show him in and jim standing with his back to the fire was face to face with his enigmatic visitor from the depths monsieur rouge thin sad faced and more colourless than ever glided into the room like an unquiet spectre he saluted his host with grave dignity aldean nodded and when the door was closed pointed to a chair i am glad to see you he said in french sit down please would you like to eat or drink or smoke if monsieur permits no i come to talk about mr mallow but certainly monsieur about myself also i discharge myself of a mission in thus presenting myself lord aldean who had not once taken his eyes off the white haggard face nodded again and sat down with easy grace his visitor slipped into a chair and placed his peaked cap on the floor beside him then he looked fixedly at the young englishman and waited to be questioned evidently m rouge was a discreet personage and not inclined to venture in further than he could withdraw nothing of the rash revolutionist about him did vraik bring you here asked aldean settling himself assuredly yes he gave himself the trouble to lead me to the door but monsieur rouge waved his hand he is gone i dismissed him it is not for him to hear what i would say what do you wish to say monsieur i would make you a confession i would deliver myself of a story but that later let us concern ourselves with mr mallow by all means is mr mallow safe safe and well but what would you rouge spread out his hands and shrugged he is in the power of madame she knows not mercy does she intend violence asked aldean hurriedly but what can i say as the votes go so will mr mallow be dealt with by the brotherhood attention monsieur your friend is brave but rash oh most terribly rash he comes to soho and he tells monsieur the doctor and madame that he knows of their wickedness about this money about this murder eh they are afraid that he may tell too much these brave ones and they call out 'spy spy' mr mallow fights well but he is conquered behold monsieur your friend most dear is a prisoner in a little room on the top of the house in soho have they ill treated him but no it is not necessary monsieur your friend eats and drinks like one of the aristocrats to morrow night there is a great meeting of us in the cellar oh a very great meeting mr mallow will be taken down to be judged all will be told and if they say 'kill' monsieur will disappear you don't mean they will murder him cried aldean aghast first they will murder him replied rouge significantly afterwards his body will disappear we have chemists who do these things mr mallow will be no more but the police eh what is it that can be done by them no body no murder no trial madame and monsieur the doctor they know well what to do there is no one else who has seen mr mallow enter no one trall can speak i can speak but with a shrug will he speak i hope so said jim anxiously you came here to speak behold monsieur i do so and why figure to yourself the reason rouge rose slowly from his chair i i am no anarchist you are no anarchist repeated aldean stupefied no i am become one to destroy them it is my vengeance vengeance monsieur rouge that is not my name i am emile durand citizen of paris who devotes himself to destroying those who would destroy the world ha ha superb magnificent monsieur with a sudden solemnity of tone i avenge my wife and my child why did the anarchists kill yes rouge covered his face and dropped back into the chair sobbing ah yes alas my dear sophie my little child the good god was silent and they died died and i i still live lord aldean looked with pity on the frame of the man shaken with the violence of his grief he succumbed to a veritable nerve storm which swept over him he wept he cried aloud he rolled in his chair until beaten and prostrate he fell back limply my poor fellow i am sorry for you some wine no no monsieur need not give himself the trouble no wine after a time a faint colour came back to him with an effort his muscles reasserted themselves and he pulled himself together but he kept his eyes fixedly on the floor and spoke rapidly though almost inaudibly monsieur five years ago i was a chemist in paris rue flaubert and my faith what a charming shop sophie my dear wife was there and the little one an adorable little one of four years ah how i loved them how happy we were monsieur that she devil of a madame commanded that paris should be terrorized by bombs she wished for a revolution close by my little shop a bomb was thrown one night it burst oh most terrible name of names shall i ever forget the bursting of that hell bomb it killed my sophie and my dear little therese his voice broke with a dry sob they were buried in the ruins of our happy home i lived conceive to yourself monsieur i lived yes his voice rose to destroy those who destroyed them rouge flung up his arms with a theatrical gesture of despair and paced hurriedly to and fro aldean did not speak he did not know what to say in the face of such grief yes monsieur i lived to plot vengeance i was ill long long when i was again myself i was not myself not emile durand but monsieur rouge the anarchist as you see me now i joined the brotherhood i took the oath i used my knowledge of chemistry to invent explosives i wormed myself into their confidence their counsels their secrets now i am the friend of that she devil figure to yourself monsieur the dear friend of madame i make the bombs i place them i work work work not for them but for myself they shall all die to morrow good lord cried aldean in horror do you intend then to blow them up with an insane light in his eyes rouge turned on him monsieur seeks to know what i care not to tell holy blue i know when to be silent to you i speak of monsieur mallow to him i have related the story of emile durand and he knows that emile durand will rescue him but rouge ha ha he broke into a peal of laughter not good to hear he will not rescue madame or monsieur the doctor no no not death in life for the innocent but death in life for her ah ha it will be a pretty sight frankly speaking after the first natural feeling of horror jim did not care two straws if the anarchists were blown to atoms or not on the whole he considered that some such wholesale destruction might be beneficial it would assuredly rid the world of a lot of these pestilential wretches and frighten the others moreover there was something ironically just in their being hoist on their own petard but about monsieur mallow he observed i shall save him replied rouge he is in a little room on the top with a skylight window on the slope of the roof in the next house i have a room with a little window too through which i can climb behold monsieur i take a rope well strong and to its end i fasten a stone i climb on the roof opposite to my window and throw the stone at the skylight on the slanting roof crash it falls in and monsieur mallow will knot it to his bed then he will climb up like the little cat along the slanting roof and round its corner until he slips into my window then i will lead him down the stairs to the door to the street there you will be monsieur and receive this unfortunate the plan of escape appealed to aldean as simple and skilful and safe enough forgetting their relative positions he sprang to his feet and shook rouge heartily by both hands thank you thank you he cried neither mr mallow nor myself will ever forget your kindness bah rouge shrugged his shoulders it is nothing what would you have monsieur mallow has been good to me he has given me money and kind words no monsieur i am no ingrate to permit one so beneficent to perish death is for the evil not for the good suppose his escape is discovered only when it is too late for them said rouge with a cruel smile they will not care for monsieur mallow's escape no my faith but what of yourself that shall be as the good god designs ask me no more monsieur but be you in that street at eight o'clock to morrow night i will bring your friend to your arms i swear it i emile durand by the head of my sophie by my little therese but when you have your friend go far there will be danger if we can ever repay you repay me rouge seized aldean by the hand and looked into his face with earnest eyes monsieur have masses said for the repose of the dear ones it is all i ask if the good lord give me death in my vengeance buy a mass for the poor emile durand he sighed dropped aldean's hand but still looked at him i promise said jim earnestly masses shall be said for sophie and the little one but i hope you will escape it is as the good god wills sighed rouge and walked to the door as he put on his peaked cap he looked back not a word of this to a soul said he hoarsely or your friend is lost i understand good at eight o'clock to morrow night in the street of poplaire there you shall see your friend and my vengeance when the man glided out jim turned to the mantelpiece and rested his forehead on his clasped hands thank god he muttered mallow will be saved i must tell olive chapter iii a terrible adventure in the old fashioned drama of medival complexion the prisoner usually the hero of the play was haled to the deepest dungeon beneath the castle moat the anarchists of soho having no castle and no moat and having moreover other uses for their cellar so far improved upon this bygone fashion as to sky their prisoners when they had any in the present instance mallow was perched in an attic on the top of the house the window was overhead set in the slant of the roof and the door was kept double locked a safer or more isolated cell could not well have been devised it was impossible to reach the skylight even by standing on the bed and it would have been a difficult task to break down that four inch door had the prisoner even succeeded in boring through the walls he could scarcely hope to escape by dropping fifty feet on to the pavement and let him shout and kick as he would no one other than his gaoler was likely to hear him he was absolutely powerless and his sole comfort lay in the thought that aldean was carrying on the campaign when jim returned he would find that mallow was missing and would undoubtedly guess that he was in the power of the anarchists if these latter did not kill him in the meantime as they might in self preservation aldean would surely apply to the police and have the soho house searched then freedom and nemesis upon his enemies this was one hope but there was yet another monsieur rouge who had brought mallow's food to him several times had on one occasion thrown off his revolutionary mask so far as to promise to aid the prisoner's escape and although mallow did not well see how he was to do this seeing that rouge had not divulged his scheme there was comfort in the thought that if aldean should fail he might succeed so he resigned himself to the inevitable and waited since his imprisonment drabble had not appeared nor indeed had mrs arne but on the sixth day when mallow was wondering what they were thinking of doing with him the lady herself came into his attic she re locked the door sat down on the one chair which she placed so that she faced mallow sitting on the bed and with the most amiable composure signified that she wished to converse the mere sight of her infuriated mallow but the memory of his previous folly taught him to control himself he was as self possessed as madame herself you are no doubt surprised to see me mr mallow began mrs arne in her unemotional tones but you will be less so when you hear what i have to say nothing you could do would surprise me madame after your daring to shut me up in this illegal manner oh madame shrugged everything we do in this house is illegal the brotherhood is outside the so called law and against it if there is any one to blame it is yourself as a spy you can hardly expect mercy i am not a spy then your interpretation of the word differs from mine you came here under the pretence of joining us from conscientious motives but your real errand is to criminate myself and the doctor in the murder of this man carson your intentions were dangerous to our personal safety ergo we lock you up can you blame us if the tiger has the tiger's nature who can blame him retorted mallow you killed carson i dare say you will not hesitate to murder me as to yourself said madame smoothly we will speak of that later but you are wrong about mr carson i did not kill him neither did drabble i find it difficult to believe that you and drabble he under the name of hain rented the house in which the man met his death he was stabbed with a knitting needle i have observed that you knit a great deal madame true but i confine my needles to their proper use the doctor and i left mr carson alone in the house when we returned he was dead who murdered him i know no more than you or the police finished madame with a sneer your explanation is too diaphanous to be convincing i did not come here to convince you said mrs arne dryly but to inform you that we intend to give you a chance to save your life save my life echoed mallow he could not repress a slight tremor your meaning has been murder then we never use that word but call it so if you will in three nights from now there is called a meeting of the brotherhood in the cellar of this house you will be brought down to take the oath and if i refuse then we remove you said madame in silky tones take the oath and you go free for you can break it only at the imminent risk of your life a hundred eyes will be always on you a hundred feet will dog your steps one rash word one hint to the police about our affairs and you die you dare not kill me madame laughed put that to the test if you will by refusing the oath said she indifferently for myself i think you better dead it is the doctor's wish that you have this chance i suppose you know the risk you run my friends will search diligently for me no doubt but they will not come here no one saw you enter this house if your friends are clever enough to trace you to this place they will find nothing we have chemists who can convert your dead body into nothing more tangible than gas you will vanish into thin air we have arranged all that you are a fiend i am madame death in life you know why i am called so no because those in authority live on my sufferance i have but to lift a finger and they die monsieur rouge whom you have seen is something more than a chemist he invents explosives he designs bombs mallow thought of the explosion in paris when the wife and child of emile durand were killed by the lifting of madame's finger and he drew comfort from the recollection a man with such wrongs would surely rescue him even at the eleventh hour the thought gave him courage to listen to the woman well whether you kill me or not the fifty thousand pounds are gone said he rather spitefully all your schemes have come to nothing all our schemes are not ended said mrs arne rising i see your friend lord aldean has not yet got back the money how do you know that i know that he is in florence trying to force my nephew into giving back the money which is ours your nephew the false carson yes carlo boldini is his real name he is a fool if he thinks to escape with that money from me but that reptile his wife is to blame for all that how dare you use such language towards mrs carson cried mallow indignantly i am speaking of clara trall my nephew's real wife miss bellairs is not that what what do you i should advise you to take the oath mr mallow and you may yet live to marry miss bellairs otherwise she shrugged and opened the door mallow tried to detain her but she drew her dress gently from his grasp and with a sudden dart was outside before he could fling himself after her the door was slammed to and locked the last communication of madame was skilfully made it left mallow in a storm of mingled joy and grief for the next two days he thought and thought over his terrible position and contrived a hundred ways to escape without having the resolution to attempt one on the third day at five o'clock rouge brought up his food mallow who had almost given up hope of seeing him again sprang forward with an exclamation of delight rouge laid a lean finger on his lips hush he whispered glancing at the door we may be overheard to night you will be brought to the meeting at ten o'clock is it not so yes yes said mallow madame told me but you will help hush no word monsieur to night at eight i will throw a stone at the window above it will fall inside here and a cord will be tied to it fasten the cord to your bed and climb up it get through the window and climb on the cord round the corner of the roof then slide down the slope the cord will lead you to my window i shall be there thank you thank you but the noise the falling stone is it not dangerous no no we shall all be down in the cellar the meeting begins at eight o'clock they expect me to bring you at nine but then monsieur you will be free milord will await you in the street lord aldean does he know then he knows all hush monsieur be careful to fasten the rope well if it slips and you roll off the roof into the street you are dead i will be careful how can i thank you hush no word monsieur rouge again laid his finger on his lips and slipped silently out of the room mallow was in darkness for lest he should fire the house he was not permitted a light but he cared little for that his heart beat high at the prospect of escape even in so perilous a way he shook his bed and found that the feet were clamped to the floor all the better it would hold the rope fast overhead the skylight was black in the night and mallow heard the raindrops rattle like small shot on the pane up through that black square was his sole way of escape with the risk of death if he made a false step but his courage was high and his nerve did not fail him never had the hours seemed so long the chimes of a near church marked them at century distances as it seemed to the strained ears of the prisoner he ate heartily of the food rouge had brought but the wine he left untouched he would need a cool head and a clear brain down below the wild beasts were no doubt creeping into their jungle he pictured them slinking through alley and by street in the rainy stormy night unclean prowlers menacing humanity in the depths of the earth they would scheme the destruction of the dwellers thereon innocent men and women little children even the kindly beasts of the earth all all would be gloated over by those now stealing to their wicked hole mallow was as brave as a lion and he burned with rage as he thought of those demons below at last eight o'clock clanged loudly in the night air then a dead silence mallow could hear his heart thump furiously still no stone fell and he clasped his hands in nervous dread lest after all rouge might have deceived him what if the man were in truth an anarchist what if his promised deliverance were not fulfilled suppose crash smash and a heavy body shot like a meteor through the window amid a rain of splintered glass the rope thank god with feverish hands he felt in the darkness for the stone and found it as he gripped the rope shook away more glass he listened for a moment to hear if the noise had attracted attention all was quiet joyfully and hopefully he groped for the bed and drew in the rope until it was taut at this end of it was prison at the other liberty and olive mallow bound it in tight knots to the iron framework of the bed he felt these over and over again to make sure they would not slip his life depended upon his care and he anxiously tugged and strained until he poured with perspiration at last the task was complete he ran his hand along the rope it was taut as a bobstay but at best it was but a frail bridge to safety yet it was his only one going to the door he listened again silence taking off his shoes and socks so that his bare feet might cling to the slates mallow sprang on the rope and swung himself upward the rain spurting in through the window splattered on his upturned face a piece of glass loosened by the swing of the rope fell and cut him but the man set his teeth and climbed hand over hand to freedom at last his head emerged through the skylight he saw the dark and stormy sky spitting rain and the light of the city glimmering through the mist luckily the skylight was large enough clinging tightly to the rope mallow thrust his shoulders against the glass it smashed splintered broke in a hundred fragments he was through in the fresh air on the roof of a house fifty and more feet from the pavement with desperate courage he clung to the frail rope and lay flat on the wet slates his toes digging into them to relieve the strain on the cord the blood surged and gushed in his head and he feared he would roll off insensible below was the abyss of the street above the sloping wet slates at an acute angle and over all the tearing sweeping drench of the rain driven before the gusts of wind then a new terror gripped his heart the edge of the rope lay amongst the sharp angles of the glass it might fray through and he would be dashed over the parapet of the house to swing like a spider at the end of a thread for a moment or so he lay flat in his soaked clothes prone on the slant then with a violent effort he drew up his knees and clawed his way along the rope his trousers were cut to ribbons his nails torn hand and foot and a piece of glass had cut one of his feet severely but he was too excited to feel any pain slowly but surely he drew himself along the slates ever ascending to the summit of the roof there was no moon to help him only a flurry of flying clouds and the steady thresh of the rain it seemed a century until he put out one hand and felt the ledge with renewed courage he lifted himself over this cutting his knees with the rough slates as he did so the next moment he was safe from the abyss and sliding carefully down the slant to a leaden gutter between two houses hush whispered a voice hold to the rope monsieur give me your hand mallow gave a gasp of joy and relief as rouge hauled him wet and exhausted through the window he would have fallen but that the man kept him upright by main force and carried him through the candle lighted room out on to the landing how he got down the stairs he never knew in the grip of rouge he seemed to be falling falling falling into eternal darkness then he must have fainted for the moment when he came to he was in a hansom his head lying on aldean's shoulder and aldean holding him with a grip of iron thank god oh thank god he heard aldean say as in a dream and you rouge how can i thank you adieu monsieur said a far away voice forget not the prayer for sophie and the little therse chapter iv the ishmaels of humanity at the head of a bare deal table set on a dais at one end of the cellar stood madame death in life this subterranean place of congress comprised the whole area of the building excavations had been made indeed extending some way below the street these were bricked in with stones rough whitewashed the low roof was actually the concrete floor of the basement it was supported by pillars and arches entrance and exit were effected through a trapdoor with a movable ladder there were neither chairs nor benches the brothers stood huddled together like sheep in a pen before the das the tribune of their infernal parliament the lanterns slung at intervals along the wall shed their faint gleam only to make obscurity more obscure it was curious to note on the faces of these men faces shaven and unshaven fierce and dreamy bearded and haggard one common expression of determination the flash of fanaticism was in the eye of every one of them some of well nigh each european nation were present here and their spokeswoman addressed them first in one language and then in another she was no longer the icicle she was the zealot she made herself felt solely by means of the sense of conviction which consumed her by the right of imaginary wrong she communicated her feelings to those about her she dominated them by sheer force of her own enthusiasm she renounced she denounced she exhorted our ruler is our enemy she declared we anarchists are without rulers we fight against all the usurpers of power against those who wish to usurp it our enemy is the landowner who keeps the land for himself who makes the peasant work for his advantage our enemy is the manufacturer who fills his factory with slaves our enemy is the state be it anarchical oligarchical or democratic its official and staff of officers magistrates police spies all these are our enemies our enemy is every thought of authority call it god or the devil in whose name the priests have so long ruled the people our enemy is the law which oppresses the weak by the strong to the justification and apotheosis of crime but if the landowners the manufacturers the heads of the state the priests and the law are our enemies we are theirs and we boldly oppose them we will reconquer the land and the factories we will annihilate the state under whatever name it may be concealed we will regain our freedom in spite of priest and law we despise all legal means they are the negations of our rights we want no so called universal suffrage since we cannot get away from our own personal sovereignty we cannot and will not make ourselves accomplices in the crimes committed by our so called representatives we will remain our own masters and he amongst us who strives to become a chief or leader is a traitor to our cause our work it is to conquer and defend common property and to overthrow governments by whatever name they may be called to do this we must work we must invent we must sacrifice brains money labour lives let all go for the attainment of our end and i have a thought a great and glorious thought a master thought which if put to execution will give us victory for the first time she threw out her hands and shouted air ships that is my thought conceive to yourselves brothers the value of this it is superb magnificent there are men of genius amongst you get you to work then with all your powers think strive experiment dedicate yourselves to the fulfilment of this great project succeed you shall have money time help what you will but succeed this is no idle dream i say it is the vision of my faith i see it now before me it rises from the ground it soars over the earth it poises like a vulture o'er the cities death death death it deals around unassailable unapproachable ever victorious our engine or right let this be your task comrades and france with her armies and england with her navies are puny and powerless against us the dreams of to day are the truths of to morrow have we not proof of it the steam engine the telegraph the phonograph the telephone all these were but dreams once to day they are with us again i say work toil beat your brains make the great secret ours solve the mighty problem of the air and make us victors over the kingdoms of the oppressors madame sat down one after another the men leaped up on to the das each in his own tongue striving to give vent to the frenzy she had raised within him they discussed the subject hotly the problem of arial navigation had plainly caught their fancy then up spake dr drabble dreams he said yes brothers at present these are but dreams but they are dreams which it is for us to make realities brothers i bring no inventive powers to this task but i bring you the sinews of war i bring money money amply sufficient for our present needs fifty thousand pounds a million and more of francs a million of marks a million of lire two hundred and fifty thousand dollars i give it to you all to you all to the brotherhood a roar of applause from the crowd then a dead silence at the words that followed they were as a douche of cold water on red hot iron but there are difficulties he said calmly not wholly unsurmountable a brother has this money gained through a scheme of mine of madame here to night that money should have been with us alas it is not drabble then paused to give due effect to his next words they came with a hiss the brother who has that money is a traitor no outcry this time no openly expressed disapprobation only a low deadly murmur of hatred and contempt every face expressed loathing for the traitor every hand itched to be at his throat the wild beasts seemed to crouch for the spring the traitor's name is carlo boldini said the doctor remember that name that you may engrave it on his tomb my nephew this man cried madame with a cruel smile my nephew whom i devote to death i spit on the traitor i stamp him under my foot to betray the great and glorious cause of humanity robber beast one lower than the brutes here you always to be trusted comrades of germany the cause has been by my nephew most vile of creatures betrayed when you beside him stand kill brothers of france the fraternity call upon you to execute the vengeance understand you the horror of betrayal children of robespierre i delegate to you the task of giving him the death down with the traitor death to him death death death death the word echoed in all languages through the cellar every one present man or woman doomed carlo boldini to death from that moment his aunt smiled approval she would have slain him herself for the cause brothers the doctor was on his feet again the traitor with a woman has fled to italy to florence he has been followed our brother who has watched him there reports that he and his wife have escaped in disguise to genoa our brother still follows the traitor has taken ship for south america with the money so hardly won on that ship our brother watches him wherever he goes the eye of the brotherhood marks him fear not vengeance shall blot him out from amidst the humanity he has so basely betrayed my comrades you volunteer to punish this traitor and the woman clara trall before any one could speak jeremiah haggard faced with terror in his eyes broke through the throng and flung himself on his knees no no he implored with shaking voice not clara not my little girl spare remove him cried a dozen voices and a dozen hands clutched the wretched creature and forced him to his feet weeping and imploring he was dragged mercilessly to the further end of the cellar the juggernaut of anarchy had rolled over his heart and crushed it without extorting a sigh or a glance from its fierce worshippers with terrible composure two men were then selected to hunt down boldini and recover the money and punish the traitor money and instructions were given to these trackers and they were bidden to return with their task completed without a word the pair slipped through the crowd through the trapdoor and went out into the world to pick up the trail of the victims from that moment boldini flying over the seas though he was stood doomed there was something devilish in the menacing silence in which the hunters departed to run down their prey my brothers said madame slowly i have a secret to disclose when this money comes back to us we go to switzerland to geneva there to work out our great invention here the police have heard of the brotherhood there is danger some day the tyrants will send their dogs here to drive us from this refuge we are ready for their coming our brother rouge has prepared this cellar for their reception here under this floor she pointed downwards there is a mine formed of a new explosive the invention of brother rouge we stand now on a volcano behind me she turned to the wall at her back behold this button it communicates with the mine by electricity one touch and all who are here would be destroyed the house would be destroyed and the street would be torn up this is the work of brother rouge a murmur of approval followed some of the weaker creatures looked down to the concrete floor as though their gaze could pierce to the deadly mine beneath and shuddered but the rest smiled grimly no one made comment of any kind madame continued rouge my brothers declares that he will sacrifice himself for the glorious cause when these dogs come here they will not find us we shall be in switzerland with wealth and brave hearts working out our scheme for the benefit of the slaves of humanity the police will explore the house they will descend to this cellar here where i stand they will find our brother smiling at his prey he will speak he will proclaim our glorious mission he will doom them to die for it one touch and our enemies are as dust rouge dies indeed but his glorious memory will live in our hearts brothers salute the name of rouge the anarchists shouted exultantly and the name of rouge with words of approval flew from lip to lip they did not pity him they did not lament his coming fate but they lifted up their voices and saluted the mention of his name all glorious there was not one man or woman present who would not do the same if bidden to save humanity my brothers we must die sacrifice a hundred lives so that one despot may fall from his throne over our graves the happy world of the future will live and those who have won freedom by our death will strew those graves with flowers everlasting to the glory of the cause shout my brothers shout and if needs be die drabble glanced at his watch turned a significant look on madame and spoke to night brothers a neophyte will take the oath to aid us he is a gentleman clever but rash he entered our house to spy he learned our secrets and should he go abroad much harm may be done madame says kill him i say not so if he refuse the oath then let him die if he take it i say let him live it is for us to win all we can to our brotherhood so that we may be strong this man can aid us therefore let us keep him if we can rouge brings him here in a few minutes and according to his wisdom shall he be dealt with there was an interval for rest the meeting broke up into chattering groups madame passed swiftly to the end of the cellar where the unfortunate trall still moaned over his niece with a look of contempt the woman stirred him with her foot rise she said sternly slowly he got on his feet a dishevelled tumbled object and muttered something about clara you fool said madame is that all you have learned with us to value your own miserable life or that of any other man or woman when we take the oath we surrender our lives to be saved or lost for the good of the cause clara has proved false she must die nothing can save her the wretched man sobbed have mercy he said oh have mercy it is no question of mercy but of necessity you are not fit to be here this is no place for tears leave the house i say when you are wanted you shall be sent for madame go said mrs arne sharply have i to speak twice trall's head dropped on his breast in utter despair and without a word he slouched through the throng and up the trapdoor as he went out he passed rouge about to descend rouge was alone grave colourless composed as he dropped down the brotherhood saluted him with a volley of applause where is the prisoner called out madame from the das he will be brought down by me shortly madame said rouge but i have come to make a communication to the society first i must make all safe so saying he removed the ladder and laid it flat on the ground then he took up his position in the corner directly under the trapdoor and leaned lightly against the wall to right and left the crowd parted so that madame and drabble saw him as down a long lane a lantern overhead shed a heavy yellow light on his pallid face and he looked as a ghost in the shadows the brotherhood was uneasy not at his action for he was a much trusted member but on account of his reference to making all safe even mrs arne seemed anxious rouge she cried what is the matter i propose to tell you madame he replied in a loud clear voice listen all of you to what i say you know me as rouge the trusted brother of the society five years ago in paris i was known as emile durand they looked at one another madame with a premonition that something was wrong half rose from her chair and drabble leaned forward anxiously in dead silence every one hung upon the speech of rouge he spoke in french the tongue best understood of the greatest number emile durand continued rouge in a calm even voice was a chemist in paris with a wife and child whom he dearly loved he was a good citizen a good father a fond husband the good god bestowed on him happiness but his happiness was destroyed by death what does this foolishness mean you will soon know madame said rouge it means that you and your cursed assassins threw a bomb into my shop you killed my wife and child wickedly and cruelly i lived but to avenge them to night i do so seize him drag him forward shouted drabble stand back murderer shrieked rouge his face scarlet with rage his eyes sparkling you see i have my hand on the wall i press it and the mine below is fired you will be a wail of terror rose from the crowd they shrank back from the man madame flung herself across the table less afraid than furious seize him she cried madly traitor kill him he lies the button which explodes the mine is at my back drabble whipped out a revolver and the crowd reeled forward mad with terror and anger who laid the mine cried rouge undaunted i did the wire yonder is a false one the real communication is here under my hand betrayed betrayed yelled madame throwing herself down shoot him kill him up swung drabble's revolver to a level with rouge's heart the man never flinched shoot and i fire the mine he roared your lives are in my hands and i doom them make your peace with the god you have offended for you are to meet him now with an oath drabble flung himself forward and fired but a terror struck woman seized his arm and the shot struck the roof the scene which ensued was indescribable the wild beasts groaned and howled some returning to the religion they had forgotten fell on their knees to pray drabble was overset and trodden underfoot all shrank back from their judge and executioner madame on the das colourless and silent stared at rouge she alone knew how lost all was o god rouge's voice rose clear and steady i am an instrument in thy hands to rid this earth of devils i sacrifice myself to avenge my wife and little one to help humanity i slay these demons judge them in their wickedness his voice became inaudible in the turmoil with uplifted hands they implored pity besought mercy and rouge smiled in the name of god he shouted madame rushed forward stumbling over the terror stricken men and women she dashed straight to the mark silent deadly pale her eyes flaming her hands extended to tear this man to pieces sophie therse cried rouge and as madame flung herself like a tigress upon him he pressed the button hard the next moment he was borne down by the woman the turmoil ceased there was a dead silence a terrible silence and the earth rocked and heaved and opened her mouth to vomit fire and the jungle with its wild beasts of humanity hurtled through the air with a roar of thunder belching flame and smoke the house split from cellar to attic the end of the world had come for them all and the smoke of their torment went up to heaven sophie and therse were avenged the sixth scene at casterwell chapter i an unexpected arrival a week after the catastrophe at soho olive and laurence were seated before a blazing fire in the manor house drawing room winter was upon them in earnest and the rose garden of july lay covered thick with snow and the naked woods surrounding fought with the whistling blast mallow had recovered from his cuts and scrapings but his nerves were still suffering from his recent experience there was no doubt that his system had received a severe shock although he pluckily made light of it even mrs purcell suddenly entering the room made him jump in his chair and olive laid her hand on his arm to soothe him the two had come together only within the last three days and at their first meeting mallow had kissed her that kiss was the outward and visible sign of their engagement my dears mrs purcell with voluminous skirts sank into a chair a wide spreading billow my dears she spoke ex cathedr i have been considering your position olive my dear outside this house you are still known as mrs carson have you formed any plausible scheme for the amelioration of this unpleasant state of affairs none mrs purcell i suppose i must tell the truth that seems to me an extreme view to take the truth is so very strange stranger than fiction chimed in mallow but if fact will poach on the domain of fancy our friends will have to enlarge their swallowing capacity i think it is best to be straightforward mrs purcell and make a clean breast of it from the arrival of carson the impostor to the soho explosion i regret to say mr mallow that i do not concur said mrs purcell shaking her turban exclusive honesty is not the best policy and in this case it would only provide the daily journals with sensational matter i am averse and i feel sure that you are also to our dear olive's name being in the mouth of the multitude there is no need to be too explicit then how am i to account for my marriage being a false one asked olive by telling the truth my dear within limitations say that the marriage was a nominal one contracted with mr angus carson in obedience to the expressed wish of your father add that during the honeymoon you unfortunately or rather fortunately discovered that mr carson was the husband of another woman and at once left him to resume your own name finally let it be known that mr carson and his true wife have left england together and will return no more mr carson you understand my love not signor boldini you would make no explanation demanded mallow assuredly not you are not bound to satisfy the curiosity of the public though indeed added mrs purcell so much as i would have you reveal should be sufficient to answer all questions moreover i most earnestly advise olive to accompany me abroad for a few months and at the end of that time to marry you mr mallow before returning to england then both of you can take up your position in this house without giving cause for scandal or public animadversions it is true people may talk about our dear olive's first marriage but for want of details which i advise you strongly to withhold such idle chatter will die of inanition there was good sound sense in what mrs purcell said a bare statement of the facts which enabled olive to reappear in society as mrs mallow was all that was necessary and none was better calculated to enunciate the facts than mrs purcell for one reason because she knew every one in the county worth knowing for another because her very prolixity made impressive what otherwise might have been looked upon as a bald and feeble narrative she would take care that the sympathies of one and all were with her beloved olive and when after a sufficiently judicious absence she returned to the manor house the wife of laurence mallow her reception would be something more than cordial what a relief sighed olive when the old lady had departed in triumph the whole thing has been quite a nightmare to me lately i am so thankful that mrs purcell has found a way out of it mrs purcell is a sensible woman said mallow warmly and her opinion carries weight what she says is perfectly true you were so unfortunate at first as to be placed in the position of marrying a man who was not your choice and further having married him of discovering the fact that he was already married the sequel is i think sufficiently obvious to the dullest of our neighbours at all events there is the whole business in a nutshell and it shall be for mrs purcell to present it to the county to crack no word need be said of any connection with these anarchist people thank goodness they and their diabolical schemes have been very effectually disposed of don't laurence olive shivered and covered her face it is terrible to think of how narrowly you escaped death dearest a miss is as good as a mile thanks to that poor fellow rouge i came through all right my only regret is that the death of mrs arne of trall and drabble does away with any hope of our learning the truth the reason for poor carson's murder will remain a mystery it is no mystery to me cried olive petulantly mrs arne killed him she denied it most solemnly i dare say such a woman would deny anything to gain her ends she would replied mallow judiciously but in this case she gained nothing by denial i am inclined to think she told me the truth until carson proved recalcitrant it would have been foolish for her to kill the goose with the golden eggs olive whoever killed carson the anarchists didn't well innocent or guilty then the wickedness has put an end to them that man rouge is a hero i agree with you but the world does not know of his heroism and never will the police the papers are absolutely at a loss to explain the explosion and it is my intention that neither jim nor i should enlighten them the morning planet declares that the anarchists were experimenting with a new explosive such an explanation is quite sufficient for the masses the classes and the quidnunc asses will not vraik say something what can he say save that rouge was one of the brotherhood it was only to jim and me that he revealed himself and his plans no vraik is safe enough i shall pay him and dismiss him you won't go on with the case then laurence mallow shook his head there are no clues he said surely you forget there are still two clues cried olive vivaciously what about the man who inquired at the p and o office oh no doubt he was an anarchist sent by drabble to learn when the pharaoh would arrive perhaps drabble himself in disguise i dare say whoever he was he was blown up with the rest of the gang no clue there olive then there is the packet lord aldean found in the sandal wood chest h'm mallow reflected there may be something in that of course it depends upon what the packet contains have you given it to mr brock no i thought of doing so to morrow he has been too ill to see any one lately what is his accident so bad as that it is as bad as it can be said olive emphatically he is old and not very strong besides he would insist upon being brought back to casterwell and the journey has shaken him the nervous shock has affected his heart so the doctor says that's bad poor old chap don't suppose he'll pull through come and see him with me to morrow laurence yes dear with pleasure we'll ask him about the packet i dare say he'll show us what is in it mallow rose and began to pace the room musing as he walked it might turn out valuable he said at length from the care carson took to conceal it it is evidently a document of importance i wonder why mr carson did conceal it because he mistrusted semberry replied mallow promptly depend upon it olive carson soon realized that the major was a shifty scamp and hid his papers where there was no likelihood of their being read i see no other explanation for their concealment i shall make a point of seeing brock to morrow he said looking out of the window and whistling softly laurence said olive who was still staring into the fire do you think dr drabble was blown up i'm certain of it as madame death in life's right hand man and general adviser to these rascals he would certainly not be absent from so important a meeting yes i think drabble has received the wage of his sins poor mrs drabble happy mrs drabble you mean she has been rescued from the torment of an unscrupulous bully besides drabble would have poisoned his children's minds he was in a fair way to ruining margery olive rose and came laughing across the room margery has improved she said with some amusement her anarchistic mood has passed she now concerns herself chiefly with religion at her age nonsense there must be a limit even to her precocity a child's religion of course margery is older than her years and very very clever as you know she now reads her bible goes to church and writes hymns on the model of keble i found her with keble's poems the other day poor child her father has quite unsettled her mind it's a lucky thing for margery and for the rest of the family that he's gone i suppose the news of his death will have to be broken to his wife but if mrs drabble is wise she will rejoice not sorrow oh laurence after all he was her husband the father of her children and a nice blackguard in either capacity hullo who's this tramp across the lawn stumbled a ragged guy fawkes grotesque and unsteady he laboured in the snow like a liner rolling in a cross sea at his nearer approach he raised his head those at the window started and stared eagerly laurence look a black beard a long beard can it be wait wait interrupted mallow and throwing open the french window he ran across the terrace down the steps with a yelp the man scrambled back but stumbled full length on the slippery crust of snow mallow gripped his shoulder as he dropped who the devil are you he said roughly mr mallow the ragged creature gave a howl of joy i'm i'm trall chapter ii the penance of margery i'm trall repeated the man staggering to his feet he plucked off a false beard thereby throwing into prominence the haggardness of his face trall echoed mallow as though taking in the man's identity for the first time good god i thought you were dead the man whimpered and fawned on mallow as a whipped dog fawns on its master i'm alive i'm trall he reiterated i'm so glad it's you mr mallow i thought they were after me but i'm trall you know me don't you you'll save me won't you i'm afraid of them' whatever is the matter laurence called out olive at the window who is it it's all right olive it's only trall i'll explain later go inside now good god said mallow again looking at the wreck of humanity before him alive after all jeremiah trall nodded and laughed vacantly his life of terror and strong drink added now to want of food and sleep had scattered the poor creature's wits he clung to mallow like a child reiterating his prayer for protection and ultimately sliding into an incoherent gabble disconnected though continuous seeing that nothing was to be got out of him in his present state mallow soothed him with repeated assurances of his safety he then led him round to the back of the house and had him supplied with food in another half hour the wretched man was safely tucked in bed with one of the men servants to watch over him the food and warmth and sense of security relaxed his nerves and shortly he fell into a deep sleep his relief had come just in time meanwhile mallow returned to the drawing room and explained the situation how trall had escaped death he did not know but he understood the man's instinct had led him to seek the protection of the only person who had treated him with kindness we shall hear his story to morrow concluded mallow and a queer one it will be unless i'm very much mistaken laurence do you think this can be the man who inquired at the p and o office he has a black beard false my dear assumed no doubt to escape the brotherhood although seeing they are all dead i can't understand what it is he fears it is quite possible he may be the man who inquired at the shipping office we shall know all about that in the morning and olive added mallow in lower tones as the servant entered with the tea say nothing about this for the present to miss ostergaard or the old ladies i'll tell aldean myself later on olive readily assented she had no wish any of them should be alarmed when they with lord aldean came in to tea no word was said about trall's strange arrival later on mallow found an opportunity for enlightening jim jove said the startled aldean how the dickens did he escape i can't say perhaps he wasn't at the meeting don't alarm the ladies jim we'll get it all out of him in the morning he's worn out now poor devil do you think he knows the truth about this carson business it's possible and probable at all events whatever he knows he'll tell me but in spite of all precautions it was not long before mrs purcell knew all about it her maids were of more than ordinary loquacity she immediately declared her belief that they would all be murdered in their beds and communicated her fears to miss slarge the two ancients reappeared in the drawing room in a nervous flutter and in the end if only to quieten them mallow thought it best to explain matters fully contrary to his expectations they were only the more alarmed an anarchist cried miss slarge tremulously with a bomb i don't think he has a bomb replied mallow gravely he is quite harmless miss slarge he hasn't strength just now to kill a fly has he rebelled against established authority demanded mrs purcell has he crime upon his soul his worst crime is hard drinking i'll look after him mrs purcell please give the servants no particulars mrs purcell expressed a pious hope that the manor house would be still whole in the morning but finally agreed that mr mallow had acted with his usual judgment and was quite right to succour the oppressed when after every one had gone to bed mallow and aldean visited trall he was still sleeping so they left him but early next morning mallow was in his room he was awake and professed himself much easier in his mind amid a profusion of thanks for all his kindness he told mallow how he had escaped the common fate through madame having ordered him out of the house i don't know how it all happened he said there was a mine laid under the cellar i know but i feel sure madame didn't fire it i hope they won't think i did it it was for fear of that i came down here you are safe enough here trall besides that section at least of the brotherhood is done for oh but they were not all there there are others two of them have gone after carlo and clara i protested but madame would send them and she turned me out of the place where are boldini and your niece now they have left genoa for south america one of the brothers followed them he wired to madame they had taken ship but he did not say for what port but they're as good as dead moaned trall the brothers who were sent after them had instructions to kill them oh let us hope they will escape said mallow soothingly by the way that disguise of yours trall did you wear it to visit the p and o office before carson arrived no mr mallow i was never in the p and o office in my life mallow looked searchingly at the man but saw by his simple denial and from his manner that he was telling the truth do you know any one else who went there he asked shifting his ground no i never heard of any one did dr drabble i am sure i don't know said trall plucking at the clothes he never told me if he did but drabble wore all kinds of disguises sometimes he wore a light wig at others a black one he was never twice the same i dare say it was he said mallow thoughtfully he was the person most interested in carson's arrival he is dead i suppose blown to pieces mr mallow he was in the cellar when i left not one of those present escaped alive they are dead in their sins mr mallow and black black indeed are those sins if i had not spoken for clara if madame had not well i have sins of my own to repent of god saved me for repentance i'm sure of that rouge was in the cellar of course he came down the trapdoor as i went up i liked rouge he hated the brotherhood as i did it might have been rouge who caused the explosion he laid the mine he knew how to fire it yes i believe rouge killed them all i am sure he did said mallow decisively mrs arne had nemesis at her elbow although she thought no doubt it was the devil but how did you know that i was alive and here rouge told me he said that he intended to aid your escape because you had been kind to him as he passed down the trapdoor i heard him say 'monsieur is safe' i didn't know what he meant at the time but afterwards i recollected he was speaking of you when i heard of the explosion i was nearly out of my mind i thought the surviving brotherhood would surely suspect me i went to your rooms to ask for your protection they told me there that you were at casterwell so i came down i walked the whole way i begged and slept out of doors oh the cold was bitter i knew you would protect me for you were always kind mr mallow always always and trall stretched out his hand timidly well now you are here you shall stay said mallow kindly they won't look for you here i dare say they think you perished with the rest and later on we'll see what had better be done trall sat up eagerly i know what to do i have my plans he whispered with a glance round as was his habit give me money and i'll go out to south america clara will look after me carlo has a lot of money drabble said so i'll warn them of their danger and we'll hide in the mountains they'll never find us there clara is so clever clara knows is she your only relative so far as i know i have a brother her father my brother michael but he may be dead he left his wife and clara many many years ago his wife died i looked after clara i had money then but when i met drabble trall burst into childish anger i hate drabble he made me what i am he was my curse i'm glad he's dead glad oh so glad if he'd only died before he ruined me i was once i am now oh and the man weeping senile tears dropped back exhausted on his pillow hush hush said mallow smoothing the bed clothes you are with friends now i will take care of you but don't say a word as to who you are or what you have been doing that might be dangerous even here no no not a word you won't let them get to me if they come they won't come trall believe me they think you dead dead echoed trall his wits wandering dead dead yes these many years drabble killed my soul dead yes the man is dead the beast lives on with tactful words and many promises mallow managed to calm him and dispel his morbid mood the man was not really so ill as worn with fatigue and stupefied with terror rest and a belief in his safety were the medicines he needed and these were now forthcoming his narrow escape seemed to have turned his thoughts towards religion for he requested the use of a bible with childish eagerness mallow left him grappling desperately with the psalms striving to extract hope from the more comforting i am glad the poor man is better said olive when she heard mallow's report he seems a harmless creature there is good in him but circumstances and drabble have done their best to destroy it well let him stay here and rest laurence see i have the letter for mr brock we must call on him now talking about dr drabble added olive as they stepped out into the crisp air i think i ought to call and see his wife and tell her do you think that is wise asked mallow dubiously of course it is wise suspense is worse than the truth besides she is without money and food i had to send provisions to her yesterday the sooner she understands her position and makes the best of it the better how can she make the best of it i shall help her and lord aldean has promised his assistance good fellow you must let me do something too my help is yours laurence said olive softly a brisk walk soon brought them to drabble's untidy home in a room more slatternly than ever they found the unsuspecting widow she was if possible more worn and downcast than before i'm sure i don't know what i should have done but for your kindness she said to olive but i expect the doctor will be back soon it is too bad his leaving me destitute like this the tradesmen won't send in food without money dear mrs drabble said olive touching her arm gently will you take me to your room i have something to tell you the significance of olive's tone was not lost upon her i hope hope nothing is the matter with the doctor she said tremulously i'll tell you in your own room insisted olive leading her to the door excuse us won't you mr mallow called back the widow and if the children should come in send them away danton is in bed with the mumps and margery has been converted please talk her back to some sense mr mallow if you can dear dear my children are so dreadful mallow sat quietly amid all the litter in no wise inclined to laugh at these last words albeit there was some humour in them on all sides there was the noise of children creeping scuffling and whispering at times a head would pop round the corner its owner meeting mallow's eye would shriek and scuttle away and then would be swift scampering and a continuous patter as of hard little hoofs on a frosty soil shortly the door swung open to its widest and margery appeared so astonishing a spectacle that mallow could not but stare at the child she was draped in a sheet her feet were bare and she carried a lighted candle i'm doing penance announced margery in solemn tones i should stand at the church door and proclaim my sins but mother won't let me your sins said mallow suppressing a strong desire to laugh have you any dozens i have sinned deeply sighed this guilty little person i have been cross i have stolen i have perverted the truth would you like to hear about any particular sin mr mallow i should be delighted margery only don't shock me too much margery waved her taper this sin was done to olive she chanted listen oh people to the sin done to olive i gave her a golden ornament of fine gold with wrought work she asked where i obtained it i declared that i had taken it from the desk of my father that was a lie that was a sin i did steal it wicked woman that i am but i stole it from the study of mr brock margery mallow jumped with sudden interest did you find that wrist button in mr brock's study margery dropped her candle and became the child she was even to the length of bursting into tears yes she sobbed i was wicked i went to see mr brock he left me to play in his study and i found the button in the drawer of his writing table i i i took it chapter iii mr brock and the letter margery's conscience had now the upper hand of her all her acting was cast to the winds it was wrong to take it she wept i can see that now mr mallow but i did not think father said that all property should be shared in common so i thought i would share with mr brock he has very nice property she added navely was this wrist button put away carefully no o o it was lying loose in a drawer i didn't think it was of much value i am very very wicked mallow drew the child towards him and consoled her don't cry margery he said wiping her eyes with his handkerchief a fault confessed is half redressed did you tell mr brock that you were sorry yes i told him that i was converted and that i repented of my wickedness he said it did not matter that i was not to trouble about what i had done then don't trouble dear there there it's all right so you have given up the anarchism i am a christian now i believe in before margery could state her religious beliefs olive looking rather anxious came into the room laurence would you mind calling on mr brock alone mrs drabble is not well enough to be left at present oh is mother ill cried margery scared she is not very well dear put on your stockings and shoes child you will take cold laurence i'll go to mr brock is that the letter olive thank you how long will you stop here until mrs drabble is better when you return home laurence please ask miss slarge to come here margery the child was shaking and white please please what is the matter she asked catching olive by the hand olive looked at her in silence and with pity if it had been a painful task to inform mrs drabble of the truth it was a much more terrible one to inform margery with a nod to mallow she led the child from the room and laurence feeling somewhat de trop in this scene of domestic grief slipped away not ill pleased to have the opportunity it was vexing in one way that olive could not come with him but on reflection he could not regret her absence at the corner of the vicarage he was confronted by a she cerberus in the person of mr brock's deaf housekeeper this grim and lean spinster might once have been a human flower but the sap was now gone out of her and she had withered on the stalk in a state of single blessedness even mallow's good looks and polite inquiries failed to impress her she was the sworn enemy of all male kind at the outset she declined to admit mallow indeed he's much too ill she said but in the end she was so far prevailed upon as to consent to convey a message this resulted in prompt permission for the visitor to enter the sick room whither the sour spinster led him with obvious reluctance she closed the door on him with a bang and returned to vent her ill temper in the kitchen the vicar had transferred himself from his bedroom to the study he was lying on a sofa drawn close up to the window his eyes were unnaturally bright and sunken and his skin was the colour of wax the few weeks of confinement to the house had aged him inconceivably but he appeared to be in good spirits and received mallow most cordially you find me much afflicted mr mallow said he cheerfully but i am not without hope of recovery i contrive to keep up my spirits which is i suppose a greater preventive of inanition than the most stringent of medicines i am indeed glad to know you are better mr brock will conversation tire you not at all it is a pleasure to converse intelligently how is mrs carson miss bellairs is quite well said laurence prepared for this question brock turned an astonished look on his visitor but why do you call olive by her maiden name because that is her name for the present she is not carson's wife not carson's wife man i married them myself said the vicar with a searching glance not unmixed with uneasiness true enough mr brock but i am sorry to tell you that carson has proved a scamp and a bigamist at the time he married olive he was already the husband of clara trall the maid they have left for england and olive has returned here as miss bellairs she is shortly to be married to me angus already married gasped brock when he took in the full import of it angus the son of an upright man act so basely surely surely there must be some mistake i am afraid not lord aldean followed the runaways to florence and saw them together they confessed their marriage but why did angus so deceive olive mallow shrugged to get her money no doubt he said carelessly it will come to you now mr brock since the marriage has not taken place alas i fear i have done with all use for worldly goods mr mallow i am not so strong as i thought i was my heart has been weakened by my accident and any sudden shock would probably be fatal to me if this money does come to me now it will not remain with me long for my days are numbered nil desperandum said mallow not very originally you have years of clean living behind you sir and may mend sooner than you think after all you are better off than drabble he has met with a violent death in common with many others of his kidney drabble dead well i am not surprised i have been wondering if he was in that soho explosion of which we have read lately as that was his town address it struck me that he might possibly have been ah sighed mr brock a terrible end to a mistaken life but i thought that drabble was more of a socialist than an anarchist he was everything that's bad said laurence shortly olive is now comforting mrs drabble poor soul by the way mr brock margery told me about that wrist button dear dear the poor child must not worry about that i forgave her taking it children will finger things and margery's mind was quite perverted by her father's peculiar views still he added with a smile margery really had more right to it than i it originally belonged to drabble what did you get it from him then as a gift yes i saw it lying on his desk one day and took it up to examine it as it was of indian workmanship i asked him to give it to me as a curiosity i was a missionary in india once you know yes i know did drabble give it to you willingly certainly i should not have taken it otherwise it is a pretty thing margery tells me that she gave it to olive olive wears it as a brooch replied mallow gloomily he was distinctly puzzled he noticed too that the vicar was half dozing and felt that perhaps he was overtaxing his strength well i must be going now mr brock said he producing dr carson's letter my principal reason for coming was to hand you this what is it asked brock taking the blue envelope drowsily a letter from your old friend dr carson brock woke up with a start he was clearly agitated from a dead man what does it mean a message of some import no doubt said mallow young carson brought it home with him but forgot to deliver it a voice from the grave muttered brock unheeding his hands were busy with two papers a closely written letter and a dozen long pages of foolscap of aggressively official appearance mallow's fingers itched to take them up but he judiciously restrained himself and watched the vicar skim his eye over the letter its perusal seemed to move him greatly wrong wrong he said folding it up better to let the dead past bury its dead and shuffling the papers into their envelope he slipped it under his pillow mallow was struck by his remark it tended to confirm his long entertained suspicions mr brock he asked after a moment was there a secret in the life of the late mr bellairs why should you think so said the vicar nervously i have not forgotten about the sealed letter which forced olive into marrying carson she asked you what its hint of evil meant you told her to take no notice of it that was her best course said mr brock still agitated so long as she married angus there was no need for her to trouble about the letter then there is a secret insisted mallow mr brock shifted uneasily whose life is free from sin he said in low tones yes there is a secret had it to do with olive's marriage yes if she had refused angus there might have been trouble what kind of trouble don't ask me said the vicar with a shiver i must ask you olive guesses that there is a secret and she wishes to know it she shall never know it from me said the vicar his face more pallid than ever i say let the dead past bury its dead you said that before when you read that letter the secret is told in that enclosed document yes said brock reluctantly then olive must read it i must read it we must know the truth the vicar remained silent and his brow wrinkled who gains knowledge gains sorrow he said aphoristically it will do neither you nor olive any good to learn the follies of a young man however i will read the document and if i can legitimately do so i will send it to olive is the secret so very terrible then it is very terrible is her father mr mallow protested the vicar wiping his wet forehead i have said all i intend to say until i read this letter if i can send it to olive it shall be sent please leave me i i have overtaxed my strength touch the bell please as you go out although mallow would fain have stayed there was nothing left for him to do but to obey this peremptory request he could not but acknowledge that mr brock was acting in an eminently reasonable way a secret of such moment as this appeared to be could not be communicated hastily and without due consideration when next he saw olive mallow told her what she might expect with characteristic firmness she chose to abide by her decision i must know the truth she declared at whatever cost so long as you and i are together laurence nothing can hurt us you tempt the gods my dearest replied laurence and sighed the events of the last few months had shaken his nerve and he was apt at times to give way to despondency mr brock did not seem in a hurry to come to his decision one two three days passed before word came to the manor house having implicit faith in the vicar's judgment mallow did not urge him at all he did not even go near the vicarage but curbed his impatience and that of olive as best he could virtue was rewarded if reward it was for on the fourth day the document was delivered to miss bellairs with a letter from the vicar i send you the history of your father in india wrote mr brock though it is somewhat against my better judgment i do so however as i can guess that your curiosity will allow you no rest i give you the opportunity of appeasing it still even at this eleventh hour i would most earnestly advise you to put the enclosed paper in the fire unread its perusal can only give you pain and remove from its pedestal the idol of your youth all this and much more mr brock wrote and mallow read he was alone with olive in the library he looked questioningly at her she was silent and for answer placed the document in his hands am i to read it he asked olive bent her head as you think wise dear or shall we burn it as mr brock advises unread olive clasped her hands tightly together the question was a weighty one she hesitated then she crossed the rubicon read she said in low tones at whatever cost read mallow silently spread out the paper and began chapter iv the treasures at kikat i alfred carson md who relate to you this story do most solemnly swear to you by all a christian gentleman holds most sacred that though stranger far than any fiction it existed in fact and that the relation of it here set forth to which my signature is duly appended is in each and every particular true at the time these events occurred i occupied the post of physician to the rao of kikat which was an unconsidered kingdom in the northern part of india i say 'was' advisedly for since the year of the mutiny it has been absorbed in our asiatic empire but in the date of the facts herein related it was still an independent state reigned over by rao singhapetty it is true but free and wealthy nevertheless still the rao in a small measure was tributary to the heic and it was to release himself from a nominal payment that he engaged to take part in the great rising to his folly in this respect this story is due in those days i was young poor rash and ambitious yet not without i think good parts mental and moral if i failed to control the one by the other the blame for such must lie with michael trall he was one of those rascally adventurers who then infested india in the hope of becoming nabobs fertile in resource of great courage and one of the most unscrupulous scoundrels who ever played the part of mephistopheles for the seduction of weaker spirits to ruin and crime whence he came i know not i conclude his past life was too disreputable to be disclosed but my knowledge of him dates from the year when he appeared at the rao's court and used his impudent arts to secure an ascendency over the mind of that weak potentate there he came into contact with me and with bellairs mark bellairs my dearest and oldest friend had come out to india with me he was then in the army but having quarrelled with his father his allowance was cut off and he was forced to sell out i suggested that he should travel eastward in my company and turn his military knowledge to some account at the court of some petty rajah as there was nothing for him to do in england he agreed to try his luck in the east and together we arrived in bombay with no money and great ambitions of our adventures i need not speak as they have nothing to do with this story but we wandered here there and everywhere until fortune brought us to kikat here as the rao was in need of a resident physician he engaged me and afterwards finding that bellairs had been in the english service he placed him in command of his small army i swear that before the meeting bellairs and i were quite content with our positions we had power the salaries were large and the rao was our very good friend in a few years we hoped to make our fortunes and return wealthy and honoured to the mother country but for trall we might have continued in the straight path but like the belial he was he drew us from it to earn money and lasting shame i must admit that trall was a most fascinating man handsome strong clever full of conversation and tact he had acquired complete power over singha then finding that we had no little say in matters of state he set his clever wits to work for our conquest not without success no doubt it was weak of us to yield but the man had a tremendous strength of will and a power of fascination which could control and did control all who personally came in contact with him remember both bellairs and myself believed him to be an honourable gentleman and it was not until we were well entangled in his nets that he threw off the mask then it was too late there is ever an exception to a rule and an exception to the well nigh universal popularity of trall was to be found in the person of the rev manners brock a missionary who had engaged himself in the hopeless task of converting the kikat heathen the pleasant manners and simplicity of brock made him a great favourite with us all even the rao liked him in spite of his christianizing propensities and placed no barrier in his way with the people brock was candid almost to the verge of folly he told us how he stood alone in the world without parents or relatives made us acquainted with all the details of his early life as a sizar at oxford as a poor london curate and made a frank declaration of his 'call' to enlighten the idolaters of india i knew brock's life as well as i did my own and felt great respect for his principles and zeal trall was studiously affable to him and tried his hardest to fascinate him into obedience but somehow brock managed to avoid his snares he kept out of trall's company undermined his influence with the rao which was exercised for no good you may be sure and altogether showed our belial plainly that he considered him a rascal naturally trall grew to hate him and would willingly have done him an injury but as singha protected the missionary open warfare was out of the question however trall watched his opportunity and it came at last the mutiny with it when all india blazed with fanaticism from north to south rao kept himself and his kingdom out of trouble although he did not go so far as to side with the english he adopted a neutral attitude and no doubt would have maintained it to the end but that trall ever at his elbow persuaded him to revolt singha did not declare open war against the foreigners he could scarcely have done so while an englishman headed his army but he tampered with the mutinous princes corresponded with them and declared that he wished to be rid of his tributary necessity with devilish ingenuity trall conducted the whole intrigue and kept urging singha openly to declare himself bellairs and i protested at first but in some way i can hardly say how trall involved us in his schemes what would have been the end of it had the rao taken the field i hardly know but he hesitated and hung back until it was too late the mutiny was suppressed and puppets at delhi were driven into exile and with them trall's hopes of becoming the vizier of an eastern king for a while he raged furiously over his disappointment then making the best of a bad job he began to look about him how best to turn the tide of affairs to his own advantage it is at this juncture that bellairs and i come into the story the troubles at an end singha naturally wished to make his peace with the victors it is true that he had not declared himself an enemy but he had intrigued deeply he had written compromising letters and what with the knowledge of myself bellairs and trall there was evidence ample to have him dethroned and exiled he grew afraid of what might happen to him and implored us all to help him at this critical moment trall showed himself in his true colours i have mentioned the compromising letters and treaties with mutinous rajahs well trall had kept copies of these and also possessed some of the originals if these documents had been shown to the heic or to sir henry lawrence there is no doubt that they would have ruined the rao beyond all hope of keeping his kingdom singha knew this and so did trall so did bellairs and i for the letters were shown to us trall proposed to blackmail the rao we refused and then it was he unmasked his batteries the man as we then discovered was a skilful forger and had signed our names to many of these letters besides the actual signature of singha if he was guilty we were also and in a worse degree seeing that according to the forgeries we were ready to massacre our own countrymen it is impossible to explain how deeply we were involved but trall showed us clearly that if we did not work with him he could and would ruin us the choice lay between ruin and crime for in no way could we have proved our innocence trall had the letters and treaties with the rao's real signature and the false ones of myself and bellairs he had provided himself with more than a dozen witnesses to swear that we were renegades to the british cause he had entangled us in the political criminality of the rao and we saw very plainly that our lives were ruined should the documents ever reach the governor general bellairs and i took a night to choose between our ruin and crime next morning i blush to set down the fact we chose shame consider i pray you our position trall as i have shown had us completely in his power guiltless we should have appeared guilty and would have been punished and despised perhaps shot by our own countrymen no declaration of innocence would have done away with the forgeries the evidence of our guilt as conspirators with the rao against the heic was down in black and white and only our word on oath contradicted it we were as the saying goes in a cleft stick mere pawns shifted on life's chess board by an unscrupulous intriguer there was nothing for it but to obey trall if we wished to save our names from the world's knowledge as those of traitors and renegades the devil and the deep sea proverb applies to our position well as i have said we gave in and trall proceeded to round off his plot money was what he wanted and money he intended to have even though he were to share it with bellairs and myself he saw singha and fixed his price for the inculpating documents the price was three diamonds famous not only in kikat but throughout india three stones of the purest water they were a large gem and two small ones valued together at some forty thousand pounds more or less trall intended to keep the most valuable gem for himself and to give us the other two 'and i should advise you both to clear out then' said he 'for there may be trouble' he was as cool in the midst of all this rascality as though he were engaged like brock in missionary enterprise when he went to have it out with singha we expected he would be killed there and then but trall knowing his risk knew also how to circumvent it of course the rao was furious and amazed when trall made his statement and demanded his price and of course being an indian his first instinct was to kill the man who had deceived him but trall was ready with a counter move he told singha that the incriminating papers were in the hands of a third person and that if he killed him these would be sent on to the government at calcutta as this meant ruin singha was not fool enough to resort to violence and seeing no way out of the snare he gave up the diamonds they were called the treasures of kikat and were guarded by the priests then the blackmailer promised that the papers should be sent back to singha two hours later he presented us with our share and slipped his own jewel into a chamois leather bag 'now' said he 'you had better skip i'm off myself' but before he could get away the rao made trouble afraid lest trall should not return the papers he made a clean breast of the whole thing to brock the missionary was fearfully angry and without trusting himself to trall's mercies started straight away for calcutta there to lay the whole matter before the government he promised to get singha out of his trouble and have trall arrested for his wickedness there was no mention of bellairs or myself as the rao did not know how trall had been plotting with us brock got away though trall heard of his mission through his spies and followed him determined to stop his visit to calcutta at any cost should he prove unreasonable bellairs and i remained with the rao and made up our minds to get away at the first opportunity with our diamonds we did not know what might happen and thought it best to be on the safe side and save our skins at all events in time singha received the papers and of course saw our signatures he applied to bellairs for an explanation i was absent at the time so bellairs saw the rao alone what took place at the interview i hardly knew for bellairs was never very explicit but it seemed that singha accused bellairs of betraying him and tried to stab him on the spot the end of the struggle was that bellairs passed his sword through the rao's heart and then came to tell me what he had done as i saw that everything might come out i advised immediate flight that same night we both left kikat shortly afterwards we learned how singha's heir had found his father's dead body and the treasonable papers fearing that these if exposed might cost him his newly acquired throne he wisely determined to let sleeping dogs lie whether he knew that bellairs killed singha or not i cannot say but he probably guessed that we were implicated from our disappearance his measures were prompt and judicious he burnt the papers gave out that his father had died of apoplexy and took possession of the state as there was nothing to compromise he made matters right with the government and when singha's corpse was burnt on a pile in accordance with the hindoo custom there was nobody to show the violence of the death the new rao did not pursue in case we might get him into trouble he simply let the matter die out and commenced his reign with the support of the government i believe if the truth were known he was glad his father was dead what became of trall i never heard but mr brock was not afterwards molested by him he was probably satisfied with his spoil mr brock returned to england and was presented by bellairs with the living of casterwell but before leaving he put the whole facts of the case before those in power but they taking into consideration that singha was dead and that trall had decamped and moreover having regard to the then distracted state of the country decided to let well alone thus it was all made very easy for singha's son the priests i believe made some fuss about the removal of the treasures of kikat but the new rao soon put an end to them he judged it better to lose the jewels than his throne and so the trouble ended without in any way inculpating either bellairs or myself i made up my mind that i must part from my friend my friend no longer for i could not forgive the murder of singha nor would i touch the money which had been gained by the price of dishonour and of blood i gave my diamond to bellairs and turning my back on him went to live like a hermit in a corner of the himalayas that my nerves were shaken by my late troubles i do not deny and i must also state that trall's treachery singha's death and bellairs' wickedness disgusted me with the world i felt the only life i could endure was one of solitude bellairs returned to england made his peace with his father and shortly after became the squire of casterwell with brock as his rector trall had dropped out of sight with his ill gotten gains he may be dead or alive rich or poor i know not what is more i do not care the man ruined my life soiled my honour and i hate him years afterwards i grew weary of my solitude and married a young eurasian lady she died when my son angus was born and alone once more i devoted myself to the education of the boy as he grew up he displayed such talents that i reflected seriously how best to advance him in life he was poor i was old and when i died angus would be penniless then it occurred to me how wrong i had been in giving up the diamond for my boy's sake i resolved to make peace with bellairs the more so when i heard that he also was married and was the father of an only daughter with sudden resolution i wrote to casterwell and proposed that my son should marry his daughter and that the value of the two diamonds should be given to them when they became man and wife to this bellairs replied that the gems were not so valuable as we had thought he had sold both for thirty eight thousand pounds and this money he had deposited in the bank to accumulate his father had left him well off so he had himself made no use of the money with the interest that had accrued he said that it amounted to some fifty thousand pounds he intended to invest this and would share the income arising therefrom with me but he refused to let his daughter marry my son i replied that he was at liberty to retain the income to himself i told him that i would not touch the money but that if he did not consent to the marriage and on the marriage day give to my son angus the capital sum of fifty thousand pounds i would write to the home government and divulge the murder by him of the rao singha on this bellairs gave in and consented to the marriage i drew out the clause relating to the money which was to be incorporated in his will and sent it to him out of the fifty thousand pounds which angus would receive on his marriage with olive bellairs he was to allow her a yearly income of a thousand pounds this i considered was fair and bellairs thought so too for he made his will as i directed the present document i now send to manners brock by the hand of my son angus i wish him to deal with it in this fashion if the marriage takes place it is to be destroyed if olive refuses he is to show her this statement and threaten to publish it unless she consents to the match bellairs is now dead and it is possible he may have tricked me in some way but i am not to be tricked unless my wish is carried out this story is to be laid before the authorities they will then confiscate the rao's money and publish to the world the wickedness of bellairs it lies with olive to save the money and protect the memory of her father by marrying angus if she declines well she knows what will happen brock whom i admire and respect will never let my son lose the money that i wish him to have and by our old friendship i conjure him to obey me angus knows the story as it is here set forth and will respect and aid towards the consummation of my wish for the rest i maintain i am more than liberal in allowing my son to marry the daughter of a murderer signed alfred carson md chapter v let the dead past bury its dead the insulting peroration of dr carson's effusion was suppressed by mallow for olive was already suffering severely under the knowledge of her father's misdeeds he was a murderer a blackmailer a thief he her dearly loved father whom from a child she had set up as her idol who could cherish nay even respect the memory of a man guilty of what she now learned he had been guilty small wonder indeed that he had implored her to conceal that guilt even though it cost her a life's happiness in the doing she had a rigid sense of right and wrong and despite herself her idol crashed from off the pedestal whereon she had so lovingly set it up just as mr brock had prophesied it would and with it went all her dearest memories all the recollections which she had cherished for so long which in the cherishing had become a part of her self perhaps even the better part she wept bitterly at the ruin of her world and mallow let her weep he felt it was better so and when she grew more composed he left her holding over the fire as he rose from his seat the leaves that had brought such sorrow with them she divined what he would do and sanctioned it with a slow bend of her head and then the flames destroyed for ever the tangible evidence of mark bellairs' sins when mallow returned she was more herself she had dried her eyes would you like to talk about this olive no dear no of what use nothing we can say can alter such truths as these perhaps not but we can at least hide them no one save you and i knows this story no one must know it olive for your father's sake mr brock knows it mr brock yes but we can trust mr brock indeed he has done all a man could do to spare you i feel i am in no small degree myself to blame for the knowledge of this having reached you at all i urged him to it oh it is better i should know it laurence at least we know the worst now nothing oh surely nothing could be worse than this poor father is gone but laurence dear i have you laurence i always have you thank god for you laurence but remember olive if your father sinned he repented bitterly repented yes laurence i know but he was willing i should be sacrificed to hide his sin i who loved him so that hurts me terribly laurence that is not easy to forgive is it not possible that he agreed to this man carson's proposal to save you from the truth that you might never know even so it was for his own sake for his memory's sake may be yes but that was only natural olive would it not be his great desire that you should think the best of him and after all dear this act of your father's was the act of days long bygone thirty years or more ago and from then to the time of his death he led an upright honest life think of him not as trall's accomplice dear but as the father you knew try and do that olive will you if you wish it laurence yes i will try and so the fateful missive was destroyed and they made up their minds that they would put their knowledge behind them and slip back again into the old life as though it had never been their hegira was before them from their marriage they would date it and that was to be very soon now yet there were details which must be settled before they finally dismissed the past and with these olive prepared to busy herself great as was her sorrow she did not allow it to sadden her she determined it should permeate her every day existence she was quietly cheerful and ever amiable to her guests she was kindly sympathetic to aldean and tui and listened with all patience to the disquisitions of miss slarge even unto the doings of ala mahozim the god of fortifications of mrs purcell she saw little in these days that good lady was indefatigably scouring the county renewing early friendships and conducting an orderly canvass in favour of olive and to the denunciation of her bigamist husband maids and matrons lifted up their hands in horror at mrs purcell's revelations men old and young expressed violent desires to have carson within boot reach so vigorously did the clever old lady raise the countryside in olive's favour that the tide of sympathy soon set strongly towards the manor house and miss bellairs mrs carson no longer on friendly tongues was pitied petted called upon and duly wept over as a dea ex machin mrs purcell had been successful far beyond the thanks of those whom she sought to serve meanwhile trall had picked up his health in no small degree and with it a courage long foreign to his timid nature but lest he should revert to his old habits mallow feared to let him out of sight he kept him always within the grounds of the manor there he pottered about from day to day and the servants understood that he was a decayed gentleman pensioner of their mistress jeremiah collecting his rags of gentility supported the character well enough he never alluded in any way to his stormy life of the past his mind taking a religious turn he dismissed his former state as one of sin and not to be referred to and he spent hours reading the bible in preparation for his summons to another existence and seemingly that call was not very far away the man's once bulky frame had shrunk and dwindled greatly so that his clothes hung loosely upon him now after the burning of the document laurence called at the vicarage to tell mr brock of what he had done but this time the deaf spinster was successful and he obtained no admission to the vicarage mr brock sent out a message that he was much engaged and could see no one for a week at least surprised somewhat mallow took himself off and on the road up to the manor met little mr timson the doctor pounding along on his broken kneed mare at mallow's halloo he reined up no easy task with his hard mouthed veteran the vicar asked mallow gazing into timson's red face red with pulling how is he getting along timson was a pessimist with a high average of deaths amongst his patients he shook his flaxen locks dolefully very bad mr mallow i don't suppose he'll see the winter through his heart is weak very weak nasty murmur there mitral valve wrong any sudden shock in fact emotion of any kind and he's done for said timson solemnly but under normal conditions doctor he'll pull through won't he oh may last for a time but he's bound to go bound to go the leg is obstinate too if he'd only rest there might be a chance but he goes on writing writing laurence pricked up his ears writing what is he writing some sort of diary i should think pages and pages of it to make matters worse he uses a cipher very bad for him that you know very bad by the way added the little man i hear poor old drabble is taken he is blown to bits if that is what you mean by 'taken' said mallow grimly he played with fire once too often timson sighed i know that he held pernicious doctrines mr mallow and his medical methods were not such as i could endorse i've taken over a good many of his patients they are in a sad state a sad sad state and he shook his little head again poor drabble ah well we must all come to it but not necessarily in the same way i trust well good day mr timson as the doctor's animal stumbled down the hill mallow climbing upward felt somewhat uneasy at the news of mr brock's industry it might be that there was yet more to tell of bellairs' wickedness and mallow fancied that the vicar might be setting it down in black and white precious queer amusement for a clergyman on the point of death anyhow he muttered to himself he has no relative that his scribbling is likely to interest that i know of that same evening leaving aldean and tui at whist with the old ladies he led olive into the library i want to talk to you olive about this money you were saying something the other day about getting rid of it yes i wouldn't use it for the world thirty thousand of it has gone with clara and boldini to south america i want to give the remaining twenty back to the indian government h'm the government will ask questions we don't want that can't it be returned as conscience money even so i fancy some explanation would be necessary it is a large sum you see besides there is another point which you have overlooked the money or rather what is left of it is not yours not mine then whose is it you forget the will olive in the event of your not marrying carson the money was to go to mr brock well as a matter of fact the provisions of the will not being complied with that is where it ought to go he can have it with pleasure but i feel sure he won't touch it now perhaps not but he said if he got it that was before he read the story he would give it back to you i don't want it if he does i shall only forward it to the proper quarter strictly speaking it should be given to the rao of kikat there is no rao now don't you remember how dr carson said that the kingdom was absorbed in the empire i think it will be best to ask mr brock's advice and not only ask it but take it mr brock is an honourable man he will agree with me that the money should be restored i am half sorry we recovered it now i'm not said mallow grimly at least we have done semberry out of his haul but i'll see brock laurence do you think mr brock knew of my father's wickedness no carson explicitly says that trall did not tell the rao about either him or your father when singha got the papers brock was already on the road to calcutta and they were burnt before he returned no brock did not know until he read carson's story he would never have published it as dr carson wished no that i'm sure he would not said mallow warmly carson was quite mistaken in his estimate of brock's character but if angus had lived and you had refused to marry him he might have held it over you as a threat but the envelope was sealed of course still angus knew the story as related there dr carson said that he told it to him but things are square now carson is dead with his story untold the paper is burnt and mr brock will keep his own counsel for our sakes after we see mr brock dear we will never talk of these things again said olive but there are one or two questions i feel i must ask him with a sudden recollection of the cipher diary and its possible further revelations mallow withheld his approval better let sleeping dogs lie dear but i want to know more of my father's life at kikat don't olive don't what you do know has brought you nothing but unhappiness that's just it laurence nothing can make me more unhappy i may as well know everything there is to know well as you please but you must let me see mr brock first why to warn him i suppose no n o o i think i ought to tell him of angus carson's death what good will that do none most likely still i think he ought to know i've always thought the motive for carson's death was to be found in india there was nothing in the story to lead one to think so nothing but mr brock may know something at present he is under the impression that boldini is the genuine carson but when i tell him of the murder and the whole conspiracy it is possible he may recall some incident likely to throw light on what is now absolutely cimmerian i doubt it laurence are you still so bent on getting to the bottom of this murder why not an undiscovered mystery is like an unfinished tune you feel a tantalizing desire for the closing cadence all my life i shall worry about that poor fellow's death until i really know how he was killed and who killed him only one more try olive i promise you if mr brock fails to help me i suppose i must give up the chase well see mr brock and then tell him the story but i fear you will be disappointed who knows dear his knowledge of your father and carson's life in kikat should be precise for all we know michael trall may have done it i can't think that laurence michael trall has not been seen or heard of for thirty years true true his own brother doesn't know of his whereabouts i dare say the scamp is dead and even if he were alive i can't see where his motive could have been true again but i think i'll ask mr brock nevertheless chapter vi mr brock's addenda in spite of herself olive fretted her trouble had taken firm hold of her mind and bade fair now to make havoc of her body she lost flesh rapidly in vain mallow tried to combat this brooding over her father's wrong doing he pointed out the futility of it he urged her implored her to make the effort to rouse herself but without result her father's sin became with her an ever present enormity she was continually dwelling upon it they tried to get her to work to use her hands employ herself actively anyhow at anything so long as for the time being it was capable of absorbing her and thus releasing the terrible tension under which she laboured at last mallow saw there was nothing for it but an entire change of scene and surroundings you must go olive dear away from here away from all that reminds you of yourself you shall go abroad at once mrs purcell shall go with you and later i will join you and in six months' time you will return dear a totally different woman no longer olive bellairs even in name for we will be married and you will laugh at yourself and these wretched phantoms of your own raising you speak as though i were a child she cried petulantly phantoms indeed facts you mean my father was a oh don't speak of it the very thought drives me beside myself and i have to keep it all to myself all all oh olive said mallow reproachfully am i not some help to you a man never understands he does not feel these things really olive i think the sooner you get away from casterwell the better i shall never be better never never mallow did not argue with her he saw that it was quite useless actions not words were necessary if olive was to be restored to a proper sense of what was due to herself and to others laurence recognized this and took an early opportunity of calling at the vicarage again mr brock refused to see him but next day mallow received a note requesting him to call he obeyed promptly on his way through the village he met jeremiah looking distressed and lonely i want to see a clergyman he whined peevishly i have so many sins to confess i can find no one to help me mallow looked at him it appeared that trall under stress of religious emotion might confess to a priest much more than he would be likely to confide to a layman in such circumstances it was not at all improbable that he might let drop much that would be useful i will take you to see a clergyman trall the best in this parish i am now on my way there if you will call at the vicarage shortly left hand side of the church from the roadway i will leave you with him then you will be able to unbosom your mind quite freely oh thank you thank you mr mallow i have many sins to confess many many when shall i come mallow glanced at his watch in three quarters of an hour say about four o'clock i would take you with me now only i want first to see mr brock myself on private business trall was more than satisfied with this arrangement and hobbled off profuse in his expressions of gratitude mallow continued his way to the vicarage good day mr brock said he as the deaf housekeeper showed him into the study now the sick room i am glad to see you at last indeed i must apologize for not receiving you before replied the vicar wearily but i have been busy arranging my papers against my death oh come now you are not going to die i shall never leave this house alive mr mallow my days are numbered you can guess now that the reading of carson's statement gave me a severe shock all these years i never suspected that it was bellairs who murdered singha indeed i did not even know that he was murdered for rao chunder the heir gave out that his father had died of apoplexy did you never return to kikat no i failed altogether to induce the governor general to move in the matter of the blackmailing and as the rao's son was not very friendly to me i judged it wiser to keep away besides i heard that bellairs and carson had left kikat and believed that their departure was due to the enmity of the new rao god forgive me i never guessed the truth rao singha never told you that bellairs and carson were inculpated in the blackmailing no trall made it out to be his own conspiracy entirely and kept their names out of his confession moreover singha had not received the incriminating letters with the forged names they were afterwards burnt by the new rao he kept his own counsel i never saw them i never suspected that bellairs and carson had fallen so low do you think the names were forged or do you believe that your friends were willing accomplices in the conspiracy i believe the names were forged declared brock decisively so far as i knew both bellairs and carson were thoroughly honourable men trall entangled them by means of the forgeries and for their own sakes they were compelled to act as accomplices did bellairs ever hint at the truth mr mallow the vicar sat up and flushed indignantly had i been told the truth by bellairs do you think that i would have remained vicar of casterwell no for olive's sake perhaps i might have held my tongue but my first act would have been to vacate the living bellairs was as silent as the grave about kikat he hardly ever alluded to his life there and then only casually guilty conscience no doubt suggested mallow as a rule a man doesn't particularly care to reperuse the smudged pages of his life book i suppose bellairs never told you his reason for the betrothal of olive to angus never never i thought it was simply and solely the outcome of his strong friendship for carson as to the will leaving me the money in the event of the marriage not taking place i did not know its contents until bellairs was dead well the money is yours now mr brock will you take it knowing how it was earned my dear friend believe me it is superfluous to discuss what i will do with it i am a dying man by my will i have restored the money to olive she can deal with it as she pleases in that case it is her intention to restore it to the indian government what good will that do said the vicar with a sigh there is no rao of kikat now the name the family the very kingdom has died out let olive make restitution if such be her wish but the money will go into the wrong pockets if she sends it there i don't care whose pockets it enters neither does she said mallow the main point is to get rid of it and there is twenty thousand pounds mr brock started only that i understood that there was fifty true enough but thirty has gone across the seas with boldini and his wife boldini who is he i forgot you don't know the story it is a long one mr brock and not a pretty one for a clergyman to hear as a rule we hear the worst stories but you talk strangely mr mallow i do not understand this boldini who is he well he is the man who masqueraded here as angus carson as angus carson do you mean to tell me that it was not really angus carson who i will tell you all about it if said mallow with some hesitation you think you are quite strong enough to hear quite strong enough and most anxious to hear said mr brock feverishly come mr mallow explain this mystery you may well call it a mystery mr brock and it seems likely to remain one i can begin the story and continue it to a certain point but you must finish it for yourself then mallow related to the astonished vicar all the intrigues of the last few months he was most minute in his recital giving even the reasons which had induced him to take various steps mrs arne drabble boldini clara he introduced all these people to mr brock placing them before him in their different capacities as vividly as he was able but he refrained from expressing to the vicar his hope that jeremiah would shortly aid towards the solution of the mystery he could see that the old man was becoming exhausted as well as bewildered by what he had heard terrible terrible he murmured poor olive poor angus oh why why did you not tell me all this before there was not much use in telling you said mallow gloomily you could not have helped us we are no nearer finding out the truth than we were before why was young carson killed that is what i want to know what was the motive i can't think replied mr brock staring before him it is all so dreadful you don't think drabble murdered the poor lad no drabble's interest was to keep him alive unless he proved stubborn then whew mallow drew a long breath from his experiences in the soho house he had little difficulty in guessing what mrs arne would have done had young carson proved obdurate but i don't think they killed him he added no i am sure they didn't but who else could have a motive asked the vicar wrinkling his brows they left him well you say and returned to find him dead some one according to your theory must have been in the house meanwhile undoubtedly and that some one is the murderer but who is he it is impossible to say angus lived all his days in india he knew no one in england perhaps major semberry no mallow shook his head he denied it strenuously and so far as i can see he had as much interest as the anarchists in keeping carson alive come mr brock are you sure there was nothing that happened at kikat likely to lead to this after thirty years nothing besides carson was not married then the boy was not born i wonder said mallow musingly if that bangle had anything to do with it how could it asked mr brock amazed well i understand it was taken from an idol no brock shook his head that is not correct singha gave the bangle to carson my friend with the full permission of the priests he cured the rao of a severe illness and the priests approved of the reward then michael trall must be the murderer how do you make that out trall disappeared from kikat thirty and more years ago he has never been heard of since probably he is dead probably but possibly he may be alive and he may have killed young carson on what grounds for what reason said mr brock killing angus would not give him the money if that is what you are thinking of no i am sure trall is dead he was too restless and ambitious a man to remain quiet and when he had exhausted his own share of the blackmail he would in all probability come here for the purpose of blackmailing bellairs perhaps he knew you were here mr brock perhaps and so far i may have been a safeguard to bellairs but knowing trall well as i do i think he would have run even the risk of my denouncing him had there been money to be gained when did you see trall last at kikat he followed me with the intention of frustrating my plans and he would have done so at the cost of murder i make no doubt but i changed the route i had intended to take and i am thankful to say he missed me at that moment the voice of the housekeeper could be heard raised in anger evidently from the deeper tones which followed against some man mr brock grew deadly pale and his heart beat wildly with sheer nervousness see see what it is mr mallow he gasped oh this will kill me the young man ran to the door and threw it open as though he had been waiting outside jeremiah shambled into the room amid the shrill expostulations of the sour spinster i came as you told me whimpered trall clutching mallow where is the clergyman i must see the clergyman trall this is disgraceful mr brock aha breathed the vicar and both men turned at the strangled sound to see him sitting up looking at the newcomer with vacantly staring eyes on his side jeremiah released his hold of mallow and as though drawn by a magnet approached the sofa the sick man and his visitor gazed blankly at one another why whispered trall still gazing it's you it's it's it's why it's michael michael repeated mallow what michael michael trall my brother oh michael i'm so glad to see you i'm jerry the man on the bed stared and stared but spoke not a word his face was blanched with fear and he repeatedly put out his hands as though to keep the other back then quietly silently without a sign of recognition he fell back dead chapter vii the cipher diary even in the first shock of this untimely death though timely discovery mallow kept his wits about him that brock was truly michael trall he made no doubt for in truth jeremiah had neither the capacity nor the reason to simulate relationship of the kind moreover nothing surely could be more conclusive than the fatal effect which this unexpected meeting had had for brock beside whom now the wretched man dropped into prayer and supplication he called upon him to recover implored him for a sign a look he wept bitterly mallow did not molest him he was totally unfit for rational conversation poor brock he may still be called so for the avoidance of confusion was quite dead mallow slipped his hand under his clothes on to the heart to make quite sure the sight of his brother and the knowledge of what would follow had done their work and snuffed him out of this life come now trall said mallow you must try and pull yourself together and what's more you must not say a word about this no one must know understand trall no one as mr brock he lived as mr brock he died but he is my own brother michael i believe you trall but reticence absolute silence on that point is necessary if only for your own safety remember the brotherhood that was quite enough for trall he promised implicit obedience and i'll sit in this corner as quiet as a mouse mr mallow he concluded if only you'll let me don't oh don't take me away well you may remain there for the present but remember not a word to any one about this mallow deemed it advisable to alarm the household he rang the bell and the acidulated housekeeper duly appeared she immediately lost all control of herself she cried out aloud and gesticulated wildly her fellow servants followed suit and in a very few moments the usually tranquil vicarage was a very pandemonium of weeping and wailing promptly mallow sent a messenger for mr timson and another for lord aldean with strict injunctions not in any way to alarm the ladies at the manor house he determined not to leave the place himself until he had possession of the cipher diary seeing now that without doubt this was michael trall he expected much in the way of revelation from the diary it is a passion with some of perverted instincts to set down their deeds and misdeeds in black and white and such documents are invariably to be relied upon they are usually perfectly unfettered in their utterance the tangible communion of such people with themselves mallow anticipated difficulty only so far as the unravelling of the cipher was concerned this might prove obstinately difficult or it might not but he argued there was no cipher invented by man that man could not unravel and unravel it he would even though he took years in the doing of it it remained now to secure the document itself within an hour mr timson arrived and seemed in nowise astonished at the suddenness of mr brock's death just what i expected he chirped in his pessimistic way cardiac failure pure and simple he was excited in some way i presume mr mallow yes he became very excited while i was talking with him said laurence evasively quite so quite so i warned him i told him how it would be dear dear most regrettable but natural all the same quite natural mr timson was moved not a hair's breadth from his habitual complacency don't you think the body should be removed to the bedroom said mallow he hardly liked to begin his search for the diary with the dead man's body lying there certainly certainly more decent quite right so superintended by the little man mr brock's remains were carried out of the study the progress to the bedroom drew forth further lamentations from the female servants timson took himself off then as he went out of the hall lord aldean entered he was full of sympathy and amazed poor old chap he said as mallow conducted him to the study died of heart failure i suppose i'm awfully sorry for the poor old fellow he was a good sort brock yes i'm sorry too said mallow grimly but not quite for your reasons the dead man is michael trall not brock trall what do you mean aldean cast a glance at jeremiah is not this trall then it is michael my poor brother sighed the creature in the corner mr brock your brother well i wait a moment aldean i'll tell you all about it directly then turning to jeremiah mallow asked was your brother a good man no o o replied trall he was clever but he was not a good man he deserted his wife and poor little clara but i was fond of him a brother is always a brother oh mallow paused he did not wish to reflect in any way upon the dead man and he was afraid to trust jeremiah out of his sight lest in his weakness he should reveal his connection with the late vicar i wish to speak privately with lord aldean he said at length go you trall into the next room for half an hour stay there and mind not a word to any one about what has happened very well mr mallow replied jeremiah submissively creeping towards the door laurence followed him and made him comfortable in the dining room the sour spinster now a very niobe all tears was informed that mr trall was suffering from shock at the unexpected death of the vicar and was not on any account to be disturbed having arranged thus for jeremiah's seclusion mallow returned to the study where he found aldean in a state of intense expectancy the situation and hints of mystery puzzled him what's all this business about he asked when he saw his friend lock the door it's about michael trall alias brock who i truly believe jim is the murderer for whom we have searched so long mr brock the murderer of carson impossible you must be mistaken surely well perhaps but i don't think so i will give you my grounds for saying so and i think you will agree jim that they are pretty strong rapidly but tersely mallow related the story as set forth by dr carson he concealed nothing not even bellairs' guilt finally he expressed his conviction that in mr brock's diary would be found the key to the whole mystery jim was amazed still he could not agree with his friend murderers don't write accounts of their crimes he pronounced decisively not such fools as to make up their own brief for the prosecution that's just where you're wrong jim there are not a few cases on record said mallow i can recollect one in particular where a clerk wrote in his diary 'to day fine and hot killed a little girl in croft's spinney' that line hanged him glad it did growled jim in disgust for being such a fool i confess i have no sympathy for a man who gives himself away like that perhaps not jim but there seems to be a peculiar fascination about confession which some of these men can't resist it may be that there is great relief for them in unburdening their minds even on paper if we can judge michael trall's character from carson's story he has heaped up a goodly pile of wickedness these thirty and more years moreover if his diary were guileless reading he would not resort to cipher no jim i believe the man has sought to ease his conscience by setting down his sins may have mallow but the cipher's a teaser no doubt i don't anticipate it will be child's play by any means still it is a fact that there is no cipher invented by the ingenuity of man which given time and application cannot be unravelled this diary may take days even months to straighten into queen's english but sooner or later i shall master its contents if only to learn why brock killed carson you speak confidently mallow but brock may be innocent even yet possible but to my mind improbable if brock be not guilty i don't know who is however it's no use theorizing when we have facts before us brock's keys are under the pillow sure we have the right to search mallow i'll take the risk of that said laurence with composure and forthwith went to work assisted by aldean manifestly the most promising hunting ground was the escritoire near the window at which michael trall in clerical capacity had been accustomed to compile his sermons mallow first explored the pigeon holes and their papers scrutinizing the writing of each in turn but so far failed to find anything at all incriminating he unlocked the drawers and went through them systematically from top to bottom in the right hand corner of the lowest drawer they found the diary carelessly thrown in without attempt at concealment it was contained in a stout volume bound in red cloth and on the back was written in ink no oh said mallow examining the neat cipher writing the rogue evidently posted his criminal ledgers with the utmost regularity where are the other twenty they were not in his desk for by this time they had searched every inch of it jim examined the bookcases filled to overflowing and occupying three walls of the room near the top of one of them he found shamelessly exposed the remaining twenty volumes the astute mr brock had evidently acted upon the conviction that in attempting no concealment he aroused no curiosity his readings had no doubt included the stories of edgar allan poe cheek of the beggar grumbled aldean tumbling down these ledgers promptly he had every faith in his cipher and in his reputation as the rev manners brock said mallow receiving the books below and arranging them on the table i expect there is material enough for a dozen detective novels in this lot eh what's up now jim don't swear aldean suppressing further imprecation scrambled down the ladder look here mallow just look watch chain studs and the missing wrist button counted laurence coolly it is no more than i expected there can be no doubt after this jim here is the dead man's jewellery the lying brute he said that drabble gave him the other wrist button as a curiosity they surveyed the tarnished gold and the double pile of red books in silence then said aldean slowly god to think of that murderous scoundrel saying he was a parson makes me sick to think of it might have lived to marry tui and me by gum jim started as the discovery slowly evolved itself in his brain say mallow all the marriages in this parish must be wrong 'uns what's to be done about them we must wait until we read the diary before considering matters of such minor importance as that said mallow tapping the books i expect it won't be easy to straighten out brock's crooked ways don't call him brock makes me feel bad brock he must be called jim for the present none of the ladies must know the truth until we get through these books manners brock is dead not michael trall i understand but jeremiah i'll manage him ha there he is i expect open the door jim aldean did so and trall looking white and agitated crept into the room i'm afraid to be alone he whimpered can't i stop here we must go home now trall said mallow soothingly can you read this cipher and he opened out a book to jeremiah in the faint hope of receiving an affirmative answer to his surprise and delight it came i can read it mr mallow it's michael's cipher i taught it to him when we were boys hurrah sang aldean slapping trall's back you shall translate it then michael's diary said jeremiah quicker in understanding than might have been expected i see ah michael was always clever with his pen been a sight too clever this time muttered jim assisting his friend to tie up the books in neat bundles here operations ceased for the moment and mallow and aldean with jeremiah in charge returned home after a few directions to the deaf housekeeper then came the difficult task of explaining certain rumours which had already reached the manor house jim discreetly held his tongue and left things to his friend who vouchsafed as little information as was consistent with allaying the general alarm mr brock had died suddenly from heart failure he declared refraining carefully from all mention of the dead man's identity with the michael trall of carson's story and from any reference to the cipher diary in the lamentations which ensued further questions were spared him the man must be buried as mr brock said mallow to aldean a day or two later there is no other course open if the story is to be kept quiet yes i suppose so it will save all trouble over those marriages better let him have a decent name over his tombstone though he doesn't deserve it as the pseudo brock had no relatives for mallow insisted that jeremiah should suppress the fact of his relationship olive as the lady of the manor charged herself with the funeral so the scoundrel was buried in fine style although it is only fair to state that he had kept his false name clean enough so far as concerned the parish they could not but feel his loss and there was much weeping and eulogy by the graveside as michael trall of kikat was laid under the turf of the churchyard in the odour of sanctity mallow thought this was one of life's greater ironies good lord was his aside to jim how the rogue must chuckle at this mummery if his spirit has eyes to see he might be a canonized saint for the fuss they make must have had some good in him replied aldean meditatively as mr brock he was straight enough that i know a serpent in a bamboo cannot be otherwise than straight said mallow casterwell vicarage was our friend's bamboo but a triple murderer faugh triple how triple he murdered carson i'm certain brock was despatched by him so that he could assume the missionary's lambskin and i shouldn't be surprised to learn that he and not bellairs made away with rao singha he was capable of it but as mr brock as mr brock jim there should be inscribed upon his tomb the couplet of some byronic imitator he settled with a little pious leaven to give the fag end of his life to heaven jeremiah did not attend the funeral mallow induced him to remain at home lest in his grief his tongue might get the better of him so he sat in his room and painfully translated the rascalities of michael into plain english and he taught laurence the cipher and laurence toiled likewise it was an affair of many weeks indeed it lasted until mrs purcell announced her determination to take olive abroad at the same time tui received a cablegram announcing that her delighted parents were on their way to england much of the diary has no bearing on this story but in the last volume or so there were notes which shed a flood of light upon much that was before hopelessly obscure one discovery in particular was of the greatest satisfaction to mallow indeed it led him to communicate the latter portion of the diary to olive miss slarge and mrs purcell tui the matter did not concern it must not be supposed that laurence gave this information in the precise words of the diary for this proved to be a hastily compiled composition thrown together at odd moments heaven knows what for unless for the sheer egotistical gratification of its author he shifted all extraneous matter translated the notes of the earlier to the later years and in one way and another drew together the story of the carsons and the events at kikat into a concise narrative this he wrote out carefully and one evening when tui and aldean were love making over the billiard table he read it out to an audience of three so it is that the following narrative must be regarded strictly as mallow's version compiled by him from the materials supplied by the twenty one volumes of the diary and told by him in the first person from its author's point of view chapter viii a rogue's memoirs bad luck bad luck bad luck there's my life's history in one word the day i launched myself on the world misfortune established herself at my elbow and my most persistent endeavours have failed to oust her from that position only so far as to allow me perfect health from first to last has she relented yet even that has had its disadvantages it has whetted an appetite already omnivorous for the luxuries of life luxuries for the acquirement of which the means have ever been withheld how i have pursued them how they have eluded me it is this quest for luxury this craving to satisfy an appetite abnormal and insatiable that has brought upon me so much of trouble i have had the worst of luck ten thousand a year might have made an honest man of me but i defy st paul himself to have stood in my place with my mind my body my soul and not have done the things that i have done he would have been another michael trall i do not say i could ever have been like st paul that is another matter my passion has been the cakes and ale of life i have never had enough of them i could not have enough of them but i was not gifted even with the means for their procuration in a moderate degree so i don't blame myself i cannot blame myself no one can justly blame me it is nature that is responsible for what i am for what i have done blame her or whosoever or whatsoever inspires her to bestow upon a luckless man passions strong and undeniable passions overwhelming and senses insatiable while denying him the wherewithal to gratify them that is the most refined torture i can conceive nothing more ubiquitous nothing more merciless well that is what has ruined me i was unlucky at the start i was the second son of a pharisee provincial but respectable so i suffered from the amiable custom of primogeniture my brother jerry two years only my senior received a home and lands and a thousand pounds a year he did not receive over much in the way of brains i in this latter respect received perhaps more than my share with senses to match with such gifts and some five hundred pounds all told i was pushed off to sink or swim i just kept afloat first of all i lost all my money in a most determined and i think thoroughly well conceived attempt to double it on the card table it was pure misfortune that it proved inferior in practice i was obliged then to borrow from jerry he was a stay at home ass i did not approve of his way of life at all but i had no option but to borrow from him again misfortune dogged me for somehow or other it passes my recollection now i got into trouble about somebody else's name on a cheque i remember those concerned made a great fuss about it altogether out of proportion to the circumstances and i remember distinctly how disgusted i was at the puritanical island upon which it was my lot to be cast so i decided to leave it for some time after that i lived on the continent upon my wits which were duly sharpened in the process it was hard that this should prove to my disadvantage but it did for at baden baden my misfortune culminated in a row at the tables i was utterly disgusted but it was wiser that i should leave so i dropped south over the equator and turned up at the cape in a new character and with a brand new name those were prehistoric days and the south african millionaire had not yet invented himself the boers disapproved of my more civilized ways with the ace and as i could not repress my repugnance for their psalm singing barbarisms i could not make myself at home there it seemed as if a resting place was ever to be denied me but i plucked up courage and in a rackety ocean tramp carrying a cargo of rats and cockroaches i sailed for bombay i had a very few pounds but no little experience arrived there i was obliged to make my living somehow it was a hand to mouth existence and i saw no prospect before me i had a certain amount of luck with my dice though on one or two occasions aspersions were cast upon their equilibrium 'give a dog a bad name and hang him' seemed to hold good even here i was driven north then heaven knows why fortune gave me her hand for once and led me to kikat the kingdom of one rao singha this petty prince was an up to date hindoo with an english army leader and a european physician bellairs he was the leader proved to be a fool with no brains and some scruples dr carson on the contrary possessed some brains but was quite unfettered by scruples i saw that i should have to adapt myself to the idiosyncrasies of each i did so and a sort of triune partnership for the making of our several and joint fortunes was the result singha was sufficiently acute but i beat him on his own ground he loved me like a brother indeed i did all i could to civilize him i taught him cards introduced him to billiards and instructed him in the orderly and methodical compilation of a betting book i don't say that one way and another i did not profit by him for i did but the profits were inconsiderable and in no way sufficient to satisfy me besides i was conscious of certain ambitions then i felt that this great state treasure not to speak of the command of some two million heathen would be much more rationally dealt with were they in my hands in a word i coveted the viziership of kikat but the priests were one and all against me moreover there was an english missionary there named manners brock who seemed to be mistrustful of me i could make nothing of him in his moral and religious convictions he was absolutely rigid a most unsympathetic soul i thought him it soon became plain to me that nothing short of re adjustment of the existing political system would clear these obstacles from my path my chance came with the mutiny by carefully playing upon singha's ambition and feudal pride i managed to get him mixed up in it at my instigation he made certain treaties with the delhi princes and wrote certain letters professing hostility to the heic then he watched for a favourable opportunity of declaring himself this opportunity never came for the rao over persuaded by brock delayed action until it was too late the mutiny smouldered out when delhi was captured and i unlucky once more reverted to the post of idle companion and powerless buffoon with the priests and brock ever on the alert to ruin my credit with singha it became a choice between my downfall and the rao's so of course i chose the rao's to strengthen my scheme i appended carson's and bellairs' names to some of the letters and thereby so implicated them in the rao's conspiracy that for their own safety they were compelled to join me carson was willing enough to throw in his lot with me but bellairs made some absurd objections until i was obliged to show him how completely his life and honour were at my discretion when matters were thus arranged i saw singha i told him plainly that i should have no option but to send the letters to the governor general unless he gave me the three diamonds which were known as the treasures of kikat he blustered a good deal but in the end i gained my point singha gave me the diamonds the largest i kept to myself the other two i handed to bellairs and carson all went smoothly until the rao made trouble by confessing his position to brock the missionary with the usual meddlesomeness of his class made tracks for calcutta declaring his intention to inform the government of my plot and protect singha he was afraid of me i fancy for he slipped off without my knowledge i saw that his denunciation meant unpleasantness so i followed close on his heels met him and argued the question with him i did my best to persuade him to my way of thinking to show him how utterly foolish and misguided he was but all to no purpose he was hopelessly unreasonable so i killed him there was nothing else for it i returned to kikat but with the utmost caution this was necessary because the rao being now in possession of the papers which i had directed were to be sent to him might be plotting vengeance i then discovered he was dead on noticing the names of bellairs and carson appended to the papers he had become unruly so carson had poisoned him and with bellairs had fled i managed to come across the fugitives and together we waited events as it happened the new king was afraid lest his father's conspiracy should cost him his throne so he hushed up the matter and gave out that singha had died of apoplexy as the danger from this quarter was over we three could now enjoy the fruits of our success i told bellairs and carson that i had killed brock so there was nothing to be feared from the government through him bellairs returned to england taking with him both his own diamond and carson's the latter had found a rag of a conscience somewhere since he had murdered the rao and talked of the diamond as the 'price of blood' he refused to take it and let bellairs carry it off although i should have liked it for myself however i was quite satisfied with my share for i sold the diamond for thirty thousand pounds with this money i went back to europe where i married became the father of a daughter and altogether had a glorious time carson in a fit of repentance retired to some himalayan hermitage haunted i suppose by what is called a guilty conscience fool my shooting of brock troubled me not in the least but what did trouble me was another run of bad luck i lost everything i returned to london and placed my wife and child in the care of jerry who was a bachelor and could better afford to keep them than i then i determined to look up bellairs who was now squire of casterwell and horribly prosperous on making inquiries i learned that the vicar of the parish was dead and that the living was in bellairs' gift i was terribly weary of wandering and it occurred to me that such a position would suit me very well at all events for a while it was quite a simple matter for me to impersonate manners brock i had all his papers and i was well up in the details of his early life as well as his life in india the creature had been a confirmed babbler and had told me everything about himself i had some trouble with bellairs at first but he soon saw it was no good he was desperately jealous of what he called his good name he had everything to lose i nothing so he did the wisest thing he could do and gave in i became the reverend manners brock i had no difficulty in deceiving the old bishop of the diocese i had all the papers and was well up in all the necessary details the living of itself was a poor one but of course bellairs had to alter that he told me when i approached this part of the subject that he had sold the two diamonds for some thirty eight thousand pounds then he too indulged in some silly nonsense about the 'price of blood' and so on which he said had prevented his touching the money for the last ten years it had been lying in the bank at compound interest and had now reached something like fifty thousand pounds i soon settled that i made him invest the money securely yet profitably and pay me the interest i felt now that i could settle down in comfort to my hardly earned repose i had an assured position a good name and a most comfortable income there were times of course when i grew weary of so much respectability but then all i had to do was to assume some disguise and run up to london for a few days and enjoy myself but i never went near jerry my wife was dead and he looked after my daughter so as the reverend manners brock my life if quiet was pleasant enough for years all went well until one day there came a letter from carson regretting that he had surrendered his diamond and suggesting that his son he had married in the mean time should marry olive bellairs and that the proceeds of the diamond should be given to the young people on their wedding day at first bellairs refused but carson replied threatening exposure more than that he plainly gave bellairs to understand that he would accuse him of rao singha's murder for the sake of his jealously guarded name bellairs was forced to yield but he wrote to carson telling him how in the person of the rev manners brock i had become vicar of casterwell and how he had been obliged to pay me the interest on the money i did not wish to be selfish but naturally i refused to give up my income so in the end i compromised the matter it was arranged that i should have the interest until the marriage took place when i was to surrender it as this could not be for twenty years i agreed to the arrangement provided that if it did not take place the money should revert to me bellairs made a will to this effect carson insisted that the fifty thousand should be settled on his son with a discretionary clause that he should pay one thousand a year to his wife i did not know at the time though i learned it later that bellairs had left a letter for his daughter imploring her to marry angus as he feared did she not that dr carson would make known the truth and thus tarnish his memory so the matter was arranged the years slipped by and bellairs died then carson wrote to me that he had told his son the story keeping back however his own guilt of singha's murder he had also put the story on paper though in doing so he had carefully refrained from connecting me as brock with michael trall this account he intimated he was sending by his son to me so that i might if necessary use it to force olive into the marriage i refused so to further his desires angus his son was to denounce me and to accuse me of the murder of brock needless to say i was greatly alarmed at the existence of this document and by the knowledge that young carson had it in his power to ruin me even when dr carson died i was not reassured as i still knew that angus was in possession of the document and the story the first could not ruin me since my identity with the brock of casterwell was not shown but if angus proved difficult to deal with it might be very awkward for me to make myself more comfortable i resolved to see angus before he arrived at casterwell i should then know at all events how he was disposed towards me mrs purcell's letter which had been shown to me by miss slarge plainly hinted that angus was a religious prig and i foresaw that he might not prove so easy to manage as his father had been from the letter i also learned the name of the steamer in which angus was coming to england shortly before the pharaoh arrived i repaired to london in disguise and inquired at the office when the liner was expected at the docks on obtaining this information i went down to wait for her i wore shabby clothes and a false black beard of course i was not aware that major semberry was in any way connected with drabble although from mrs purcell's letter i knew that he acted as bear leader to angus when the steamer arrived i mixed with the crowd on deck and managed to have carson pointed out to me i recognized him easily from his resemblance to his father when he left the boat with semberry i followed them still disguised to athelstane place i determined to take the first opportunity of speaking to angus i waited for some time but they did not come out i realized that it might be some considerable time perhaps days before i found the opportunity i wished for see him i would and that alone while hanging round the house i saw a man it must have been drabble disguised as hain but at the moment i failed to recognize him i saw also the housekeeper she was a stranger to me these two were always about the place although semberry had left and i was beginning to despair of ever seeing angus alone at last one evening they both left the house together and i having seen them well out of the way walked up to the door and rang the bell angus answered it himself and when i said i was mr brock of casterwell for i had put my false beard in my pocket he at once asked me to walk upstairs in the drawing room i had an interview with him and a stormy one it proved he was a stern religious young man and he declared that he intended to tell olive the truth to pay back the money to the indian government and to denounce me as brock's murderer he also informed me that he had the document securely concealed as his father having repented of writing it had tried to regain possession of it to prevent his doing so angus had placed it in the secret drawer of his chest i implored him not to ruin me indeed i offered to give up all claim to the money i even went on my knees to him but all in vain he was adamant and insisted that i should be exposed as an impostor and a murderer then in my turn i threatened him i told him that if he denounced me i would reveal his father's sin he did not know the truth and asked me what i meant when he heard that his father had murdered singha he fainted as he generally did when violently excited by reason of his weak heart this i knew from mrs purcell's letter i was quite determined that as i had him at my mercy he should not live to ruin me i looked about for a weapon to kill him and saw the wool work left by mrs arne with the knitting needles in it i opened his shirt as he lay insensible on the sofa and pierced him to the heart with one of the needles he died very quietly and i think without pain then i took his studs wrist buttons watch chain and money so that the murder might look like the work of a robber in the next room i hunted for the portmanteau and turned it out to see if i could find the document it was not to be found nor the sandal wood chest so i stole away from the house leaving carson dead and later on returned to casterwell i read in the newspapers how futile had been the search for the assassin but i could not quite comprehend what they said about the severed hand i guessed that it had been cut off in order to remove the bangle because i myself had been unable to remove it owing to the swollen condition of the hand but i could not understand their motive for taking away the bangle it was not until i met boldini as carson in the churchyard that this became quite clear to me then of course i guessed at once that it was necessary for his impersonation i almost fainted at the sight of him he was so like the young man whom i had been obliged to kill i explained my emotion to mallow by saying that the son had reminded me so forcibly of his father my dear old friend moreover i made no doubt that a conspiracy was in progress for obtaining the money of course i could have denounced the imposture there and then but that might have led to my own undoing so i decided to let sleeping dogs lie the money would be lost to me by the marriage as on reading her father's letter which she showed to me miss bellairs was bent on carrying out his wish still now that angus was dead no one could identify me with michael trall i was safe if poor the marriage ceremony i myself performed so i lost the money by my own act i was surprised to learn that my daughter clara had engaged herself as maid to olive but as mr brock i dared not interfere i regret now that i did not for through her i might have found out all about boldini's scheme when mr and mrs carson so called departed i discovered that one of the dead man's wrist buttons had been taken out of my desk this alarmed me greatly and i forthwith hid the rest of the jewellery in my bookcase afterwards margery drabble confessed to me that she was the culprit so when her father was killed i told mallow that he had given it to me there was no one else to contradict the statement i was most anxious to find the document in the sandal wood chest and thought it might be with major semberry having gone up to see him i unfortunately met mallow but i explained my visit on the plea that i wished the major to bring about a reconciliation between the young couple i did not see semberry nor did i enter his lodgings as i was coming away a cab knocked me down and broke my leg then one day a few weeks later to my great surprise mr mallow himself brought me the document it had been discovered by lord aldean in the secret hiding place of the sandal wood chest where carson had concealed it from his father olive as mallow informed me wished to read it she thought perhaps it might throw some light on the sealed letter left by her father on consideration i promised to show it to her if after reading it i judged it fit for her to read i found i could do so with safety carson had made no mention of brock's death and had accused bellairs of the murder of the rao singha which he himself had committed true he spoke in no measured terms of michael trall in fact he abused him roundly but since that adventurer was dead and brock was alive in his person such blame of him and praise of me served only to strengthen my position i resolved therefore that olive should read of her father's guilt hoping that thereupon she would refuse to touch the money granting it was recovered from boldini in which case it might come to me so the matter stands all who may know of my identity with trall are dead the existing document strengthens my position and in no way can the death of carson be traced to me i shall die in the odour of sanctity after all and indeed if what the doctor says is true this cursed accident is going to bring about that event very shortly well if i die i die my life has been a hard one and if i have sinned i repeat nature is to blame not myself i have directed by my will that the twenty one volumes of my cipher diary are to be burnt since it is only for my own gratification that i have written them i have no wish to be maligned after my death even if the diary is not destroyed i feel safe seeing that no one can read it save jerry and i dare say that he is dead by this time he must be dead or clara would not have gone out to service i wish now i had asked her about him mr mallow is about to marry olive bellairs i wish them joy i have no ill feeling against either of them if i live i may of course get back this money i don't suppose for one moment that olive will touch it if i die well there is an end of michael trall and his bad luck but no one will ever know that the revered and beloved vicar of casterwell killed angus carson i die a respected member of society and on my tombstone shall be written words of praise many a stone has lied about him who sleeps beneath it so why not mine i murdered brock i murdered carson but their ghosts have never haunted me i have baffled the world and i have kept my secret in the face of every danger mallow is coming to see me again well let him come i say i do not fear him now the bad days are over for me michael trall has gone into limbo and manners brock the worthy vicar has beaten fortune after all epilogue letter from miss slarge of casterwell to mrs purcell at san remo the first of january my dear sister i hasten to thank you for your kind invitation to join you at san remo i regret to say that it is not possible for me to accept it although my book is now rapidly approaching completion there still remains much to be done in the way of verifying sundry minor details for example i am desirous of expanding the statement of diodorous siculous in which he identifies osiris with the god bacchus and that means that i have still many works to read the impossibility of taking my library with me alone precludes me from leaving here until my manuscript is finished i have decided to call my work 'the new babylon or the migration of chaldean idolatry to the seven hilled city of the revelations according to st john the divine' a title which i think sufficiently well explains its meaning may its publication tend to keep our island free from the superstitions of semiramis and peter you will be glad to hear that olive and mr mallow are now comfortably established at the manor house their serene happiness is pleasant to contemplate a year has elapsed since the death of mr brock as i may still call him and with him is buried the sad story of the past his brother jeremiah as you know died six months ago he lies beside him in the same churchyard in life they were divided in death they lie side by side what a moral your favourite dr johnson would have deduced from this mr mallow i think now was right when he decided not to reveal the truth about our late vicar the confusion which would have arisen in our village had he done so would have been terrible to contemplate 'what the eye does not see the heart does not grieve at' that is a wise proverb my dear priscilla and peculiarly applicable in the present instance lord and lady aldean have returned to kingsholme from their honeymoon if possible more in love with one another than ever i am bound to say that tui conducts herself with great dignity in her new position and that seemingly lord aldean is not without a due sense of his social and marital responsibilities at the next drawing room both brides are to be presented to their sovereign and i am glad to know that you will be with us for that ceremony olive and her husband express themselves very gratefully to you for the judicious manner in which you anticipated any scandal which might have arisen through the chain of incidents connected with the impostor boldini as it is they have been received with open arms by the county and of course no reference is ever made to poor olive's untoward entanglement socially she occupies her proper position and as mrs mallow she is if anything more popular than before mr mallow is engaged upon a new novel which bids fair to secure for him a high position in the world of letters olive i know would like him to enter the commons but so far he has shown no inclination in that direction lord aldean has taken his seat in the house of lords and urged by tui who has more ambition than i gave her credit for intends taking an active part in the politics of his country mr and mrs ostergaard have returned to new zealand well satisfied with the elevation of their daughter to the rank of a peeress they were delighted with lord aldean and parted from him with great regret he hopes soon to return their visit and talks of buying a yacht for the purpose but this scheme is as yet quite in embryo of course you know that mr mallow with his wife's approval paid over the twenty thousand pounds to the indian government i believe he told the whole story to the secretary of the india office indeed there was no reason why he should not seeing that every one who was implicated in the death of the rao singha has now passed away the story of kikat must now be relegated to the domain of legend for my own part i never wish to hear of it again poor olive she was so much relieved to know that her dear father was not guilty of bloodshed she has put everything else behind her and feels able to cherish his memory as she loves to do that is as it should be i always thought highly of olive's moral principles between them lord aldean and mr mallow have arranged mrs drabble's affairs that is to say that as the doctor died absolutely penniless they allow her a small income the children have been put to school and i am glad to say that the discipline is already exercising a most salutary effect upon margery pruning as i may say the exuberance of her temperament she is much less flighty and altogether improved and i feel confident she will at length emerge into a clever and notable woman her tastes lie chiefly in the direction of poetry and when she comes here for her holidays i endeavour myself to assist her as much as i can as a widow mrs drabble is infinitely happier than she was as a wife this is reflected in her home which now presents something like an orderly appearance she is full of praises of her benefactors which indeed is just and right i received a short time back some news from india which i think will interest you it appears that major semberry through financial difficulties has been obliged to resign his commission reports say he has gone to chili with the intention of there entering the service of the republic it is to be hoped whether he does this or no that he will take his lesson to heart and endeavour to mend his ways even at this somewhat tardy stage in his career you priscilla with your usual acuteness were perfectly correct in your reading of his character he is a thoroughly bad man and he never did a worse thing than when he conspired to ruin the life of our poor dear olive it just shows how far beneath the standard of honour and moral rectitude it is possible for a gentleman to fall there is still one other and a most extraordinary circumstance in connection with the conspiracy that i must tell you a week ago mr mallow received a visit from clara boldini she told him that her husband had gambled away every penny of the money with which they decamped is it not terrible to think of such depravity imagine a young man like that squandering thirty thousand pounds in twelve months in gambling and not only did the wretched fellow lose his money but his life it appears that directed by the terrible creature whom they call madame death in life two of her followers tracked boldini to lima in peru and shot him one night in a gambling den their efforts to obtain the tangible fruits of his wickedness were frustrated of course through his having squandered them in their fury at thus being baulked of their spoil they determined to kill this unhappy clara she however managed to receive timely warning and escaped to england she looks old and worn and poor and seems possessed with the idea that she must ultimately be killed by these ruffians mr mallow and olive tried all they could to induce her to remain safe at casterwell but she would not because she said she could not bring more trouble upon them that was good of the girl i think she visited her uncle's grave and wept bitterly over it mr mallow did not tell her that her father too was buried close by and i think he was right it is best that this sad story should pass into oblivion clara remained only one night here she then returned to london but before she left she gave to olive the famous indian bangle which she had removed from the dead body of her husband when he met his death in lima olive keeps it as a curiosity though she does not need anything to remind her of the troublous times with which it is connected where clara is now we none of us know we can only hope she will be spared any such violent death as she fears and that indeed some amount of peace may be vouchsafed to her after the stormy life which she has led how truly thankful should we be my dear priscilla that providence has cast our lot in pastures so peaceful and so far removed from the strife and turmoil of the world there is really no more news to give you save that i am well and happy neither olive nor her husband would hear of my leaving the manor house so i am still here in my old position i have great comfort in the thought that olive is now so well protected by an honourable and upright husband besides which the presence of a literary man in the house is a source of unmixed pleasure to me the friendship between mr mallow and lord aldean still stands as firm as ever cemented only by the fact that their wives are as sisters to one another we are indeed a happy family down here and it needs only your presence my dear sister to compete our joy we all of us look forward to seeing you in london this season perhaps then we may persuade you to take a house in casterwell so that you may spend at least some part of the years that are to come amongst us who love and esteem you we are blessed indeed for we have health wealth and happiness and so far as our finite intelligence can perceive our troubles all are at an end and the future before us is tranquil this letter leaves me i may confidently say the happiest woman in the three kingdoms write to me my dear priscilla and tell me when you propose to arrive in london as my book will be published this year and it will be a great joy to me to feel that i am to have your valuable aid in correcting the proofs now let me conclude with a verse from the book of books to show how thankful i am for the great mercies of the almighty 'i cried unto god with my voice even unto god with my voice and he gave ear unto me' how truly that has been fulfilled my dear priscilla you know believe me my dear sister ever your loving rubina ps will you enter some roman catholic place of worship and see if any image of the virgin mary is decked with a turreted crown the diana of ephesus wore such a one and i connect her with the virgin the crown itself is probably a reminiscence of the tower of babel r the end london printed by william clowes and sons
