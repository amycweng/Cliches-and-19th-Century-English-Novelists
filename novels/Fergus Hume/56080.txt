hastens to healthgiving waters rests when curfew bells are ringing rises when the lark is singing plays lawn tennis flirts and idles laying snares for future bridals thus forgetting pleasures evil in return to life primeval it was toby clendon who named it pinchlers dockyard toby clendon young handsome and a trifle scampish who wrote witty essays for the satirist slashing criticisms for the bookworm and dainty society verses for any journal which chose to pay for such poetical effusions a very cruel remark to make about mrs pinchlers respectable private hotel at marshonthesea but then the truth is always cruel and mr clendon proved the truth of his statement in this wise a dockyard is a place where brokendown ships are repaired man by poetical license is a ship on the ocean of life some brokendown human ships under stress of circumstance put in to pinchlers private hotel for repair in the matter of bodily ailments pinchlers harbours these brokendown human ships therefore pinchlers is a human dockyard strike out the word human as redundant and there you are pinchlers dockyard a whimsical deduction doubtless yet by no means void of a certain amount of truthful humour as the guests at pinchlers private hotel were for the most part deficient as regards physical completeness if the lungs were healthy the liver was out of order granted that the head was all there the legs were not unless one leg counted as two splendid physique but something wrong with the internal organs yes certainly a good many human ships were undergoing repair under the calculating eye of mrs pinchler and as her establishment was not healthy enough for a hotel nor sickly enough for an hospital toby clendons intermediate term dockyard fitted it exactly so pinchlers dockyard it was called throughout marshonthesea it was a square redbrick house built on a slight eminence and facing the salt sea breeze of the channel on the one side a pleasant garden on the other smooth green tennis lawns and in front a mixture of turf of flowerbeds and of gravel sloping down to the road which divided it from the stony sea beach a short distance away to the right was marshonthesea with its rows of gleaming white houses set on the heights while below was the redroofed quaint old town built long before its rival above became famous as a wateringplace to the left undulating hills clumps of trees tall white cliffs and here and there pleasant country houses showing themselves above the green crests of their encircling woods add to this charming prospect a brilliant blue sea a soft wind filled with the salt smell of the waters and a sun tempered by intervening clouds and it will be easily seen that marshonthesea was a pleasantly situated place and pinchlers dockyard was one of the pleasantest houses in it and why said mr clendon continuing an argument and why english people want to go to the riviera for beauty when they have all this side of the channel to choose from is more than i can make out it was just after luncheon and the wrecks at present being repaired in the dockyard were sunning themselves on the tennis lawn some were reading novels others were discussing their ailments a few ladies were working at some feminine embroidery a few gentlemen were smoking their afterdinner pipe cigar cigarette as the case might be and all were enjoying themselves thoroughly in their different ways toby himself arrayed in spotless white flannels with a blueribboned straw hat was lying ungracefully on the grass smoking a cigarette and talking in an affectedly cynical vein to three ladies there was mrs valpy fat ponderous and plethoric miss thomasina valpy her daughter familiarly called tommy a charmingly pretty girl small coquettish and very fascinating in manner as a rule men of susceptible hearts fell in love with tommy but when they heard mrs valpy say that she was like thomasina when young generally retreated in dismay having a prophetic vision that this fragile biscuitchina damsel would resemble her mother when old and as mrs valpywell they never proposed at all events there was a third lady present miss kaituna pethram who was staying at pinchlers with the valpys and without doubt she was very handsome so handsome indeed that tommys brilliant beauty paled before her sombre loveliness she was dark unusually dark with a pale olivecoloured skin coils of splendid dusky hair luminous dark eyes and clearlycut features which were not exactly european in their outline neither was her christian name european and this being taken in conjunction with her unenglish look led some people to think she had african blood in her veins in this supposition however they were decidedly wrong as there was no suggestion of the negro in her rich beauty indian not delicate enough neither as regards features nor figure spanish no none of the languor of the creole then no doubt italian but then she lacked the lithe grace and restless vivacity of the latin race in fact miss kaituna pethram puzzled every one they were unable to fix her as the americans say and consequently gave up the unguessable riddle of her birth in despair as a matter of fact however she was the descendant in the third generation of that magnificent new zealand race now rapidly dying outthe maories and the blending of the dusky polynesian with the fair european had culminated in the production of this strange flower of two diverse stocksneither wholly of the one nor of the other but a unique blending of both her great grandparents had been fullblooded maories with uncivilised instincts and an inborn preference for a savage life their daughter also a fullblooded maori being the daughter of a chief had married a european settler and the offspring of this mixed marriage was kaitunas mother a halfcaste inheriting the civilised culture of her father and the savage instincts of her mother kaituna was born of this halfcaste and an english father therefore the civilised heredity prevailed but she still retained the semblance in a minor degree of her primeval ancestry and without doubt though ameliorated by two generations of european progenitors on the male side there lurked in her nature the ineradicable instincts of the savage of course selfcomplacent europeans pureblooded in themselves never argued out the matter in this wise and were apt to look down on this inheritor of maori ancestry as a nigger but were decidedly wrong in doing so as the magnificent race that inhabits new zealand is widely removed from the african black at all events whatever they might think kaituna pethram was a uniquely beautiful girl attractive to a very great degree and inspiring more admiration than the undecided blondes and brunettes who moved in the same circle cared to acknowledge toby clendon was not in love with her as he preferred the saucy manner and delicate beauty of miss valpy but archie maxwell who was the best looking young man at pinchlers had quite lost his heart to this unique flower of womanhood and the damsels of pinchlers resented this greatly mr maxwell however was at present engaged in talking to some of them at a distance and if his eyes did wander now and then to where clendon was playing shepherd paris to goddesses threemrs valpy being minerva in her own opinionthey did their best to enchain his attention and keep him to themselves kaituna herself did not mind as she was not particularly taken with mr maxwell and was quite content to lie lazily back in her chair under the shelter of a large red sunshade and listen to toby clendons desultory conversation it was a pleasant enough conversation in a frivolous fashion mr clendon made startling statements regarding the world and its inhabitants kaituna commented thereon tommy sparkled in an idle girlish way and mrs valpy with sage maxims culled from the monotonous past of an uneventful life supplied the busy element requisite in all cases three of the party were young the fourth was gracefully old so juvenility predominating the conversation rippled along pleasantly enough after the patriotic toby had made his remark concerning the superiority of things english over all the rest of the world kaituna waved the banner of maoriland and laughed softly ah wait till you see new zealand ultima thule said clendon classically eh i why should i go there miss pethram to see what nature can do in the way of beautiful landscape i am a domestic being miss pethram and find the domestic scenery of england sufficiently beautiful to satisfy my artistic longings new zealand i have been told is an uncivilised country full of horrid woods and wild beasts there are no wild beasts at all replied kaituna indignantly and the bush is not horrid as to it being uncivilised that is the mistake you english make oh the contempt in the term you english interjected toby impudently we have cities railways theatres musical societies shops and everything else necessary to make life pleasant that is civilisation i suppose we have also great plains majestic mountains splendid rivers undulating pasture lands and what not this is uncivilisedif you like to call it so england is prettyoh yes very pretty but tame like a garden one gets tired of always living in a garden a garden is natures drawingroom i dont say a word against england for i like it very much but at times i feel stifled by the narrowness of the place england is very beautiful yes but new zealand concluded miss pethram with conviction new zealand is the most beautiful place in the whole world my dear said mrs valpy in a patronising manner are you not going a little too far ive no doubt the place you come from is very nice very nice indeed but to compare it with england is ridiculous you have no city i think like london no no london is cosmopolitan yesquite so having stated this plain truth mrs valpy looked round with a fat smile of triumph and resumed her knitting while tommy dashed into the conversation with slangy vivacity oh i say you know new zealands a place where you can have a high old time but londons the place for larks why not the country said clendon drily the morning lark oh i dont mean that sort of lark interrupted tommy ingeniously the evenin lark my style you know waltzin flirtin talkin jolly rather you move in the highest circles tommy said kaituna who was a somewhat satirical damsel you drop your gs better than dropping your hs or your money said toby lighting a fresh cigarette i dont know what were all talking about i think observed mrs valpy in a geographical style we were discussing the islands of new zealand rippin place said tommy gaily thomasina my dear remarked her johnsonian mamma i really do not think that you are personally acquainted with the place no im not but kaituna has told me a lot archie maxwell has told me more mr maxwell interposed kaituna quickly oh yes he said that he had visited auckland on his way to sydneybut you cant tell new zealand from one city ex pede herculem said the classical toby which being translated meansby the foot shall ye know the head auckland isnt the head of new zealand it was but now wellington is the capital the city of wooden matchboxes built in a draughty situation how unpatriotic oh no im not mr clendon but i reserve my patriotism for dunedin you mean edinburgh i mean the new edinburgh with the old name not the old edinburgh with the new name epigrammatic decidedly this is instructive miss pethram do they teach epigram in the schools of dunedin and why not do you think oxford and cambridge monopolise the learning of nations we also in dunedin concluded kaituna proudly have an university to teach the young idea how to shootdelightful but i thought there was no game to shoot said tommy wickedly mrs valpy reproved the trio for their frivolous conversation you are all talking sad nonsense on the contrary gay nonsense retorted clendon lightly but i foresee in this badinage the elements of an article for the satirist miss pethram i am going to use you as copy tell me all about yourself to be published as an essay and ticketed the new pocahontas perhaps replied the essayist evasively for you are a kind of nineteenth century pocahontas you belong to the children of nature yes i do said kaituna quickly and im proud of it my father went out to new zealand a long time ago and there married my mother who was the daughter of a maori mother my grandmother was the child of a chiefa real pocahontas not quite pocahontas was a chieftainess in her own right and died at wapping didnt she said mrs valpy placidly of course the dark races always give way to the superiority of the white kaituna looked indignantly at this fat flabby woman who spoke so contemptuously of her maori ancestors who were certainly superior to mrs valpy from a physical point of view and very probably her equal mentally in some ways it was no use however arguing with mrs valpy over such a nice point as she was firmly intrenched behind her insular egotism and would not have understood the drift of the argument with the exception that she was a white and therefore greatly superior to a black toby saw the indignant flash in her eyes and hastened to divert the chance of trouble by saying the first thing that came into his mind is your mother in england miss pethram my mother is dead oh i begi beg your pardon said toby flustering a little at his awkwardness i mean your father my father replied kaituna cheerfully oh he is out in new zealand again you know we lived out there until a year ago then my father by the death of his elder brother became sir rupert pethram so he brought me home we always call england home in the colonies he had to go out again about business so he left me in mrs valpys charge delighted to have you my dear murmured the old lady blinking her eyes in the sunshine like an owl you see mr clendon we are near neighbours of sir ruperts down in berkshire oh said clendon raising himself on his elbow with a look of curiosity in his eyes that is my county may i ask what particular part you inhabit near henley why i lived near there also what cried tommy with great surprise can it be that you are a relative of mr clendon the vicar of deswarth only his son the young man who would not become a curate it didnt suit me said toby apologetically im far too gay for a curate its a mistake putting a square peg into a round hole you know and i make a much better pressman than a preacher it is a curious thing we never met you mr clendon observed mrs valpy heavily but we have only been at the terraces for two years oh and ive been away from the parental roof for five or six years i do not wonder at never meeting you but how strange we should meet here coincidences occur in real life as well as in novels i see mr maxwell told me he met a man in london the other day whom he had last seen in japan said kaituna smiling maxwell is a wandering jewan engineering cain hush hush said mrs valpy shocked like a good churchwoman at any reference to the bible in light conversation mr maxwell is a very estimable young man i called him cain in a figurative sense only replied toby coolly but if you object to that name let us call him ulysses among the sirens finished kaituna mischievously tommy caught the allusion and laughed rudely confident in her own superiority regarding beauty she was scornful of the attempts of the socalled sirens to secure the bestlooking man in the place so took a great delight in drawing into her own net any masculine fish that was likely to be angled for by any other girl she called it fun the world called it flirtation and her enemies called it coquetry and toby clendon although not her enemy possibly agreed with the appropriateness of the term but then he was her lover and lovers are discontented if they dont get the object of their affections all to themselves the sirens repeated miss valpy scornfully what with voices like geese what humbug let us take archie maxwell ulysses away from the sirens kaituna no no dont do that said kaituna with a sudden rush of colour its a shame what depriving them of their big fish not at all its greedy of them to be so selfish ill call him mr maxwell its very chilly here said kaituna rising to her feet mr clendon my shawl please thank you im going inside because of mr maxwell asked miss valpy maliciously no im expecting some letters from mr dombrain oh here is mr maxwell au revoir and miss pethram walked quickly away towards the house maxwell having extricated himself from the company of the sirens who looked after their late captive with vengeful eyes saw kaituna depart and hesitated between following her or obeying the invitation of miss valpy his heart said go there the voice of tommy said come here and the unfortunate young man hesitated which to obey the lady saw his hesitation and purposely to vex mr clendon settled the question at once mr maxwell come here i want you to play lawntennis certainly miss valpy said maxwell with sulky civility why i asked you to play twice this afternoon and you refused cried clendon in some anger well ive changed my mind but you can play also if you like no thank you iveive got an engagement tommy moved close to the young man and laughed youve got a very cross face at this clendon laughed also and his cross face cleared oh ill be delighted to play and what about miss pethram asked maxwell rather anxiously miss pethram has gone inside to await the arrival of the post isnt she coming out again i think not if you will excuse me miss valpy i wont play just at present oh never mind so maxwell stalked away in a very bad temper with himself with miss pethram and with everything else in any one but a lover it would have been sulks but in the ars amoris it is called despair tommy held her racket like a guitar and strumming on it with her fingers hummed a little tunea vulgar little tune which she had picked up from a common street boy tho im an earl and shes a girl far far below my level oh mary jane you give me pain you wicked little thomasina cried the scandalised mrs valpy and thomasina laughed chapter ii wanted a chaperon we are told in stories olden dragons watched the apples golden quick to send a thief to hades now no fruit the worldtree ladens apples gold are dainty maidens and the dragons are old ladies after dinnera meal cooked conducted and eaten on strictly digestive principlesmost of the inmates of pinchlers retired to bed sleep was necessary to the wellbeing of these wrecks of humanity so those who could sleep went to their repose with joyful hearts and those who could not put off the evil hour precluding a restless night by going to the drawingroom for a little music here they sat in melancholy rows round the room comparing notes as to their physical sensations and recommending each other patent medicines some of the younger people sang songs and played popular airs on the outoftune piano furnished by pinchlers during the intervals between the songs scraps of curious conversation could be heard somewhat after this fashion theres nothing like a glass of hot water in the morning dry toast mind butter is rank poison rub the afflicted part gently and breathe slowly put a linseed poultice at the nape of the neck with such light and instructive conversation did the wrecks beguile their leisure hours keeping watchful eyes on the clock so as not to miss taking their respective medicines at the right times mrs pinchler a dry angular woman with a glassy eye and a fixed smile revolved round the drawingroom at intervals asking every one how they felt better mrs tandle yes i thought that syrup would do you goodit soothes the coats of the stomach miss pols you do look yellow let me recommend a glass of hot water in the morning mr spons if you lie down on the sofa im sure it will do you good oh are you going to play miss valpy something quiet please music is such a good digestive tommy however was not a young lady who could play quiet tunes her performance on the piano being of the muscular order she therefore favoured the company with a noisy piece of the most advanced school which had no melody although full of contrapuntal devices having shaken every ones nerves with this trying performance she glided off into a series of popular waltzes mostly of the scrappy order in which she sandwiched hymn tunes between musichall melodies the wrecks liked this style of thing as they could all beat time with their feet and when it was finished said waltzes were charming but not so fine as batchs passion music of which they knew nothing not even how to pronounce his name correctly bach echoed tommy contemptuously oh hes an old fossil offenbachs more in my line oui you bet sapristi vive la bagatelle the company did not understand french so suffered this observation to pass in discreet silence but kaituna laughed she was sitting in a corner by herself with a look of impatience on her face for she was expecting a letter and the post was late kaituna cried tommy attracted by the laugh why are you sitting in the corner like a graven image come out and sing no i dont want to im waiting for my letter hasnt it arrived yet said miss valpy skipping across the room id give it to that dombrain thing if i were you dombrain what a name who is he my fathers solicitor oh in the law and the profits i dont mean biblically but commercially but i say dont keep thinking of your letter or it wont come the watched postman never boils what nonsense you talk i cant help it dear my brains leave me when there are no male things in the room theres mr spons oh i dont bother about him hes not a man hes a medicine bottle hark i hear footmarks approaching on horseback it is the man now will you take mr clendon and i mr maxwell or will you take mr maxwell and i mr clendon i dont want either said kaituna hastily now thats ungrateful especially when mr maxwell is such a dear oh that heaven would send me such a manshakespeare kaituna so dont look indignant you can take archie and ill satisfy myself with toby you shouldnt call men by their christian names thomasina dont say that it sounds like ma i only call them by their christian names to you i wouldnt do it to their faces i hope not how proper you are behold the male sex are at the door i can smell the tobacco on their clothes the rattle of the lively damsel was put an end to by the entry of the gentlemen headed by maxwell and clendon the latter of whom miss valpy bore off at once to the piano to make him sing turn over her music and make himself generally useful maxwell however went straight across to kaituna and held out a newspaper this is yours miss pethram he said seating himself beside her i knew you were anxious about the post so i waited downstairs till it came was there no letter said kaituna in some dismay no nothing but that telegraph oh there maybe something marked in it she said quietly excuse me a moment while i look maxwell bowed and sat watching her as she tore the cover off the paper and opened the rustling leaves he had only known this girl a fortnight yet within that time had contrived to fall deeply in love with her it was not her beauty although manlike he naturally admired a pretty woman it was not her charming manner fascinating as it was in every way it was not her clever brain her bright conversation her perfect taste in dress no it was that indescribable something which she had about her to attract him in a greater degree than any other woman he had ever known what that something is no man knows until he has fallen in love and then he feels it but cannot describe his sensations scientists no doubt would call it animal magnetism poets would call it love scoffers would term it sensuality but whatever scientists poets or scoffers choose to call it the thing is unnameable indescribable and is the necessary concomitant of a happy marriage it was this indescribable feeling that had sprung up suddenly between those two young people kaituna also felt drawn to maxwell but in a lesser degree for no matter what cynics may say about the frivolity of women they are certainly less inflammable than men a pretty woman knows her power to attract the opposite sex and uses it daily mostly for amusement therefore when her time does come to feel the genuine pangs of love she is more able to govern and control her feelings than a man who as a rule simply lets himself go so this was exactly how the case stood between these two lovers maxwell felt that kaituna was the one woman in the world for him and never attempted to suppress his passion in any way he allowed himself to be so entirely dominated by it that it soon became his master and all his days and nights were given over to dreams of this beautiful dark woman from a distant isle of the sea on the other hand kaituna felt that she loved him but controlling herself with feminine dexterity never let her infatuated lover see that his passion was responded to in any way had he tried to go away she would speedily have lured him back by means of those marvellous womanly arts the trick of which no man knoweth but the poor lovelorn wretch was so abjectly submissive that she coolly planted her conquering foot on his neck and indulged in a little catlike play with this foolish mouse he was a handsome fellow too archie maxwell with his freshcoloured face his yellow hair and moustache his blue eyes and his stalwart figure a lover any girl would be proud to have at her feet as kaituna undoubtedly was though the woman predominated in her too much to allow her to let him see her approval poor yes he was poor certainly an engineer who wandered over half the world building bridges and railways and all kind of extraordinary things still he was young and engineering is a money making profession so kaituna positively determined that should he ask her to marry him she would consent but her fatherwell he was thousands of miles away and when he returned she would no doubt gain his approval so at present she surrendered herself entirely to this new delicious feeling and ulysses tangled in the snares of calypso forgot everything save the face of the conquering nymph meanwhile calypso read the paper while ulysses watched her and they both sat silent while every one round them talked loudly tommy was playing a nigger minstrel tune and toby leaning on the piano was chatting to her gaily evidently on the fair way to become as much enamoured of his nymph as this other sighing rover well have you found what you wanted asked maxwell as the lady looked up with a bright smile yes it is marked with a blue pencil and as you have been so kind in playing postman you can read it archie did so wanted a companion for a young lady apply by letter dombrain chintler lane city short and sweet he said handing the paper back with a puzzled look on his face but i dont understand it its easily explained replied miss pethram composedly mr dombrain is my fathers solicitor and is advertising for a chaperonfor me for you but you have mrs valpy mrs valpy is a dear old lady but she ismrs valpy it is a very serious thing to advertise in a paper for a chaperon you never know the kind of person you may get mr dombrain will mr dombrain may not be infallible retorted archie feeling rather angry he knew not why at the repetition of the name if your father wished you to have a chaperon why didnt he ask mrs valpy to recommend some one kaituna laughed im sure i cant tell you papa has gone away to new zealand on business and asked mrs valpy to look after me in the meantime he left instructions with mr dombrainin whom he has full confidencethat i was to be provided with a companion so i suppose mr dombrains only idea of getting one suitable is through the newspapers i think its a pity oh not at all dont be afraid of me mr maxwell i assure you i can take excellent care of myself all colonial girls can they are more selfreliant than english young ladies if i dont like the companion chosen for me by mr dombrain ill easily get rid of her but if mrs valpy recommended you someone who could introduce you into society some pauper peeress i suppose you mean said kaituna equitably no i wouldnt care for that at all i dont wish to go into society until my father comes home again then it will be easy for the pethrams are an old family and have sisters and cousins and aunts everywhere when i wish to see the world ive no doubt papa will find some one to present me at court but at present i want a companion to talk to i say a chaperon but i mean a companion oh i wishi wish stuttered archie growing red i wish he stopped short this wise young man for he was on the verge of saying something very foolish which might have jeopardised his chances with the maori maiden but the fruit was not yet ripe so with wisdom beyond his years he refrained from finishing his sentence youve wished three times said miss pethram calmly what is it about the wish yes i wish that you may get a good chaperon so do i but i suppose they are as difficult to get as anything else im afraid ill be very hard to please of course its a difficult thing to choose a person to live with even in marriage kaituna blushed and folded up the paper in a somewhat embarrassed fashion marriage is a lottery she said at length with an attempt at lightness i think ive heard that remark before very likely its hard to say anything original nowadays i suppose said archie after a pause that when your chaperon is chosen by mr dombrain she will come down here oh dear no im going home next week with the valpys home yes to thornstream near deswarth in berkshire papas house you know and ill never see you again he said dismally oh i dont know the world is small maxwell groaned in vexation of spirit thinking that the heart of this desirable maiden was as the flint which is hard and the maiden herself having thus worried her mouse consoled it in a pleasant fashion besides berkshire is not very far from london i know that of course but i have no acquaintances in deswarth oh fie what about mrs valpy mrs valpy of course i quite forgot mrs valpy said archie determined to pay court at once to the old lady you know i like mrs valpy since when asked kaituna mischievously archie took out his watch gravely and looked at it to be exact since a minute ago oh the craft of the male sex the end justifies the means quoted archie jesuitically but oh i say he stopped and a look of alarm overspread his face whats the matter im afraid i wont be able to come down to berkshire why not because i have to go to south america next month kaituna froze instantly and annihilated him with a glacial look at which he quailed visibly i cant help it miss pethram he said piteously dont look at me like that im not looking at you like that retorted miss pethram vengefully ii hope youll have a pleasant voyage i wont i hate the sea then why go needs must when the devil drives thats very coarse but its very true i beg your pardon really but you know it is hard to have to go prancing about the world when you dont want to how long will you be out in south america i dont know perhaps for ever if i get yellow fever i wish you wouldnt talk like that man is mortal said maxwell with gloomy relish man is silly retorted kaituna rising to her feet so im going to ask mr clendon to sing a song you never ask me said the young man reproachfully oh can engineers sing maxwell said a naughty word under his breath and walked meekly to the piano beside her toby was in possession of the instrument and was giving miss valpy selections from the latest london burlesque this is the dance you know he said playing a breakdown and then comes the song skip the gutter daddy deara rippin song sounds like it said maxwell caustically so refined well you neednt talk my boy ive seen you enjoying it immensely kaituna directed another look of scorn at the unhappy maxwell which inspired him with a vehement desire to break tobys head he refrained however and smiled in a sickly manner i prefer shakespeare he said at length telling the best lie he could under the circumstances dry old stick observed tommy lightly theres no fun in him but hes so high class listen to the virtuous one said clendon scoffingly oh my gracious that my boy should talk such jargon you dont feel ill do you archie no i dont retorted archie in a rage seeing that kaituna was enjoying this little dialogue with great zest i wish youd be quiet and sing something how can i be quiet and sing also dosing mr clendon said kaituna with a kind flash of her beautiful eyes at the happy bard maxwell suppressed a second naughty word and sat down in dismal silence what shall i sing asked toby running his fingers over the piano something funny no no something sentimental said kaituna in a commanding tone and sat down beside miss valpy toby cleared his throat looked up at the ceiling for inspiration and laughed ill sing a betwixt and between thing so he did she is the dearest of girls i confess her milliners bills are a sight to see dearest of girls in the matter of dress dearest of girls in the world to me i lost my heart but i lost my gold and hearts without gold are romantic trash her love was a thing to be bought and sold but i couldnt purchase for want of cash now she is spouse to an aged man hes eightyfive and a trifle frail soon hell finish his lifes brief span then shell look for another male ah but love comes not twice in our life cupid for ever has passed us by so if she asked me to make her my wife i would not marry her no not i oh said tommy when the song was ended so thats your idea of a womans love not minethe worlds and what about the love which cannot be bought asked kaituna is there such a love yes cynic growled maxwell in disgust true love is not a saleable article the woman who truly loves a man here his eye rested on kaituna lets nothing stand in the way of that love she gives up rank fortune everything for his sake and what does she receive in return demanded miss pethram innocently the true joy which arises from the union of two loving hearts very pastoral indeed said toby lightly chloe and corydon in arcadia it once existed indeed but now but now finished kaituna rather tired of the discussion it is time to retire both the gentlemen protested at the ladies going away so early but kaituna remained firm and was supported by tommy who said she felt very tired not of us i hope said toby meekly thyself hath said it she replied holding out her hand goodnight when they were leaving the room maxwell who was escorting kaituna bent over and whispered in her ear i wont go to south america south america she repeated with a pretended look of surprise oh yes of course i forgot all about it i assure you goodnight she was gone before he could say a word leaving him overcome with anger at the flippant manner in which she spoke was she in jest or earnest he could not tell perhaps she said one thing and meant another he could not tell perchanceoh women were all alike they liked to put their victim on a sharp hook and watch him wriggle painfully to be free shes a coquette who miss valpy asked toby overhearing no miss pethram but i dare say her friends no better im afraid not sighed mr clendon dismally its six of one and halfadozen of the other but what ails my archibald his brow is overcast oh rubbish growled archibald rudely come and smoke the smokingroom was quite empty so the young men established themselves in two comfortable armchairs and devoted their energies to the consumption of tobacco clendon preferred the frivolous cigarette but archie produced with loving care a well coloured meerschaum which had been his companion for many years this is a travelled pipe he said to his friend when the blue smoke was rolling in clouds from his mouth a very ulysses of pipes it has been in far countries and knoweth the ways of the stranger good idea for a story observed toby who was always on the lookout for copy the tale of a pipe in ten fills egad i think it ought to go capitally its so difficult to get an idea nowadays maxwell luxuriating in his pipe grunted in a manner which might have meant anything so toby promptly attacked him on his want of manners you might speak to a fellow when a fellow speaks to you i tell you what archie youve changed for the worse since we were at school together then you were a gregarious animal and now you are an unsociable beast dont call names my good man i cant help being quiet my thoughts are far away pish not so very far well perhaps not have you asked her to marry you hardly ive only known her a fortnight and besides ive got no money no but she has i dont want to live on my wife im going away to south america never to see her again i suppose said toby ironically dont talk nonsense archie youre madly in love with miss pethram and dont want to lose sight of her true but i must when she goes away from here not a bit of it listen i will be your good angel maxwell laughed grimly at the idea i will be your good angel repeated toby imperturbably and take you down with me to deswarth to your fathers house i thought you werent friends with your governor i am not acknowledged clendon with touching candour he wanted me to become a churchman and i didnt care about it we had words and parted now however ive won a success in literature ill go back and ask the pater to kill the domestic veal you i will bring with me to the banquet and as miss pethram lives near you will be able to see her woo her wed her and be happy ever afterwards archie made no reply but smoked furiously and toby having delivered himself of what he had to say also subsided into silence after a pause said maxwell toby yes ill come what about south america d south america chapter iii the woman with the fierce eyes you are a snake for the sly beast lies coiled in the brake of your sleepy eyes lo at your glances my weak soul dies woman you are with a face so fair but the snake must mar all the woman there your eyes affright but your smiles ensnare such a poor room it was with a wellworn carpet shabby furniture a dingy mirror over the fireplace and a mean sordid look everywhere the bright sunshine pouring in through the dirty windows showed up the weak points of the apartment in the most relentless manner great foldingdoors at one side half open showing an untidy bedroom beyond and on the other side the manypaned windows veiled by ragged curtains looked out into jepple street bloomsbury there was a shaky round table in the centre of the apartment on which was spread a doubtfully clean cloth and on it the remains of a very poor breakfast an egg half eaten a teacup half filled and a portion of bread on the plate showed that the person for whom this meal was provided had not finished and indeed she was leaning on the table with her elbows looking at a copy of the daily telegraph a noticeable woman this frowning down on the newspaper with tightly closed lips and one whom it would be unwise to offend after a pause she pushed the paper away arose to her feet and marching across to the dingy mirror surveyed herself long and anxiously the face that looked out at her from the glass was a remarkable one dark very dark with fierce black eyes under strongly marked eyebrows masses of rough dark hair carelessly twisted up into a heavy coil a thinlipped flexible mouth and a general contour of face not at all english she had slender brown hands which looked powerful in spite of their delicacy and a good figure though just now it was concealed by a loose dressinggown of pale yellow silk much discoloured and stained with her strange barbaric face her gaudy dress mrs belswin was certainly a study for a painter mrs belswin so she called herself but she looked more like a savage queen than a civilised woman she should have been decked with coloured beads with fantastic feathers with barbaric bracelets with strangely striped skins as it was she was an anomaly an incongruity in the poor room of poor lodginghouse staring at her fierce face in the dingy mirror mrs munser who kept the establishment acknowledged to her intimate friend mrs pegs that the sight of this lady had given her a turn and certainly no one could blame cockney mrs munser for of all the strange people that might be seen in london this lithe savagelooking woman was surely the strangest indian jungles african forests south american pampas she would have been at home there having all the appearance and fire of a woman of the tropics but to see her in dull smoky londonit was extraordinary after scrutinising herself for a time she began to talk aloud in a rich full voice which was broken every now and then by a guttural note which betrayed the savage yet she chose her words well she spoke easily and rolled her words in a soft labial manner suggestive of the italian language yet she was not an italian twenty years ago she muttered savagely nearly twenty years ago and i have hardly ever seen her i must do so now when providence has put this chance into my hands they cant keep a mother from her child gods laws are stronger than those of man rupert would put the ocean between us if he could but now hes in new zealand so for a time i will be able to see her to speak to her to hold her in my arms not as her motherno not as her motherbut as her paid servant she turned away from the mirror with a savage gesture and walked slowly up and down the room with the soft sinuous movement of a panther her soft silk dress rustled as she walked and her splendid hair released by her sudden movement fell like a black veil over her shoulders she thrust the tresses back from her temples with impatient hands and her face looked forth from the cloud of hair dark sombre and savage with a flash of the fierce eyes and vicious click of the strong white teeth curses on the man who took me away from her i did not care for him with his yellow hair and pink face why did i go why was i such a fool i left her my own child for him and went out into the world an outcast for his sake god god why are women such fools for a moment she stood with uplifted hands as if awaiting an answer but none came so letting her arms fall she walked back to her chair and lighting a cigarette placed it in her mouth i darent use a pipe here she said with a discordant laugh it would not be respectable but spanish women smoke cigarettes russian women smoke cigarettes so why should not the maori woman smoke them also respectable eh well im going to be respectable now when ive answered this this was an advertisement in the paper which read as follows wanted a companion for a young lady apply by letter dombrain chintler lane city apply by letter muttered mrs belswin with a sneer indeed i wont alfred dombrain ill apply in person and i think ill obtain the situation ill hold it toohold it till rupert returns and thenand then she sprang to her feet and blew a cloud of smoke with a mocking laugh and then my husband ill match myself against you salve dimora casta e pura the singer was coming slowly upstairs and as he finished the line knocked at the door stephano said mrs belswin with a frown glancing at the clock what can he want so early avanti the door opened and stephano the singer a tall lithe italian with a beaming smile presented himself and burst out into a torrent of greeting buon giorno cara mia ah my beautiful lucrezia my splendid norma how like an angel you look this morning gran dio che grazia signora i kiss your hand he dropped on one knee in an affectedly theatrical manner and pressed his lips to mrs belswins hand upon which she twitched it away with a frown and spoke roughly to her adorer what do you want ferrari niente niente but to pay a visit of ceremony its not customary to pay visits of ceremony at ten oclock in the morning i wish you would go away im busy che donna said the italian with a gesture of admiration and taking off his hat sat down on the sofa stephano ferrari was a handsome man in a wicked way he was tall and slender with a dark expressive face white teeth which gleamed under his heavy black moustache wonderfully fine eyes and a bland ingratiating manner english he spoke remarkably well having been for many years away from his native land but had a habit of interlarding his conversation with italian ejaculations which in conjunction with his carefullylearnt english had a somewhat curious effect being the tenor of an opera company in new york he had become acquainted with mrs belswin who was also in the profession and had fallen violently in love with this splendidlooking woman who had so many of the characteristics of his countrywomen mrs belswin did not reciprocate this passion and treated him with marked discourtesy but this only added fuel to the fire of his love much to her annoyance as ferrari had all the ardour and violence of his race strongly developed and was likely to prove dangerous if she did not return his passion a thing she felt by no means inclined to do at present he sat smiling on the sofa before her adjusted his bright red tie ran his fingers through his curly hair and then twisted the ends of his moustache with peculiarly aggravating complacency dont you hear what i say said mrs belswin stamping her foot angrily im busy go away bid me not fly from those starlike eyes sang the signor rolling a cigarette with deft fingers ah che bella musica if the words were but my beautiful italian instead of this harsh english dio it hurts the throat your speakingfogvoiced pigs that you are take your abuse and yourself somewhere else replied mrs belswin bringing her hand down sharply on the table i tell you im busy you never leave me alone stephano you followed me over from america and now you stay beside me all day why do you make such a fool of yourself because i love thee carissima let me light this not at thine eyesstelle radiantebut from thy cigarette grazia mrs belswin knew of old that when ferrari was in this humour nothing reasonable could be expected from him so resigned to the inevitable she let him light his cigarette as he wished then flinging herself down on her chair looked moodily at him how long is this foolery going to last she demanded caustically till you become the signora ferrari that will never be nay angela miait will be some day was there ever such a man burst out mrs belswin viciously he wont take no for an answer not from thee donna lucrezia dont call me donna lucrezia perch because im tired of opera im tired of you im tired of everything im going to leave all the old life and become respectable the life of a singer is always respectable declared ferrari mendaciously you mean to leave me signora yes i do ebbene we shall see what claim have you on me none i met you in america two years ago we nag together for a time and because of that you persecute me with you ridiculous attentions i love thee i dont want your love veramente no she spoke defiantly and folding her arms stared steadily at her persistent lover the italian however was not at all annoyed he simply threw his halfsmoked cigarette into the teacup and rising from his seat stood before her smiling and bland as ever non e vero signora ebbene i am the same we met in san francisco two years ago i was a singer of opera i obtained for you engagements i loved you carissima i love thee still you are cold cruel you stonewoman bella demonia for long time i have been your slave you have given me the kicks of a dog pazienza i finish soon i have told you all of myself you have told me all of yourself i come to this fog land with you and now you say addio bellissima signora but i am not to be talked to like a child i love you and i marry you ecco you will be signora ferrari senza dubbio having thus delivered himself of his determination with many smiles and gesticulations signor ferrari bowed in his best stage manner sat down in his chair and began to roll another cigarette mrs belswin heard him in silence the clenching of her hands alone betraying her anger but having had two years experience of the italians character she knew what to do and controlling herself with an effort began to temporise in a highly diplomatic manner i suppose no woman could be indifferent to such love as you profess stephano and some day i may be able to answer you as you wishbut not now not now and why cara mia because i am going to see my daughter again your daughter yes you know i told you all my past life i was a fool to do so as it gives you a certain hold over me but i am a lonelywoman your manner was sympathetic and sowell its only natural i should wish to confide in some one so you confided in me per lamor di dio signora do not be sorry i am simpatica i feel for you ah dio it was a terrible story of your husband and the parting in anger basta basta think of it no more i must do you think i can forget the past by a simple effort of will happy for me happy for all if such a thing could be buti have forgotten nothing that is my punishment and now cara now i am going to see my dear daughter again she is in london then ah che gioja yes she is inin england and il marito he is at the other end of the world bene let him say there mrs belswin nodded her head in savage approval then began to walk to and fro talking rapidly while he is away i have a plan in the paper there is a notice requiring a companion for my daughter how do you know because it is put in by a mr dombrain he is rupert pethrams solicitor oh i know him better than he thinks all these years i have been away from my child i have watched over her ah yes i know all of her life in new zealand i have good friends there i found out when her father brought her to england and that is why i came over here so quickly i intended to see her againto speak to herbut without revealing i was her unhappy mother buti was afraid of pethram yes you may smile stephano but you do not know him i do e incrdibile you who fear no one i do not fear him physically she said proudly with a savage flash from her fierce eyes i fear no man in that way but i am afraid because of my daughter she thinks i am dead it is better than that she should know i am a divorced disgraced woman if sir rupert were angry he might tell her all and thenand thenoh god i could not bear to see her again she would despise me she would look on me with scorn my own child ah i should diei should die the tears actually came into her eyes and for a moment softened their fierceness this woman hard and undisciplined with savage instincts derived from a savage mother yet felt the strong maternal instinct implanted in the breast of every woman and quailed with terror as she thought of the power her former husband had to lower her in the eyes of her daughter ferrari of course could not understand this having been always accustomed to think of mrs belswin as an untamed tigress but now she had a touch of feminine softness about her which puzzled him ah the strangeness of women he said philosophically ebbene now il marito is away what will you do im going to see mr dombrain and obtain the situation of companion to my own daughter not so fast signora she will know you no she will not know me replied mrs belswin softly she does not remember me when i left her she was a little child she thinks i am dead i go to her as a stranger it is hard it is terribly hard i will see her i will speak to her i will perhaps kiss her but i dare not say child i am your mother ah it is cruelbut it is my punishment it is a good plan for you cara mia but about me you forget your faithful stephano no i do not she said coaxingly for she was afraid he would spoil all knowing what he did but you must wait i want to see my daughterto live with her for a time when my husband returns he will know me so i must leave before he sees me then i will come back to thee carissima basta replied ferrari with great reluctance i do not wish to keep you from the child i am not jealous of il marito youve no cause to bei hate him look then the love i bear you carissima mia though all your life i know though you have had husband and lover yet i wish to make you mine it is strange said mrs belswin indifferently i am not a young woman my good looks are going my past life is not that of a saint and yet you would marry me because i love thee carissima said ferrari taking her hand i have loved many before but none like thee bella demonia ah dio thou hast the fierceness of the tiger within thee the hot blood of italy burns in thy veins my lucrezia borgia i am weary of tame women who weep and sigh ever i am no cold englishman thou knowest the lion seeks but the lioness and so i come to thee for thy love stella adorata he caressed her softly as he spoke these words in his musical voice and the woman softened under his caress with feline grace all the treachery and sleepiness of the panther was observable in this woman but under the smoothness of her manner lay the fierceness of her savage nature which was now being controlled by the master hand of the italian you will let me go to my daughter then she said in a soft languid voice her fierce eyes dulling under the mesmeric influence of his gaze as you will i can deny thee nothing regina del mia vita chapter iv what mrs belswin had to say the deeds we do though done in heedless ways may have the shaping of our future lives and stretching forth their long arms from the past may alter this and that in such strange fashion that we become as puppets in their hands to play the game of life by old events mr dombrains office situate in chintle lane was a shabby little place consisting of three rooms one where his clients waited another occupied by three clerks constantly writing and a third where mr dombrain himself sat like a crafty spider in his web waiting for silly flies the three rooms were all bad but mr dombrains was the worst a square lowroofed apartment like a box with a dim twilight atmosphere which filtered in through a dirty skylight in the roof this being the case dombrains desk was lighted by a gasjet with a green shade fed by a snakylooking indiarubber tube attached to the iron gaspipe projecting from the wall above his head the heavy yellow light flaring from under this green shade revealed the room in a halfhearted sort of fashion illuminating the desk but quite unable to penetrate into the dark corners of the place on the writingtable were piles of papers mostly tied into bundles with red tape a glass inkstand a pad of pink blottingpaper three or four pens all of which were arranged on a dingy inkstained green cloth in front of a row of pigeon holes full of loose letters and legallooking documents in front of this table sat mr dombrain in a heavy horsehaircovered chair and near him were two other chairs of slender construction for the use of clients along the walls more pigeon holes crammed with papers a tall bookshelf filled with hardlooking law books which had a secondhand look of having been picked up cheap a ragged carpet on the wellworn floor and dust everywhere indeed so thickly lay the dust on books on floor on papers on desk that the whole room looked as if it had just been opened after the lapse of years the chamber of the sleeping beauty perhaps and mr dombrainwell no he was not a beauty and he never was sleeping so the comparison holds not indeed he was a singularly ugly man in a coarse fashion a large bulletshaped head covered with rough red hair cut so remarkably short that it stood up stiffly in a stubbly fashion a freckled face with a coarse red beard clipped short cunning little grey eyes rather bleared by the constant glare of the gaslight in which he worked and large crimson ears dressed in a neat suit of black broadcloth he appeared singularly ill at ease in it and with his large stumpyfingered hands with clubbed nails his awkward manner his habit of stealthily glancing out of his bleared eyes mr dombrain was about as unsuited a person for a lawyer as one could find there was nothing suave about him to invite confidence and he looked as if he would have been more at home working as a navvy than sitting behind this desk with his large red hands clumsily moving the papers about three oclock in the afternoon it was by mr dombrains fatfaced silver watch lying on the table in front of him and as the lawyer noted the fact in his usual stealthy fashion a timidlooking clerk glided into the room yes said dombrain interrogatively without looking up if you pleaseif you please sir a lady stammered the timid clerk washing his hands with invisible soap and water a lady aboutabout the situation sir humph i said the application was to be by letter butbut the lady sir mr dombrain looked complacently at his nails but said nothing butbut the lady sir repeated the timid clerk again i said the application was to be by letter the clerk seeing that this was the answer he was expected to deliver went sliding out of the room but at the door encountered the lady in question dressed in black and closely veiled madam he stammered growing red the application was to be by letter i preferred to come personally as she spoke low though her voice was mr dombrain looked up suddenly with a startled look on his face can you see me mr dombrain he arose slowly to his feet as if in obedience to some nervous impulse and with his grey eyes looking straight at the veiled woman still kept silence can you see me mr alfred dombrain the lawyers red face had turned pale and looked yellow in the gaslight the hot atmosphere of the room evidently made him gasp used as he was to it for he opened his mouth as if to speak then closing it again signed to the clerk to leave the room left alone with his visitor dombrain still maintaining the same position stood watching her with a mesmeric stare as she glided into one of the chairs beside the table wont you sit down mr alfred dombrain his face was suddenly suffused with a rush of blood and he sat down heavily madam who are you dont you know ah what a pity and you have such a good memory for voices imemoryvoices he stammered moving restlessly yes why not mr damberton hush for gods sake hush who are you who are you the woman flung back her veil and he recoiled from the sight of her face with a hoarse strangled cry jezebel pethram once jezebel pethram now miriam belswin i see you remember faces as well as voicesand names also ah what an excellent memory mr dombrain alias damberton collected his scattered senses together and going over to a small iron safe set in the wall produced a tumbler and a bottle of whisky mrs belswin looked at him approvingly as he drank off half a glass of the spirit neat thats right youll need all your dutch courage quite forgetting the demands of hospitality dombrain replaced the bottle and glass in the respectable safe and resumed his seat at the table with his ordinary bullying nature quite restored to him by the potent spirit now then mrs pethram or belswin or whatever you like to call yourself he said in a harsh angry tone what do you want here i want you ho ho the feeling isnt reciprocal leave my office when i choose perhaps a policeman will make you go quicker growled dombrain rising perhaps he will retorted mrs belswin composedly and perhaps hell take you along with him infernal nonsense is it well try the experiment if you like mr dombrain resumed his seat with a malediction on all women in general and mrs belswin in particular then he bit his nails and looked at her defiantly only to quail before the fierce look in her eyes its no use beating about the bush with a fiend like you he growled sulkily making a clumsy attempt to appear at his ease not a bit i wish youd go away whined dombrain with a sudden change of front im quite respectable now i havent seen you for twenty years why do you come now and badger me it isnt fair to pull a man down when hes up do you call this up sneered mrs belswin looking round the dingy office its up enough for me the woman grinned in a disagreeable manner finding mr dombrains manner very amusing she glanced rapidly at him with her fierce eyes and he wriggled uneasily in his chair dont look at me like that you witch he muttered covering his face with his large hands youve got the evil eye confound you mrs belswin leaning forward held up her forefinger and shook it gently at the lawyer it wont do my friend i tell you it wont do youve tried bullying youve tried whining neither of them go down with me if you have any business to do youve got to put it aside for me if you have to see clients you cant and wont see them till i choose do you hear what i say you legal caliban ive come here for a purpose mr dombrainthat i believe is your present namefor a purpose sir do you hear yes i hear what is your purpose she laughed but not mirthfully to tell you a story i dont want stories go to a publisher certainly ill go to the scotland yard firm hold your tongue sir sneering doesnt come well from an animal like you i have no time to waste neither have i that being the case with both of us sit still mr dombrain stopped his wriggling and became as a stone statue of an egyptian king with his hands resting on his knees now ill tell you my story cant you do without that no my good man i cant to make you understand what i want i must tell you all my story some of it you know some of it you dont know be easy its short and not sweet listen and mr dombrain did listen not because he wanted to but because this woman with the fierce eyes had an influence over him which he bully coarseminded man as he was could not resist when he recollected what she knew and what she could tell and would tell if she chose a cold sweat broke out all over him and he felt nerveless as a little child therefore for these and divers other reasons mr dombrain listenedwith manifest reluctance it is true but still he listened we will commence the story in new zealand twenty yearssay twentytwo years ago one rupert pethram the younger son of a good family come out there to make his fortune he made it by the simple process of marrying a maori halfcaste called jezebel manners you see i dont scruple to tell everything about myself dear friend well mr and mrs pethram got on very well together for a time but she grew tired of being married to a fool he was a fool wasnt he she waited for a reply so dombrain against his will was forced to give her one yes he was a foolto marry you the wisest thing he ever did in his life seeing what a lot of property i brought him but i couldnt get on with him my mother was a pureblooded maori i am only half a white and i hated his cold phlegmatic disposition his supercilious manners i wasi am hotblooded ardent quicktempered fancy a woman like me tied to a coldblooded fish like rupert pethram bah it was madness i hated him before my child was born afterwards i hated him more than ever then the other man came along there always is another man naturally what would become of the divorce court if there wasnt yes the other man did come along a pink and white fool my husband was a god compared to silas oates then why did you run away with oates why indeed he attracted me in some way i suppose or i was sick of my humdrum married life i dont know why i left even rupert pethram for such a fool as silas i did so however i gave up my name my child my money all for whatfor a man that tired of me in less than six months and left me to starve in san francisco you didnt starve however it is not my nature to act foolishly all my life no i did not starve i had a good voice which i managed to get trained i had also a good idea of acting so i made a success on the operatic stage as madame tagni oh are you the celebrated madame tagni i was now i am mrs belswin of no occupation in particular i sang in the states i sang in new zealand you didnt sing in dunedin no because my husband was there do you know why i came to new zealanda divorced dishonoured woman no of course you dont i came to see my child i did see her unknown to rupert or to the child herself i was in new zealand a long time watching over my darling then i went again to the states but i left friends behind megood friends who kept me posted up in all the news of my child kaituna since i left her twenty years ago like a fool i have known everything about her i heard in new york how rupert had lost all his money owing to the decrease in the value of property i heard his elder brother had died and that he had come in for the title he is sir rupert pethram i ought to be lady pethram but youre not sneered dombrain unable to resist the opportunity she flashed a savage glance at him and replied quietly no i am mrs belswin thats enough for me at present but to go on with my story i heard how my husband had brought our child home to the old country and leaving her there had returned to new zealand on business when this news reached me i made up my mind at once and came over here i found outhow it matters notthat my husbands legal adviser was an old friend of mine one alfred damberton hush not that name here ah i forgot you are the respectable mr alfred dombrain now but it was curious that i should find an old friend in a position so likely to be of use to me use to you groaned dombrain savagely yes i have seen your advertisement in the paper for a companion for a young lady well i have come to apply for the situation you yes personally and not by letter as you suggested in print mr dombrain felt that he was in a fix and therefore lied with clumsy malignity that advertisement doesnt refer to your daughter doesnt it said mrs belswin sharply then why refer to my daughter at all just now becauseoh because because you couldnt think of a better lie i suppose she finished contemptuously it wont do my friend i tell you it wont do im not the kind of woman to be played fast and loose with you say it is not my daughter that requires a chaperon i do yes i do then you lie what do you think private detectives are made for did you think i came here without having everything necessary to meet an unscrupulous wretch like you i thought nothing about you i thought you were dead and wished it i daresay but im not im alive enough to do you an injuryto have your name struck off the roll of english solicitors you cant he retorted defiantly growing pale again i defy you youd better not mr damberton im one too many for you i can tell a little thing about your past career which would considerably spoil the respectable position you now hold no one would believe you against me a respectable solicitors word is worth a dozen of a divorced woman if you insult me ill put a knife in you you miserable wretch said mrs belswin breathing hard i tell you im a desperate woman i know that you have advertised for a chaperon for my daughter and iher motherintend to have the situation under the name of mrs belswin but your husband will recognise you my husband is out in new zealand and will be there for the next few months when he returns i will deal with him not you this matter of the chaperon is in your hands and you are going to give the situation to me you hear gaolbirdto me dombrain winced at the term applied to him and jumped up with a furious look of rage i defy you i defy you he said in a low harsh voice the veins in his forehead swelling with intense passion you outcast you jezebel ah how the name suits you i know what you are going to say that twenty years ago i was in gaol in new zealand for embezzlement well i own iti was i was a friend of your lover silas oatesyour lover who cast you off to starve i lost money betting i embezzled a large sum i was convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment well i worked out my term i left the colony where as alfred damberton i was too well known to get a chance of honest employment and came to england through america i met you again in america i was fool enough to think silas oates might help me for old times sake i found he had left youleft you alone in frisco you were little better than a vile creature on the streets i was a gaolbird oh a nice pair we were outcasts both you and i he passed his handkerchief over his dry lips as he paused but mrs belswin made no sign in any way but simply sat looking at him with a sneer when i left you resumed dombrain hurriedly i came to englandto my father he was a lawyer in the country he received me welltook me into his office and admitted me into partnership when he died i came up to london and have prospered since i have changed my name to alfred dombrain and am respected everywhere your husband does not know my story he was recommended to me by a friend and he has employed me for some years i have his confidence in every way i am a respectable man i have forgotten the past and now you come with your bitter tongue and spiteful mind to tear me down from the position i have so hardly won he dropped down exhausted into a chair but mrs belswin still smiling still sneering pointed to the safe take some more whiskey you will need it woman leave me not till i leave as chaperon to my child that you shall never have oh yes i shall i say you shall not you can go and tell my story where you please i shall tell yours and well see who will be believedalfred dombrain the respectable trusted lawyer or mrs belswin the divorced woman bah you cant frighten me with slanders there is nothing to connect dombrain the solicitor with damberton the convict indeed what about this she held up a photograph which she had taken out of her pocketa photograph resembling mr dombrain but which had written under it alfred damberton you may alter your face said mrs belswin maliciously but you cant very well alter your handwriting and now i look at you i really dont think there is much alteration a beard when there used to be only a moustache more wrinkles less smiles oh i think any one will recognise this for you dombrain made a snatch at the photograph but she was too quick for him not quite this is my evidence against you i heard in america through my useful detectives that you were lawyer to my husband so thinking i might require your help and knowing i shouldnt get it without some difficulty i took the trouble of writing to new zealand for a full report of your very interesting case youve cost me a good deal of money my dear sir but they pay well on the operastage so i dont mind i have all the papers telling your little story i have this photograph with your own signature proving the identity of damberton with dombrain so taking all things into consideration i think you had better do what i ask she had so completely got the better of mr dombrain that she had reduced him to a kind of moral pulp and he leaned back in his chair utterly crushed what do you want he asked feebly i want the situation of chaperon to miss kaituna pethram if i give it to you as i can will you hold your tongue aboutaboutmy past life yes certainly provided that you never disclose that the divorced mrs pethram has anything to do with the respectable mrs belswin i agree to all you say you will give me the situation yes i am engaged then you are as chaperon to miss pethram yes as chaperon to miss pethram mrs belswin arose with a smile of triumph and took her leave beaten all along the line i see let this be a lesson to you my dear friend never to put your thick head against a womans wits chapter v the prodigal son oh what becomes of our prodigal sons when worried by troublesome debts and duns when fatherly loving is quite worn out and how to exist is a matter of doubt well some go writing in london town a few rise up and a lot fall down many as squatters go south of the line and tend to their sheep instead of their swine dozens in african jungles now rest numbers ranch in the far wild west but have they full or an empty purse have they lived decently or the reverse married or single wherever they roam our prodigal sons in the end come home when mr clendon vicar of deswarth preached on the parable of the prodigal son he little thought that it would one day be applicable to his own offspring yet such was the case for tobias clendoncalled after that celebrated character in the apocryphacame home from oxford where he was supposed to be studying for the church and resolutely refused to become a curate with the chance of a possible bishopric somewhere about the forties the fact is the young man had contracted the fatal habit of scribbling and having had a few articles on dogcarts poetry saint simonismsuch was the wideness of his rangeaccepted by friendly editors had resolved to devote his energies to literature he had not ambition enough to become a great writer nor enough modesty to sink to the level of a literary hack but seeing a chance of earning his bread and butter in an easy fashion he determined to take advantage of it and get through life as happily as possible having therefore made up his mind to be a scribbler of ephemeral essays verse storiesanything that paid in facthe had also made up his mind to tell his respected parent but having a wholesome dread of said parent was afraid to do so chancemeddlesome goddesshelped him he was rusticated for an amusing escapade arising from a misuse of spiritsanimal spirits andandother spirits unfortunately the college authorities did not look at the affair precisely in tobys way so they banished him from alma mater whom toby henceforward regarded as an unjust stepmother being thus summarily treated he went home to deswarth and was received by his respectable parent with as strong language as his position as vicar allowed him to use clendon pre was a dryasdust old gentleman who was always grubbing among antique

his printed compositions to his father but that gentleman despising modern print modern paper modern everything would not look at his sons effusions this narrowmindedness grieved toby as he had hoped to break the matter gently to his reverend sire but as this could not be done instead of shivering on the brink like a timid bather he plunged in in plain english he told his father that he wished to

deluge no prophet likes to have his prophecies proved false and mr clendon was no exception to the rule having settled tobys career in life he was terribly angry that toby should presume to unsettle it in any way not be a curate not be a vicar not be a bishopwhat did the boy expect to be the boy with all humility stated that he expected to be a dickens a george eliot george eliot sir was a woman well then a walter scott had his father any objections the reverend bookworm had several first objectionliterature has no prizes money yes fame yes but no official prizes if you go into the law you may hope some day to sit on the woolsack which is stately but uncomfortable if you prefer the church you may attain the dignity of a bishopeven of an archbishop in medicine you may become physician to the court and physic royalty which entails large fees and a chance of populating the royal vaults in westminster abbey even in painting the presidentship of the royal academy is not beyond the reach of a conventional painter who does not startle his generation with too much genius all these things are worth striving for because they smack of officialism but literatureoh shade of richard savage what prize is there in literature suggestion by tobythe poet laureateship which has no salary worth speaking of attached to it and rhymes to order are seldom rhymes in order no the laureateship is out of the question therefore literature has no prizes second objectionliterature is a good stick but a bad crutcha remark of walter scott which was uttered in the primeval times of scribbling still according to mr clendon who knew nothing past that period it held good today if toby went in for literature how did he expect to live till the fame period seeing that he could earn but little and the paternal pursestrings were to be closed tightly poetry it doesnt pay verse is a curse doesnt fill the purse rhyme and reason both according to clendon pre novels pshaw the field is overrun by three volume rubbish by talented lady scribblers essays no one wants essays when lamb and addison can be bought cheaply altogether literature has no money in it third objection and strongestyou were intended for the church and you must carry out my plans even if against your own judgment having thus stated his objections clendon pre ordered toby to take holy orders at once and think no more of the draggletailed muse and all her tribe toby refused his father used clerical bad language toby left the room his father cut him off with a shilling and bade him leave the paternal roof which he did here endeth the first book of tobias in london toby had a hard time he went through the mill and did not like it he sounded the depths of the london ocean which contains all kinds of disagreeable things which appear not on the surfacefireless grates abusive landladies obdurate editors wellworn clothing oh it was certainly an unpleasant experience but toby sank to rise and never forgot when wandering amid this submarine wreckage of london that he was a gentleman and had one definite object in view if a man keep these two things in mind they are bladders which will float him to the surface among successful crafts therefore tobias clendon roseslowly at first then rapidly he wrote articles about the wreckage amid which he wandered and had them accepted by editors who paid him as little as they could afterwards he scribbled comic songs for opulent musichall artistes which contained the latest ideas of the day and a superfluity of slang these efforts brought him into contact with the theatrical profession which is renowned for its modesty and he put new wine into old bottles by patching up old burlesques in this cobbling he was very successful and what with one thing and another he got on capitally from burlesques he advanced to little curtain raisers he wrote short abusive stories for charitablyminded society papers scathing articles on books by celebrated writers in which he proved conclusively that they did not know their business as novelists and altogether became a sort of literary autolycus being a pickerup of unconsidered trifles in the literary line this brought him in a good income and in a few years he actually could face his bankers without blushing then he took a holiday and during such holiday went to marshonthesea where he met miss valpy who reminded him about his father and then i am said toby sententiously a prodigal son i have lived in a far country and eaten husks with london swine unlike the young man however i have risen above the profession of swineherd i have become friends with dives and he has bidden me to feasts where i have fared sumptuously the prodigal son began with money and ended with swine i began with swine and end now with money this is a distinct improvement on the old parable but now i will arise and go to my father im afraid he wont kill the fatted calf but i dont particularly mind as i detest veal its indigestible he wont fall on my neck because hes not a demonstrative old gentleman but still ill go especially as there is no dear brother to make things unpleasant my lares and penates i will collect and the country of my fathers will see me once more with this idea in his mind toby who had left home in a thirdclass carriage returned in a firstclass and was puffed up accordingly with all such pomposity however he took a common sense view of things with regard to the reception committee and walked to the vicarage with a becoming air of humility he had left his father grubbing among relics of fust and caxton and on his return found him still grubbinga little older looking a little dryerbut still stranded among rare folios of the middle ages toby saluted this paternal ghoul and was received kindly the ghoul having a heart concealed somewhere in his anatomy i am glad to see you again tobias said clendon pre with marked cordiality i am a clergyman and you offended me by not making the profession hereditary however i am also a father and i have missed you very much my boyvery much indeedshake hands which toby did and actually surprised a tear on the parchment cheek of his father which touch of nature making them both akin had a marked effect on the soft heart of the young man and he fell into the arms of his sire thus far the parable was excellently interpreted but the fatted calf ah it was truly an excellent beast that same calf for it consisted of several courses and the wine was undeniable clendon pre looked after his cellar as well as his folios and after a good dinner father and son clasped hands once more under the influence of port which made them both sentimental you will stay with me tobias and comfort my declining years certainly father but you will let me go to london occasionally oh yes tobias you must attend to your business by the way what is your business that of a scribbler ah richard savage and grub street never mind my boy ive got money enough for us both no not grub street nous avons change tout cela eh father i make about five hundred a year whatwhat at scribbling yes dear me remarked clendon pre eyeing his port what a lot of money there must be in the world my dear father literature has improved since the caxton period but printing has not tobias no no nowadays they use flimsy paper bad type but the matter father the contents of a book i never read a modern book pish you cant teach an old dog new tricks i dont believe in your cheap literature its a good thing for me at any rate father of course its an ill wind that blows nobody any good well this wind has blown me to you with five hundred a year good good yes folios make one narrow you shall expand my mind tobias you shall bring me into contact with the nineteenth century but i wont read any books but your own i dont write books no well im thankful for small mercies how long are you going to stay with me till you grow tired of me then tobias you are settled here for the rest of your life my dear father by the way i want to ask a friend of mine down here not a woman no i havent got that far yet a fellow called archie maxwell he used to go to school with me and were great chums tobias no slang you mean you are a david and jonathan i do thats about the size of it eheu hinc ill lachrym i like not the nineteenth century talk it grates on the ear i beg your pardon father but can i have archie maxwell down certainly is he also in grub street oh no hes an engineer on the railway no a civil engineerbuilds bridges well well let the young man come but hell find it dull here oh no he wont because you see father theres a lady eh miss kaituna pethram whom he loves ho ho i know the young lady she is a parishioner of mine her father came into the title a year ago and has gone out to new zealand again leaving his daughter in charge of mrs belswin mrs belswin yes a very charming lady who acts as chaperon poor archie what are you afraid of the dragon who guards the golden apples said the bookworm with great good humour pooh pooh in my time young men were not such fainthearted lovers if he really adores this nymph of the oceanshe comes from new zealand i believehell soon propitiate the dragon is it an amiable dragon humph im afraid not your hercules must be stouthearted what a pity mrs valpy and her daughter are not the chaperons still eh why i think miss valpy requires a chaperon herself but perchance no hercules eyes that golden fruit silence on the part of tobias and a blush on his cheek tobias tobias said his father with uplifted finger youve been looking over the garden wall of the hesperides and the golden fruit of the valpys tempts you eh my son you also are in lovewith miss valpy yes and your friend is in love with miss pethram yes and you both intend to stay with me for a time so as to be near your inamoratas if you please father mr clendon smiled grimly and finished his glass of port which he really felt he needed cupid cupid what have i done that thus i should be sir pandarus of troy in my old age tobias go to bed goodnight father and he vanished sir pandarus groaned farewell oh lovely peace i dwell no more under the shade of thy desirable olive four lovers in one parish and i the vicar thereof alas alas the prodigal son i sent abroad with curses has returned and he hath brought back his curse with him eheu infelici chapter vi the dragon an elderly dragon with cold grey eyes tongue that gibes at a lover rash ears quite deaf to pathetic sighs uttered by men who are scant of cash but when a millionaire comes to woo the dragon inspires him not with fear her sole idea of love that is true is measured by so many pounds a year thornstream manor the residence of the pethrams for many generations was a quaint old house surrounded by pleasant grounds a grey weatherbeaten structure of two stories built on a slight rise on which were wide terraces down to the green lawns below which were girt some distance away by a circle of ancient trees the house itself was a long low embattlemented place between two sharply pointed gables beneath which were diamondpaned oriel windows along the front other wide low windows and a massive door set in a heavy stone porch the roofs above of deepred tiles with twisted chimneys here and there and the whole house covered with a clinging garment of dark green ivy as if to shelter it from the cold winds blowing across the park seen at the end of the drive as it emerged from the trees the white terraced rise topped by the grey ivycovered house with the tint of red afforded by the roof looked singularly peaceful and pleasant the goddess with the olive branch had established herself in this pleasant domain and a brooding air of sunday quiet pervaded the place as if it were indeed that delightful castle of indolence whereof one james thomson discourseth so pleasantly the grounds were also charmingwide stretches of green lawn flowerbeds filled with homely cottage flowers still stonerimmed ponds where broadleaved waterlilies kept the sun from grilling the hoary carp in the depths below an antique dial with its warning motto and on the verge of the lush glass heavily foliaged trees making pleasant shades for the timid deer browsing round their gnarled boles white pigeons flashed in the blue sky round the grey walls of thornstream or nestled among the trees with gentle cooings while a glimpse could be obtained every now and then of lazy cows in distant meadows chewing the cud of contentment it was one of those scenes of intense quiet which are only to be seen in full perfection in the pleasant lands of pastoral england a home a veritable home which one engaged in the turmoil of the world would remember with regretful longing peace absolute peace that most desirable of all blessings was here peace which youth scorns but which age prizes brooded over the homestead and the sleeping beauty herself might have dreamed away her hundred years in this happy english mansion without being disturbed in any way and on an english homegrey twilight poured on dewy pastures dewy trees softer than sleepall things in order stored a haunt of ancient peace i never understood those lines of tennyson until i saw thornstream it was kaituna who was speakingkaituna arrayed in a cool white dress standing on the terrace in the early morning looking over the peaceful scene spread out before her the birds were singing joyously in the trees the cool dew was lying on the grass and this young girl reared in a fardistant country was now viewing with dreamy eyes the pleasant land of england beside her was mrs belswin in a simple dress of black serge with all her splendid hair smoothed firmly back and a pensive look in her fierce eyeseyes which had now lost in a great measure their savage expression and which filled with soft maternal love when they rested on the straight slim form of her daughter in the sordid lodging in bloomsbury in a gaudy dress with her real nature unrestrained in any way she had looked like a savage but now with all her feelings well under control her sombre dress and her demure look she appeared quite civilized the savage was there however all the same and should occasion arise to excite her in any way a keen observer could easily see that the thin veneer of civilization would vanish and the true instinct of the uncivilized being would flash forth with a force all the greater for suppression her voice also had altered as it was no longer strident or harsh in its tones and in replying to kaitunas remark anent tennyson it was as soft and sweet as that of a quakeress it is very beautiful in a mild way she said quietly but im afraid i should grow weary of this everlasting tranquillity oh mrs belswin im sure that truer happiness can be found here than in the world i dare say you are right kaituna but the sentiment sounds curious coming from one so young its the fault of my colonial training replied kaituna with a smile life in new zealand is very quiet you know when i came home with papa i was quite bewildered by the noise and turmoil of londonevery one rushing here and thererestless crowds in the streets chattering women in the housesno rest no pause no quiet oh it was terrible and down here down here it is charming one can dream dreams in this delicious old place and take life easily not at the railroad speed of london folk you are too young for a hermit kaituna oh but im not a hermit i assure you im fond of gaiety i adore balls and gardenparties im never tired of riding and tennisplaying but i can get all those in the country and can live slowly which i like the hurryskurry of town life would kill me you like england then oh very much very much indeed its a wonderful country but my home has my dearest love life there is so pleasant so steadygoing you can take pleasure at your own time if you want to here in england it is all fever and excitement when i stayed in london i felt as if it were a nightmare with the gas and glare and endless streets with their endless crowds rushing onon without rest or pause ah if you saw new zealand i am sure you would like it do you know new zealand no answered mrs belswin quietly i do not know new zealand but i have been in melbourne ah thats too much like london say rather san francisco melbourne is wonderfully like frisco are you an american mrs belswin yes i was born in new orleans then you are a creole finished mrs belswin quickly yes you can tell that from my appearance i have black blood in my veins in america it is thought a crime here it doesnt matter ive got black blood in my veins also said kaituna with a flush in her olivetinted cheek that is maori blood my mother was the granddaughter of a chief mrs belswin moved a few steps away as she could not trust herself to speak so tumultuous were the feelings raging in her bosom her childher own child and yet she dare not take her to her bosom and tell her the truth the girls innocent words wounded her to the quick and it needed all the stoical resignation of her savage nature to enable her to preserve a calm demeanour i dont remember my mother at all went on kaituna idly leaning her arms on the terrace she died when i was a child but i often picture her to myself and the picture asked mrs belswin unsteadily her face turned away oh a tall beautiful woman with dark eyes and haughty bearing proud to all but loving to me i once saw a picture of pocahontas and i always fancied my mother a woman like thatwild and free and majestic ah it was a great sorrow to me that she died i should have loved her so i used to envy other girls when i saw them with their mothers because i have none oh it must be very very beautiful to have a mother to take care of youto whom you can appeal for comfort and sympathy butbutmrs belswin why you are crying she was cryingcrying bitterly and the tears ran down her dark cheeks in great drops that showed how much she was moved by the girls idle wordstears that were caused by the terrible agony of carrying on the part she was playing kaituna in great wonder approached her but at the light touch of the girls fingers the woman shrank back with a low cry of fear dont touch medont touch me child kaituna paused with a puzzled look on her face upon which mrs belswin dried her eyes hurriedly and took the girls hand i beg your pardon kaituna she said with forced composure but you must not mind me my dear i am not very well at present my nerves are out of order i hope i have said nothing to vex you no dear no but ii had a little child of my own once andandand she died oh i am so sorry cried kaituna touched to the heart by this pathetic confession i should not have spoken as i did you did not know my dear it was not your fault i lost my little girl many years ago but the wound is quite fresh and it bleeds on occasions i am all right now kaitunadont look so dismayed we have all our skeletons you know minemine is a little child dear mrs belswin said kaituna touching her with tender fingers i have only known you a fortnight it is true but there is something about you that draws me to you i dont know what it is as i dont make friends easily but with you why i feel as if i had known you all my life my dearest replied mrs belswin taking the girl in her arms with fierce affection you do not know how happy your words have made me if my daughter had lived she would have been just like you nowjust like you let me give you my love dearmy dead love that has starved for so many years she pressed the girl to her breast but kaituna hesitated as she had said she was not ready in making new friends but there was something in the tones of mrs belswins voice something about the look in her eyes in the pressure of her arms that sent a thrill through her and hardly knowing what she did with sudden impulse she kissed the woman on the mouth upon which mrs belswin with an inarticulate cry leant her face on the girls shoulder and burst into tears was it nature that was working here to bring mother and daughter togethernature that has her secret springs her mysterious instincts which enable those of one flesh to recognise one another by some hidden impulse who can tell science dissects the body analyses the brain gives hard and fast reasons for the emotions but there is something that escapes her prying eyes something that no one can describe that no one has seena something which obeying the laws of being recognises its affinity in another body and flies forth to meet it we boasted scientists of the nineteenth century have discovered a great deal about that wonderful beingman but there is one secret which is hidden from all save god himself and that is the secret of maternal instinct suddenly they were disturbed by the sound of the gong and hastily drying their tearsfor kaituna had been crying as much as mrs belswinthey went in to breakfast such a pleasant room with bright cheerful paper chintzcovered furniture and the white cloth of the table covered with hearty country fare mrs belswin took her seat at the head of the table to pour out the coffee and kaituna sat at the side looking over the bunch of homely flowers brilliant among the dishes out on to the fair country beyond by the side of her plate kaituna found a letter with the new zealand postmark on it and knowing it came from her father opened it at once papa will be back in three months she said when she had finished reading it his business will not take him so long as he expected what is the business dear asked mrs belswin with her face bent over her plate selling land you know my mother brought him a good deal of property and he is now going to sell it going to sell it reiterated mrs belswin in angry surprise why is he going to do that kaituna was rather astonished at her tone on seeing which mrs belswin hastened to excuse herself i beg your pardon my dear she said apologetically but i thought land in the colony was so very valuable so it is but papa desires to establish himself in england altogether now that he has come in for the title so he wishes to sell his new zealand property and invest the money in some other way besides the value of property in the colony has decreased of late years you seem to be well up in the subject kaituna i could hardly help being so papa was always talking about the government and their dealings with the land you see mrs belswin politics with us are more domestic than here in england they deal with kings and governments but there we attend to the welfare of the peoplethe parcelling out of the land and all those kinds of things im afraid ive got but a hazy idea of the true facts of the case but you understand what i mean oh i understand replied mrs belswin composedlyand so she did a deal better than kaituna herself so your papa is coming home in three months i suppose you will be very pleased to see him oh yes i am very fond of my father we are more like brother and sister than anything else people say that papa is supercilious and haughty but i never saw it myself he could hardly be so to you no he is all that is good and kind i try to make him as happy as possible for it was a heavy blow to him when he lost my mother mrs belswin turned away her head to conceal a sneer so i try to supply my mothers place as much as possible im sure you succeed said mrs belswin warmly he can hardly miss your mother when he has you beside him thats what he says but of course i know he says it only to please me a daughter cannot supply the place of a wife in this case it seems she can said the lady caustically but what will he do when you marry kaituna blushed and cast down her eyes well ii have not thought of marriage yet oh kaituna no really said the girl raising her clear eyes to mrs belswins face i should not think of marrying without gaining papas consent then you have not seen the prince yet the prince yes the fairy prince who is to awake the sleeping beauty kaituna blushed again and laughed in rather an embarrassed manner dear mrs belswin what curious things you say she replied evasively i have not seen any one in new zealand i cared about and since my arrival in england i have lived so quietly that i can hardly have met the fairy prince you speak of when the hour arrives the fairy prince comes with it said mrs belswin oracularly my dear you are too charming to remain with your father all your life as i am sure he must acknowledge himself have the young men of today no eyes or no hearts that they can see my kaituna without falling in love with her im sure i dont know no one has spoken to me of love yet ah its not the speaking alone dear you are a woman and the instinct of a woman can tell what a man means without him using his tongue but you see i am not versed in love lore my dear you are a delightful girl in the first days of innocence i am glad to see that the bloom of maidenhood is not rubbed off you by premature wisdom in loveaffairs a girl who flirts from her teens upwards loses that delightful unconsciousness which is the great charm of a maiden you have lived secluded in new zealand you are living secluded in england and the world has passed you by but the fairy prince will arrive my dear and his kiss will awaken you from the sleep of girlhood into the real life of womanly existence i thought such things only happened in novels no dear no they happen around us every day when you see a girl with a blushing face and a dreaming eye or hear a young fellow singing gaily for very joy of life you will know that love has come to them both and they are telling each other the beautiful story in the full belief that such story is quite original though adam told it to eve in the garden of eden it sounds delightful sighed the girl pensively i suppose you are telling me your experience my experience echoed mrs belswin flushing acutely no child no i have had my romance like all women but it ended sadly i understand said kaituna quietly you are thinking of your lost child mrs belswin was about to make some passionate rejoinder but checked herself suddenly and went on eating her breakfast with forced composure kaituna also became silent thinking over what had been said and there was no further conversation until the butler entered and handed the girl a letter from the vicarage miss he said ceremoniously and retired the letter proved to be from toby clendon being a few lines announcing the fact that mr maxwell was staying with him and that they would both come on that afternoon to thornstream to renew the acquaintance so pleasantly begun at marshonthe sea what is the matter asked mrs belswin staring in some astonishment at the rosy face and bright eyes of the girl nothing is wrong i hope no no im sure i dont look as if anything were wrong its this letter from mr clendon mr clendon repeated mrs belswin taking the letter handed to her by kaituna is that the charming young fellow we met the other day yes oh i see he has a friend staying with him and they are going to call this afternoon kaituna i am a sorceressa witch my dear i should have been burnt in the middle ages as a practitioner of the black art give me your hand what for asked kaituna in some confusion as mrs belswin took her by the wrist for a magical ceremony there now tell me is mr clendon the prince no no no thats very emphatic i mistrust emphasis in a girl well we will dismiss mr clendon though he is very delightful what about mr maxwell ah now i know your pulse leaped at the name your face is rosy your eyes are bright by the white witchcraft i practise i interpret these signs you are in love my dear no and with mr maxwell kaituna snatched away her hands with a little laugh and covered her burning face you the sleeping beauty said mrs belswin with mock severity my dear your sleep is over the true prince has arrived and the hundred years are at an end the girl made no reply but between her fingers one bright eye looked forth at her chaperon i will talk to mr maxwell this afternoon and see if he is a man worthy of you oh im sure he is ah you have betrayed yourself it is the prince after all but what about your father my father will not cross me in this of course not provided your prince is rich rich or poor it doesnt matter papa will deny me nothing he is the kindest man in the world humph muttered mrs belswin under her breath he has altered since my time then chapter vii the garden of hesperides in a garden fair you met me and i told you all my woes then in case you might forget me i bestowed on you a rose love had captive to you brought me for i felt his arrows smart so in mercy quick you sought me and bestowed on me a heart oh wonderful wonderful and thrice wonderful was the soul of vicar clendon seeing that in this mummified body battered by the assaults of sixty years it still kept itself fresh and green in the very heyday of perennial youth in spite of his grubbing among dusty books in spite of the hardening process of continually celebrating marriages in spite of the pessimistic ideas which come with old age he could still feel sympathetic thrills when he heard the sighings of two lone lovers he should have frowned and looked askance on such youthful foolery he should have forgotten the days when plancus was consul and he wooed amaryllis with bashful courtesy he should have preached sermons a mile long on the sin of going to the temple of venus but strange to tell he did not this withered old husk encased a fresh young soul and the venerable clergyman felt a boyish pleasure in the courting of these young men is the age of miracles past when such things can happenwhen sober age can sympathize with frolic youth without pointing out the follies of the world as seen telescopically from a distance of sixty years no oh no in spite of cynicism and pessimism and various other isms all belonging to the same detestable class there are still those among us whose souls bloom freshly though cased in antique frames your father said archie maxwell after making the acquaintance of the bookworm your father toby is a brick my father stated toby solemnly is not a brick for a brick is hard and the pater is anything but that on the contrary he is as soft as butter if you wish to express approval of my progenitor o quoter of slang say that he is the ninth wonder of the worldwhich he is and why o utterer of dark sayings because he is an old man who can see his son in love without calling him a fool this was true and toby appreciated the novelty of possessing such a father demonstrating such appreciation by being a most attentive son which exhilarated the old gentleman to such a degree that he became younger every day in appearance thereby proving this saying of a forgotten sage to be true the body takes its complexion from the soul not the soul from the body archie maxwell having at the cost of many lies postponed his trip to buenos ayres has duly arrived and strange to say the vicar takes a great fancy to him after living for so many years with no other company than a rusty housekeeper and a library of rustier books he is quite delighted at the presence of two young men in the house and actually foregoes his afterdinner sleep in order to talk with them while they smoke their pipes archie tells him all his history of his travels his struggles his income his aspirations his loveaffairsin fact everything about himself and the old mans heart warms towards this handsome graceless youth who he sees has the makings of a fine man about him he listens sympathetically to the endless catalogue of kaitunas charms to the hopes and fears and heartburnings which are part of the disease of love and then undergoes the same thing in duplicate from toby indeed so genial is he that both the young men wax eloquent on the merits of their respective dulcineas and spare him no detail however small of their perfections as to tobys suit mr clendon thinks it will prosper if thomasina is that way inclined as mrs valpy is a widow and would be only too glad to see her daughter in the safe keeping of such an excellent young man but when questioned about archies wooing the sage is doubtful he has seen sir rupert and thinks him haughty and superciliousnot at all the kind of man to bestow his daughter on a pauper engineer however good his prospects the best thing he can do is to bid archie wait and hope if kaituna loves him parental opposition may be overcome but the course of true love never did run smooth and archie must be prepared for trouble but as gold is refined by passing through fire so both these young lovers if frizzled up in the furnace of affection may benefit by the ordeal and prove their mutual passions to be strong and enduring whereas at present it may merely be the effect of juxtaposition and a desire to pass the time archie is horrified at this flippant view of the case being taken by venerable age and vows by the stars the moonyeaby the heart of his sweet mistress that the love he bears her is not of today or tomorrow but of all time and that nothing shall prevent him marrying the object of his passion even if he should have to adopt that last resource of young lochinvara runaway marriage so things stand at present and toby sends a note over to kaituna asking permission to renew their acquaintance with her then without waiting for such permission to be grantedthe note being a mere matter of formsets off thornstreamwards with his friend archibald before they start on this errand of charity on the part of toby and wooing on the part of archibald the sage discourseth you are going to seek the garden of hesperides but there you will find no golden fruit no the dragons are better employed they watch two beautiful maidens and eye jealously wandering knights such as yourselves who would steal them i am speaking not of the dragons but of the maidens nevertheless from this quest i know not how you will return the dragon who guards the princess of tobias is amenable to reason and if the son succeeds in gaining the love of the princess the father may gain the consent of the dragon but the other dragon mr maxwell is a firebreathing beast and even if you succeed in overcoming this first danger your princess is still beyond your reach because of her father true at present he is away but when he returns young manoh when he returns when he does it will be too late for i shall have gained the heart of his daughter true when the steed is stolen it is useless to shut the stabledoor go mr maxwell i see you have all the egotism and confidence of youth necessary to enable you to achieve this quest successfully so they went it was a bright summer day and the sun shone brightly in a blue sky dappled with fleecy clouds gently blew the wind through the trees rustling their foliage wherein sang the joyous birds thrush and blackbird and ouzel and redcap piped gaily on the swaying boughs in very gladness of heart at intervals there sounded the mellow voice of the cuckoo and from the blue sky rained the song of the lark invisible from the verdant earth in the quaint gardens of thornstream manor bloomed the flowersroses roses everywhere in rich profusion from pale cold buds to deeply crimsoned blossoms a sudden flame of scarlet geraniums burns along the foot of the garden wall and among their cool green leaves flash the orange circles of the marigolds rosemary dark and sombre old man with its thin leaves like greygreen seaweed form beds of reposeful tint overlaid by brilliant coloured flowers scarlet and blue and yellow but the prevailing tint is white foxgloves with delicate white bells round which hum the noisy beesscattered clusters of pale flushed roses other flowers with white petals all streaked and dappled and spotted with innumerable tints a beautiful garden truly and the thievish wind stealing odours from the profusion of sweets carried them on languid wings to mrs belswin and kaituna sitting on the terrace they had erected a great japanese umbrella at one end and were sitting beneath it in basket chairs between them stood a small table on which lay some feminine work and a yellowbacked novel but neither the work nor the novel were in requisition for both ladies were chatting to toby and archie as they lounged near in their coollooking gray suits both gentlemen by kind permission of the feminine half of the party were smoking cigarettes and mrs belswin knowing how it would shock kaituna bravely suppressed a desire to have one also very handsome she looked in her dark dress with a bunch of crimson poppies at her breast but handsomer still looked kaituna her pale olive face delicately flushed as she toyed with a heap of pale white blossoms and talked gaily to archibald i think instead of spoiling those flowers you might make me a buttonhole said the audacious archie in a small voice kaituna looked doubtful you have a buttonhole one of my own gathering he said throwing it away no man can arrange flowers now you being a woman can arrange them charmingly dont pay me any more compliments mr maxwell well i wont if you give me a buttonhole i have nothing here worth making up said miss pethram rising suddenly and letting all the flowers fall on the terrace come down with me to the garden mrs belswin mr maxwell and i are going to pick flowers very well dear replied mrs belswin languidly i do not mind so long as i am not expected to come also twos company muttered toby softly what did you say asked the chaperon quickly oh nothing well leave you two here to talk said kaituna gaily come mr maxwell you shall choose your own flowers they descended the steps into the garden id rather you did so ioh i should not know which to choose then suppose i suggest something a red rose which means love and a white rose which means silence and the red and white roses together mean silent love oh i see you are versed in the language of flowers does it form part of the education of an engineer no but it does of every young man thank you miss pethram two red roses and no white one that means double love the love of a girl for a boy two buds of a woman for a man full blown blossoms why do you not say the love of a man for a woman eh ah well you know ladies first always let me ask you to put these two red rosebuds in my coat kaituna hesitated a moment and looked down at the green grass seeking for some excuse none feasible enough came into her mind so still with downcast eyes she took the flowers from his outstretched hand and placed them in his coat he was taller than she and could just espy her face flushing under the broadbrimmed straw hat and she must have felt the devouring passion of his eyes instinctively for her hands busied with the flowers trembled you have given me no white rose i see said archie in an unsteady voice so i am not compelled to keep silence may i speak nonooh no she had finished fastening those obstinate flowers with a pin and they had revenged themselves by wounding her finger with a thorn oh oh miss pethram whats the matter oh have you hurt your finger yes but its not very sore why its bleeding he cried in alarm taking her hand let me bind my handkerchief round it oh no oh yes you must obey your doctor there thats better he still held her hand and before she was aware of what he was doing bent down suddenly and kissed it oh she cried blushing you must not do that kaituna mr maxwell if you say another word ill go back to my chaperon but i wont hear another word so there archie looked down disconsolately not knowing what to say when suddenly he heard a gay laugh in the distance and on raising his head saw a white figure flitting away across the lawn towards the sundial he hesitated a moment and then laughed softly faint heart never won fair lady certainly nobody could accuse archie maxwell of being fainthearted for he ran after his sweet enemy with the utmost courage when he reached her she was standing by the sundial and the two spectators on the terrace saw the two actors suddenly appear on the stage one spectatora womanfrowned the othera manlaughed dont go mrs belswin said toby seeing she was about to rise we are having such a jolly conversation thats a very artful remark but it doesnt deceive me artful i assure you mrs belswin i am the most unsophisticated of mena perfect child so i should judge from your description of london life said mrs belswin drily leaning back in her chair but perhaps you are not aware mr clendon that i am miss pethrams chaperon happy miss pethram i wish you were mine im afraid the task of keeping you in order would be beyond my powers do you think so observed toby sentimentally he was a young man who would have flirted with his grandmother in default of any one better and mrs belswin being a handsome woman this fickle youth improved the shining hours mrs belswin however saw through him with ease not having gone through the world without learning something of the male sex so she laughed gaily and turned the conversation with feminine tact you are a good friend mr clendon i am i am everything that is good your trumpeter is dead i see yes poor soul he died from overwork mrs belswin laughed again at tobys verbal dexterity and then began to talk about maxwell which was the subject nearest her heart the lady wished to know all about archies position so as to see if he was a suitable lover for kaituna and the man being a firm friend of the lovelorn swain lied calmly with that great ease which only comes from long experience mr maxwell is a great friend of yours isnt he oh yes we were boys together youre not much more now what is his profession hes an engineer awfully clever hed have invented the steamengine if stephenson hadnt been before him would he indeed what a pity he wasnt born before the age of steam by the way how is he getting on in his profession splendidly hes been in china building railways and at the end of the year hes going out to buenos ayres to build a bridge hes got no money i suppose well no hes not rich but hes got great expectations has he but you cant marry on great expectations no i cant but archie can indeed you forget there are always two people to a bargain of marriage theres double the number in this case how so theres archie miss pethram mrs belswin and sir rupert pethram there was a pause after this as the lady was pondering over the situation toby had his eyes fastened on the two figures at the dial and he smiled mrs belswin looking up suddenly caught him smiling and spoke sharply mr clendon i believe you to be a sensible man if my belief is correct stop laughing and listen to me toby became as serious as a judge at once i am not blind continued mrs belswin looking at him and i can see plainly what is going on as you know i am responsible to sir rupert pethram for his daughters wellbeing and this sort of thing wont do what sort of thing asked toby innocently oh you know well enough mr maxwell making love to my charge is ridiculous sir rupert would never consent to his daughter marrying a poor engineer and im not going to have kaitunas happiness marred for a foolish loveaffair but what can i do discontinue your visits here and tell your friend to do the same he wont do what i ask him then ill take kaituna away its no use hell follow archies the most obstinate fellow in the world and hes too much in love with miss pethram to give her up without a struggle why do you know mrs belswin he gave up a good billet at buenos ayres because it would have taken him away from her i thought you said he was going out there at the end of the year so he is but its not half such a good billet the one he has given up is worth two hundred pounds a year more and he gave it up for the sake of kaituna yes hes madly in love with her he was very foolish to jeopardise his success in life because of a loveaffair particularly when nothing can come of it but why shouldnt anything come of it im sure you will be a friend to these lovers these lovers repeated mrs belswin jealously do you think kaituna loves him im sure of it you seem very learned in love mr clendon perhaps you are in love yourself a blush that had been absent for years crept into the bronze of tobys cheeks perhaps i am i may as well tell the truth and shame the mr clendon oh you understand i am in love so is archie he loves your charge i love another girl be a kind good friend mrs belswin and help archie to make miss pethram mrs maxwell what about sir rupert oh you can persuade him im sure mrs belswin frowned i have no influence with sir rupert she said shortly and rose to her feet come with me mr clendon and we will go to kaituna you wont help them i cant i tell you she replied impatiently from all i can see your friend seems a truehearted man but i shall have to know him a long time before i can say he is fit for myfor miss pethram but even if i approve it is of no use sir rupert is the person to give his consent well and hell never give it toby felt depressed at this and followed mrs belswin meekly to the couple at the sundial the said couple both nervous and flushed to all appearances having been talkingchinese metaphysics kaituna dont you think these gentlemen would like some afternoon tea said mrs belswin sweetly i dare say they would replied kaituna with great composure what do you say mr clendon she did not address herself to archie who stood sulkily by the dial following the figures with his finger toby glanced from one to the other saw they were both embarrassed and promptly made up his mind how to act im afraid we wont have time miss pethram he replied glancing at his watch its nearly four and we have some distance to walk well if you wont have tea you will take a glass of wine said mrs belswin looking at archie then without waiting for a reply she made him follow her and walked towards the house toby followed with kaituna and surely never were maid or man more unsuited to each other he was bold she was shy he talked she remained silent till they were in the drawingroom and then the feminine element broke forth mr clendon she said in a whisper yes speak low if you speak love what do you mean its not mine its shakespeares by the way you wanted to say something i do tell him i didnt mean it she flitted away and toby gasped tell who didnt mean what things are getting mixed thank you ill take a glass of sherry how we all act in this world here were four people each with individual ideas regarding the situation and yet they chatted about the weather the crops the countryabout everything except what they were thinking about mrs belswin and toby did most of the talking but kaituna and archie put in a word every now and then for the sake of appearances at last the young men took their departure and when left alone with kaituna mrs belswin drew her caressingly to her breast i like your prince my dear i dont oh kaituna youve been quarrelling i havent he has he doesnt understand me does a man ever understand a woman of course if he loves her then in this case there ought to be no misunderstanding for i am sure he loves you oh do you think so do you really think so my dear said mrs belswin as the girl hid her face on the breast of the chaperon i am quick at judging a man all women are its instinct i think mr maxwell an honourable young fellow and very charming he would make you a good husband but your father will never consent to your marrying a poor man oh you dont know papa dont i said mrs belswin grimly and closed the discussion this was one side of the questionand the other we have said archie in deep despair been to the garden of hesperides and the dragon has beaten us have you quarrelled with your mash asked toby leaving allegory for common sense my mash toby you are growing vulgar i did not quarrel with kaituna but we had words several hundred i should think what was the row how coarse you are said the refined archie there was no row i spoke of myself in the third person when there are only two people and those are of the opposite sex you shouldnt introduce a third person well what did you say i asked her whether she would accept a poor man if he proposed to her and she said she said no archies face was tragic in its deep gloom so toby comforted him old boy yes said the despairing lover she said she didnt mean it what did she say that to you yes toby cried archie with great fervour i love that girl so youve said a hundred times and ill marry her oh will you said toby grinning i can paint your future a little cottage a nice income a charming girl yes yes dont you wish you may get it oh toby if you only knew i do know i know all about it so dont rhapsodise and i know another thing im hungry so hurry up chapter viii mrs belswins correspondence the wisest of plans a letter upsets the penny post bans the wisest of plans tho womans tho mans and then one regrets the wisest of plans a letter upsets about three weeks after the visit of archie and his friend mrs belswin was seated on the fallen trunk of a tree in thornstream park meditating deeply over two letters lying on her lap around her the heavy foliage of the trees rustled in the chilly morning air above her the sun shot golden arrows from the blue sky and below her feet the lush grass starred with delicate woodland flowers sloped gently down to a babbling brook the brown waters of which rippled noisily over its smooth stones but mrs belswin with a frown on her face paid no attention to these things being occupied with disagreeable thoughts evoked by the letters aforesaid and after a pause she took up one impatiently in order to read it for the second time carissima mia why have you not written to me for so long every day i say she will send to me a letter and every day i find the postman comes not this is not right conduct to him who adores thee my lucrezia and there is fear in my heart that i may lose thee i am now singing at the theatre folly in an opera comique called sultana fatima and they pay me well as they should seeing i leave the grand italian opera for this street music but that my english is so good i would not have been the chief tenor here it is not hard to sing and i am content since i waste not my time and am near thee but thou oh my star adorable must not stay long from him who hungers for thy smile when does the illustrious husband come again for i know that he will drive thee back to me and we will go at once to my beautiful italy send me a letter and say when thou wilt come to me or i swear that i will come to thee in the country in order to behold thee again thou hast seen thy child those many months now i will that thou shouldst return i wait thy answer saying thou wilt return or i myself will behold thee in thy village cara signora i kiss your hand thine unhappy stephano when she had finished this mrs belswin let it fall on her lap with a shrug of her shoulders and picked up the other letter which consisted of two lines pethram returns in three weeks so unless you want trouble youd better clear outa d had i said the reader sneering im not so sure about that mr dombrain ill leave this place when i choose so rupert pethram is coming home and i if i please can see him husband and wife will meet again after twenty years of separation how dramatic the interview will be i can well imagine it and yet i am not sure it will take place i cannot retain my position as chaperon to kaituna if he is in the house i cannot disguise myself for kaituna would ask the reasonbesides im too impulsive to act a part if i go i part from my daughter for ever if i stay rupert will certainly recognise me and then he will force me to leave the house what a terrible positionto be driven away after a glimpse of paradise and yet i can do nothing to help myselfpositively nothing she stopped short with a feeling of deep anger at her helplessness but she did not attempt to disguise the truth from herselfshe could do nothing the law was on the side of her husband and she could never hope to regain the position she had forfeited by her former folly as to stephano ferrari hell do what he says she muttered glancing at the italians flowery letter if i dont go to him he will come to me and with his hot foreign blood may create a disturbance i wouldnt mind for myself but kaitunai must consider kaituna if i refuse to go with stephano he is quite the sort of man to tell her all and that would exile me from my daughter more than anything else rupert would make me leave the house stephano would lose his temper at what he calls my obstinacyi should not care but if kaituna knew that iher motherwas alive that i had lost my place in the world and become an outcast she would scorn memy own child oh i could not bear that it would kill me with her face in her hands she rocked to and fro in an agony of grief and when she recovered herself somewhat her countenance haggard and worn showed how bitterly she felt the position in which she was placed if i could only die i wish i could hell cannot be worse than the life i live now i am near my child yet dare not tell her i am her mother but soon i shall have to go away and be denied even the poor consolation of being near her if only i had the courage to kill myself but there i have the courage and would die willingly were it not for kaituna oh god god i have sinned deeply but my punishment is very heavyheavier than i can bear she had risen to her feet and was walking to and fro in the narrow space of the glade swinging her arms in a very storm of passionate grief the mask she had worn for the last few weeks so carefully was now thrown aside and she abandoned herself to her agony of despair in the most reckless manner she wept she cried she raved she flung herself on the groundin fact she gave herself up wholly to her mood of the moment truly the quiet english glade had never seen a stranger sight than that of this savage woman abandoning herself to transports of impotent fury why am i so helpless she cried furiously lifting up her arms to the blue sky if i have sinned i have been punished for twenty years i have borne my punishment but i can do so no longer she is my childmineminemine they cannot take her from me i am her mother god gave her to me and man shall not take her away i love her better than her cold fiend of a father she is my life my soul my existence if i leave her i shall die i will not leave her i will not leave her no no no she stamped furiously on the ground gnashing her teeth with rage and staring at the sky with fierce face and clenched hands but after a time her fury exhausted itself and sitting down on the fallen tree again she began to weep bitterly my little child oh my little child i can do nothing i must leave you and go away alone ferrari loves me but what is his love compared to yours dear you have kissed me you have placed your arms round my neck you have given my starved heart the love it desired and nownow i must give up all and go awayfor ever oh cruel cruel and i can do nothing rocking herself to and fro she wept quietly for a time then drying her tears put the letters in her pocket and rose to go i must not give way like this she said to herself as she left the glade it will do no good i must see how i can manage to retain my position rupert stephano dombrainthey are all against me three against one but ill try my hardest to conquer them its a womans wit against mens brutality but ill fightill fight and win if i win i gain all if i loseoh god if i losei surrender everything the morning was very chilly in spite of its being summer and mrs belswin having all the love for warmth inherent in those born in the tropics shivered at the cold east wind but feeling too upset to return direct to the house and face kaitunas inquiring gaze made up her mind to take a brisk walk she wore a heavy sealskin mantle and thrusting her hands into the deep pockets walked quickly against the wind thinking deeply over her position it was truly a terrible dilemma in which she now found herself exiled from her daughter for so many years and all through her own fault yet she had been quite unable to stifle the natural instinct in her heart it may be that the desire to be near her daughter constantly was all the stronger because she knew it was out of the question and the enforced suppression of her love in her own breast had given the pleasure of living with kaituna even as a servant a peculiar charm of its own it will doubtless be argued by some people that a woman who could give up her child for the sake of a lover could not have had much maternal instinct but then it must be recollected that mrs belswin had then acted on the impulse of a moment in doing so and had regretted her folly ever since when she thought of all she had lost for one moment of folly it made her mad with rage and she would have sacrificed anything to regain her forfeited position thanks to her knowledge of how matters stood and her own dexterity she had been enabled to gain her ends for at least some months but now her husband was coming home again she knew that she would have to seek refuge in flight she was a bold woman a determined woman and all her lifes happiness was at stake yet she knew it was perfectly useless to appeal to her husband for pity or help by her own act she had forfeited her right to approach him and the act had brought its own bitter punishment by robbing her of the delight of gratifying her strong maternal instinct like a tiger who desires more blood when he has once tasted it mrs belswin had just experienced sufficient delight in being near her child to make her passionately regret having to depart plan after plan she thought of and rejected as useless because she saw quite plainly that she could do nothing against the position held by her husband law society morality were all against her and she could only stand afar off weeping bitterly as she surveyed the paradise from which she had banished herself oh i could kill rupert i could kill him she thought madly but that would do no good if i thought it would i should not hesitate i dare not tell kaituna the truth because she would shrink from me rupert once he knows i am here will not let me remain if i sold my soul it would be useless i can do nothing except bear my punishment till i die suddenly an idea came into her head suppose rupert pethram were to die before he came to thornstream in that case she would still retain her position and be happy for the rest of her life but then there was no chance of him dyinga healthy strong man and unless something happened he would return to thornstream and turn her out on the world if the ship would only go down if god would only unchain the winds of heaven and dash the ship to pieces on the rocks mrs belswin as it will be seen was not a religious woman when she thought thus and was willing to sacrifice dozens of human lives in order to get rid of her enemy it was simply balzacs mandarin over again and mrs belswin with her savage disregard of human life would have sacrificed all the mandarins in china yea china itself if by so doing she could have retained her position undisturbed however there was but small possibility of either mandarin or ship perishing to please her so she began to wonder in her own mind how she could get rid of pethram before he could arrive at thornstream ah if stephano ferrari stephano ferrari the idea came to her like an inspiration and she hurriedly thought out a plan ferrari loved her he would do anything to get her to marry him well she would do so provided he got rid of pethram and secured her position with her daughter murder no not murder but suppose pethram disappeared then her brain was in a whirl her throat was dry with excitement and she leaned against a fence for a few minutes to keep herself from falling for the earth seemed spinning round her and the sky red as blood before her eyes with an effort she pulled herself together and looked around mrs belks cottage she said with a gasp of relief ill go in and rest chapter ix a rustic apollo the marble statue of an antique god may win our admiration for a time seeing it lacks not any outward grace but stands a type of flesh idealised yet as we gaze in silent wonderment we weary of the irresponsive stone because the cold perfection wants a soul it was without doubt a charming cottagesuch as one reads of in a fairy tale clay walls thatched roof wide diamondpaned casements and twisted chimney with all the violent colours subdued to a pleasant neutral tint by the sun and rain while ivy rosetrees and wistaria clambered over all enclosing it in a network of greenery and the gardenoh it was a most delightful garden not too neat but all the handiwork of man softened by the gentle touch of nature tall hollyhocks odorous stocks crimsontipped daisies flaunting dahlias and staring sunflowers grew together in riotous sweetness breaking bounds here and there as they nodded over the low white fence and bent across the narrow path leading up to the rosewreathed trellis of the porch there was an appletree too on one sidea gnarled mosstufted appletree already snowy with white blossoms and on the other a lowbranched cherrytree looking like a frosted twelfth cake pigeons fluttered around the eaves of the cottage fowls strutted among the flowers and over all blazed the hot sun of summer from the clouddappled sky it was really charming in its rustic picturesqueness and mrs belswin pausing at the gate looked regretfully at this vision of bucolic ease so far removed from her own feverish existence if i had been a village girl i might have been a good woman she thought walking up to the porch but i daresay i should have tired of this innocent sweetness and gone up to the evil life of london as all village beauties have done on knocking at the door it was opened shortly by a tiny woman old shrivelled and evillooking enough to have been the witch of the cottage not that mrs belk was illlooking on the contrary she must have been pretty when young for she still retained a sufficiency of beauty to warrant a second glance but there was a restless look in her dark eyes a settled sneer on her thin lips and a generally discontented expression on her face which repelled the onlooker mrs belswin had an intuitive capability of reading faces and the first glance she threw on this little figure with the withered face put her at once on her guard on her guard against a cottager mrs belswin would have laughed at the idea still the fact remains that mrs belk bore her character in her face and mrs belswin at once put herself on her guard against mrs belk hardly probable that these two women would meet again the cottager could never have it in her power to harm the lady but in spite of the absurdity of the situation mrs belswin with that inherent suspicion created by a long life of duplicity and watchfulness did not think it beneath her dignity to pick and choose her words while talking to this humble woman in case chance should turn her into a possible enemy i beg your pardon she said slowly but i am very tired and would like to rest theres a public a little way on maam replied mrs belk respectfully by no means inclined to entertain a stranger i prefer to rest here said mrs belswin coolly you know me i daresaymiss pethrams companion mrs belsin said the old woman doubtfully let the lady come in mother remarked the slow soft voice of a man inside the cottage dont you see she looks tired whereupon mrs belk with manifest reluctance moved to one side and miss pethrams companion entered the room to find herself face to face with the handsomest man she had ever seen he offered her a chair in silence and she sat down thankfully while mrs belk closed the door and the rustic apollo stood leaning against the table looking at their visitor handsome yes splendidly handsome this man in a massive herculean fashion one who would be called a magnificent animal for there was no intellect in the freshcoloured face no intelligence in the bright blue eyes and his whole figure had but beauty and symmetry after the fashion of a brute he was very tallover six feetwith long limbs a great breadth of chest and a small wellshaped head covered with crisp locks of curly golden hair his skin was browned by the sun he had a wellshaped nose sleepy blue eyes and his mouth and chin were hidden by a magnificent golden beard which swept his chest nature had lavished her gift of physical beauty on this man but the casket contained no jewel for the soul which would have lent light to the eyes expression to the mouth and noble bearing to the body was absent and samson belk was simply a fine animal whom one would admire like a soulless picture but tire of in a few moments mrs belswins first thought was what a handsome man her second what a brute he would be to the woman who loved him they were a curious couple the little withered mother and the tall handsome son dissimilar enough in appearance to negative the relationship except for the expression of the face for there in the countenance of the man appeared the same expression that pervaded the face of the woman the eyes were not so restless because they had rather a sleepy expression the sneer on the lips was hidden by the drooping moustache and the general look was more of illhumour than discontent but in spite of the physical difference between them no one could have helped noticing by the worst traits of the woman appearing in the man that this splendid specimen of humanity was the offspring of this dwarfish feminine personality you are sir ruperts head bailiff are you not said mrs belswin when she had sufficiently admired her host yes madam i have that honour he spoke in a slow sleepy voice eminently attractive and suited to his appearance a voice which in its languor and oily softness had an accent of refinement and culture yet this man was a simple rustic a bailiff one of the peasant class it was most perplexing and mrs belswin clever woman of the world as she was felt herself puzzled she was a woman and inquisitive so she set herself to work to solve this problem by a series of artful questions have you been a bailiff here long about four years madam i was bailiff to sir robert and when sir rupert came into the title he kindly kept me on i should think you were fitted for better things belk gazed at her in a slow bovine fashion and a spark of admiration flashed into his sleepy eyes as he looked at this stately woman who spoke in such a friendly manner its very kind of you to say so madam but i have no one to say a good word for me ah the rich never say a good word for the poor my lady said mrs belk with fawning deprecation if looks go for anything my samson ought to live in a palace hes the finest wrestler in all the county and the best shot and the most daring rider and the poorest man finished samson with a coarse laugh which betrayed his real nature aye aye mother if id money to play the swell id cut a dash with the best of these fine lilyhanded gents what would you do asked mrs belswin curious to find out how different this mans soul was to his body do echoed the giant folding his arms why madam id keep a fine stable and race my horses at the derby id marry a lady and have a fine house with servants and the finest of wine to drink and food to eatthats what id do a very modest ambition truly said mrs belswin with a scarcely concealed sneer i presume you would not cultivate your brains ive had enough schooling growled belk stroking his beard mother made me learn things and a fine time i had of it you were never a good boy samson said his mother shaking her head with a look of pride which belied her words handsome is as handsome doesthats what i always tells him my lady if it were handsome does as handsome is your son would be a clever man replied mrs belswin rising to go neither mrs belk nor samson were clever enough to understand this remark but after a time a faint idea of what she meant dawned on the obtuse intellect of the giant and he smiled approvingly wont you have a glass of milk my lady asked mrs belk dropping a curtsey no thank you may i have the honour of showing you the nearest way through the wood madam said belk hat in hand resuming his polite manner and languid mode of speaking no thank you i know my way answered mrs belswin coolly many thanks for your courtesygoodday when she had vanished samson belk stood for some minutes in a brown study then recovering himself with a huge sigh ordered his mother to bring him a mug of beer eh shes a fine madam that he said as he drank the ale got a spice of the devil in her too i wish i could marry her that wouldnt do much good said his mother contemptuously shes only a companion now if you married miss pethram youd have all this place and be master here not much chance of that growled belk putting on his hat shes in love with that friend of parsons a whippersnapper aye that he is i could smash him with one hand not any great shakes with money either as ive heard tell whatll sir rupert say to his courting well i heard at the great house this morning that sir rupert was on his way home belk scowled and shook his broad shoulders in an uneasy manner he did not like sir rupert who was a severe master and therefore was not at all pleased to hear that his term of liberty would soon be over i hope accounts are all right samson said his mother anxiously let sir rupert see youve been a good servant lad im good enough for the wage i get growled belk sulkily if sir rupert meddles with me hell get the worst of it ill stand no mans handling dn me if i do he thrust his hands into his pockets and strolled off defiantly where are you going lad asked his mother as he paused at the gate to the badger retorted mr belk curtly and hurriedly retreated so as to escape his parents expostulations the lads always there said mrs belk to herself as she closed the door hes after no good i reckon eh if i could only get some money id march him off to america where he could live like a gentleman but theres no chance of that while rich folk have the handling of the money meanwhile mrs belswin was walking rapidly back to the house thinking over the curious couple she had just left not a bit like the ordinary people she thought the mothers not to be trusted except as concerns the son and the sonwell hes discontented with his lot i wonder if rupert finds him a good servant he must or he wouldnt keep him on but if mr samson belk tries any games on with his master i think hell get the worst of it goodday mrs belswin it was gelthrip the curate who saluted her a lank lean man with a hatchet face lanternjawed and clean shaven not by any means what the world would term handsome dressed in black he looked like a crow and his hoarse voicefor he suffered from clergymans soar throatwas not unlike the cawing of those dreary birds he was a gossip and very inquisitive he supported a sick sister and professed high church principles and it was lucky that he should have vowed himself to celibacy for certainly no woman would have taken him as her husband he had long bony hands and cracked his knuckles in order to punctuate his sentences and he talked without ceasing mixing up religion gossip literature music art and science in one heterogeneous mass of chatter having drawn the cork of his eloquence by saying goodday and touching his lowcrowned hat mr gelthrip cracked his knuckles cheerfully and poured forth a flood of aimless nonsense goodday ah yes it is a charming day is it not the blue of the sky with the lark singing so delightfully you know shelleys poem do you notyesturner might paint that scene puts me in mind of his vale of health and this place by the way is very healthyplenty of oxygen in the air for weak lungs ahah my heart swells with goodness towards the creator of all things as i drink in the air i think i saw you coming out of belks cottage mrs belswin yes i went in there to rest for a few minutes a great contrast mother and son mrs belswin the witch of endor and apollo the far darter yes but a touching instance of parental affection for she is devoted to her son a devotion of which i regret to say hes not worthy mrs belswin not worthy my dear lady he never comes to church passes his time in publichouses and at wrestling matches and horseraces a most godless young man but surely sir rupert objects to this conduct he does not know mrs belswin belk in a rough fashion is crafty very crafty but when the baronet returns i have no doubt he will hear from others of the behaviour of this misguided young man i deem it my duty continued mr gelthrip inflating his chest to inform sir rupert of his servants misdeeds i dont think i would do that said mrs belswin drily sir rupert does not care about his private business being meddled with ah you know sir rupert then mrs belswin bit her lip in vexation for she saw that she had made a mistake and at once hastened to put herself right in the eyes of this talebearer no of course not i only speak from hearsay sir rupert said the curate in a dogmatic fashion does not i believe care about the church therefore as you say he may resent my interference but i would not be doing my duty as a clergyman if i did not warn him of the dissipated ways of his bailiff do you think it is kind to deprive the young man of his situation in this case mrs belswin i do he is dissipated and neglects his business he has the handling of money and seeing he is always betting on races he may be tempted towell you know what i mean i know this sir said mrs belswin with great spirit that you are about to act a most unworthy part if this man is as you say warn him remonstrate with him but dont take the bread out of his mouth by getting him dismissed charity covers a multitude of sins that remark is in the bible i believe if so practise what you preach and you will be far more respected than if you drive this man to despair by taking away his only means of livelihood good morning she bowed and walked off leaving the curate staring after her with open mouth the stream of his eloquence being for once dried up reflections on the part of mr gelthripwhere has this woman been brought up that she manifests such little reverence for the cloth a dangerous woman i am afraid and not at all suited to be the companion of miss pethram im afraid i shall have to warn sir rupert about her as well as about belk as for belk it is my dutymy duty as a clergyman to open his masters eyes to the deplorable state of this young man he gambles bets plays cards drinks all these things entail money and yet he spends far more than his salary so i must warn sir rupert of his bailiffs real character now mrs belswinah there was a good deal of spiteful meaning in the curates ah and there was no doubt that mrs belswin had made a bitter enemy of this wellmeaning but meddlesome young man reflections on the part of mrs belswinive been preaching a sermon to a man whose duty it is to preach one to me saul among the prophets this time im not sorry for i hate those meek young men who make mischief under the pretence of doing good why are these clergymen so meddlesome its none of his business to enlighten rupert about belk if belk is dissipated i know rupert will find it out quick enough and discharge him i shouldnt like to be either rupert or the curate if such a thing does come to pass for belk is a most unforgiving man i can see that in his face i have made an enemy of this rev meekness well he cant harm me until rupert comes home and thenah well ill see chapter x a boudoir consultation if two ladies talk together be it fine or rainy weather subjects three youll find they handle love sans diamonds and a carriage prospects of a wealthy marriage or the latest piece of scandal what do ladies talk about over five oclock tea when no male is present ah that is one of the mysteries of bona dea the ritual whereof is known to none of the stronger sex they doubtless discuss fashionsfor no woman however affecting to despise the pomps and vanities of this world can contemplate the raiment of another woman without blaming or praising the same according to taste or price very likely they make remarks about their neighbours and hint with nods and winks mysteriously suggestive thatwell you know what nevertheless men in their clubs do exactly the same thing and scandal is by no means monopolized by ladies however the question is what do they talk aboutand as the votaries of the bona dea will not tell us we must be content to accept ambiguous smiles and tightlyclosed lips as answer on this occasion however the subject under discussion was love and four ladiestwo married and two unmarriedwere talking together on a very pleasant subject and the subject was the courting of tommy valpy by toby clendon i must admit said mrs valpy in her usual heavy fashion that i was astonished when the young man spoke to me i wasnt observed tommy with a maiden blush ah from mrs belswin forewarneds forearmed we all know that im very pleased to hear about it said kaituna putting her arm around tommys waist mr clendon is most delightful but not so much so as another person hinted the engaged young lady with wicked intuition whereupon kaituna grew red and requested another piece of cake love is all very well said mrs belswin who was a practical person but it wont keep the pot boiling now about his income eight hundred a year declared tommy boldly we can live on that no doubt but is the eight hundred a year certain well three hundred is very certain because it comes from his father but the remaining five hundredwell you know said miss valpy hopefully literature pays so well nowadays and tobys in the first flight i dont think so much of his literature observed mrs valpy stirring her tea he may or he may not make the income he says but the three hundred a year is absolutely certain i hope youll be happy dear said kaituna gaily i of course will be bridesmaid tommy looked at her friend significantly and then laughed we will be married together she whispered confidentially im afraid not mr maxwell has said nothing no then he has looked a good deal both girls laughed again and then mrs valpy began to explain her ideas for tommys trousseau which interested every one the brideelect and her mother were staying for a few days at thornstream and on this evening were going over to dine at the vicarage in company with kaituna and mrs belswin clendon pre was delighted at the choice of his only son and was giving this dinner in order to welcome his intended daughterinlaw to his family circle of two tommy got on very well with the vicar who liked her vivacity and brilliant manner so much that he was actually weaned from his beloved library and the blackletter folios saw less of their owner than they had done since the time when they had been purchased mrs valpy was also calmly satisfied with her daughters engagement as her intended soninlaw was a very delightful young man and moreover had a rich father the latter fact being the most important in the good ladys eyes if he dabbled in literature well let him do so it would serve to keep him out of mischief but as for deriving any solid benefit from novelwriting or playscribbling such an idea never entered mrs valpys head all she knew was that toby was a good son and would make a good husband besides which he could keep his wife in comfort so what more could a mother desire the old lady therefore sat in kaitunas boudoir smiling and nodding over her tea completely satisfied with herself and the world by the way said kaituna when the exhaustive subject of tommys trousseau had come to an end you know of course mrs valpy that my father is on his way home yes dear i heard something about it replied the old lady lazily when do you expect him for certain in about a fortnight so soon said mrs belswin to herself in that case i have no time to lose youll be glad to see sir rupert i suppose asked tommy turning to the companion oh yes of course but im not sure if i shall be here when he arrives not here ejaculated kaituna in dismay oh mrs belswin i have to go up to town my dear said that lady very slowly in order to see aa friend of mine she hesitated over the last word knowing in her own heart the errand which was taking her up to town but cant you put off your visit for a time im afraid not kaituna said nothing but looked reproachfully at her friend whereupon mrs belswin kissed her with a gay laugh dont look so scared my child i shall only be away for a few days you will like sir rupert im sure said mrs valpy who had been slowly following out a train of thought he is a most delightful man so i have always heard replied the chaperon coldly perhaps hell marry again said tommy idly more for the sake of saying something than from any idea of sir ruperts matrimonial intentions no the answer came from mrs belswin and had escaped her against her will but on seeing the surprise her sudden ejaculation had created she explained herself with calm grace of course i mean that sir rupert would surely not think of marrying when he has this dear child to comfort him i dont think papa will ever marry again said kaituna in a low tone i wonder at your saying such a thing he was too fond of my mother to forget her easily mrs belswin turned away her head and sneered for she was too well acquainted with rupert pethrams selfish heart to believe that he regretted her in the least seeing however that the subject was a painful one to kaituna and by no means relishing it herself she hastened to turn the conversation by saying the first thing that came into her head by the way do you know i have an admirer here not the vicar cried tommy clapping her hands no im not antique enough then mr gelthrip ah hes too devoted to his sick sister no my admirer is that handsome mr belk papas bailiff said kaituna smiling well he is very handsome but i must confess i dont like his face nor do i declared tommy boldly hes got the same disagreeable countenance as his mother from what ive heard i think hes a very dissipated young man said mrs valpy slowly i suppose mr gelthrip told you that remarked mrs belswin with curling lip so like him he never opens his mouth except to destroy a reputation im afraid belk has no reputation to destroy laughed tommy jumping up but we shall meet the rev gelthrip tonight and i declare its time to dress the clock chimed the halfhour and the ladies went away to dress with the exception of mrs belswin who remained in her chair absorbed in thought in a fortnight she muttered to herself slowly ah i must be prepared for him ill try and see him in london and convince him that i must stay by my child if he consents well and good if he refuses she stopped drew a long breath and clenched her hands if he refusesill see ferrari chapter xi the art of dining if youd be a healthy sinner eat with judgment when at dinner and remember with a shiver man is governed by his liver viands rich and wine in plenty spoil lifes dolce far niente he who shuns this vital question suffers soon from indigestion the cornerstone of dissipation is to act with moderation when the sceptre of the csars passed into the hands of st peter and his successors it carried with it among other fixturesto use a legal expressionthe art of giving a good dinner the clergy have therefore always been famous for their attention to creature comforts and among the various arts which they rescued from the wreck of the classic world the art of dining is certainly one of which they were most careful in england the fat abbots and portly monks of the past have been transmuted through the agency of that royal magician henry viii into the comfortable bishops and delectable vicars of the present but the change is actually only in the thirtynine articles and the science of gastronomy still has its wisest savants among the clergy it is true that some ascetics wishing to return to the bosom of the romish church have denied themselves all dainties in favour of lentils and pulse but unlike daniel and his friends they are no fairer for doing so yet the general run of curates provided they are well paid rectors vicars deans bishops yea even archbishops are worthy successors to the clerical gourmands of the middle ages so satirised by rabelais and are as careful of their cellars and kitchens as of their churches and parishioners mr clendon dryasdust grubber among ancient folios as he was by no means neglected the substance for the shadow and satisfied his brain his stomach and his palate in equal measurethe former by means of choice editions the latter by choice viands but truth to tell he to all appearances throve more on the library than on the kitchen the number of guests at dinner according to some gastronomical worthy should never be less than the three graces nor greater than the nine muses so vicar clendon had taken this sage advice by limiting the friends assembled round his hospitable board to eight people the sexes being in equal numbers ie four of the one and four of the other the host took in mrs valpy a most admirable arrangement as both were fond of their victuals and thought eating preferable to talking especially when the cook was a good one as happened in this case mr gelthrip escorted mrs belswin fire and water sweet and sour black and white two galley slaves chained together against their will could not have been less suited than the clergyman and the companion were to one another goodbreeding forbade either resenting the juxtaposition so they had smiles on their faces and rage in their hearts at being thus coupled so unsuitably by their amphitryon the engaged ones of course went diningroomwards togethera good omen of the future in the eyes of both hinting that they would thus wander side by side towards the good things of this life archie was squire to kaituna ecstasy rapture bliss ah how poor a language is english when required to express the joy of two lovers coming together for a whole evening who have not expected fate or cupid or mother venus to be so kind out of compliment to the month of roses vicar clendon gave his guests a distinctly pink dinner which was a novelty both as regards viands wines and artistic arrangements in the centre of the white tablecloth there was an oval shaped of moistlooking emerald moss filled with loose roseleaves from the midst of which sprang rich clusters of the flower in red in white and in yellow set off here and there by masses of green leaves no intrusive epergne to hide the faces of the guests from one another but a tiny fountain shooting up a silver thread that fell again in diamond spray over the odorous blossoms belowrosewreaths for the white bosoms of the ladies rose bouquets with entanglements of delicate maidenhair fern for the men and on imitation roseleaf menus the names of the dishes in purple ink viands for the most part rosetinted by an artistic cook and as for wines there was claret deeply red port amethystine in tint sparkling burgundy of rosy hues and from the roof roseate light suffused from a redshaded lamp the whole prevailing tint of this unique meal was the rosered of dawn and parson clendon smiling benignly from the head of the table felt that he had achieved a distinct success in the way of originality a thing to be proud of in this century of usedup ideas the romans observed the vicar discursively by way of providing a subject of conversation the romans would have enjoyed a meal served up in this fashion you are thinking of vitellius asserted mr gelthrip in a dictatorial manner no sir i am thinking of lucullus a gourmet sir not a gourmand mr gelthrip not being sufficiently learned either in french or gastronomy to appreciate the subtlety of this remark wisely held his tongue and went on with his soup if we were like the romans father we should be crowned with garlands of roses said toby in order to keep the ball of conversation rolling instead of which we wear the roses in our buttonholes added archie gaily not so graceful perhaps but more comfortable ah were not at all classic observed the host regretfully dining with lucullus we should have reclined how uncomfortable said tommy saucily as bad as having breakfast in bed which is where you generally have it interposed mrs valpy reprovingly ah said toby with a world of meaning in his tone i am afraid you have not studied one dr watts the early to bed man you mean cried mrs belswin horrible i never could see the use of his cutanddried little proverbs his poems madam are very edifying remarked gelthrip in a clerical manner very probably and like most things edifying very dreary she said this so tartly that clendon pre was afraid of the probable rejoinder of his curate so made the first remark that came into his mind apropos of nothing in particular our conversation is like that of praeds vicar very discursive we began with the romans we end with dr watts i prefer the romans declared archie sipping his wine not their dining surely observed kaituna no whispered archie literally sub rosa for she wore a halfopened bud in her dark hair because you would not have been present the nineteenth century with all its faults has one great virtue it allows us to dine with you kaituna laughed in a pretty confused manner whereupon mrs belswin flashed her glorious dark eyes sympathetically on the pair for she was now quite in favour of this to all appearances imprudent marriage reasons two first the young couple loved one another devotedly which appealed to her womanly and maternal instincts second the match would be objected to by sir rupert which pleased the revengeful part of her nature with these two excellent reasons she was very satisfied so smiled kindly on the lovers burgundy sir thank you mrs belswin that lady bowed cordially to her host and touched the rim of her glass lightly with her lips it is not now customary for gentlemen to drink healths with the opposite sex at dinner but tis an oldfashioned custom and therefore found favour with the vicar lover of all things antique as he was drink to me only with thine eyes a most excellent sentiment tobias said his father with a waggish smile but we are not all so happily placed as you my son every dog has its day father true true most true et ego in arcadia fui eh mr gelthrip i am not married sir responded that gentleman stiffly nor is he likely to be whispered archie to his neighbour how luckyfor the possible mrs gelthrip im not so sure of that she replied in the same tone every jack has his jill even i yes i suppose so oh you are not certain how can i be certain you do not wear your heart on your sleeve do i not kaituna was somewhat taken aback at this direct way of putting it and not feeling inclined to reply in the only way in which she could do so looked round for a mode of escape from the pertinacity of her companion help came from the vicar miss pethram i understand your father is coming home again yes mr clendon i am pleased to say he is ah no doubt no doubt well i can tell him you have been in safe hands responded the vicar bowing to mrs belswin who acknowledged the compliment with a somewhat doubtful smile you have never seen sir rupert asked toby politely mrs belswin started drew her handkerchiefa flimsy feminine thing of lace and cambricacross her dry lips and laughed in an embarrassed fashion as she replied no i have not seen him but of course kaituna has told me all about him ah said the vicar eyeing the rosy bubbles flashing in his glass i remember rupert pethram very well before he went out to new zealand he was a gay lighthearted boy but now alas tempora mutantur et nos mutamur in illis i cant fancy my father ever having been gay and lighthearted cried kaituna doubtfully ever since i can remember him he has been so grave and solemn trouble trouble sighed the vicar it changes us all mrs belswin affecting to arrange the wreath at her breast darted a lightning glance at the old man from under her long lashes i wonder if rupert told you anything she thought rapidly bah what do i care if he did this fool can do me no harm there is only one man im afraid of meetingrupert pethram himself well perhaps i shall not need to meet him she smiled cruelly as she thought of the harm she proposed to do her unfortunate husband and listened idly to mr gelthrip who was holding forth in his usual dogmatic style on the good which a moneyed man like sir rupert could do to the parish of deswarth i hope miss pethram he said turning to kaituna that you will urge upon your father the advisability of throwing open the picture gallery at thornstream to the villagers in order to encourage a taste for art but they know nothing about art the illustrated london news and the graphic form their idea of pictures they can learn mr clendon they can learn replied the curate easily i should like them to appreciate the old masters egad its a thing i could never do cried toby flippantly i much prefer the modern painters you are a philistine sir humph said toby under his breath and this samson is slaughtering me with the jawbone of an ass then music pursued gelthrip waxing eloquent a little wagner very little said archie slily all chords and no melody i dont quite understand you remarked tommy addressing mr gelthrip with a demure smile you believe in doctor watts and richard wagner isnt it rather difficult to reconcile the two things not at all miss valpy wagner is understandable by the meanest mind meaning himself whispered archie with a laugh the fact is observed mr clendon with mock solemnity that when my worthy friend can get our labourers to descant learnedly on claude lorraine michael angelo and titian read and appreciate george merediths novelsof whom tobias i have heard you speakand understand the advanced school of music of which i myself know nothing he will have accomplished his lifes work it would be a worthy career for a man said gelthrip energetically so i think remarked mrs belswin dryly but if you make all your labourers so learned mr gelthrip im afraid they wont do much work instead of hedging and ditching they will take to admiring the sunsets and to analysing the music of the lark or comparing the latest novelists description of nature to the disadvantage of the real thing mr gelthrip bore all this sarcasm with equanimity smiling benignly all the time he was an enthusiast on the subject and had a hide impervious to shafts of ridicule however skilfully launched his scheme was simple sir rupert had plenty of money and judging from his daughters description seemed to be philanthropically inclined mr gelthrip had full power in the parishas his superior was too much taken up with the middle ages to pay attention to the nineteenth centuryso he determined with the aid of sir ruperts money and his own brains to make deswarth a model village in the matter of culture and high art as to religionwell mr gelthrip was a clergyman and thought he could mingle religion and high art together so as to make them palatable to his childrenofnature parishioners meanwhile his ideas stood in this order culture high art religion alas for the possible model parish and the souls of its occupants this however is talk of futurity but at present the ladies headed by mrs valpy retired leaving the four gentlemen to their wine tobias said his father benevolentlya man must feel benevolent with a glass of port in his hand tobias to the health of your bride thank you father replied toby gratefully touching his lips with the glass archie to the future mrs maxwell ah ah remarked the old gentleman smiling has it gone as far as that not yet sir archie was blushing deeply being an ingenuous youth and unused to such public compliments ill bet whispered toby looking at him gravely that youll have something to say to me tonight over a pipe do you think so faltered archie toying with his glass i speak said clendon fils i speak from experience having proposed and been accepted i can do the first but what about the second faint heart remarked toby judiciously never won fair lady then ill take your advice this very night said archie desperately i am remarked toby as he lifted his glass a prophet in a small way old boy your hand to the health of our double marriageand no heeltaps archie finished his glass chapter xii ars amoris tis very easy to make love a smilea pressure of the hand a reference to the stars above a fly with me to some far land a sigh as soft as coo of dove a kissthe rest shell understand mr gelthrip thinking no one but himself knew anything had contradicted his clerical superior on some point connected with the introduction of printing into england and the vicar in great wrath had carried off his dogmatic curate to the library in order to prove his case the two elder ladies were talking about sir rupert as mrs valpy had met him a few months previously and mrs belswin was trying to find out all about her quondam husband in order to strengthen her position as much as possible at present she knew that she was entirely at the mercy of sir rupert so if she could discover something detrimental to his character it might serve as a weapon against him the scheme which she hoped to carry through with the assistance of ferrari was a dangerous one and moreover she was doubtful if the italian would consent to aid her therefore she was anxious to try all other methods of coercing her husband before resorting to the last and most terrible expedient she was a clever woman was mrs belswin and the instinct for discovery which she inherited from her savage grandparents made her wonderfully acute in crossexamining simple mrs valpy who not comprehending the subtlety of her companion told all she knew about the baronet in the most open manner the result was not gratifying to mrs belswin for with all her dexterity in twisting and turning and questioning and hinting she discovered nothing likely to compromise sir rupert in any way its no use she thought with a feeling of despair in her heart rupert has it all his own way and i can do nothingnothing except she smiled significantly and simple mrs valpy seeing that the companion was looking at toby and her daughter who were amusing themselves at the piano misinterpreted the smile and therefore spoke according to her misinterpretation theyll make a very happy couple wont they mrs belswin mrs belswin thus being appealed to started smiled politely and assented with much outward show of interest to the remark of the old lady its so nice for toby to have his home here pursued mrs valpy with much satisfaction because you know our place is not far from the vicarage so i shall not be parted from my daughter the other woman started and laid her hand on her breast as if to still the beating of her heart yes it would be a terrible thing to part with your only child she said in a low voice i know what the pain of such a separation is you have parted from your child then said mrs valpy sympathetically mrs belswin clutched her throat and gave an hysterical laugh well no not exactly she said still in the same low voice butbut my little daughtermy little daughter died many years ago it was very hard for her to lie like this when her daughter was only a few yards away chatting to maxwell at the window but mrs belswin looked upon such necessary denial as punishment for her sins and accepted it accordingly im very sorry observed mrs valpy with wellbred condolence still time brings consolation not to all people oh yes i think so besides now you have that dear girl kaituna and she seems very fond of you yes she could say no more the strangeness of the situation excited her to laughter to that laughter which is very near tears and she was afraid to speak lest she should break down and then sir rupert will be so glad to find his daughter has such a good friend the mention of the hated name restored mrs belswin to her usual self and with a supercilious glance at the blundering woman who had so unconsciously wounded her she answered in her ordinary manner i hope so but im afraid i shall not have an opportunity of seeing sir rupert at once as i go to town shortly on business but you will return oh yes of course i shall return unless some unforeseen circumstances should arise we are never certain of anything in the future you know mrs valpy no perhaps not at all events i think you will like sir rupert mrs belswin sneered oh do you think so im certain such a gentlemanly man quite young for his age i wonder he does not marry again perhaps he had enough of matrimony with his first wife said mrs belswin coolly oh he was devotedly attached to her was he indeed yes simply worshipped her she died in new zealand when kaituna was a baby i believe and sir rupert told me how this loss had overshadowed his life hypocrite murmured mrs belswin between her clenched teeth the conversation was becoming a little difficult for her to carry on as she dare not disclose herself yet and did not care about exchanging complimentary remarks on the subject of a man she detested so heartily at this moment toby struck a chord on the piano and tommy burst out laughing so with ready wit mrs belswin made this interruption serve as an excuse to break off the conversation the young people seem to be merry she said to mrs valpy and rising to her feet i must go over and see what the joke is about mrs valpy nodded sleepily feeling somewhat drowsy after her dinner so mrs belswin seeing she did not mind being left to her own devices walked across to the piano and interrupted the two lovers for which interruption however they did not feel profoundly grateful wont you sing something asked the companion addressing toby or you miss valpy oh my songs are too much of the orthodox drawingroom type replied miss valpy disparagingly now toby is original in his ditties come lets have a little chinmusic toby wherever do you learn such slang said mrs belswin with a smile toby i oh how can you i speak the queens english do you really said tommy laughing well i at present speak the presidents american so go right along stranger and look slippy with the barrel organ if your mother hears you remonstrated mrs belswin she will yes i know she will retorted tommy imperturbably but shes asleep and im awake very much so i say mrs belswin wheres kaituna i think shes walking on the lawn with mr maxwell as a chaperon you should hunt them out said miss valpy mischievously suppose i give the same advice to your mother replied mrs belswin dryly dont said toby in mock horror as you are strong be merciful certainly if you sing something what shall i sing anything said tommy sitting down except that new style of song all chords and no tune toby laughed mischievously and began to sing if i mashed her would she kiss me no no no if i bolted would she miss me no no no she knows i havent got a rap besides there is the other chap at him not me she sets her cap no no no mr clendon said tommy in a tone of dignified rebuke we dont want any musichall songs if you cant sing something refined dont sing at all i must collect my ideas first replied toby running his fingers over the piano wait till the spirit moves me mrs belswin had resumed her seat near the sleeping form of mrs valpy and was thinking deeply though her thoughts judging from the savage expression in her fierce eyes did not seem to be very agreeable ones while tommy leaned over the piano watching tobys face as he tried to seek inspiration from her smiles outside on the short dry grass of the lawn kaituna was strolling accompanied by archie maxwell the grass extended for some distance in a gentle slope and was encircled by tall trees their heavy foliage drooping over the beds of flowers below beyond the warm blue of the sky sparkling with stars and just over the trembling treetops the golden round of the moon a gentle wind was blowing through the rustling leaves bearing on its faint wings the rich odours of the flowers and the lawn was strewn with aerial shadows that trembled with the trembling of the trees then the white walls of the vicarage the sloping roof neutral tinted in the moonlight the glimmer of the cold shine on the glass of the upstair windows and below the yellow warm light streaming out of the drawingroom casements on the gravelled walk the lawn beyond and the figures of the two lovers moving like black shadows through the magical light a nightingale began to sing deliciously hidden in the warm dusk of the leaves then another bird in the distance answered the first the hoot of an owl sounded faintly through the air the sharp whirr of a cricket replied and all the night seemed full of sweet sounds kaituna sat down on a bench placed under the drawingroom windows and archie standing beside her lighted a cigarette after asking and obtaining the requisite permission the voices of the vicar and his curate sounded in high dispute from the adjacent library there was a murmur of conversation from within where mrs belswin was talking to the other lovers and at intervals the sharp notes of the piano struck abruptly through the voices the songs of the nightingale and the charm of the night what i miss very much in the sky here said kaituna looking up at the stars is the southern cross yes i have seen it myself replied archie removing his cigarette you know i have travelled a great deal and intend to travel still more perhaps you dont seem very sure mr maxwell what about south america i thought i had told you that i had changed my mind about south america kaituna flushed a little at the significance of his words and cast down her eyes i believe you said something about putting off your journey till the end of the year ill put it off altogether if a certain event takes place and that certain event cannot you guess duplicity on the part of the woman who knew perfectly well the event to which the young man referred no i am afraid i cant miss pethramkaituna i hush mr clendon is singing it was only to gain time for reflection as she knew that a declaration of love trembled on his lips but with feminine coquetry could not help blowing hot to his cold and toby was singing a bold martial song with a curious accompaniment like the trotting of a horsea song which thrilled through the listeners with its fierce exultation and savage passion on god and his prophet i seven times called me i opened the koranthe omen appalled me i read itthou wast to be bride to another i knew my betrayer twas him i called brother zulema zulema i sprang on my steed as he waited beside me then rode through the desert with allah to guide me fierce blew the sirocco its terrors were idle i galloped till dawn to be first at your bridal zulema zulema i rode to the tentdoor your fathers tribe knew me they dreamed of the glory theyd gain if they slew me i dashed through the cowardsi met my betrayer he fell from his saddle and i was his slayer zulema zulema you ran from your dwellingyour fathers spears missed me you sprang to my saddle with fervour to kiss me we broke through the press of your kinsfolk my foemen i won thee zulema so false was the omen zulema zulema ah said archie with a long breath when the fierce cry had rung out for the last time that is the way to win a bride kaituna thought so too although she did not make any remark but the shrill savagery of the song had stirred her hereditary instincts profoundly and even in the dim moonlight archie could see the distension of her nostrils and the flash of excitement that sparkled in her eyes it gave him an idea and throwing himself on his knees he began to woo her as fiercely and as freely as ever her dusky ancestors had been wooed in the virgin recesses of new zealand woods kaituna i love you i love you you must have seen it you must know it this is no time for timid protestations for doubtful sighing give me your hands he seized them in his strong grasp i am a man and i must woo like a man i love you i love you i wish you to be my wife i am poor but i am young and with you beside me i can do great things say that you will marry me but my father he sprang to his feet still holding her hands and drew her forcibly towards him your father may consenthe may refuse i do not care for his consent or his refusal say you will be my wife and no human being shall come between us i have no money i will gain a fortune for you i have no homei will make one for you youth love and god are on our side and we are made the one for the other you must not say no you shall not say no you are the woman needed to complete my life and god has given you to me lay aside your coquetry your hesitations your fears speak boldly to me as i do to you let no false modestyno false prideno maidenly dread come between us i love you kaituna will you be my wife there was something in this akin to the fierce wooing of primeval man all the artificial restraints of civilisation were laid aside the doubts the fears the looks the shrinkings all these safeguards and shields of nervous natures had vanished before this whirlwind of passion which bore down such feeble barriers set between man and woman as his eyes ardent with love passionate with longing flashed into her own she felt her bosom thrill her blood rush rapidly through her veins and with an inarticulate cry wherein all the instincts she had inherited from her maori ancestors broke forth she flung herself on his heaving breast kaituna yes yes take me i take me i am yours and yours only chapter xiii exit mrs belswin she smiles she laughs she talks of this and that to all appearances a very woman ah but that phrase bears deep interpretation a very woman is a treacherous thing her smiles a liea lie to hide the truth for when the time is ripe for all her schemes a very woman slips her smiling mask and lo behold a look which means you die one who has been in strange lands and ventured his life in far countries is by no means anxious to court again the dangers he has so happily escaped the traveller telling his tales by his lately gained fireside shudders as he remembers the perils he has dared the risks he has encountered and is thankful for his present safety so thankful indeed that he is unwilling to place his life for the second time at the disposal of chance it was somewhat after this fashion that mrs belswin viewed her present security in contrast to her past jeopardy she had been a freelance and adventuress an unprotected woman at the mercy of the world so hard and pitiless to such unfortunates but now she had found a home a refuge a daughters love a bright oasis in the desert of affliction and she dreaded to be driven out of this peaceful paradise which held all that made her life worth having into a stormy world once more through perils more deadly than those of savage lands through storms more terrible than those of the ocean she had passed into a haven of tranquillity but now that she was tasting of the pleasures of hope and repose it seemed as though she would once more be driven forth to battle with her fellowcreatures her quondam husband held her fate in his hand he had right and might on his side and she knew that she could expect no mercy from one whom she had so deeply wronged had the positions been reversed she felt that she would not have scrupled to enforce the powers she possessed and therefore never for a moment dreamed that her husband would act otherwise all she knew was that she was now in paradise that she enjoyed her daughters affection ignorant as that daughter was of the mothers identity and that the husband of her youth and the father of her dearlyloved child would expel her from this hardly won paradise as soon as he discovered her therein this being the case she did not waste time in asking for a mercy not likely to be granted but set herself to work to find out some means of retaining her position in defiance of her husbands enmity and hatred after her conversation with mrs valpy she saw that rupert pethram had glossed over the affair of the divorce in order to avoid all suspicion of scandal against himself and the mother of his child for he was unwilling that the child should suffer for the sin of her parent this was certainly a point in her favour as by threatening to denounce the whole affair if she was not allowed to retain her position she could force him to acquiesce in her demand in order to avoid scandal but then if he though keeping the terrible affair secret from the outside world told kaituna all about her mothers disgrace thus destroying the love which the girl had for the memory of one whom she thought was deadit would be too terrible as she could urge nothing in extenuation of her sin and would be forced to blush before her own child no nothing could be done in that way should she throw herself on the mercy of the man she had wronged alas she knew his stern nature well enough to be aware of the hopeless folly of such an attempt looking at the whole affair in whatever way that suggested itself to her fertile brain she saw no means of retaining her position her child or her newlyfound respectability except by enlisting the sympathy of ferrari and but it was too terrible it was a crime guilty as she was to do this would render her still more guilty even if she succeeded in getting her husband out of the way and it was not discovered by the law there was still ferrari to be reckoned with it would give him a strong hold over her which he would use to force her into marriage and then she would be still separated from her child so that the crime she contemplated would be useless to see this woman raging up and down her bedroom was a pitiful sight flinging herself on her knees she would pray to god to soften the heart of her husband then realising how futile was the hope she would start to her feet and think again of the crime she contemplated committing with the assistance of her italian lover she raged she wept she sighed she implored her mood changed with every tick of the clock from hope she fell into despair from despair she changed once more to hopetears imprecations prayers threats she tried them all in their turn and the result was always the sameabsolute failure she was dashing herself in vain against an adamantine wall for in her calmer moments she saw how helpless she was against the position held by her husbanda position approved of by law approved of by the world she could do nothing and she knew it still ferrari yes she would go up and see him for perhaps he could solve the riddle which thus perplexed her so terribly he would demand his price she knew him well enough for that well she would pay it in order to still retain possession of her child let her accomplish her present desire and the future would take care of itself so mrs belswin summoning all her philosophy to her aid composed her features and told kaituna that she was going up to london on business but papa will be here next week said the girl in dismay yes im sorry to go at such a time dear replied mrs belswin with an immovable countenance but it is a very important matter that takes me away you will be back again soon in a fortnight at the least oh im glad of that said kaituna with a flush you know i want you to help me gain papas consent to my marriage with archie mrs belswin smiled bitterly as she kissed her daughter knowing how weak was the reed upon which the girl leaned she ask rupert pethram to consent to the marriageshe dare to demand a favour of the man she had wronged for the child she had forsaken she almost laughed as she thought of the terrible irony of the situation but restraining herself with her usual selfcommand bade the girl hope for the best your father must like mr maxwell he is such a charming young fellow she said encouragingly and as you love him so dearly sir rupert for the sake of your happiness may perhaps overlook his want of money but you will speak to papa mrs belswin yes if i see your father on my return i will certainly speak to him how strangely you talk said kaituna rather puzzled if you come back in a fortnight you will be sure to see papa of course dear of course i was only thinking that some unforeseen accident oh no no kaituna you love your father very dearly very very dearly he is all i have in the world it required all mrs belswins selfrestraint to prevent her then and there throwing herself into the girls arms and telling her all such a course however would have been worse than madness so she was forced to crush down her maternal feelings after this interview with kaituna she departed for londondeparted for the possible commission of a crime and as the carriage left thornstream she looked back with a sigh to the girl standing on the terrace perhaps i shall never see her again she said with a groan throwing herself back in her seat but no that will never happen even if rupert does turn me out of the house he will not tell kaituna anything to destroy her belief in her mother so i shall some day meet her with her husband her lips curled as she said this knowing well that sir rupert would never give his consent to the marriage and then she clenched her hands with a frown he must consent to the marriagekaitunas heart is set on it he can destroy my happiness but ill kill him before he destroys that of my child and with this firm determination she left her husbands housethe house in which she should have reigned a happy mistress and mother and the house into which she had crept like a disguised thief the house which she in the mad instinct of her savage nature intended to deprive of its master while waiting on the railway platform for the london train she saw samson belk the relations between these two were peculiar ever since he had seen her at his mothers cottage belk had followed her everywhere like her shadow much to mrs belswins astonishment for candid in all things to herself she could not conceive how a handsome young man could leave younger women for one verging on middle age yet such was the case this bucolic man had fallen passionately in love and adored her with all the sullen ardour of his obstinate nature he was slowwitted dullheaded and it took a long time for an idea to penetrate into his brain but once the idea was there nothing could get it out again this woman so different from all he had known who spoke in a commanding way who flashed her eyes fiercely on all as if they were her slaves had without a word without a sign brought to his knees this uncultured man who knew nothing of the deference due to the sex and whose only attributes were great physical strength and a handsome exterior formerly owing to these advantages he had gained admiration from all women and in return had treated them with brutal indifference or scarcely veiled contempt but now the positions were reversed and he was the abject slave of this imperious queen who looked down at him with disdain it was a case of samson like wax in the hands of delilahof hercules subjugated by omphale and samson belk with all his virile strength his handsome face his stalwart figure was crouching like a dog at the feet of mrs belswin he looked somewhat haggard as he came towards her and took off his hat mrs belswin nodding coldly to him in return well mr belk she said indifferently what are you doing here i heard you were going to town madam yes how can that possibly concern you belk stood twisting his hat round and round in a sheepish manner i thought i might be of service to you he stammered looking at her portmanteau thank you but there is no need the porters will attend to all that replied the lady graciously but you dont look very well mr belk i suppose youve been drinking candour was mrs belswins strong point and looking at belk as an inferior animal she treated him accordingly but he seemed in nowise displeased at her bluntness no i havent been drinking madam thats just as well you know sir rupert returns next week and if he found you to be dissipated hed dismiss you on the spot would he said belk sullenly let him if he likes you seem to know sir rupert madam i no but i have heard about him hes a hard man what ive seen of him mrs belswin was not going to discuss this subject with a servant like belk so she turned indifferently away as the train came into the station and left him standing there looking in sullen admiration at her graceful form in the dark garments she now affected when she was safely installed in a firstclass carriage her rustic admirer who had seen personally after her luggage appeared at the window with some newspapers youll want them to read madam he said awkwardly as she thanked him i hope youll have a pleasant journey thank you mr belk i hope i shall youll be coming back soon i hope he blurted out this question with a deep flush and mrs belswin stared at him with undisguised astonishment she could not understand the reason of this mans deference for she judged it impossible that he could be so deeply in love with her as all his actions seemed to denote goodnatured however when not crossed in any way she replied politely as the train moved off i shall return in a fortnight if you dont muttered belk as the long line of carriages disappeared ill follow you up to london good heavens said mrs belswin throwing herself back in her seat what on earth can the man see in me to admire im not a vain woman i never was a vain woman and why that handsome young fellow should leave youth to run after age is more than i can understand its flattering very much so but continued the lady struck by a sudden thought if ferrari met my new admirer im afraid there would be trouble she laughed at the idea and taking up the telegraph began to read but suddenly laid it down with a nervous start ferrari loves me belk loves me i love neither but only my child rupert stands between me and my happiness which of these men will remove him out of my path ferraria subtle italian belka brutal saxon humph the fox and the lion over againcraft and strength i can depend on them both and rupert she struck her hands together with a triumphant laugh rupert pethram you are marching blindfolded into a trap chapter xiv signor ferrari declines number one is the greater number if i assisted number two it would become the lesser signor ferrari was a gentleman who knew how to make himself thoroughly comfortable and in order to do so squandered his earnings in a most spendthrift fashion at present he was receiving a very handsome salary for his singing in sultana fatima therefore he denied himself nothing in the way of luxury he was a true bohemian in every action of his life and accepted his fluctuating fortunes with the utmost equanimity if he fared badly on dry bread and water one day he was hopeful of oysters and champagne the next and when the feast of dives was before him made the most of it in eating and drinking so as to recompense himself for all future deprivations which would be the lot of povertystricken lazarus while his voice lasted he was well aware that he could command an excellent income which satisfied him completely for when he grew old and songless he was quite prepared to return to italy and live there the happygolucky life of his youth on polenta and sour wine in his impulsive southern fashion he loved mrs belswin madly but strangely enough it never for a moment occurred to him to save money against his possible marriage with her if he starved she would starve if he made money she would share it and if she objected to such a chequered existence signor ferrari was quite confident enough in his own powers of will and persuasion to be satisfied that he could force her to accept his view of the matter this was the ferrari philosophy and no bad one either as times go seeing that a singers livelihood depends entirely upon the caprice of the public as long as he could get enough to eat be the food rich or plain a smoke and plenty of sleep the world could go hang for all he cared he lived in the present never thought about the past and let the future take care of itself so altogether managed to scramble through life in a leisurely selfish manner eminently egotistical in fashion at present being in the heyday of life he was dining with dives which was happiness enough in itself but in order that nothing should be wanting to complete his felicity he had received a letter from mrs belswin telling him of her contemplated arrival under these circumstances he had nothing left to wish for and lounging on the sofa in his sittingroom in a state of blissful contentment awaited the coming of his fair friend buno said the signor with smiling satisfaction folding up the letter and putting it in his pocket the singingbird returns to its nest this time i will clip its wings so that it flies not again per bacco the kind heart of stephano surprises himself for who would let his bird fly as he has done but i fear not the jealousy offspring of suspicion ecco she loves but me and comes again to the nest and what a nest cospetto my lucrezia will be hard to please if she likes not this palazzo del amor it was a very pretty nest indeed from a lodginghouse point of view although its incongruity of colouring and furnishing would have driven an artist out of his mind but then the signor was not exacting in the way of harmonious effect and provided his dwelling was fairly comfortable felt completely satisfied lying on the sofa he looked complacently at the furniture covered with painfully bright blue satin at the scarlet curtains the green wallpaper and at all the wax flowers berlin wool mats and gimcrack ornaments with which the room was adorned ferrari had added to this splendid furnishing an excellent piano for professional purposes and numerous photographs principally feminine of his artistic friends so that he conceived himself to be housed in a princely fashion it was three oclock by the incorrect french timepiece on the tawdry mantelpiece and ferrari was getting somewhat impatient as mrs belswin had mentioned two oclock as the time of her arrival but with his accustomed philosophy he manifested no anger at the delay la donna mobile he hummed shrugging his shoulders as he strolled towards the piano women are always late it is one of their charming follies ah eh ee diavolo my voice is bad this day these english fogs are down my throat ah eh ee dio what a note voce del oca ask not the stars the fate they deal read in my eyes the love i feel thats a good song that serenade to fatima it shows off my voice ill sing it to exercise my high notes he did so and was just in the middle of the first verse when mrs belswin made her appearance upon which he stopped abruptly and came forward to greet her with theatrical effusion stella dora once more you shine he cried seizing her hands with a passionate look in his dark eyes oh my life how dear it is to see thee again you missed me then stephano said mrs belswin sinking wearily into a chair missed thee carissima exclaimed the italian throwing himself on his knees before her and kissing her hand by this and this and this again i swear that all has been dark to me without the light of thine eyes but you will not leave me again angela mia thou hast come back for ever to be my wife mrs belswin drew her hand away sharply and frowned for in her present irritable state of mind the exaggerated manner of ferrari jarred on her nerves do be sensible stephano she said in a vexed tone you are always acting how can that be acting cruel one which is the truth replied ferrari reproachfully rising from his knees thou knowst my love and yet when i speak you are cold eh donna lucrezia is your heart changed my heart remains as it always was my friend but ive come up to see you on business oh business interrupted stephano suspiciously cospetto you want once more to leave me for a time yes oh for a time yes echoed ferrari mockingly amica mia you have a strange way of speaking to him who adores you dio you play with me like a child i love you and wish you for my wife you say yes and depart for a time now return you to me and again say stephano i leave you for a time i made no promise to be your wife said mrs belswin angrily nor will i do so unless you help me now help you and in what way has the little daughter been cruel you wish me to speak as father to her i wish you to do nothing of the sort my daughter is quite well and i was perfectly happy with her and without me cried ferrari jealously upon which mrs belswin made a gesture of irritation we can settle that afterwards she said drawing off her gloves meanwhile let us talk sense i shall be up in town for a fortnight and you stay cara at an hotel in the strand ill give you the address before i leave bene i will then have you to myself for two weeks it all depends on whether you will help me in what i wish to do ebbene is it il marito mrs belswin nodded and the italian burst out laughing povero diavolo he has then come again no but he arrives next week how pleased you are said ferrari mockingly oh yes he will be so sweet to behold you thats the very question i dont want him to see me then return not to the little daughter i must i must cried mrs belswin in despair i cant give up my child after meeting her again twenty years stephano and i have not seen her now i am beside her every day she loves menot as her mother but as her friend i cant give up all this because my husband is returning signor ferrari shrugged his shoulders and lighted a cigarette but there is nothing more you can do he said spreading out his hands with a dramatic gesture eh carrissima think of what is this affair il marito has said to you goodbye the little daughter thinks you to be dead if then you come to reveal yourself il maritoeh amica mia it is a trouble for all what can i do nothing oh no certainly you have beheld the little daughter for a time now you are to me again i say stella dora with me remain and forget all no i will not i will not cried mrs belswin savagely rising to her feet cannot you see how i suffer if you love me as you say you must see how i suffer give up my child my life my happiness i cannot do it dio you cannot make the miracles i can i must do you think i will stay with you while my child calls me with me you must stay my norma i love thee i will not leave you no more you cant stop me ebbene said ferrari conscious that he held the advantage go then and see how il marito will behold you mrs belswin felt her helplessness and clenched her hands with a savage cry of despair that seemed to be torn out of her throbbing heart up and down the gaudy room she paced with her face convulsed with rage and her fierce eyes flashing with an unholy fire while ferrari secure in his position sat quietly near the window smoking leisurely his selfpossession seemed to provoke her ready as she was to vent her impotent anger on anything and stopping abruptly she poured forth all her anger why do you sit there smiling and smiling like a fool she shrieked stamping her foot can you not suggest something can you not do something eh carissima i would say be quiet the people below will hear you cry out let them what do i care i am a desperate woman ferrari and i am determined to keep my position beside my child i will stop at nothingnothingnot even murder murder signor ferrari let the cigarette drop from his fingers and jumped up with a cry of dismay looking pale and unnerved she saw this and lashing him with her tongue taunted him bitterly yes murder you miserable i thought you were a brave man but i see i made a mistake you love me you want to be my husband no no no i marry a brave manyes a brave man not a coward ferrari winced with an angry glitter in his eyes eh lucrezia you think i am a brave man if i go to assassin il marito cospetto i am an italian but the italians are not fools if another man loved you and would take you away i would kill himyes but il maritoeh that is not quite the same i kill him and you return to the little daughter for always what gain to me carissima i kill him and your law gives me the rope what gain to me no donna lucrezia do what you love stab him with a stiletto or give the poison i say nothing but as for me to obeydio the life is not trouble to me yet you are afraid he bounded across the room and seized her roughly by the wrist devilwoman i have no fear you lie to speak so i you lie figlia inferna then why do you refuse to help me per bacco i am no assassin il marito is not an enemy to me to you he is hateful revenge yourself as it pleases but icospetto you ask too much he flung her away from him with a gesture of anger and began to walk about the room mrs belswin remained silent savagely disappointed at the failure of her plan and presently ferrari began to talk again in his rapid impulsive fashion if there was any gain yes but i see not anything i would work against myself you know that signora machiavelli ah yes i am not blind cara mia while il marito lives you are mine he will keep you from the little daughter but he dieseh and you depart no no i swear i refuse your swearing they are false forget il maritoforget the little daughter you are mine mia moglie and you depart not again mrs belswin laughed scornfully and put on her gloves again with the utmost deliberation then taking up her umbrella she moved quickly towards the door but not so quickly as to prevent ferrari placing himself before her where go you demanded the italian between his clenched teeth to find a braver man than stephano ferrari no you will find no one wont i pshaw i have found one already the italian sprang on her with a bound like a tiger seized her hands and placed his face so close to her own that she could feel his hot breath on her cheek you have a lover traditrice no you lie i believe you not mrs belswin laughed and made an attempt to go away sit in that chair infamous i will not sit in that chair i order you order yes i stephano ferrari she looked first at the italian then at the chair and his aspect was so determined that in order to avoid an unseemly struggle she sat down as desired with a shrug of the shoulders now tell me of this lover there is nothing to tell you lie i do not lie with eyes as fierce as his own she looked straight at him and it became a question as to which of them had the stronger will her determination to retain her position at any price even at the cost of her husbands life had roused all her worst passions and for the first time since he had known her the italian averted his eyes with a shudder of dread jettatura he cried recoiling from her malignant gaze and making horns with his fingers to avert the blighting consequences of her look mrs belswin saw her advantage and immediately began to play on his superstition i have the evil eye you think yes it is so why have you never discovered it before because i gave you love to those who cross me not i am kind but an insult ah you shrink well then take care i never forgive i never forget ferrari completely cowed by her manner threw himself on his knees before her and held out his hands with a gesture of entreaty stella dora leave me not behold me at your feet cruel one i die in your anger mrs belswin saw that she had gained command over him but was too wise to push her conquest too far so bending down she gave him her hand which he covered with fierce kisses rise stephano and i will tell you all for two weeks i will be in town and with you all the days you can call at my hotel if it pleases you if i decide nothing about my husband you can come down with me to deswarth and we will face him together but this lover i have no lover i spoke in jest your devotion has touched me and i will reward it by becoming your wife for the present said mrs belswin with a charming smile i will say a reverderci if you send me a box i will come and hear you sing tonight ferrari once more kissed her hand there was a rustling of skirts a closing of the door and she was gone the italian stood where she had left him with a scared look on his face and after a few minutes looked at the door through which she had vanished with a nervous smile jettatura he muttered shivering jettatura chapter xv the return of the wanderer oh i have seen the southern cross in southern skies burn clear and bright and i have seen the ocean toss beneath its gleam in waves of white its beauty brought me no delight for i was on a foreign shore but now joy cometh with the sight of englands chalky cliffs once more quite unaware of the pitfalls prepared for him by his now nearly forgotten wife sir rupert pethram had returned once more to england and rejoiced greatly in his dry fashion to find himself again under his own rooftree kaituna was delighted to have him home again and welcomed him with a filial affection that made a deep impression on his somewhat hard nature he was not a favourite with the world being so stiff and dry in his manner that every one felt a feeling of uneasiness towards him consequently he was unused to affection except from his daughter whom he loved fondly in his own undemonstrative fashion a difficult man to get on with at least people said so and the haughty distant smile with which he greeted every one was enough to chill the most exuberant expressions of friendship not even his residence in new zealand where as a rule humanity is much more sociable than in england had eradicated the inherent exclusiveness of his nature true in his young days he had been more friendly with his fellowcreatures but the episode of his wifes divorce had destroyed his feelings of sociability entirely and although being an upright honourable gentleman he was respected throughout the colony he was certainly not loved he was a man who lived entirely alone and except his daughter kaituna there was no one on whom he bestowed a thought yet he was not uncharitable if he saw suffering he relieved it if any one desired help he was not backward in giving his aid still even the recipients of his charity found it difficult to feel warmly towards him in any way he did not believe in gratitude and therefore never sought for it but did his good deeds in a stolid matteroffact fashion that robbed them of their charm in the eyes of the onlookers it seemed as though his unhappy married life had blighted his existence had frozen in his breast all feelings of tenderness towards humanity for he was eminently a man who acted from right motives and not from any feelings of impulse to relieve suffering or help his fellowcreatures in appearance he was tall slender and rather goodlooking with a thin wrinkled face scanty grey hair and a darkish moustache well dressed in a quiet fashion undemonstrative and distant in his manners he embarrassed all with whom he came in contact for the wellbred coldness of his voice and the supercilious look in his grey eyes and the nolimetangere of his behaviour made every one around him feel uncomfortable with kaituna he was always as pleasant and agreeable as he was able to be but his daughter felt that any pointed display of affection would be received with disapproval by her singular parent a man so straightlaced so rigid in the due observance of all social duties could not but be annoyed at the absence of his daughters chaperon at a time when he was expected home she was kaitunas guardian in his absence responsible for her in every way and he was naturally anxious to see if mr dombrains choice was a good one shortly after his arrival he broached the subject to kaituna while waiting for his horse to be brought round as it was his intention to ride round the estate with belk kaituna he said in his frigid voice when do you expect this lady to return in about ten days papa do you like her my child oh papa i love her sir rupert raised his eyebrows that is a strong expression and a mistaken one my child never give your love to any one they will betray you isnt that rather severe not from my experience answered pethram with emphasis but there there do not look so sad child you are young yet and all geese are swans in your eyes but about mrs belswin i am very much annoyed that she should have gone away at this time it is not courteous to me nor in keeping with her position as your companion but she had to go about some business papa said kaituna rather afraid at the frown she saw on her fathers face business business her business is here child i expect mrs belswin to give all her time to you she has done so until now and now is the most important time as i wish to see if she is a good companion for you im sure you will like her very much papa impossible i like no one very much not even me she threw her arms round sir ruperts neck and his face relaxed somewhat under her smile there there child he said pushing her gently away if i have a weak spot in my heart it is for you now goodbye at present im going to see how things are looking so he went away in the bright breezy morning and kaituna was left alone in deep thought wondering how she could tell him of the offer of marriage made to her by archie maxwell she was a brave enough girl in most things but felt decidedly reluctant to speak to her father about a subject she knew would be disagreeable to him archie was young handsome hopeful and loved her dearly but these four excellent qualities would seem nothing in sir ruperts eyes as opposed to poverty the girl was in despair knowing her fathers iron nature as she did and longed for the return of mrs belswin in order to have at least one friend to stand by her it was true that archie had declared himself ready to speak to sir rupert at once but kaituna dreading the refusal of her father to countenance the engagement persuaded him to wait until her chaperon came back meanwhile she went off to her own room to read her lovers last letter for as archie not being duly accredited could not come to the house they were obliged to correspond in a clandestine manner which was not without its charm to the romantic nature of miss pethram while therefore kaituna was attending to her business sir rupert was attending to his accompanied by belk he rode over the estate looking into things and exercised the young mans dull brains pretty considerably by his shrewd questions concerning this and that and the other thing sir rupert pethram had not been a penniless younger son nor graduated in new zealand for nothing for he knew as much about land and crops and cattle and top dressing as any man being thus accomplished he took occasion to read his bailiff a severe lecture which belk received in sulky silence on the slipslop fashion in which things were conducted when i pay my servants well said sir rupert severely i expect them to look after my interests thoroughly there has been a great deal of neglect here and i expect you to place things on a much more satisfactory footing do you hear me yes sir ill do my best your best will be my worst im afraid judging from what ive seen ill give you a few months longer but if you dont improve things in that time mr belk im afraid you and i will have to part company belk was in a towering rage at thus being spoken to but as he wanted to retain his situation he held his tongue nevertheless determining in his own mind that he would repay sir rupert for his reproof as soon as he was able fortune offered him an unexpected chance of which he took immediate advantage returning home with sir rupert a dogcart containing two young men passed them on the road the occupants of which nodded to belk whom they knew slightly who are those gentlemen asked sir rupert sharply one is mr clendon the vicars son sir and the other belk saw his chance for knowing all the gossip of the place he was aware that kaitunas engagement was unknown to sir rupert so in the hope that it would be disagreeable he spoke out straight mr maxwell sir the gentleman engaged to miss pethram what the devil do you mean demanded sir rupert haughtily i beg your pardon sir i only answered your question pethram looked keenly at the man to read his real meaning but belk kept his countenance with the greatest skill so the baronet was forced to believe that he had spoken in all good faith you can go belk he said curtly turning his horses head and dont forget what ive said the bailiff looked after him with a savage look in his face no i wont forget he said to himself scowling that affairs been kept from you but you know all about it now if i can find a chance of hurting you my fine gentleman ill do it to pay you out for your cursed pride this day meanwhile sir rupert outwardly calm was riding home consumed with rage what his daughter engaged to a man of whom he knew nothingof whose very name he was ignorant it was infamous and she had never said a word about it good heavens where was mrs belswin to permit such a thing evidently it was common gossip all the county knew it and his daughter whom he loved and trusted had withheld her confidence shes like her mother said sir rupert between his clenched teeth deceptive in all things never mind ill get the truth out of her before the day is an hour older and thenoh these women these women daughters and wives they are all the same they smile they kiss they betray and we poor fools believe them touching his horse with the spur he rode at full gallop up the avenue in order to relieve his overburdened feelings and when he was once more in his own study sent for his daughter without delay kaituna obeyed this unexpected summons with considerable trepidation having with feminine instinct guessed the reason for which her father wanted to see her so suddenly she found him standing in front of the fireplace with his hands behind his back and a stern look on his facea look she had never before seen directed at her will you take a chair said pethram with glacial politeness im sorry to trouble you about a disagreeable matter but being your father i owe it to myself and to you to speak she sat down in the chair he indicated with a sinking heart and waited in silence to hear his reproaches sir rupert however had no intention of making any he disliked a scene and was moreover skilful in using that irony which cuts like a knife and which is far more effective than unreasoning rage so you have deceived me kaituna father am i your father i hardly think so when you conceal from me the most important event of your life kaituna had a considerable spice of the paternal nature in her so she took a hint from the baronet and used his own weapons to defend herself i dont understand to what you allude sir do you not if then you will give me your attention for a few moments i will try and enlighten you i saw a young gentleman in the distance today and asked belk who he was in reply i was informed that it was a mr maxwell to whom you are engaged will you kindly inform me if this is the case kaituna lifted her head defiantly i love mr maxwell and wish to marry him indeed i presume you never considered that it was necessary to consult me i intended to do so father whenwhen mrs belswin returned ah mrs belswin then knows all about this affair yes and is going to ask me to consent to the marriage yes sir rupert walked up and down the room for a few minutes then pausing before his daughter spoke deliberately im afraid you may think me somewhat inquisitive but i should like to know something about this mr maxwell where did you meet him at marshonthesea indeed and having fallen in love with you there he followed you up here yes he was going to ask you to consent to our marriage very considerate of him but as yet he has not done so who is my future soninlaw father cried kaituna the tears coming into her eyes do not speak so cruelly he is a civil engineer and i love him veryvery dearly mr clendon the vicar knows him he is staying there just now very interesting indeed has he any money i dont know i think not so you were going to marry in this extremely doubtful fashion i must say the whole affair does equal credit to your heart and head father pardon me one moment this estate is entailed and should i die tomorrow you do not inherit a penny as it goes to the next male heir of the pethrams if then you do not make a good match i confess i do not see how you are to live kaituna said nothing but remained with downcast eyes looking at the ground while her father went on speaking in a cold tranquil tone knowing that you would be penniless at my death i went out to new zealand sold all my property and invested the money in an australian silver mining company you may be sure i did not do so without first personally inquiring thoroughly about the prospects of the company from what i learned i am sure that it will turn out well and in the event of its doing so you will be an heiress under these circumstances i can rest assured as to your future should i die in an unexpected manner i understand father butbutwhat are you going to do i am going to write to mr maxwell thank him for his very gentlemanly behaviour and refuse to sanction the match kaituna flung herself on her knees before him no no you will not be so cruel i love him papa oh you dont know how i love him i know well enough kaituna you love him so much that you would go and live in a cottage on dry bread and water this is youthful folly and i decline to aid you to ruin your life in such a way mr maxwell has behaved very badly no no i say he has replied pethram with emphasis no gentleman would have acted as he has done i will write him at once and if he seeks an interview he shall have it so that i can tell him to his face my opinion of his conduct father not another word kaituna rise from your knees for all your tears wont alter my decision i wont ask you to dismiss this gentleman i will do it myself his daughter stung by his cold irony sprang to her feet with a cry of anger papa papa dont do that i love him i want to marry him then after a pause stamping her foot i will marry him will you im afraid not replied pethram coldly you are under age remember oh what shall i do what shall i do cried the girl tearfully raising her head behave like a sensible woman and give up this madness no i will not i will be true to archie pethram shook his head with a vexed air my dear child you are really very foolish i dont wish to argue any more on the subject you are going to write toto mr maxwell at once and refuse to let him marry me exactly then said kaituna pausing a moment at the door i swear by the name of my mother that i will be true to him she was gone in a moment and sir rupert over whose face had come a grave worn look laughed discordantly by the name of her mother he said with a sneer ah she little knows what her mother was chapter xvi forewarned is forearmed tis ill work

skill and though in armour he be dight your lance may find some place to kill the interview which had taken place between mrs belswin and her italian lover had been productive of a curious change in the demeanour of the latter from being master he became slave from commanding he changed to obeying and taking advantage of this astonishing transformation mrs belswin ordered her quondam master about like a dog she saw that by a single flash of her fierce eyes at a critical moment she had inculcated the superstitious italian with the idea that she was possessed of the evil eye and had by so doing taken all the manhood out of him this son of the south who was decidedly brave in the presence of physical danger was so completely the slave of superstition that he firmly believed mrs belswins eyes exercised a malignant influence upon him against which he was powerless to struggle notwithstanding this terrible feeling he was too much in love with her to think of removing himself from the dread fascination of her presence and therefore he accepted his new position with superstitious resignation once or twice indeed he attempted to exert his former authority but the ominous gleam in mrs belswins eyes and the significant sneer on her lips soon reduced him to obedience and he cowered at the feet of his sometime slave in abject terror it was not physical fear it was not a want of manliness it was simply the effect of a supernatural terror acting upon a nature singularly prone both by birth and training to yield to such weird superstitions having thus reduced ferrari to such a state of bondage mrs belswin thought that there would be no difficulty in making him put her husband out of the way in some stealthy manner here however she was entirely wrong as ferrari being afraid of the english law absolutely refused to lend himself to the committal of a crime even at the command of his evil genius in vain with all the artistic craft of a woman she prayed implored cursed ordered ferrari would not be moved from the position which he had taken up in holding himself aloof from the power of the law afraid of her in every other way he did exactly as she asked him but in this special case his fear of the visible power of justice was greater than his fear of supernatural visitation from the glance of the evil eye and after a fortnights battling mrs belswin was obliged to confess herself beaten by the steady refusal of her slave to obey her in what she desired most of all things to be done by means of belk she had kept herself thoroughly well acquainted with all that had taken place at thornstream during her absence the bailiff employed his mother who was always haunting the great house to find out what was going on so the information she gave her son he in his turn retailed by letter to mrs belswin in london from this source therefore the latter learned all about sir ruperts return the discovery of the engagement and the dismissal of archie maxwell by the angry baronet on hearing all this news mrs belswin with rare resolution made up her mind to go down to thornstream and see her husband face to face she saw plainly that she could do nothing criminal against him and so determined to have an interview with him and throw herself on his mercy if he granted her this all would be well if however he spurned herwell mrs belswin knitted her brows clenched her hands and drew a long breath she was a despairing reckless woman and would stop at nothing to gain her ends so it seemed as though sir rupert was in a very dangerous position the baronet was no coward but he would certainly have felt a thrill of fear had he known this meditated attack by his terribly savage wife one effect of ferraris newlyborn dread of mrs belswins supernatural powers was that he followed her like a dog and seemed afraid to let her out of his sight formerly having a full belief in his power to draw her back to himself he had not minded her being away for certain periods but now that he deemed his dominating power was gone he was afraid lest she should leave him altogether and kept a close watch upon all her actions he was with her all day and at night when forced to attend to his business insisted that she should come to the theatre and stay in a private box where he could see her during the performance mrs belswin did not wish to abuse her newlygained power over him so acquiesced in his somewhat unreasonable demands but when she made her preparations to return to thornstream he insisted upon accompanying her there but what about your business objected mrs belswin that will be right cara mia he replied rapidly see youwe will go down on sundayi do not sing that night and i will return on mondaywith you i will not return on monday signora you will i think so on sunday night you will behold il marito he will order you away and what is left but to come back with your faithful stephano what you say is very true said mrs belswin coolly but things may turn out so that i can stay eh have you the plan donna lucrezia no i leave everything to chance dio what faith muttered ferrari lifting his hands and the conversation ended with mrs belswin agreeing that ferrari should accompany her to thornstream on sunday afternoon with that profound belief in the unseen which is a strong characteristic of halfcivilised natures mrs belswin seeing that she could do nothing herself left everything to chance and expected this blind faith to be rewarded by some miraculous intervention which should change her husbands heart towards her she had no grounds for such belief but hoping against hope kept repeating to herself that all would yet be well and that things would end happily nevertheless in spite of her striving to look upon the bright side of things she received something of a shock when on arriving at the deswarth railway station she saw archie maxwell advancing towards her with a most lugubrious expression of countenance wishing to speak with him she sent ferrari off to look after her portmanteau and drew the disconsolate lover into the bare waitingroom where they could converse freely well asked mrs belswin sharply looking at the downcast face of the young man is all this true about sir rupert yes of course what else would i speak of its all true quite trueworse luck he has refused to sanction the engagement yes i received a letter from him in which he accuses me of acting shamefully in winning his daughters heart oh cried archie clenching his hands if he was not her father you never saw such a lettera cruel wicked letter if he was not her father i would make him apologise for its insolence oh said mrs belswin cruelly so being her father you are going to sit quietly down under this insult what can i do do oh if i only were a man do why marry kaituna in spite of him why dont you see kaituna and urge her to marry you at once i have done so and she refuses to disobey her father good heavens thought mrs belswin savagely the girl is no daughter of mine to allow herself thus to be robbed of the man she professes to love she kept this sentiment to herself however and only said abruptly what are you doing here im going up to town on business indeed so you capitulate without a struggle no i dont replied maxwell flushing at the cold contempt expressed in her tone i am going to see my employers about this buenos ayres business which i put off till the end of the year if i can manage it ill start for south america next month alone not if i can help it on my return ill try and persuade kaituna to accompany me and disobey her father theres no help for it replied archie with a groan we love one another very dearly and i dont see why our lives should be spoilt at the caprice of a selfish old man what does your friend mr clendon say he is entirely on my side and mrs valpy the same they think sir rupert is an old brute so he is muttered mrs belswin angrily well mr maxwell she said aloud i also am on your side its a shame that your lives should be spoilt for a caprice but remember one thing sir rupert will cut his daughter off with a shilling let him kaituna and i can face poverty together poor innocents said mrs belswin with a jeering laugh you dont know what poverty is you neednt speak so unkindly replied archie rather hurt at her tone i thought you wished me to marry kaituna so i do but i dont want you to starve we shall not starve i can always make a good income my dear sir said mrs belswin candidly your income may be enough for one but it certainly is not enough for two particularly when the other is a girl brought up as kaituna has been if you marry kaituna without her fathers consent you drag her down to poverty oh yes you do its no good glossing over those matters better look at the hard simple facts mr maxwell and you will find it best in the long run you love kaituna she loves you and you look forward to love in a cottage and all that kind of thing which does not exist out of novels the reality however is not so pleasant then what am i to do give up kaituna certainly not kahunas happiness is as dear to me as it is to you if you left her she would pine away and im sure you would not be happy mrs belswin cried the young man in desperation i dont know what you mean you blow hot and cold you are both for and against you say marry kaituna and then you add it is a selfish thing to drag her to poverty i dont understand your meaning oh the density of lovers said mrs belswin with an angry flash of her fierce eyes you are like all men my dear mr maxwell and never see an inch beyond your nose does it never strike you that i am also fond of kaituna and would do anything to insure her happiness you yes even i oh dont look so disbelieving my friend i may have more power than you think with sir rupert but you dont know sir rupert dont i replied mrs belswin grimly thats all you know well here is your train mr maxwell so ill say goodbye but what are you going to do said archie as they went out on to the platform i dont knowyet will you get sir rupert to consent to our marriage perhaps maxwell jumped into a firstclass carriage with a sigh of despair and put his head out of the window for a moment as the train started mrs belswin yes i dont know your meaning but you seem to have some power so ill leave the future happiness of kaituna and myself in your hands you will trust me entirely very well you will see your trust has not been misplaced mrs belswin however was promising more than she could perform and stood frowning deeply as the train went off from this reverie she was aroused by a touch on her shoulder and on turning saw ferrari is that the man what do you mean is it the one who is ready to do for you what i refuse she looked at him mockingly and womanlike determined to torture him my good stephano if you knew that you would be as wise as myself chapter xvii before the storm before the storm the woods are still all nature drowses as in sleep yet tho her slumbers she may keep she feels a strange prophetic thrill before the storm from heavy clouds on mount and hill the thunders mutterlightnings leap and soon the heavns commence to weep such strained silence augurs ill before the storm living at thornstream was hardly very pleasant after the interview between sir rupert and his daughter everything went on just the same but this very calmness was a foreboding sign of a coming tempest the baronet was deeply angered at what he considered kaitunas feminine duplicity but hiding all such feelings under a mask of ultra politeness he treated her with a cold courtesy which was far more irritating to the proud spirit of the girl than any outburst of wrath would have been inheriting however no inconsiderable portion of the paternal pride she on her part treated her father with distant politeness so these two proud spirits found themselves entirely separated the one from the other by the insurmountable barrier of disdainful silence which they had each contributed to build they lived under the same roof they took their meals at the same table they interchanged the usual remarks concerning daily events and to all outward appearances were the same to one another as they had ever been but it was far from being the case for the confidence of the father in the daughter of the daughter in the father had entirely disappeared and they regarded one another with mutual distrust it was certainly a very unhappy state of things and was entirely due to the peculiar views held by sir rupert regarding his bearing towards his womankind had he interviewed maxwell personally and judged for himself as to his fitness to become the husband of his daughterhad he spoken of the matter to kaituna in a kindly mannerhad he made some allowance for the mutual love of these young people who had set aside conventional observations things might have been better but by ordering his daughter to give up her lover as he had formerly ordered his highspirited wife to give up her friend he committed a fatal mistake and as he had reaped the consequences of such highhanded proceedings before by losing his wife it seemed as though history would repeat itself and he would lose his daughter had he shown kaituna the folly of a hasty love match had he entreated her for her own sake to be cautious had he requested her to consider her determinationbut to order ah that was the mistake he made curiously enough he never saw this in all things he demanded an absolute and unquestioning obedience from his household so it never for a moment struck him that the girl would dare to defy his authority yet it was so for in place of making her obedient sir ruperts blundering conduct had made her crafty and she made up her mind that she would never give up her lover tommy valpy stood her friend and kaituna met archie at her house where they parted with many promises of remaining true to one another then kaituna returned to thornstream and resumed her mask of politeness while sir rupert thinking she had obeyed him and given up her undesirable lover was to a certain extent content although still suspicious of her apparent acquiescence in his wish things were in this state when mrs belswin arrived on leaving the railway station after her interview with maxwell she had met belk but did not stop to speak to him being afraid of ferraris jealousy in this she was quite right for belk seeing her driving past with a stranger scowled savagely as he took off his hat while ferrari noting the good looks of the young man and seeing the scowl directed to himself guessed directly that this was the rival mentioned by mrs belswin mia cara he said artfully as they drove on to deswarth that handsome gentleman who made the bowis it your friend friend echoed mrs belswin carelesslyoh ive so many friends is it began stephano when mrs belswin turned furiously upon him dont worry me stephano dont you see im busy is that the man i mentioned to youyes it is you see he is stronger than you so dont fight him unless you like i dont care a morsel for either of you all i want is to stay by my child and as you cant help me you coward dont worry me with silly questions ferrari said no more but made up his mind to seek an interview with the goodlooking stranger and find out whether mrs belswin regarded him with favour on arriving at deswarth which was a short distance from thornstream mrs belswin put the italian down at the chequers inn told him to wait there in concealment until she saw him again and then drove to the hall being determined not to see sir rupert until after dinner in order to discover in the meantime how the land lay she went up to her own room and sent for kaituna who was delighted to see her now you are here said the girl kissing her friend you may perhaps induce papa to let me marry archie you know i know all about it my dear replied mrs belswin with a maternal air mr maxwell met me at the railway station and put me in full possession of all the facts and do you think papa will let me marry him asked kaituna timidly i really cannot tell dear until i see your papa at dinner noo responded mrs belswin doubtfully im tired after my journey so ill have my dinner here afterwards i will ask for an interview with sir rupert so you and your papa can dine ttette no im sure we cant said kaituna in rather a tone of relief mr dombrain is here mrs belswin faced round rapidly dombrain she echoed aghast your fathers solicitor yes now what does he want here i wonder muttered mrs belswin more to herself than to her auditor he came down to make papas will i think said kaituna his will echoed mrs belswin struck with a sudden thought kaituna if your father dies will he leave you well off oh i dont want papa to die no no of course not said her companion impatiently but one never knows what might happen but suppose he did die you would be an heiress no doubt kaituna shook her head i dont think so she replied slowly you see thornstream is entailed on the male side and none of it comes to me but your father was well enough off in new zealand why how do you know that i dont know dear answered mrs belswin hurriedly seeing she had made a slip i only presume so he used to be well off but he lost a lot of money lately and this time when he went out he sold all his property oh said mrs belswin drawing a long breath of relief then he will have a large sum of money in hand no indeed he has put it all into silver mining shares in melbourne the fool muttered mrs belswin below her breath to risk his all in such security so you see dear mrs belswin said kaituna pursuing her own train of thought that if archie wants to marry me for my money i shall not have any mrs belswin caught the girl in her arms and kissed her with rare tenderness my dear she said kindly smoothing the dark hair archie loves you for yourself not for your money now go downstairs dear and excuse me to your father and you will see him tonight about archie mrs belswin gasped in a somewhat hysterical manner and caught at the mantelpiece for support as she repeated the words i will see him tonightaboutaboutarchie kaituna was satisfied and departed but when the door was closed after her mrs belswin rushed madly across the room and flinging herself on her knees before the door burst out into a terrible fit of crying oh my dear my dear she wailed in a low moaning manner what can i do what can i do if your father dies you will be left penniless if he lives i shall have to leave you foreverfor ever my dearand go away into the outer darkness oh god god is there nothing i can do she looked up at the painted ceiling as if expecting an answer but none came so rising wearily to her feet she locked the door and dragged herself slowly towards the mirror what an old old woman i look she muttered peering into the glass grey hairs in the black wrinkles in the smooth face i wonder if he will recognise me surely not twenty years make a great difference i will see him now in another two hours he never dreams i am under the same roof unless dombrain she started drew herself up to her full height and clenched her hands dombrain she said again can he have revealed anything to rupert i know he hates me and would do me an injury if he dared but he cannot no i hold his secret while i do that mine is safe with him oh how ill i feel but i must not faint i must not quail i must be bravebrave for my childs sake she bathed her face in cold water took a small liqueur glass of brandy which she produced from the dressingbag and then went to lie down for a time before facing her husband tonight she murmured as her head sank on the pillows tonight rupert pethram we measure swords let us see who will win you or i chapter xviii face to face oh i was the husband and you were the wife we met and we married and parted our meeting was happy our marriage was strife our parting left each brokenhearted our hearts are now cured of their anguish and shame weve learned each our lesson of sorrow tis folly to need the same lesson again and so i will bid you goodmorrow sir ruperts study which was one of the most comfortable apartments in the house was placed in the east angle of the building so that two of the walls were formed by the outside of the house it was lighted by four french windows two of which were generally open in fine weather looking out on to the terrace it was furnished in a heavy stately fashion with cumbersome oaken furniture upholstered in green morocco and the walls hung with velvety darkgreen paper were surrounded with low oaken bookcases the height of a man filled with wellselected volumes on top of these cases were placed choice specimens of ceramic art consisting of red egyptian waterjars delicate figures in dresden china and huge bowls of porcelain bizarre with red and blue dragons interspersed with these quaint effigies of squat hindoo idols grotesque bronze gods from japan and hideous fetishes from central africa dainty watercolour pictures in slender gilt frames lightened the sombre tints of the walls and between these were highly polished steel battleaxes oldfashioned guns delicate but deadly pistols of modern workmanship and dangerouslooking swords all arranged in symmetrical patterns the floor of polished oak was covered with buffalo skins from american prairies opossum rugs from australian plains striped tigerskins from indian jungles and white bearskins from the cold north while in the centre of the room stood the desk piled with books and loose papers the whole room had a workmanlike appearance and an air of literary comfort eminently attractive to a bookish man on this night the two french windows were wide open and into the room floated the rich perfumes of the flowers broken by the pungent smell of a cigar which sir rupert was smoking as he sat writing at his desk at his feet on either side were heavy books carelessly thrown down after use and scattered sheets of paper while amid the confused mass on the desk itself was the red blottingpad and the white notepaper on which he was writing there was a lamp on his left from beneath the green shade of which welled a flood of heavy yellow lightso heavy that it seemed to rest sluggishly on the floor and be unable to rise to the ceiling where the shade made a dark circle withinthe yellow lighted room the silent man writing rapidly the steady ticking of the clock and the acrid tobacco scent withoutthe close night moonless and starless the air drowsy with heat the faint flowerodours and the sombre masses of the trees sleeping dully under the soporific influence of the atmosphere there was something weird in the uncanny stillness of the night a kind of premonition of coming woe which would have certainly affected the nerves of a highlystrung man but sir rupert did not believe in nerves and wrote on carelessly without giving a thought to the strange prophetic feeling in the air if he had only known he would have fallen on his knees and prayed for the protection of his guardian angel until the red dawn broke through the dread shadows of the fatal night the rapid scratching of the pen the sharp peremptory tick of the clock and suddenly a distinct knock at the door sir rupert raised his head with an expectant look on his face come in a woman entered tall and stately arrayed in sombre garments she entered slowly with a faltering step and paused in the shadow before the desk sir rupert his eyes dazzled by the glare of the lamp could see her face but indistinctly in the semitwilight and only heard her short hurried breathing which betokened great agitation mrs belswin is it not the woman placed one hand on her throat as if striving to keep down an attack of hysteria and answered in a low choked voice yes i beg your pardon i did not hear what you said madam ii am mrs belswin sir rupert started and passed his hand across his face with a confused sense of memory but dismissing the sudden flash of thought he arose to his feet and pointed politely to a chair will you not be seated mrs belswin she was foolish to betray her identity but whether it was that her resolution failed her or that her nerve gave way or that she determined to forestall discovery with an appealing cry she fell on her knees rupert god he tore the shade off the lamp the heavy concentrated yellow light spread through the room in clear waves of brilliance and there on the floor with wild white face with outstretched appealing hands with the agony of despair in her eyes he saw his divorced wife rupert step by step he retreated before the kneeling figure with startled eyes and dry lips until he leant against the wall and thrust out cruel hands to keep off this spectre of the past you yes iyour wife my wife he burst out into a discordant laugh on which like a wounded snake she dragged herself painfully along the floor until she reached his feet keep off he whispered in a hoarse voice keep off you shameless creature but hear me hear youhear you said sir rupert in a tone of concentrated scorn i heard you twenty years ago the law heard you the world heard you what can you say to me now that i did not hear then pity me oh rupert pity me pity you you that had no pity on me you that ruined my lifethat blasted my namethat made my home desolate pity you i am not an angel i am a man the woman twisted her hands together and burst out crying into floods of hot bitter tears that burned and seared her cheeksthose cheeks that burned with shame at the righteous scorn of the man who had trusted her and whom she had wronged what are you doing here said pethram harshly rise and answer me dont lie grovelling there with your crocodile tears have you no mercy none for such as you at these cruel words she arose to her feet with an effort and leaned heavily against the wall while her husband took his seat in stern anger as if she were a criminal brought before him for sentence you are mrs belswin yes my daughters companion she is mine as well as yours silence he said sternly do not dare to claim the child which you left so cruelly twenty years ago have you no shame shame she replied bitterly yes i have shame i know what shame istwenty years of bitter cruel shame god of mercy twenty years twenty thousand years would not be too much for your sin are you so pure yourself that you can judge me so harshly i am not here to argue such a question he said coldly with a cruel look in his eyes i want to know what you are doing here i came as a companion to my daughter and you told her i told her nothing said mrs belswin vehemently so help me heaven she knows nothing i am her companion her paid companionnothing more i am glad you have had the sense to spare my daughter the story of your shame how did you obtain the situation it was advertised and i got it through dombrain did he know who you were how could he do you think all the world knows the story of my folly your folly he repeated with deep scorn your sin you mean dombrain was a long time in new zealand he must have heard of the case if he did he never saw me he did not recognise me sir rupert looked at her doubtfully as if he would drag the truth from her unwilling lips she stood before him white silent defiant and he arose slowly to his feet twenty years ago he said coldly the law gave me my freedom from you and i thought never to see you again like a thief you have entered my house during my absence you have dared to contaminate with your presence my childyes my child not yours she ceased to be yours when you forsook her how you obtained this entrance i will make it my business to find out but now that i know that mrs belswin is my divorced wife i order her to leave my house at once go she uttered a piteous cry and stretched out her hands towards him in an agony of despair no no you cannot be so cruel i am not cruel by your own act you forfeited your right to remain under my roof but my child your child ah you remember her now after deserting her for twenty years do you think i will permit you to contaminate her young life by your presence do you think that i can see you day after day and not remember what you were and see what you are his wife cowered before his vehemence and covering her face with her hands shrank against the wall rupert she said in a low pleading voice do not be so harsh with me if i have sinned i have suffered for my sin for twenty years i have longed for a sight of my child but until now i dared not see her chance sent you away and gave me an opportunity of living with her as a companion she does not know who i am she will never know who i am and as her paid companion she loves me let me stay beside her and have some happiness in my wretched life no i will not i wonder you dare ask me i dare anything for my child it is too late to talk like thattwenty years too late you will let me stay oh rupert let me stay no for gods sake no no reflect some day you may need mercy how can you expect it if you deny it to me you have heard my determination go now at this moment you would turn me out of your house like a dog i would and i do it is all that you deserve at my hands is there no mercy nonefrom me go i will not go cried mrs belswin in despair i will not go i tell you sir rupert advanced towards the bell rope then i will order my servants to turn you out but rupert think kaituna will learn who i am better that than she should be contaminated by your presence the woman clasped her hands together and then in a frenzy of rage dashed across the room to pull him away from the bellrope you shall not you shall not she shrieked her fierce eyes flashing with mad anger i will stay i am a reckless woman i love my child i will not go i have the power to make you go and i will said pethram coldly are you a man or a devil i am what you have made me what i made you she hissed in a voice shaking with bitter scorn no it is you who have made me what i am i loved you when i married you as there is a god above i loved you but with your cold cruel words with your sarcastic sneers with your neglect you killed that love i had no friend i was only a girl and you crushed my heart i was dying for the love and tenderness which you refused to give me i was a good husband as the world says a good husband you gave me a good home you surrounded me with every comfort to all outward appearance i had nothing left to desire ah how little you with your cold cruel nature know what a woman wants i desired love i desired tenderness but i did not get it oates was kind to me he cheered my loneliness and in a moment of madness i went with him i regretted it the moment afterwards i have regretted it ever since god knows how miserable my life has been now i have a chance of happiness i will take advantage of it i will stay with my child you can do what you like you can say what you likei stay without changing a muscle of his face sir rupert heard his miserable wife to the end then advanced once more to the bell you have said all now go or i will have you turned out mrs belswin laughed scornfully do what you like she said indifferently you have said what you will do i have said what i will do for the first time sir rupert hesitated and let his hand fall without ringing the bell you fiend he said in a cold fury having made my life miserable before you now come to do so again but i knew i was never safe from your malice dombrain to whom i told all your vile conduct said you would come again he said that dombrain said that yes and he is a fit judge of my conduct she burst out in passionate anger do you know who he is do you know what he was a convictan embezzlera man who has served his term in prison my solicitormr dombrain he said incredulously mr dombrain she scoffed sneeringly mr damberton is his real name and it was by knowing what he was and what he is that i forced him to receive me as your daughters companion i would have spared him had he spared me but nowwell you know the worst of him yes and i know the worst of you he said fiercely oh you played your cards well but i will turn you out of my house and tomorrow i will expose dombrain or dambertons real position to all the world you can do what you like about him but i stay here you go and at once i will not she said desperately then i will shame you in the eyes of your own child he replied resolutely seizing the bell rope no no not that i say i will either you go at once or i call in kaituna and tell her who and what you are mrs belswin writhed in anguish oh i could not bear that my own child pity pity will you go pity pity will you go yes yes my own child i will go yes dont ring the bell i will go now but do not tell heroh rupert do not tell her i will tell nothing if you leave this house at once she dragged herself slowly towards the window conscious that she was beaten firm on every point reckless to the verge of despair the thought that her own child should know her shame was too much even for her oh god is there no mercy none go on the threshold of the window she stood with her tall form drawn up to its full height and her fierce eyes flashing with rage you part the mother and the child you drive me out of your house like a dog but remember with whom you have to deal tonight it is your turn tomorrow it will be mine he looked at her with a scornful smile and in a moment she was swallowed up by the darkness of the night from whence she had emerged like a spectre of the past chapter xix the outer darkness i stand outside in the bitter night and beat at the fastclosed door oh let me in to the kindly light give back to me days of yore but an angel says with a frowning brow the past can no power restore you must dwell in the outer darkness now for ever and ever more through the warm summer night her heart filled with rage humiliation and despair fled the unhappy woman whither she knew not all she wanted was to escape from thornstream lest her husband seeing her by chance should break his word and tell kaituna what she was if he did sooh the horror of it for her daughter to know that the mother whose memory she reverenced was alive and an unhappy fallen creature a thousand fiends seemed to shriek in her ears as she ran onward and it was only when she came against the trunk of a tree and fell halfstunned on the cool grass that she stopped in her mad career how cool was the delicate touch of the grass how sweet the perfume of the flowers she buried her hot face among the primroses and pressed her aching breast against the chill bosom of the earth to still the agonised throbbing of her heart under the great tree she lay in an exhausted condition thinking of her failure to conciliate pethram of the past with all its follies of the present with its pain and the future which looked so hopeless and dreary it was all over she had staked everything on the casting of a die and lost her husband had driven her away from the house from her child and there was nothing left for her to do but to return to london with ferrari and marry him at once never again would she live with her child she might see heryes but without being seenfor she knew that if she spoke again to kaituna everything would be revealed by rupert pethram to destroy that beautiful memory of motherhood which was the chief treasure of kaitunas lifeto show herself in her true colours as a fallen and wretched womanno she could not do that better exile better wretchedness better death than the terrible truth with a groan she sat up among the soft grass her hands lying idly on her lap her wild face raised to the lonely sky yes lonely for above there was nothing but clouds black heavy clouds as gloomy as her own future oh god was there no hope was there stay the clouds part rolling heavily to the westward revealing a glimpse of dark blue sky and set therein like a diamond the glimmer of a star hope yes it was a sign of hope a sign of promise a sign of comfort she thought she would go back to ferrari and see if he could suggest any plan by which she could turn the tables on her husband so brushing the dead leaves off her dress she threw the lace kerchief she wore round her neck over her head after the fashion of a mantilla and walked rapidly down the avenue towards deswarth the rapid motion of walking seemed to restore her nerve and with such restoration she regained again the fierceness of her savage spirit the moment of softness was past the good angel who had comforted her with the star of hope fled away in terror and over her head the angel of evil who had been her constant companion for so many years now spread his sable wings he had ordered her away he had parted her from her child this manher husband that used to be who had ruined her life by his cruel words and studied neglect the blame of her sin rested on his shoulders and she had suffered in the eyes of the world now once more he triumphed and while he was resting honoured and respected in his own house she was flying through the night like a guilty creature oh muttered mrs belswin between her clenched teeth if i was a man id kill him but i can do nothing i can do nothing yet i dont know if i can persuade that cowardly ferrari or belk belk would do anything for me what is to be done must be done tonighttomorrow it will be too late which way am i to turn she paused a moment pressed her hands on her beating heart then suddenly made up her mind i will see ferrarifirst the chequers inn was just on the outskirts of deswarth and a comparatively short distance from thornstream so it did not take mrs belswin long at the rapid pace at which she was walking to arrive there it stood a short distance back from the road and the night being hot all the doors and windows were open letting the yellow light within stream out on to the dark village street on the benches outside a number of yokels were drinking and talking loudly together about some fortnightold event which had just reached their outoftheway parish mrs belswin not wishing to be recognised flitted rapidly past them and was standing in the passage hesitating whether to make herself known to the landlord or not when luckily at that moment ferrari came out of a side door with the intention of going into the taproom like a ghost the woman glided forward and laid her hand on his arm stephano you cara mia the passage was so dark that he was able to recognise her by her voice alone and the noise from the taproom was so loud that only a quick ear like his could have distinguished her low tones come into some room i wish to speak to you here then he said drawing her into the room from whence he had emerged what is wrong il marito eh dio by your face there is trouble with a sigh of relief mrs belswin flung herself wearily into a chair while ferrari carefully closed the door and took up his position on the hearthrug even in that moment of anxiety mrs belswin with that noting of trivial things common to a preoccupied mind noticed the tawdry furnishing of the apartmentthe gaudy wallpaper on which hung brilliantly coloured portraits of the queen the prince of wales and general gordon the vivid red of the tablecloth the dingy blue of the chairs and the tarnished mirror over the fireplace swathed in fly spotted yellow gauze ferrari had evidently been smoking for there yet lingered about the room the odour of a cigar and the atmosphere was slightly hazy with smoke while the smoky flame of a badly trimmed kerosene lamp faintly illumined the whole place on a chair near the wall sat mrs belswin faint and weary but with an angry light in her wonderful eyes and standing on the hearthrug the italian his hands behind his back and his body slightly bent forward eager anxious and expectant ii marito he repeated inquiringly the woman made a gesture of assent upon which ferrari rubbed his hands together with an air of satisfaction bene he said smiling and showing his white teeth it is as i said it would be il marito has said depart and you my lucrezia have come back to the faithful one ah che gioja we will now leave this fog land and go to my beautiful italydolce napoli the waiting is over cara mia you are to me at last ah felicita you go too fast my friend replied mrs belswin with a cold look of disapproval on her expressive face do you think i will marry a coward i am no coward if a man to me dared to speak the word i would show him i am italian it is your eyesyour evil eyesthat make me afraid but you will not be cruel to me again bellissima he added in a caressing tone you have come to say i love thee listen stephano said mrs belswin rising to her feet and crossing to the italian i wish to tell you what he said no do not touch me wait i saw my husband he spoke cruelly to me he made me leave his houseyes turned me out like a dog cospetto ah that stirs your blood i see your eyes flash can you see methe woman you lovetreated in this manner no i am sure you love me too much you are italian you have a strong arm and a warm heart is it not so but what wish you signora kill him she had caught the italian by the coat with her two hands and her face was so close to his own that he felt her hot breath on his pale cheek with a gesture of alarm he shrank away and was about to speak but she prevented him you are afraid of the law she went on hurriedly do not be afraid listen hethat man i hatethe man who has treated me like a dogis in a room with open windows that lead on a terrace go there without noisewait in the shadow within all is lightwithout all is darkness draw him to the window by some trick when his figure is in the light shoot him with this ferrari gave a gasp for she had thrust a small revolver into his hand upon which his fingers unconsciously closed i cannot do it myself went on the temptress i dare not they would find out who i was and what i did i bought this pistol to kill him tonight but my heart failed me no one will think it is you go go if you love me and kill him i will be your wifei will do what you wishi will go where you likeonly kill him kill him it was no civilised woman who was thus planning a murder in such a coldblooded manner it was a savage with all the bloodthirsty instincts of a barbaric race all the european side of this womans nature had vanished and the primeval lust for blood dominated her entirely ferrari felt this horrible truth as her face distorted with passion pressed close to his own and with a cry of fear thrust her away dropped the pistol on the floor and covered his face with his hands devil woman that you are no mrs belswin whirled into the centre of the room like an enraged tigress you wont do it she hissed madly you wont help me i was right you are a coward well i will ask you no morei will do it myself she picked up the pistol lying at his feet and turned to the door but with a cry of horror he sprang in front of her and prevented her exit no no you are mad you are mad i will not let you go stand away i will go no cara think dio like a caged panther she looked round the room for a means of exit for mad with rage as she was she yet retained sufficient sense to know that a scene at the chequers would be detrimental to her plans i must go i must go her eye caught the window and like a flash of lightning she sprang towards it tore it open and bounded through into the darkness like a panther uttering a laugh of triumph as she vanished ferrari darted forward but stopped halfway across the room in amazement dio what a devil i must go or she will kill him he put on his hat and coat rapidly and closing the window left the inn by the door my friend he said to the landlord i go for a little walk addio luckily none of the labourers outside had seen mrs belswin leave as she had slipped past them in the shadow and the road to thornstream being perfectly deserted she was free from discovery ferrari had explored the neighbourhood that afternoon so knowing the way to thornstream walked slowly along the road until out of sight of the inn then ran rapidly onward through the darkness longing to catch a glimpse of the flying woman speeding towards thornstream with murder in her heart chapter xx a mysterious affair stark and stiff in the lonely night stiff and stark in the dawning light there it lies with unseeing eyes and placid face of a bloodless white who hath slain this man by guilt and fraud bears on his brow deepseared and broad the bloodred stain which is mark of cain unseen by man but beheld by god the red light of dawn burned in the eastern skies the first faint thrill of life ran through the earth as the twitter of awakening birds was heard in the green woods then the glorious sun sent his beams over the chill lands bathing everything in golden splendour thornstream hall faced to the east and the great shafts of sunlight breaking through misty morning clouds pointed downward like the finger of god on to the terraceto the open window of sir ruperts study and there in the splendour of sunrise lay a dead man face downward he lay with half of his body in the room the other half on the terrace and the hands stretched out in the form of a cross clenched in the agony of death last nightthis morningnay but a few hours back and this was a living breathing man full of all the passions sins and hatred of humanity now an empty shell a soulless husk was all that remained of sir rupert pethram then the servants began to move about the house attending to their morning duties and oneit was the housemaidentered the study to put it in order there she saw the dead man and with a terrible cry fell senseless to the ground her cry brought in her fellowservants there were expressions of incredulous wonder exclamations of horror and then a general hubbub of voices in a few minutes all the household knew the terrible truth that sir rupert had been found dead in his study shot through the head and dombrain came to the scene of the tragedy with horror on his face followed by kaituna and mrs belswin for gods sake dont let miss pethram see it said dombrain to the butler nor mrs belswin it is not a sight for women but it was too late they were both in the room and kaituna with a cry of horror fell on her knees beside the dead body of her father while mrs belswin stood looking down at the corpse with an impassive expression on her stronglymarked features the servants had left the room in order to send for the police and only three persons were left with the dead mankaituna convulsed with grief kneeling by the body and mrs belswin standing beside dombrain both silently lookingat the dead man no at the weeping daughter no at one another yes the questioning look of dombrain said you were the dead mans enemy is this your work mrs belswins eyes replied defiantly i was and am still the dead mans enemy i defy you to prove that this is my work they eyed one another steadily for a few moments and then the mans eyes drooped before the fierce daring of the womans there was silence in the room broken only by the sobs of kaituna come away my dear said mrs belswin bending down with a caressing gesture come to your room we can do no good here oh cried kaituna rising slowly from her knees who has done this my poor father my poor father who has murdered him again a flash of suspicion between dombrain and mrs belswin we do not know dear said the latter soothingly but mr dombrain has sent for the police perhaps they will find out the truth they must they must cried the girl in an agony of grief oh it is terrible to have come back for this to be killed under his own roof by an enemy oh why does god permits such things god permits many things said mrs belswin bitterly putting her arm round the shrinking form of her daughter come away dear all that can be done will be done the english police are clever and may perhaps capture the murderer dombrain smiled and mrs belswin noticed the smile perhaps the murderer may escape he said with emphasis giving a stealthy glance at mrs belswins coldly impassive face he may escape man but he will not escape god cried kaituna fervently oh come away mrs belswin come away i shall die if i stay here you will of course do everything that is necessary mr dombrain said the chaperon as she led the weeping girl to the door of course he replied stolidly i will arrange everything mrs belswin looked at him steadily and then left the room with the heartbroken daughter while dombrain left alone beside the corpse drew a long breath what nerve he said under his breath what nerve the police came took possession of the house brought down detectives from london questioned every one held an inquest anddiscovered nothing well it was a difficult case the police are not infallible therefore they failed to discover the murderer of sir rupert pethram if it had been a low london murder case for instance of the whitechapel poker sort then indeed the criminal would not have escaped human justice but in this affair it was impossible to move in any direction justice promised to do what she could and did nothing that bandage over her eyes is often in the way and in this instance blinded her altogether so whomsoever had killed sir rupert pethram was quite safe as far as this stupid blind blundering justice was concerned of course the police had a theory which explained everything and accomplished nothing the daily papers argued one way the police argued another the public gave their view of the matter and after great cry there was little wool sir rupert according to an intelligent jury came by his death at the hands of a person unknown a verdict which was vague and might mean anything then he was placed in the family vault and the title and estates went to a distant cousin kaituna left thornstream a penniless orphan and a new order of things began the new heir was a man of business who was hard and prided himself on being hard he had a large family and thinking the thornstream rents was quite small enough to rear his dozen childrenmale and female in equal proportiondeclined to do anything for kaituna whom he scarcely knew mrs belswin thereupon stepped forward and took kaituna off to london with her to see mr dombrain and ascertain if possible what private property sir rupert had died possessed of mr dombrain was quite happy to oblige mrs belswin in every way and did what he could but that was comparatively little so little indeed that it made no difference in the financial position of kaituna and she remained dependent on the bounty of mrs belswin but archie maxwell oh he behaved admirably on hearing of the death of sir rupert through the medium of the press he came down at once to deswarth consulted with toby and made every effort to find out the assassin of sir rupert but without success then he proposed to marry kaituna as soon as possible after the death of her father which arrangement was approved of by mrs belswin who added however that they could not marry on nothing and as archie was not rich and kaituna was now poor there was nothing left for them but to wait this archie agreed to do after much persuasion but meantime was with kaituna as often as possible he came up to london with mrs belswin helped her to select a comfortable lodging and when his sweetheart and her chaperon were established went off on his own account to see mr dombrain has miss pethram absolutely nothing he asked really says the solicitor i dont know if i can give you any information yes you can i am engaged to miss pethram and i am going to marry her as soon as i can i dont want her money for myself but i want her to get her rights mr maxwell said dombrain solemnly the late sir rupert was a great friend of mine and i would do anything for his daughter but im afraid that she inherits nothing but two thousand shares oh indeed in what company in the pole star silver mining company limited melbourne australia are they worth anything not even the paper they are written on hump said archie thoughtfully from what i heard of sir rupert i should hardly think he was a fool and no one but a fool would invest his money in a rotten company do you know anything of australian mining i know new zealand replied mr dombrain evasively but im not acquainted with australia the mine may turn up trumps on the other hand it may not are these shares all the property left by sir rupert yes he had land in new zealand but when he came in for the title he sold it all and invested the money in these shares he thought he would be able to save money from the thornstream rents to leave to his daughter but as he occupied the position of master such a short time of course he saved nothing and the new baronet sir thomas will do nothing for miss pethram nothing what a scoundrel mr dombrain shrugged his shoulders and declined to commit himself to an opiniona legal opinion is worth seven shillings and sixpence so there is no use wasting that amount by the way said archie as he was going what do you think of this murder i think it is a most mysterious affair said dombrain after a pause i cant account for it i was staying in the house as you know and left sir rupert in his study quite hearty i heard no pistol shot and in the morning he was dead most extraordinary had sir rupert any enemies my dear sir we all have enemies replied dombrain evasively i dare say but ones enemies dont go as far as murder as a rule answered archie dryly no no that is true but really mr maxwell you know as much about the murder as i do and i dare say are as completely in the dark i shant be in the dark long how so because im going to find out who murdered sir rupert take my advice and dont try said dombrain slowly why not demanded maxwell looking at him keenly because youll discover nothing how can you the police have failed i dont believe in the police much replied archie lightly i may succeed where others have failed goodbye mr dombrain i am going to see miss pethram and will probably see you again about these shares when maxwell had departed the solicitor sat in deep thought for a few minutes i wonder he said at length i wonder if he knows anything about mrs belswin chapter xxi archie makes his plans if you are my friend i set you this task aid me to an end if you are my friend your comradeship lend this secret unmask if you are my friend i set you this task maxwell globetrotters to clendon vicarage deswarthcome to me at once important toby was a lover and therefore unwilling to leave the vicinity of his beloved but he was also a friend and being of a kind staunch nature speedily made up his mind to obey at once the telegram his father who sincerely regretted the misfortune which had befallen the unfortunate kaituna and her lover warmly approved of his sons going away so tobys mind being at rest concerning the parental opinion he rode over to the valpys in order to see what tommy thought about the matter as he expected she said he was to lose no time in going to maxwell and also gave him several affectionate messages for kaituna you dont know how sorry i am for her toby she said with a sigh fancy losing your father and then all your money still archie is left observed toby wisely yes im glad of that she will always have him to protect her and that kind woman mrs belswin now then toby dont you say there are no good people in this world when mrs belswin has acted as she has done i never said there were no good people in the world retorted her lover in an injured tone i only said that good people are few and far between of course went on tommy without noticing this defence kaituna could always have found a home with ma and i i wish she had come here instead of going to london but mrs belswin seems very fond of her and then mr maxwell will marry her soon so she will be happy some day i wonder why mrs belswin is so very fond of kaituna speculated toby idly paid companions as a rule dont go beyond their wages in the matter of affection but mrs belswin goes the entire bakery toby dont be vulgar replied miss valpy reprovingly mrs belswin is a very superior woman i hate superior women oh thank you youre not a superior woman said clendon laughingly what am i then the dearest girl in the world i am i am youll find that out when your wifes milliners bill comes in now dont toby there are more important things than kissing not just now replied clendon and kissed her twice goodbye dearest i shall expect a letter every day will you really how long will you be absent i dont know it depends on what archie wants to see me about well ill write goodbye and take my love to kaituna certainly only i hope it wont get damaged during the transit so they parted and tommy returned to discuss kaitunas future with her mother while toby packed his portmanteau and after taking leave of his father caught the afternoon train to town archie maxwell when engaged in foreign parts underwent all incidental hardships without a murmur and accepted all disagreeables with a philosophy beautiful to behold but archie maxwell when in london indemnified himself for all such hardships by giving himself as many pleasures as his income permitted him being a young gentleman of good family he had a very reputable circle of acquaintances he had very pleasant rooms in the west end and belonged to the globetrotters which is as every one knows a very exclusive club being clever in his profession archie made a very decent income and having no reason that he knew of to save money spent every penny he made with a kind of itwillbeallrightintheend philosophy but now that he was engaged to kaituna he made various excellent resolutions about economy and resolved to put by as much as possible for the future home of mr and mrs maxwell he was a very methodical young man was mr maxwell and speedily made up his mind what course to pursue which course involved the cooperation of clendonhence the telegram which brought the latter up to town as toby had let his chambers during his visit to deswarth archie offered to put him up for the night which offer clendon accepted with avidity as he too was on the economic tack oh it was truly a beautiful spectacle to behold these young men formerly so careless of money matters now as careful of the shillings as they had been careless of the pounds on this night however as archie was going to arrange his future plans he proposed to toby that they should for a few hours only revert to the dear old extravagant days and enjoy themselves to this toby who hankered after the flesh pots of egypt agreed so they arranged to have the best dinner which the globetrotters was capable of providing and afterwards archie was to unburden his mind to his friend the globetrotters is a very pleasant club in an excellent situation and as the members are all travelled men of a sociable turn of mind the society to be found there is not to be despised from an informative point of view had marco polo or christopher columbus lived in the nineteenth century they would certainly have been members of the globetrotters and as for ulyssesbut then ulysses was fond of feminine society so perhaps he would not have cared for the exclusively masculine element of the club at all events when archie who being a traveller was a member arrived with tobywho being a stayathome was notthey found a great many pleasant people there including a bearded traveller who had been lionshooting in africa another who had made arrangements to find out the north pole if he was able and several other nineteenth century productions who all knew and liked maxwell archie however was too taken up with his plans to waste much time in hearing adventures about big game shooting and artful savages so he went off with toby to a very retired table where they had an excellent dinner under the supervision of a friendly waiter who was as great a traveller as any in the club having been a steward on a p o liner after dinner during which they had discussed various topics all bearing on the pethram murder and their future married happiness archie and his friend sought a secluded corner in the smokingroom ordered coffee and cigarettes and when they were thoroughly comfortable began to talk business toby said archie reflectively weve known each other a good many years seeing we were at school together i may say we have replied clendon smiling come now archie you want me to do something and dont like asking thats true because im going to ask you to make a sacrifice not to give up tommy no no i dont want to break your heart old fellow but ii well what is the sacrifice i want you to leave england for a few months and go to melbourne what for asked toby aghast at this strange request ill tell you i have been to dombrain who is the late sir ruperts lawyer about the will and i find he has left kaituna all his personal property well thats jolly the personal property consists of shares in a silver mine which at present are worth nothing oh thats not jolly but what about thornstream isnt kaituna the heiress no thornstream is entailed on the male side and all the property goes with the title had kaituna been a man she would have inherited but as she is a woman she doesnt get a penny i see the present baronet pursued archie smoothly is a beastly skinflint and wont give kaituna a penny so had it not been for the kindness of a strangeri allude to mrs belswini dont know what the poor girl would have done i do said toby emphatically she would have gone to the valpys who asked her to come or to the vicarage where the dear old pater would have looked after her bless you maxwell she would have been all right i know both your father and the valpys are good kind people replied maxwell with emotion and of course if the worst came to the worst she could have married me at once and we would have got on somehow still all these possibilities do not make mrs belswins kindness any the less shes a good sort said clendon feelingly why if kaituna had been her own daughter she couldnt do more for her than she is doing but get on with your story well kaituna as i have shown you gets nothing from thornstream or the present baronet so all she inherits is her fathers private property now in new zealand he had a good deal of land but when he came in for the title he converted it all into cash and with that cash he bought two thousand shares in the pole star silver mining company in melbourne wasnt that rather rash i dont know it certainly appears so now dombrain assures me that the shares are not worth the paper they are written on but ive got my doubts on the subject so i want you to go out to melbourne and find out all you can about the mine but what can i do i know nothing about mining oh you can find out from the brokers if the mine has any prospect of turning out well dombrain is arranging all the will business so as soon as kaituna is legally in possession of the shares i will send out the scrip to you and also a power of attorney perhaps the mine will turn up trumps if it does you can sell if notwell theres no harm done there was silence for a few moments during which toby was thinking deeply and his goodlooking face wore a more thoughtful expression than usual of course archie he said at length i am anxious to oblige you in all things but you must admit that this is a little serious oh yes i told you it was a sacrifice replied archie readily i would go myself only i have a strong reason for remaining in england may i ask that reason yes i want to find out who killed sir rupert youll never do that said toby shaking his head why my dear lad the police could find absolutely no clue the police beblessed retorted archie with contempt i am going on my own ideas in this matter and im going to get mrs belswin to help me but she knows nothing thats very likely but she saw sir rupert on the night of his murder and if she can recollect her conversation who knows but what some chance word in it might lead to the detection of the murderer besides mrs belswin is a very clever woman and in a case of this difficulty women see clearer than men why are you so anxious to find out this murder because i want to set kaitunas mind at rest the poor girl is worrying herself about the affair and if i can find out and punish the assassin of her father it will give her great relief there was again a short silence and then archie went on speaking you see now my dear lad why i wish you to help me in this i cannot do both things myself at the same time for if i go to melbourne the murderer of sir rupert may escape and if i stay and hunt for him the mine may turn out a success and no one will be there to look after kaitunas interests does kaituna know all your ideas asked toby thoughtfully yes and approves of them so does mrs belswin you see as she has been such a good friend to kaituna i had to tell her everything of course quite right responded toby heartily well old fellow ill tell you what some time ago the weekly scorpion spoke to me about taking a trip out to australia and writing up the colonies so if i accept that ill combine pleasure and business that would be capital said archie with a sigh of relief for to tell you the truth toby i was rather anxious about the money for you to go with kaituna has none i cant ask mrs belswin so i would have had to find it myself archibald maxwell said clendon wrathfully do you mean to say that you thought i would have been such a mean wretch as to let you find all the expenses of my voyage well i couldnt ask you to give your time and money also oh couldnt you dont be an ass old chap had i gone without the scorpion chips i would have halved the exs but this newspaper business cuts the gordion knot all i have got to do is to accept their offer and i shall get all my expenses paid and a jolly good price for my articles into the bargain which cash can go to hurry up my marriage well will you go as far as i can see at present yes replied toby quickly but i must speak to tommy and the pater they may object said maxwell dolefully oh no they wont retorted clendon gaily bless you a trip to australia is nothing nowadays i could do it on my head and i will too considering its at the antipodes archie rose to his feet with a sigh of relief im so glad there is a chance of your doing what i ask you he said gratefully it all depends upon the home authorities replied clendon judiciously but i think you can set your mind at rest old fellow ill go home tomorrow and wire you result of inquiries i think you can pretty well rely on everything being fixed up beautifully youre a good fellow toby i am i am my friends dont know half my virtues but about this detective business of yours archie im afraid you wont find out anything ill try at all events nothing is done without trying oh if youre going in for copybook maxims ive nothing more to say chapter xxii mrs belswin considers ways and means fortunes a jade when we dont require her she ever beside us is staying fortunes a jade for when we desire her she never responds to our praying mrs belswin was not a rich woman when she left her husband she took no money naturally supposing that silas p oates who played the part of corespondent in the divorce case would take care of her their romance however came to an end for the ladys temper being uncertain and the gentlemans income being equally so things went anything but smoothly so they parted where her quondam lover went mrs belswin neither knew nor cared but for her part she earned enough to keep her comfortable by becoming an opera singer she was a handsome woman with a fine voice and great dramatic powers so as time went on she took a first class position on the boards and therefore earned a great deal of money unfortunately being openhanded and careless in money matters she spent her income as she earned it and when she arrived in england in search of her daughter found herself very badly off of course owing to the peculiar position she held at thornstream she had received no salary as sir rupert was the only one who could pay her and when he saw her naturally the money question gave way to much more important matters after pethrams death mrs belswin had taken possession of kaituna with the intention of marrying her to maxwell but now found herself in london with a daughter to provide for and very little money in the bank ferrari certainly would have been delighted to have shared his salary with her but mrs belswin had always kept the italian at his distance and was determined not to give him any hold over her by being in his debt since leaving oates she had lived a decent life earning her own money and asking favours from no one so that although she had led a somewhat bohemian existence yet for the sake of her child she had kept herself pure reckless vehement careless as she was of all outward appearances no one could cast a stone at her in a moral sense and ferrari knowing this well respected her for it he had often pressed her to take money from him to be repaid by her marrying him but mrs belswin not being prepared to discharge her debts in this way had always refused even now when her daughter looked to her for support and but a few pounds stood between her and absolute want she never thought of asking ferrari for money and had he suspecting her needs offered it she would certainly have declined to take advantage of his generosity therefore to appeal to ferrari was out of the question but what about maxwell no mrs belswin had her daughters happiness too much at heart to jeopardise the girls future by an appeal to the purse of her future husband besides maxwell was not rich for she had heard him lament to toby clendon over his lack of money which made him an unacceptable soninlaw to sir rupert clearly therefore she could not ask archie of course there was dombrain no doubt if she asked him he would give her money but suppose he refused to assist her ah well then she could force him at this point of her meditations mrs belswin stopped could she force him it was questionable she did not like the way he looked at her over the dead body of her husband certainly she knew his secret and could damage his position in london which he prized so highly but then a worm will turn and if appearances were against her as they certainly were about the death of sir rupert he could make things very disagreeable for her formerly she would not have minded but would have dared him in her old reckless fashion trusting to her indomitable will to carry her through safely but now she had kaituna to think of as well as herself so she determined to leave mr dombrain alone ferrari maxwell dombrain she could ask none of the three to assist her and yet something must be done the terrible blow of her fathers death had left kaituna prostrate with grief and she looked to mrs belswin for every thing yes the daughter ignorant of the mothers personality depended upon the mother as she would have done had she known the truth and mrs belswin although concealing her real relationship acted towards her newlyrecovered daughter with the utmost tenderness still what about money there was the stage she could resume her profession but that would entail time to obtain an engagement and constant absence from kaituna who was not fitted in her present upset state of mind to be left alone so after going over all kinds of possibilities in her mind mrs belswin found herself at her wits end which way to turn for assistance coincidences happen in real life as well as in novels and it was a curious thing that mrs belswin should find in a society journal the name of silas p oates mentioned as staying at the langham hotel silas p oates millionaire most extraordinary he had arrived just in time for she could apply to him for money he was her old lover he was the man who had ruined her life he had deserted her shamefully but now he was rich and had a right to help her yes she would call on him at once and ask him for assistance for the sake of the deadandgone days he would not refuse so with a smile of satisfaction mrs belswin looked at the paper again mr silas p oates is accompanied by his wife and daughter oh he was married thenmarried and respectablewhile she was still tossing on the stormy waters of the bohemian ocean ah these men these men they always have the best of it they love and ruin and forsake a woman and then settle down into respectable members of society while the woman who has lost all for their sake is condemned for the rest of her life to be the sport of one sex and the scorn of the other still now that he was married she would certainly be able to obtain what she wished for he would not dare to refuse lest she should speak to his wife and destroy his happiness it never struck mrs belswin that to act in this way would be dishonourable she had been a freelance for so long and had been so accustomed in fighting her way through the world to use all kinds of weapons that the means she intended to employ to extort money from oates seemed quite legitimate many a woman would have died rather than have applied for help to the man who had basely deserted her but mrs belswin her moral sense blunted by constantly battling with the stormy world not only intended to get money from her old lover but intended to apply that money to secure the happiness of her innocent daughter here is a text for the preacher on human nature does the end in this instance justify the means strange things are done in this world of ours but surely nothing more fantastical or shameful entered a womans mind than to use her former disgrace as a means to secure her daughters ease and peace of mind and yet mrs belswin could not see itdid not see itand made up her mind to call on silas p oates the next day and not leave him until she had his cheque for a considerable amount in her purse today however archie was coming in order to tell them about toby clendons proposed mission to australia and kaituna was seated at the window watching for his coming while mrs belswin pondered over the problem of silas p oates it was a dull little sittingroom in a dull little house in a dull little neighbourhood but then the aforesaid neighbourhood was eminently respectable and that satisfied mrs belswin in her dread lest her daughter should be tainted by bohemianism mrs belswin had gone to the opposite extreme and with the assistance of archie taken lodgings in a severely respectable quarter where church bells rang every other hour of the day and nothing less genteel than a fourwheeler was ever seen in the dingy street their abode was situated in grail street which was so deserted that it put the reflective in mind of london during the plague especially as a hearse was no uncommon sight owing to the undertakers wilps co high class pauper furnishers being at the corner all the houses were sadlooking in keeping with the corner establishment and kaitunas face was sad also as she looked out on to the lonely road on which fell the fine rain dressed in black with her hands lying listlessly in her lap and her face thin and worn with trouble kaituna looked a very different girl in the dingy london lodging from what she had been at thornstream mrs belswin thought so as she glanced at her after answering the money question and went across to her with a look of anxiety on her face kaituna my dearest do not look so sad she said tenderly bending over the girl you make me feel so terribly anxious kaituna pushed her thick hair wearily off her forehead and sighed deeply i cannot help looking sad she replied listlessly i feel sad a few months ago and i was so happy now everything is taken away from me not everything dear you have still me you echoed kaituna with a wan smile taking the elder womans hand ah mrs belswin what should i have done without you my good angel dont call me a good angel dear said mrs belswin hurriedly i am not good god help me had i been good things would have been different i dont know what you refer to replied kaituna simply stroking the hand she held all i know is that you have been good to me without you i should have died you are my only friend you forget archie said mrs belswin with an attempt at lightness no i dont forget him good kind fellow but mrs belswin i cannot hold him to his promise i am poor now it will be unfair for me to drag him down i must go away i cannot stay to be a burden on youa burden on him you must let me go where asked mrs belswin quietly i dont know i will get the position of governess somewhere mrs valpy will recommend me she knows what i can do then you wish to leave me said mrs belswin reproachfully no i do not but how can i ask you to keep me like this youa stranger a stranger said mrs belswin with a strange smile my dear you must not look upon me as a stranger i told you my story onceabout my little child now you stand to me in that childs place i love you like a daughter if you left me i should go mad leave me no kaituna you must notyou shall not leave me promise that you will always stay beside me the vehemence of the woman frightened kaituna unnerved as she was by what she had gone through and she shrank back in alarm dear mrs belswin oh cried the woman walking up and down the room with tears streaming down her face for you to go awayto leave me after all that i have suffered you do not know what you say you call me a stranger i am a stranger yes i am mrs belswin who was your hired servant but i love you kaituna like a daughter you will not leave meoh my child you will not leave me she flung herself on her knees beside the girl and looked up into her eyes with a fierce intensity of gaze that moved the girl strangely no i will not leave you since you wish me not to she said gently but indeed mrs belswin i dont deserve such love mrs belswin covered the hand she held with kisses and sobbed hysterically then the strange creature suddenly dried her eyes and rose to her feet with a smile on her lips it was the savage nature all over one moment all fury the next calm and smiling she never controlled herself in any way but let her natural moods and fancies have full play so the result was bizarre and rather terrifying to a more civilised nature by this time however kaituna perhaps from a secret chord of sympathy inherited from her savage progenitors was beginning to understand mrs belswins whirlwinds of passion and sudden transitions from storm to calm therefore when the present outburst was over the two women chatted together quite easily as if nothing unusual had occurred but of one thing i am certain said kaituna after a pause that it is not right for me to marry archie at present i am poor so is he and i cannot consent to drag him down with me my dear you are too fine in your ideas said mrs belswin with a superior smile archie maxwell loves you and if you refused to marry him it would break his heart besides perhaps the pole star shares will be worth a lot of money im afraid not its no use building up hopes on those ah my poor father he thought to make me an heiress but he has only made me a pauper my poor poor father was he not a noble man mrs belswin yes dear yes but you forget i only had a short interview with him i remember on the night he diedthe night that he was murdered oh if i could only discover who killed him but i can do nothing i am only a woman and have no money to employ any one so he must lie in his grave unavenged oh who will help me the answer came in an unexpected manner from the servant opening the door and announcing mr maxwell curious murmured mrs belswin that is the second coincidence today chapter xxiii better leave well alone when things to outward view are smooth tis wisest to disturb them not restrain the prying eye of youth when things to outward view are smooth for should ye seek to learn the truth much evil may by chance be wrought when things to outward view are smooth tis wisest to disturb them not when he entered the room archie looked very pleased and a trifle excited which happy demeanour was noticed at once by mrs belswin good news she asked as he greeted her and walked over to kaituna with the eager step of an expectant lover very good news he replied gaily the best of news toby is going out to australia to look after your fortune kaituna my fortune echoed kaituna faintly raising her eyes to his bright face im afraid my fortune is a myth not at all not at all replied maxwell kissing her pale cheek your fortune at present is not in the clouds but in the earth and when the pole star company find that rich lode they are now looking for you will be a female croesus i hope so for your sake i hope so for both your sakes said mrs belswin bluntly and then there will be no more talk of breaking off the engagement what our engagement cried maxwell in an astonished tone looking from the one to the other why what do you mean ask donna quixota there my dear mr maxwell she has been talking the highflown nonsense which the virtuous heroine uses on the stage when she appeals to the gallery she knows you love her for herself alone and that i cannot live without her yet she talks about leaving us both on some absurd scruple of honour my dear kaituna you are surely not in earnest said archie smoothing the girls dark hair mrs belswin is jesting i suppose no she is repeating my words in a slightly different way but kaituna now you are going to begin a discussion said mrs belswin goodhumouredly so i will leave you for a time but first mr maxwell tell me about your friend you say he is going out to melbourne yes i got a letter from him today miss valpy and his father are both agreeable and he starts by one of the orient line in a fortnight but the money said mrs belswin in some dismay thinking of her straightened means what about the money oh that is all right answered maxwell in a satisfied tone providence has tempered the financial wind to the clendon lamb he is going to write a series of articles on australian cities for the weekly scorpion so the benevolent editor of that paper pays his expenses oh said mrs belswin with a sigh of relief turning towards the door im so glad its a good omen for the silver mine i hope hell come back as prosperous as he leaves now im going away for a few minutes so ill leave you mr maxwell to convince kaituna that things will turn out better than she expects when mrs belswin vanished archie took kaituna by the chin and turned her face towards his own you wicked young woman he said laughing how can you speak even in jest about leaving me kaituna rose to her feet and walked backwards and forwards several times in deep thought then she paused before archie and looked steadily at him with her clear honest eyes archie she said at length believe me i did not speak without reason while my father was alive there was a chance of our marrying for i would have persuaded him to consent some time and mrs belswin would have helped me but he is dead and i have not a penny in the world how then can i marry you who have nothing but your profession to depend upon and that profession one which means constant travelling if you married me you would have to leave me for we should not be rich enough to travel together you would find me a drag upon you enough for one is not enough for two i love you you know i love you and it is for that very reason that i want to break off our engagement and not be a burden to you in the future maxwell laughed as she ended this long speech and seizing her hands drew her towards him what a capital lawyer you would make he said with an indulgent smile but let us look on the other side of the question say that these shares turn out to be worth a lot of money will you expect me to give you up no no oh no ah you see then that the case is the same with me you love me for myself i love you for yourself it is no question of money between us with you as my wife i would work hard i shall only be too proud to work for you we shall not be rich but we should be happy no my dearest i should indeed be unworthy of your love did i look at the future from your point of view i love you you are mine and rich or poor we will always be together but but me no buts said maxwell in a peremptory tone putting his arm round her neck you know what i say is right you love me do you not yes and you will never leave me kaituna kissed him with tears in her eyes no i will never leave you archie pressed her to his heart with a cry of joy and at this moment mrs belswin entered well young people i have explained away all objections said maxwell as kaituna withdrew her arms from his neck and we are going to marry on nothing a year meanwhile said mrs belswin satirically meanwhile echoed maxwell rising i am going to speak to you for a few minutes and then take kaituna for a walk in the park youll take compassion on a lonely bachelor will you not dearest yes ill go and put on my things at once said kaituna whose face now looked much brighter than before archie yes i am afraid youll be a dreadful tyrant when i marry you she laughed and ran out of the room whereat maxwell also laughed out of sympathy but when the door closed the laugh died away on his lips and he turned gravely to mrs belswin who had resumed her seat well said that lady with a half smile glancing at him you look as gloomy as a november day what are you thinking about sir ruperts death mrs belswin half expected this reply but notwithstanding gave a sudden start at the abruptness of his speech you are still determined to find out the cause of his death she said slowly i dont think there is any question on that point he replied with emphasis he was shot and i want to find out who shot him what good will that do it will set kaitunas mind at rest his listener played with the plain gold ring on her fingerthe ring which had been the symbol of her marriage with the murdered manand frowned if i were you id let sleeping dogs lie she said at length without raising her eyes no i will not see here mrs belswin i know quite well that kaituna is anxious to find out the murderer of her father if she does not it will embitter her whole life she cannot bear to think of him lying unavenged in his grave herself she can do nothing but i her promised husband can im afraid you overcalculate your powers as a detective perhaps i do he answered calmly but im going to try at all events and see if i can unravel this mystery did i intend to let sleeping dogs lie as you phrase it i would have gone out to australia myself to look after the silver mines but as clendon has taken that trouble off my hands i am going to devote myself to finding out the man who murdered sir rupert he spoke with such determination that she felt convinced he would carry out his intention and fidgeted about in her seat for a few moments then walking to the window stood looking out into the dull street while she made her next remark i dont think it will do any good where the police have failed you cannot hope to succeed i hope to do so with your help my help she echoed facing round suddenly so that her back was to the light and her face comparatively in the shadow what can i tell you mrs belswin said maxwell gravely you were one of the last people who saw sir rupert alive yes that is so she answered without moving a muscle but i told all i knew at the inquest i suppose you did but can you think of nothing else she looked at him with a piercing glance as if trying to read his soul but saw nothing that could make her think that he suspected her in any way of being connected with the murdered man i told all i knew at the inquest she repeated i had an interview with sir rupert about your marriage with kaituna he refused his consent and i left the study kaituna had gone to bed with a bad headache so i did not wish to make it worse by my ill news therefore i retired to rest at once and knew nothing more until the next morning you heard no pistol shot none strange said maxwell thoughtfully no one seems to have heard a pistol shot and yet such an unusual thing must have attracted attention you forget that sir ruperts study was some distance away from the sleeping apartments and i think at the time he was killed every one was in bed but he was not shot in the room but from the terrace mrs belswin started again how do you know that i dont know it i only presume so the body was found lying half in and half out of the window so my theory is that sir rupert came to the open window for a breath of air and the assassin concealed in the shadow of the terrace shot him through the head its a very excellent theorystill it is only theory yes i know that said maxwell ruefully you dont know if sir rupert had any enemies mrs belswin i why i did not even know sir rupert himself until i spoke to him that night in his study there was no doubt that mrs belswin was a magnificent actress for she uttered this lie without the least hesitation no of course not answered maxwell after a pause i know he was a stranger to you still he must have had enemies i wonder if kaituna could tell me ask her no i wont it will only upset her she is so agitated over the whole affair ill go and see the detective who had the case in hand and i wont tell kaituna anything until i can say this is the murderer of your father its a wildgoose chase perhaps still something may be discovered at this moment kaituna returned dressed for walking and after bidding fare well to mrs belswin archie went out with his sweetheart leaving the chaperon still standing by the window mrs belswin twisted her hands together and looked at the carpet with an angry frown something maybe discovered she repeated in a thoughtful tone i dont think so the assassin came out of the night fulfilled his mission and disappeared again into the night not all the machinery of the law could find out the truth and where the law failed i dont think youll succeed archibald maxwell chapter xxiv a memory of the past i the present becomes the future yes but the present does not again become the past time goes forward foreverwe cannot return on his footsteps for the laws of the universe are unalterable unchangeable and fixed ii yet when i see you before me i am inclined to doubt all that has existed since the shaping of the earth from chaos for you appear as you did in those fardistant days when love and sin made up the sum of our lives iii phantom vanish again into the darkness from whence my memory hath called thee as a god i have recreated theeas a god i condemn thee to disappear i live the present the futurebut the past i will not renew lest such phantoms as you should turn the past into the present in a private sittingroom of the langham hotel sat mr silas p oates of new york city millionaire who had come to england with his wife and daughter to spend his money secure a titled husband for his only child and look round generally he had made his money in a somewhat unexpected way by sundry dealings in stocks and shares besides which he had bought a clever invention cheaply of the inventora poor manand by dint of dexterous advertising and persistent pushing had boomed it into a big success a farseeing man was mr oates none too scrupulous who regarded his fellowmen as so many sheep to be shorn of their rich fleece but he always kept to the letter if not the spirit of the law and therefore regarded himself as a keen business man who had made his enormous fortune honestly all his little knavish tricks his taking advantage of his fellowcreatures when they were in difficulties and his unscrupulous unblushing lying he designated under the collective name of business and however scandalous his dealings might appear to god they certainly appeared legitimate to his brother business men who mostly acted the same way therefore silas was called a sharp business man all his twistings and turnings and chicanery and sailing close to the wind went to pile up the dollars and however he might have ruined less clever men than himself however he imposed gulled and swindled the public he was generally admitted in the land of freedom to be a cute man who was a worthy representative of the great god mammon charity according to the bible covers a multitude of sins but money occupies a much higher place nowadays in the covering process and all the doubtful ways by which he had acquired his fortune disappeared in the eyes of the condoning world under the golden cover of the fortune itself this worthy product of the nineteenth century was a short thin active little man with a parchmentcoloured skin dark hair moustache beard eyebrows and eyes and a quick delicate restlessness about him like a brighteyed bird he was dressed neatly in a quiet gray suit wore no jewellery not even a watchchain and was always on the alert to see something to his advantage outwardly he was a quiet respectable decent little fellow who as the saying goes would not harm a fly inwardly he was an astute blackguard who called his evil doing business who always kept well within the law and had dethroned the deity in favour of himself his past was bad and tricky so much so that it would hardly bear looking into by a man with a conscience but even though mr oates had no conscience he did not indulge much in retrospection not that he dreaded remorse but simply looked upon such dreaming as a waste of time at present he was perfectly happy he had made a lot of money he had a pretty wife for whom he cared nothing a charming daughter for whom he cared a great deal and was now going to show the old world what the new world could do in the way of making a splash it was a very enviable frame of mind to be in and one quite beyond the reach of an honest man who would have been disturbed at the memory of how he had made his money but silas only thought how pleasant it was he had made so much money for the making of which he had to thank no onenot even god who in his inexplicable mercy permitted this gilded worm to reap the golden reward of a life of legitimate legalised rascality mr oates therefore was happy and thought no one could upset that happiness in any way but he found out his mistake when the waiter brought in a card inscribed mrs belswin well sir drawled silas looking doubtfully at the card this lady wants to look me up yes sir mrs belswin soliloquised the american in deep thought i cant fix her nohow ask the lady to step this way yes sir the alert active waiter disappeared and mr oates pondered he did not know the name he had only arrived in england the previous day and was unacquainted with any one what then did this strange lady want with him luckily mrs hatty k oates had gone out shopping with her daughter else the situation might have been awkward for silas whose domestic hearthstone was not quite free from connubial rows caused by jealousy his wife however was away and would not be home for the next few hours so mr oates feeling rather curious as to the business of his fair visitor was by no means sorry that he had a chance of passing his afternoon in feminine society his visitor entered the room heralded by the waiter then the latter retired closing the door carefully after him leaving the pair alone the lady was dressed in black and wore a heavy crape veil which suggested mourning to the astute silas and after he had gathered as much as he was able from a keen glance at this draped veiled figure he politely placed a chair for her you wish to see me madam he asked resuming his own seat i do for a few minutes i am an old friend of yours mrs belswins voice was muffled by the veil and moreover silas had not heard it for nearly twenty years so he did not recognise his visitor in the least and was considerably puzzled by the concluding part of her speech an old friend he said doubtfully smoothing his chin from the states yes down frisco way oh mr oates started he had many acquaintances down frisco way but they could hardly be called friends as they very much disapproved of his method of doing business ive got an eye for faces said silas in a jaunty manner so if you put up that veil ive no doubt i can fix you im afraid i shall startle you im not easily startled madam my nerves are in good working order are they then ill put them to the test mrs belswin suddenly threw back her veil and bent forward so that her face was in the strong light whereupon silas gave a whoop like a wild indian bounded from his chair and gasped im afraid you overestimate the working order of your nerves silas said mrs belswin scoffingly and then leaning back in her chair waited for mr oates to make the next move in the game great scott its mrs pethram i thought you were dead and wished it too ive no doubt said mrs belswin bitterly well are you not glad to see me no replied silas truthfully im uncommon sorry ah youve learned to speak the truth since i saw you last observed the lady raising her eyebrows otherwise youre not much changed the same ugly little monkey with whom i ran away from new zealand ive often wondered why i did run away with you pursued mrs belswin with charming candour and now i see you again i wonder more than ever silas grinned in an uneasy manner he would have preferred her to be less cool to pay more deference to his position but she seemed as candid as ever and he almost expected to have something damaging flung at his head as had been her custom in the old days it was a very disagreeable position so silas rose to the occasion and immediately set to work to emulate her coolness and find out how he could circumvent this unwelcome visitor from the past i see youre still in the vinegar line he said easily resuming his seat i guess you did turn me over for a bit it takes a pretty stiff dose to do that but this time youve raised cain proper they were delightfully amiable to one another the more so as a feeling of distrust pervaded the whole conversation but as mrs belswin wanted to waste no time in case the wife of her former lover should turn up she opened fire at once i dare say youre surprised to see me its no good beating round the bush im surprised and sorry youll be sorrier before ive done with you hello what are y going to show your teeth about nothing if youll do what i ask see here mrs pethram said silas leaning forward with his shrewd sharp foxy face its no good your tryin to play low on me ive cut my eye teeth i can tell you you think youve got the whip hand of me thats as i take it well you can drop that dodge i ran off with you to frisco cause i was a born fool i did love you only you were more like a redskin than a civilised woman we agreed to part company twenty years ago and ive kept my part of the contract ive gone right along in the money line and this time ive come home on the winner im married and straight now and i dont want no one to put things wrong between my wife and me as youre an old friend ill act square by you if its money but if its blackmail your looking after its no go and youd better believe it mrs belswin was in all things a headstrong impulsive woman without any craft or power to disguise her feelings she had come to oates with the fullest intention of threatening to tell his wife their former relations if he refused to give her money but here was her adversary calmly placing the whole of her nefarious scheme before her and she felt completely nonplussed oates on the other hand was so accustomed to trickery that mrs belswin was a mere child in his hands and the course he was now adopting was certainly the only means by which he could hope to checkmate her well madam said silas triumphantly seeing his plain speaking had taken mrs belswin aback what do you say mrs belswin acted like a fool lost her temper and stormed you despicable little wretch she said starting to her feet with her eyes blazing with anger how dare you speak to me like this was it not for your sake that i lost my husband my good name my position in the world and yet you dare to taunt me with it you are now rich married and respectable i on the other hand am pooryes poor otherwise my life for these last twenty years has been above reproach oh you may laugh you judge me by yourself but i tell you since i left you i have led a decent life the reason i refuse to tell you now hear what i have to say i would not have come to you unless it was a case of dire necessity i hate you too much to have ever desired to set eyes on you again but i was compelled to come because i want money give me a cheque for and i wont trouble you again refuse and ill tell your wife all will you indeed sneered silas mockingly dont try the blackmailing game for you wont bounce a cent out of me thats so mrs pethram my wife knows all about you i told her all when i was married thats a lie said mrs belswin fiercely i dont believe it i reckon its true though i wont take your word for it so ill ask your wife shell be here at threeforty you can wait it was all bravado on the part of oates as he was in deadly fear lest his wife should come in and learn all true this discreditable connection had taken place before his marriage but mrs oates would not take that fact into consideration and would make things very unpleasant for him with all his cleverness and craft silas was a coward at heart so as mrs belswin sat there evidently determined to await the arrival of his wife he skirmished round in order to find out some weak spot in her armour by which he could beat her had he betrayed fear mrs belswin would have at once perceived that she had the advantage but he did nothing but sit smiling before her and all she could do in her mad rage was to tell all to mrs oates thereby cutting her own throat and benefiting nothing by revelation say queried mr oates airily why dont you look up pethram he is dead is that so said oates somewhat startled died in new zealand i guess no he didnt he died in england what did you kill him for it was simply an idle malicious question as silas never for a moment dreamed that the husband and wife had met or that there had been anything strange about the husbands death foolish mrs belswin never thinking flashed out at once on the impulse of the moment quite forgetting that she was putting a sword into her enemys hand i didnt kill him how dare you say so no one knows who murdered him silas jumped up from his seat with an exclamation of surprise as his apparently idle question had evidently drawn forth something important oh he was murdered then didnt you know said mrs belswin haughtily when you spoke to me like that i know nothing returned silas coolly i only spoke because i know if you had met pethram in one of your fiendish tempers you would have put a knife in him mrs belswin saw that she had raised a suspicion in the mind of silas so was now careful as to what she said youre talking at random pethram is dead and some one shot him i dont know who you can see all about it in the papers silas made no answer as he was thinking owing to mrs belswins unsuspicious nature he had learned a very important fact which might possibly lead to his circumventing her demands for money so he made up his mind at once how to act and acted see here he said goodhumouredly pulling out his chequebook ill do what i can for you tell my wife or not if you like but now if five hundred dollars are of any use ill give you that lot straight off five hundred dollars said mrs belswin coollyone hundred pounds well that will do in the meantime but im to have the rest next week or ill make things hot for you silas the american had his own opinion on the subject but with his habitual craft said nothing filling up the cheque he gave it to mrs belswin who took it without a word of thanks and put it in her purse ive made it payable to mrs belswin said oates thats your last name i guess it has been my name ever since i left you in frisco retorted mrs belswin fiercely you need not insinuate that i have been leading a bad life ive no doubt my past would bear more looking into than yours youve the same old style i see said silas insolently all gunpowder and dynamite well i guess that now youve got what you came for youll get as you elegantly phrase it ill get rejoined the lady letting down her veil but let me hear from you next week about the rest of the money or ill come and interview your wife oh ill write you straight answered silas with a peculiar smile as he accompanied her to the door goodbye mrs pethrambeg pardon mrs belswin neither correct sir said his visitor jeeringly my lady pethram silas closed the door after her with a smile which faded from his face when he found himself alone lady pethram he echoed thoughtfully i reckon then that pethram got his handle well now id better look after that murder case and then ill fix that shedevil right along the line having thus made up his mind he sent for a file of the daily telegraph of the previous month and went steadily to work to read up the thornstream case which he had no difficulty in finding he also discovered the address of a private inquiry office and at once wrote a letter instructing them to send him a detective this business being concluded he lighted a cigar rubbed his dry lean hands together and chuckled two can always play at a game my lady he muttered but this time i guess youll stand out chapter xxv silas plays his little game tis very hard to play the game of life for tho you keep your eye upon the board and move your puppets in wellthoughtout ways just when the winning seems within your grasp some pawn is touched by stealthyfingered chance and straight the wouldbe victor looses all in his dingy office sat mr dombrain before his desk in deep thought and judging from the frown on his coarse face his thoughts were not of the pleasantest he bit his hard nails he pulled at his stubbly red moustache drummed on the table with his large hairy hands and in fact displayed all the symptoms of a man very much disturbed in his mind the cause of this disturbance was mrs belswin and seeing that he was alone mr dombrain for the moment threw off his professional suavity and cursed the lady heartily had she been present she would have laughed at his outburst of wrath but as she had just left the room he was free to make as rude remarks as he pleased and he certainly took full advantage of his solitude the wrath of mrs belswin and the subsequent flattening out of mr dombrain arose out of the following circumstance the lawyer seeing that kaituna had been left penniless except for certain shares which he truly assured her were not worth the paper they were written on had in a spirit of philanthropy offered to buy those shares off her at his own pricewhich was a very small oneso that miss pethram would have something to live on he wrote a lettera generous and noble letter from his point of viewin which he offered to take these undesirable shares in the pole star mining company off her hands at a great sacrifice to himself and mrs belswin had answered the letter on behalf of kaituna in person as she was a lady who never minced matters however unpleasant and moreover never exercised any selfcontrol mr dombrain had rather a bad time of it for a quarter of an hour he had seen that phrase in a french novel but had never thoroughly understood its significance until mrs belswin illustrated it to him in her own graphic manner she saidoh he hardly remembered what she said except that she used the word swindler pretty often and made several pointed allusions to the disgrace of an exconvict exercising an honourable profession in london mr dombrain could have said something rather disagreeable to her which would certainly have shut her up but this modern xantippe gave him no opportunity of saying a word she came she saw she raged stormed crushed conquered and finally departed in a whirlwind of passion telling him that clendon was going to look after the shares in melbourne and that if he dared to try any tricks on her she wouldshe would mr dombrain shivered when he thought of what she said she would do now however that she was out of the room and he had collected his thoughts scattered by her terrific onslaught he began to think and after several minutes of thinking and frowning he grinned not a pleasant grin by any manner of meansa nasty mephistophelean grin that boded ill to his adversary she had been unpleasant to him well he could now be unpleasant to her and in a way she wouldnt like he constructed a little scheme in his head which he thought would answer his purpose and was about to make a few notes relative to the same when a card was brought in to him silas p oates mr dombrain shivered and had the clerk not been present he would have sworn as it was however he merely told the clerk to show the gentleman in and then trembled at the thought of this second phantom of the past which had succeeded to mrs belswin she knew about his little mistake in new zealand so also did mr oates and mr dombrain groaned in dismay as he thought of the double chance of exposure now threatening him did the american come as a friend as an enemy or in ignorance dombrain hoped the first dreaded the second but felt pretty confident that the third was the americans state of mind as he certainly would never connect dombrain the solicitor with damberton the convict however it would be decided in another minute so mr dombrain smoothed his hair imposed a nervous grin on his mouth and waited the advent of this second bogie with inward fear but outward calm the millionaire entered quite unaware of the second shock which awaited him for his purpose in seeking out mr dombrain was wholly unconnected with the idea that he would find an old friend the fact is mr oates had read the thornstream case had noticed that mrs belswin was mixed up with it and had sought out mr dombrainwhose name was also in the paperswith the idea of finding out the precise position held by mrs belswin in the house of her former husband sir ruperts solicitor could tell him this if it was drawn from him artfully mr dombrain was sir ruperts solicitor so to mr dombrain came the wary silas wholly ignorant of what awaited him silas did not notice dombrain particularly at first but sat down in the chair beside the table and cast about for some good idea wherewith to begin an extremely awkward conversation dombrain saw that he was not recognised so kept his face in the shadow as much as possible and spoke in a low gruff voice as if his throat was stuffed with cotton wool i have called sir observed mr oates after a preliminary cough to speak to you about the late sir rupert pethram yes you sir i understand were his lawyer is that so that is so replied dombrain unconsciously dropping into the americanisms of the speaker a friend of mine sir pursued mr oates after another pause was connected i believe with the deceased i allude sir to mrs belswin mrs belswin the name so startled dombrain that he forgot his intention of keeping his identity concealed from his visitor and speaking in his natural voice started forward so that his face was clearly seen by silas now mr oates in addition to his many other gifts for getting the better of his fellow creatures possessed a remarkably retentive memory in the matter of faces and in spite of the alteration mr dombrain had made in his appearance recognised him at once this time his nerves did not belie the reputation he gave them and after a slight start he leaned back in his chair with a slight dry smile i opinionate remarked silas reflectively that ive been on your tracks before no it was continued silas without taking any notice of the denial it was in new zealand sir dunedin was the city a healthy gaol sir according to the guide books i dont know what youre talking about said dombrain doggedly resuming his seat i never saw you before and im a stranger to you dombrain is a stranger i confess said silas fixing his clear eyes on the sullen face of the man before him but i can size up the party called damberton without much trouble i reckon i can tell you a story about him mr dombrain if you want particulars no no said dombrain hoarsely wiping his forehead its no use beating about the bush i am damberton but now im quite respectable you surely are not going to im goin to do nothin sir you aint upsettin my applecart no sir thats a fact anyhow then what do you want me to do for you asked dombrain with a sigh of relief well now replied silas thoughtfully thats just what ive got to find out mrs belswinhey do you know who mrs belswin is yes the shedevil pethrams wife she was here half an hour ago is that so i say you aint playin in the same yard i guess not much when you call her names i hate her said dombrain fiercely she is the curse of my life i reckon shes been raisin cain here observed silas shrewdly well that aint any of my business but shes been tryin the same game on with me now im a quiet man sir and i dont want no catamount spittin round my front door so i want you to put the set on that lady what can i do ive been readin your noospapers sir they cant scream like the american eagle not much but i read all about that shootin case and i see you were waltzin round hey mrs pethram wasnt far off neither i guess no she was companion to miss pethram well you do surprise me sir i spose her daughter didnt rise to the fact that mrs belswin was her mamma no she knew nothing mrs belswin obtained the situation while sir rupert pethram was absent when he returned she had an interview with him and and he passed in his cheques concluded silas musingly queer thing that anyhow you dont think began dombrain hastily when silas interrupted him promptly i dont think at all he said rising and putting on his hat i dont want to think compoundin a felony isnt in my line nohow but surely sir oates who had turned away faced round suddenly with a sharp look in his foxy face which made dombrain feel somewhat ill at ease see here mister he said slowly mrs belswins been round at my hotel tryin to get dollars i gave her five hundred and now this banks shut she gets no more i guess this fall because youll tell her shes not to come gavortin round my claim no more but i cant stop her no said silas interrogatively i guess you can see here mr damberton i know what you arenone better and thats straight you know what mrs belswin is and if she plays low on you sir just ask her where she got the little gun to fix up things with her husband but she didnt kill him silas laughed disbelievingly i dont know nothin of that game sir its a cut beyond me and thats a fact all i say is that if mrs belswin comes on the warpath to my ranch ill tell some things about mr damberton that mr dombrain wont smile at you take me sir i fancy yes said dombrain slowly while the great drops of sweat gathered on his forehead i understand bully for you replied mr oates in a friendly tone going to the door goodmornin sir im pleased to see you again its like the old days and thats a fact mr oates sauntered out with his hands in his pockets and dombrain flung himself in his chair and burying his face in his hands sobbed like a child my god he sobbed passionately am i to lose all after these years chapter xxvi vae victis those who went forth in brave array return again at the close of day with tattered banners that flaunted gay and swords now broken that once could slay their march is sad and slow oh sorrow for those who could not die who lionhearted were forced to fly and now for ever in chains must lie for hark there rises the terrible cry woe to the vanquished woe when mrs belswin received a letter from mr dombrain asking her to call she was considerably astonished as she had thought her last interview with him would have pretty well resigned him to the loss of her society but evidently he was now throwing down the gage of battle so mrs belswin like an old warhorse at the sound of a trumpet felt a certain exultation at the thought of the coming fight and lost no time in assenting to the request of the solicitor what he wanted to see her about she could not imagine unless it was to make another offer for the pole star shares and as she had already set his mind at rest on that point it seemed ridiculous to think that he would waste his time in trying to encompass the impossible she was now quite at ease in her own mind regarding money matters as the hundred pounds she had obtained from silas together with what she already had in the bank would enable her and kaituna to live in comfort for the next three or four months in an economical way of course she quite expected to be in possession of the other four hundred the next week which would place them in affluence until the report of toby came home about the pole star shares and judging from the offer made by dombrain mrs belswin with feminine acuteness guessed that the shares were more valuable than they now appeared to be so that their sale in a few months would realise a decent sum for kaituna if this turned out to be the case mrs belswin intended to persuade kaituna to marry archie at once and the future of her child being thus secured she cared little for herself she could certainly marry herself as both ferrari and belk were devoted to her but she despised the first for his cowardice in the matter of removing her husband and the latter in spite of his good looks was of too lowly a station for her to think seriously of in any way since her departure from thornstream belk had written to her several timesardent passionate letters which showed plainly how deeply in love he was with her and mrs belswin could not but feel a thrill of pride at the thought of her own attractions even at the mature age of fortyfive at present however she had more important things to think of than marriage and drove along to dombrains office in a puzzled state of mind trying to think of the reason why he wanted to see her so that she could be prepared to hold her own that silas had stolen a march on her she never for a moment dreamed and had she guessed the real object of the interview sought by mr dombrain she would doubtless have felt somewhat ill at ease as it was however she knew nothing and thus ignorance being bliss she walked boldly into the dingy office and took her accustomed seat with her usual defiant air dombrain himself was rather nervous although he now assumed a bullying manner towards the woman he was afraid of she had held a power over him which had hitherto precluded him from talking to her as he would have wished but now he had discovered something about her life which gave him the advantage and he determined to use his power to insult sneer and crush her in fact treat her in the same way as she had hitherto treated him in spite of her violent temper her foolish impulses mrs belswin was not without a certain amount of feminine cunning and as she was quite in the dark concerning the object of the interview and moreover did not like the illconcealed look of triumph on the part of the solicitor she held her tongue waiting for him to begin the attack so that a chance word might afford her an opportunity of fathoming his motives well mrs belswin said dombrain with a nasty grin on his coarselooking face and how are you today after your conduct in our last interview mrs belswin looked him up and down in a sneeringly insolent manner which made him writhe i think i ought to ask that question she said disdainfully considering that i left you crushed like the little reptile you are oh no none of those compliments if you please last time you had it all your own way this time i have it all mine two can play at every game yes but one generally holds trumps this time i hold trumps do you play cards mrs belswin if so you know that the game is to the player with the strongest hand i congratulate you on your knowledge of gambling and may i ask what you are talking about all in good time mrs belswinall in good time first and foremost i wish to know about your visit to silas oates ah you start at that you are not quite so confident as you were at our last interview i think you are mistaken replied mrs belswin coldly there can be nothing to interest you in my interview with mr oates if you fancy your knowledge that i called on him makes me afraid you were never further from the truth in your life i am not to be terrified by an exconvict it was the old threat that had formerly reduced mr dombrain to silence but now it appeared to have lost its power for the exconvict leaned back in his chair and laughed insolently people who live in glass houses should not throw stones what do you mean exactly what i say you seem to have been at your private whiskeybottle said mrs belswin rising impatiently but as i am not in the mood to listen to your drunken ravings i will go oh no you wont of course you can if you like but you had better hear what i have to say i will give you five minutes replied mrs belswin resuming her seat no more that will be enough now just listen to me mr oates has called and informed me of your attempt to blackmail him you have got one hundred pounds and he says he will not give you any more that is a question that has nothing to do with you sir oh yes it has retorted dombrain coolly he asked me to stop you from calling on him again and i intend to do so mrs belswin laughed long and loudly do you indeed and may i ask how you intend to stop me mr dombrain leaned across the desk glanced round to make sure they were alone then whispered slowly by asking you how you killed your husband she sprang to her feet with a pale face her eyes flashing fiercely its a lie you know i had nothing to do with it im afraid a jury wouldnt take that view if they heard my evidence your evidence the evidence of a felon thats a pretty name but instead of abusing me youd better look after yourself mrs belswin sat down again and spoke deliberately i dont know what your object is in talking like this but i will take it as a favour if you will let me know precisely how you connect me with my late husbands death you say i killed him you hint you can prove it thats a lie because if that was the case i should be in prison now no no mr damberton you are not the man to spare a woman certainly not you who have made my life a hell for the last few months we can exchange these compliments afterwards first your story dombrain who was growing weary of all this fencing lost no time in responding to this request and began at once as you know i was staying at thornstream on the night you arrived ostensibly i had come down to see sir rupert on business but my real motive was to see how you intended to meet him you did not appear at dinner and i thought you would put off the interview until the next day i was tired with my days work and was about to retire to rest when i saw you descending the stairs upon which i hid myself lest you should see me coward ejaculated mrs belswin disdainfully no i was no coward but had i been foolish enough to have spoken to you in one of your paroxysms of anger you might have revealed my true position to sir rupert out of spite mrs belswin thought how she had really done this and how ignorant the man before her was of his narrow escape from exposurean exposure only prevented by the death of pethram therefore resumed dombrain coldly i hid myself but i watched the door of the study you entered there and the door was closed a long time passedthe servants put out the lights shut up the house and retired to rest miss pethram i have learned since retired early on account of a headache and as the whole thornstream household kept country hours by the time the clock struck tenthe hall clock i am speaking ofall the house was asleep except you sir rupert and myself the halfhour sounded still you had not left the studythe threequarters struck but the door was still closed i waited and waited and wondered eleven sounded from the clock in the hall and at a few minutes past the door opened and you appeared pale and ghastly like a guilty spectre closing the door softly after you with a furtive look round lest some one should be watching you fled upstairs brushed past me and went into your bedroom this was all i wanted to see i knew you had met your husband that he had not turned you out of the house so never dreaming that you had committed a crime to screen your real self i went to bed next morning he flung open his arms with a dramatic gesture quite in keeping with the stagey way in which he had told the story and became silent with his small eyes viciously fastened on the unfortunate woman before him she was sitting like an image of stone pale and still with tightly compressed lips and a lurid fire burning in her fierce eyes only the nervous working of her hands lying in her lap betrayed her deep agitation and when he had finished she looked at him with a smile of disdain and you saw all this wonderful thing like a cat in the dark she said scoffingly no you know perfectly well that the hall lamp was still lighted for sir rupert himself had told the servants not to wait up as he would work late and he would put it out himself i saw perfectly well all i have described and you know it so you think i killed my husband im sure of it according to the evidence at the inquest the time of his death was between ten and eleven i can prove that you left the room at eleven oclock so you must have left your dead husband behind you if you saw all this why did you not tell it at the inquest because i wished to spare you no no dont lie to me like that i am your bitter enemy why did you spare me i will tell you whether you killed sir rupert or not was nothing to me personally my reputation as a lawyer is a great deal to me had i denounced you the result would have been that i should have told all about you and you would have been struck off the rolls ah i thought you had some motive for sparing me well what do you intend to do now tell all unless you promise to leave oates alone if you do your position will still be lost i know it i know it cried dombrain in despair but what can i do if i do not stop your going to oates he knows me and he will tell all if i do stop you then you in revenge will tell all i see you are between two fires said mrs belswin calmly well set your mind at rest i will trouble silas oates no more you will not no all i wanted out of him was money but as to that you will take his place and be my banker i yes you pshaw man you neednt look so scared you know well enough that the money will be returned to you when those shares are sold but they are worth nothing so i thought until you wanted to buy them said mrs belswin with a sneer you forget i hold your life in my hand cried dombrain threateningly well and i hold your position in mine retorted mrs belswin my life is a great deal to me your position is everything to you i am willing to leave silas oates alone if you give me money when i require it if not you can denounce me when you like and then you will be hanged said dombrain spitefully bah i can prove your story to be a lie how so ill tell you now good heavens did you think that if i was guilty id think my life safe in your keeping my neck against your position bah the thing is ridiculous i can clear myself and ruin you at the same time but i want no scandal nor my daughter to know who i am as she inevitably must had i to publicly defend myself of your charge of murder so you see that on my side i have as much a desire as you to keep matters quiet now then ill leave silas oates alone i will not go near him but if i want money you must supply it i will do soto any reasonable amount replied dombrain hastily but you say you are innocent and i am after what ive seen i dont believe it if you did not kill him who else had a motive how do i know i was not in all the secrets of sir ruperts life but i can tell to you so afraid of losing your pettifogging position what i dare not tell any one else i saw sir ruperts dead body on that night but i did not kill him then you know who did no i do not let me hear your story said dombrain with a disbelieving smile when i entered the study began mrs belswin without further preamble i saw my husband he recognised me at once we had a stirring interview and he turned me out of the house i left by the french window where he was found lying dead and in order to get shelter for the night i went to the chequers in deswarth im not telling you all the story mind you but only what suits myself in the dock i should tell everything well to resume i waited at the chequers for some time and then determined to return to thornstream to say goodbye to my daughter as i knew sir rupert would prevent me seeing her the next day i arrived on the terrace just when the hour of eleven sounded there was still a light in sir ruperts study and stealing along in the dark i saw his dead body lying half in and half out of the window a full sense of the danger of my position flashed on me and i saw that if i was arrested i was lost i dare not try to enter the house by any door as they were all locked and if a servant admitted me i should have to account for my being out at that hour of the night which would lead to my being accused of the murder the only way to regain my own room in safety was across the dead body of my husband so i entered by the french window left by the study door and regained my bedroom without any one having seen meexcept you i did not kill him i swear i did not im afraid that story would not go down in a court of law i told you i had kept some of the story to myself to use your favourite illustration i still hold my trump card there was silence for a few moments during which mrs belswin considerably agitated used her smellingbottle freely then dombrain spoke well theres nothing more to be said i think not said mrs belswin rising you know my conditions and you know mine i think retorted dombrain with a malignant grin she cast upon him a glance of supreme contempt and went to the door ill see you again when i want money she said and vanished humph said mr dombrain thoughtfully if i can find out the part of the story you wont tell i may be able to stop your seeing me altogether chapter xxvii the case out of the night and into the light comes the doer of evil deeds out of the light and into the night with a sin on his soul he speeds but the hemp is sown and the tree is grown that will hang him high as a murderer known himself hath planted the seeds to be an amateur detective requires a certain amount of capital there are people who know to be discovered and a search after them cannot be successfully conducted without money and when the people who know are brought under the eye of the inquirer they frequently decline to speak unless well paid for their information money therefore is essential to the success of solving a mystery and when archie maxwell sat down calmly to consider the aspect of affairs he found himself at once face to face with the question of funds he was young he had talents he had a profession so with all these endowments looked forward to making a fortune which is the ambition of every wellconstituted youth in this age of gold unfortunately like the magical draught of mephistopheles time is required to make money and as every moment was of importance in finding out the mystery of sir ruperts death archie could not waste four or five years in getting together sufficient to prosecute his inquiries it was true that he was engaged to go out to buenos ayres at the end of the year but the firm who employed him were hard to deal with and refused to let him draw in advance of his salary toby was not well off so he could not apply to him for aid besides which that young man was already on his way to the antipodes so mr maxwell found himself with comparatively little money in the bank and a difficult case to solve without funds luckily archie was of a very sanguine nature and hopeful in a micawberish sense of something turning up so making up his mind to at all events make a start in the affair he collected all the newspaper reports of the inquest and made himself thoroughly acquainted with the ins and outs of the baronets death it appeared from the evidence of the butler that on the night of the murder sir rupert had informed him that he would be sitting up late in his study looking over some papers and that the household could go to bed at their usual time sir rupert appeared cheerful but somewhat preoccupied and went into his study shortly after dinner the butler according to his instructions locked up all the house leaving the hall lamp burning for sir rupert to put out and then with the rest of the servants retired to rest he heard no pistolshot no sounds of any one being in the house and knew nothing about the terrible event which had taken place until the next morning the housemaid stated that she had entered the study according to her usual custom to put it to rights and had there found the body of her master lying half in and half out of the french window which was open her shriek of terror brought her fellowservants to the spot and the police were sent for but she knew nothing more miss pethram deposed that her father had said goodnight to her shortly after dinner and had retired to his study to attend to some business she remained in the drawingroom for some time with mr dombrain her fathers solicitor who was then staying in the house and retired to bed about nine oclock as she had a bad headache she had heard no pistolshot during the night there was nothing in her fathers demeanour that led her to think he contemplated suicide mr dombrain the dead mans solicitor said that he had come down to thornstream in order to witness the signing of sir ruperts will the signing took place in the afternoon and at night the baronet went to his study to look over some papers he witness offered to accompany him but sir rupert refused as he said it was not necessary miss pethram retired to bed about nine oclock and as he was left alone he also retired half an hour afterwards sir rupert never gave him the least idea that he contemplated suicidein fact on the night of the murder he seemed very cheerful witness was a very heavy sleeper but he certainly had heard no pistolshot during the night and it was only next morning that he learned about the crime mrs belswin chaperon to miss pethram gave her evidence which was rather important as she was the last person who saw sir rupert alive she had been engaged when sir rupert was in new zealand and on his arrival had gone up to london on business she only returned on the day when the crime was committed and went to see sir rupert in his study between eight and nine oclock she only had a short interview with him as they had nothing particular to talk about and had gone up to her room shortly after nine oclock knowing that miss pethram had retired with a bad headache she did not disturb her but went straight to bed some of the servants might have noticed her going upstairs to her room she did not know sir rupert was a complete stranger to her he seemed well and cheerful certainly the idea of suicide never crossed her mind for a moment she heard no sounds of a struggle nor any pistolshot and knew nothing of the committal of the crime until next morning the doctors evidence was to the effect that the deceased had been shot somewhere between ten and eleven oclock at night the bullet penetrating the right eye had entered the brain causing death almost instantaneously from the slanting upward direction of the bullet from the eye towards the back part of the head he would think the pistol or gun had been fired from a low position according to his idea the murderer had been crouching behind some shrubs on the terrace sir rupert came to the window and as the study was lighted his form would be clearly defined against the brilliant background this was the opportunity chosen by the assassin who had fired from the crouching position he occupied so that the bullet had travelled upwards and penetrated into the brain through the right eye during the evidence of this witness the bullet was produced to the court and afterwards the coroner summed up going on the evidence produced the jury brought in a verdict of murder against some person or persons unknown in addition to this bold report of the case there was a short leader which theorised a great deal but ultimately came to the conclusion that nothing could be done to unravel the mystery and as usual complimented the police on their vigilance a compliment wholly undeserved as from all appearances the case had been conducted in a singularly slipslop fashion utterly unworthy of english justice being an engineer maxwell was consequently a mathematician therefore having been trained in that exact science he had a singularly logical mind two and two according to his way of looking at things made four but in this instance he was doubtful as to whether they did so everything in connection with the case was wrapped in mystery and there seemed to be no one on whom suspicion could rest all the people present in the house on the night in question had given satisfactory accounts of their movements except perhaps mrs belswin and the only possible suspicion against her was that she had been last in the company of the dead man this was all very well but the committal of a crime presupposes a motive and as mrs belswin according to her own account was a complete stranger to sir rupert it would certainly be very foolish to even hint such a thing against her she had seen the baronet spoken to him for a few minutes and then retired to bed nothing could be simpler and whosoever had a hand in the murder it was certainly not mrs belswin so archie dismissed this fancy as a foolish one the curious part about the whole affair was that no one had heard any report and as sir rupert had been shot the sound of the weapon employed would certainly have been heard yet all present in the house averred that they heard nothing which was to say the least very peculiar judging from the evidence of the doctor sir rupert was shot from the terrace which argued that the assassin must have been a stranger to the house with this idea in his head maxwell wondered whether any suspicious stranger had been about the neighbourhood at that time and made up his mind to inquire sir rupert from all accounts was not a loveable character and in fact his conduct towards maxwell had been anything but courteous so that he was just the kind of man to have enemies this being the case what was more probable than that some man or woman whom he had wronged had followed him to thornstream and revenged themselves by killing him it was rather a wild idea still it seemed the only feasible one so maxwell made up his mind to go down to deswarth ask the hospitality of the vicarage for a few days and make inquiries regarding what strangers had been to the village on that fatal day this was the conclusion he came to but then the assertion of every one that they had heard no shot was puzzling and the more maxwell thought the more puzzled he became suddenly an idea struck him and he jumped to his feet i have it he cried it was an airgun chapter xxviii what mrs belk found nothing appears all is concealed chance interferes all is revealed it was a great idea and one which had never entered the brains of the detectives employed in the case so maxwell looked upon it as an earnest of success he told no one about it not even mrs belswin nor kaituna but informing them that he was called out of town for a few days on business made his preparations for going to deswarth and finding out all particulars regarding the case which had not come to light at the inquest then chance interfered on the morning of his departure he was having breakfast at his rooms intending to catch the eleven train to deswarth when his departure was postponed indefinitely by the appearance of a visitor and the visitor was mrs belk she sent up her name to archie who told the servant to admit her wondering on what errand she had comenever for a moment thinking that she could have anything to do with the deswarth tragedy mrs belk entered neatly dressed in her widows garb with her mean evil face looking smug and placid under the white frill of her widows cap on seeing archie she curtsied in an oldfashioned way and with the natural deference of the lower orders waited for him to speak first you wish to see me he said looking at her in some surprise for such an odd figure had never before entered his chambers mrs belk with another curtsey signified that she did wish to see him and had come to london for that purpose this reply having been made she shut her mouth with a snap and waited still giving no hint of her errand will you not be seated mrsmrs belk sir said the woman seeing that archie was at a loss perhaps sir you may know my son samson belk oh yes the goodlooking bailiff replied maxwell carelessly is he your son he is sir answered mrs belk her heart swelling with pride at hearing the eulogy on her sons good looks he was bailiff to sir rupert but now he is bailiff to the new baronet sir thomas pethram indeed im very glad his prospects are so good said archie politely wondering what all this domestic history had to do with him his prospects aint good sir and thats why ive come up to see you but my good woman what can i do cried the young man in amazement mrs belk wriggled in her chair sniffed significantly and went on talking apparently in a manner most irrelevant to the subject in hand sir thomas she said with snappy deliberation is a hard man sir rupert was hard theres no denying and my boywho is prouddidnt get on with being crushed if sir rupert hadnt died he would have left his service but as he did die and sir thomas asked him to stay onhe knowing all the ins and outs of the placehe did so thinking sir thomas would be a better master and he was disappointed mrs belk nodded her head emphatically you cant make a silk purse out of a sows ear she said sententiously and thats what sir thomas is a hard gentleman sir who thinks my boy is a slave so we are going to leave his service but mrs belk observed archie rather puzzled what on earth has all this got to do with me im coming to that sir replied the woman imperturbably me and my boy wondered what wed do when we left sir thomas for situations mr maxwell are hard to getespecially for poor folks like us maxwell nodded an assent and waited until she came to the reason of her visit in the papers pursued mrs belk with a faint smile of triumph on her pale face me and my boy saw that strong men was being exhibited in london and all the gentry was mad on em yes i believe that is the case this strong man craze is in all the musichalls my son sir is called samson and he is as strong as a horse yes i know that said archie with the cordial admiration of physical strength which one englishman feels for another he is tremendously strong ive seen him do some wonderful things well and your son proposes to come up to london and exhibit his strength yes sir said mrs belk with a look of triumph he does sir its my idea ive no doubt its a good one while the craze lasts he may make money but after ill take care of the money sir answered mrs belk grimly hell make hay while the sun shines and ill take care when the sun doesnt shine that well have something to live on do you want me to help you in this then in a sort of way sir but not for nothing maxwell smiled really i dont know what you can do for me you wait sir and ill tell to git a start in london requires money and me and my son want fifty pounds to give us a start indeed im afraid i cant advance the money so you say now sir but when you know what fifty pounds ull buy perhaps you will archies curiosity was now fully aroused owing to the significance of her words there was evidently something important behind all this apparently idle preamble and he waited with some anxiety as to what she was going to tell him you are engaged to miss pethram sir im told said mrs belk abruptly yes i am what then replied maxwell rather haughtily not liking his private affairs being mentioned by a complete stranger mrs belk bent forward in a mysterious manner touched him on the knee then flung herself back in her chair with a searching look has she found out who killed her father good god maxwell jumped to his feet with an ejaculation and one hand grasping the back of his chair stood looking at the mean figure before him in silent amazement what do you mean he demanded in a stifled voice the woman carried an obtrusive black leather bag of no small size with a metal clasp and this she shook slowly at him as she replied to his question in here she said in her monotonous voicea voice that neither rose nor fell but kept on droning constantly in the same dreary monotonein here i have something which may lead to the discovery of the criminal maxwell gasped was chance going to reveal the secret which he had been so afraid was a secret for ever he had been about to go down to deswarth on an apparently hopeless quest without anything to guide him to a conclusion and lo at the very time when he was starting this woman appeared from the clouds with the asseveration that she knew something which would be a sure guide to the revealing of the mystery in that bag he said mechanically looking at it in a fascinated fashion in that bag with a cry of relief he advanced and stretched out his hands eagerly give it to me what is it give it to me the woman put the bag behind her back with a frown no she answered in the same passionless voice nothing for nothing i have told you what i wanted give me fifty pounds and you shall have it but what is it a clue to the man who committed the murder give it to me at once certainlywhen i get fifty pounds maxwell reflected he was not a rich man and fifty pounds was a great consideration to him still in his search he would probably spend that amount and by giving it to this woman he would perhaps learn the name of the criminal at once so it would be better to save time by acceding to her demand and thus arrest the assassin before he had time to leave the country therefore he made up his mind to give it to her and secure the evidence she said was in the bag but first he tried to find out exactly what that evidence was worth do you know who committed the murder no i do not i found something which i think belongs to him and may lead to his detection you shall have it for fifty pounds why do you come to me you are engaged to miss pethram and it is to your interest to find out who killed her father besides you will pay me money if i went to sir thomas or to sir ruperts solicitor they would probably refuse to give me a penny and i want the money for my son if i give you a cheque for fifty pounds you will give me thisthiswhatever it is you have in your bag i will but i dont like cheques id rather have the money in gold you mistrust me i dont like cheques reiterated mrs belk doggedly maxwell reflected a few moments then made up his mind what to do and rang the bell when the servant who attended to all the chambers in the building entered he handed him a cheque for fifty pounds made payable to bearer and drawn on the piccadilly bank a branch of which was not far distant take a hansom and cash this at oncegold will you be long about ten minutes sir the servant departed and maxwell turned to mrs belk who observed ail these doings with a satisfied smile you see i am treating you fairly he said quietly and when the messenger returns i will place those fifty pounds in your hands very well sir in return i will give you what is in here i do not like this distrust cried maxwell angrily i am a country woman sir i know nothing of london ways she was evidently obdurate and there was silence for a few minutes then archie made another attempt to extract information from her where did you find thiswhatever it is i will tell you sir when you have it in your hands do you know to whom it belongs no sir it seems to me that i am paying a heavy price for what is of comparatively little value i may be able to tell you something in addition to giving this to you likely to be of service in connection with it yes i think so humph is this clue which you have of value to you yes of pecuniary value i mean yes it is valuable then why did you not sell it instead of giving it to me for fifty pounds sir said mrs belk coldly i am an honest woman the thing is not mine to sell money obtained dishonestly brings no good luck and as this money is for my son i do not wish it to be cursed the fifty pounds i now give you may be the price of a mans blood you are strangely scrupulous you will not steal but you will hang a man if he is guilty he deserves to die credit rather than blame is mine for handing him over to justice maxwell looked curiously at her you speak above your station in life very probably replied mrs belk indifferently i have had some education this strange dialogue was interrupted by the entrance of the servant who handed maxwell fifty pounds in gold and then took his departure the young man placed the money on the table and motioned to mrs belk count it please and see if it is correct mrs belk eagerly advanced towards the table and dividing the money into tens counted it rapidly having done so she took a small canvas bag out of her pocket and put the gold into it that is all right sir she said with a sigh of relief opening the black bag you have behaved like a gentleman i have the money i want and you have in exchangethis this was a small diamond pin in the shape of a star with eight points and maxwell took it in his hand with a sensation that he had seen it before ah he said thoughtfully turning it over in his hands this is the thing i have bought for my fifty pounds yes sir it is worth about twenty i should say said maxwell resuming his seat but doubtless the story attached to it will render it more valuable there is no story sir replied mrs belk who had placed the gold in her obtrusive black bag simply this i found that on the terrace of the hall on the morning after the murder it was lying close to the window indeed and you think i think that it was dropped by the man who murdered sir rupert how do you know it was a man that is a gentlemans scarfpin sir hah cried maxwell with a sudden start i know now where i saw it you saw it sir asked mrs belk eagerly yes on the scarf of the man inever mind i may be mistaken did you tell your son you had found this no sir i wished to surprise him with the money i have told no one except you im glad of that well i think i have an idea but surely he cannot be guilty of the murder who sir maxwell who had risen to his feet looked at her keenly have you any idea of whom i am talking none in the least sir the young man walked to the other end of the room then retraced his steps slowly mrs belk he said after a pause do you know if there were any strangers in deswarth on the night of the murder only one sir a furriner at the chequers and he went away next morning do you think he knew sir rupert i do not know sir all i know is that i found that scarfpin near where the murder was committed if it belongs to the furriner he killed sir rupert what was he doing at deswarth i do not know sir humph well say nothing about this to any one mrs belk i will see you again when i come down to deswarth you are coming down to deswarth sir yes to find out who killed sir rupert i think youll find him in london sir said the woman with a grim smile as she stood with her hand on the door goodmorning sir goodmorning maxwell stood a long time looking at the pin yes he said aloud it certainly belongs to that man he had seen it in the scarf of ferrari in the morning he met mrs belswin at the deswarth station chapter xxix danger woman this stranger knows not thy shame yet there is danger hears he thy name hide it conceal it heed not the cost breathe it reveal it and thou art lost the diamond scarfpin had been found on the terrace of thornstream by mrs belk so the man to whom it belonged must have been there on the night of the murder and the owner thereof according to maxwells firm convictionon the testimony of his own eyeswas none other than the stranger who had been in the company of mrs belswin at the deswarth station the first thing therefore to be done was to find out who this stranger was and demand from him an explanation of his presence at thornstream on that fatal night maxwell however did not know this man whom he suspected of being a murderer he did not even know his name but he could discover all about him in two ways one of which was doubtful the other certain the doubtful way to go down to deswarth and inquire from the landlord of the chequers the name position and business in the village of the man who had stayed at the inn this was doubtful in this way that supposing the stranger had come to deswarth to commit this crime he would naturally give a false name to the landlord so as to obviate the danger of discovery so maxwell with this idea in his head plainly saw that going down to deswarth in order to interview the landlord would in all reasonable probability be a waste of time the certain way to ask mrs belswin the name of her companion and the reason of his coming to the village archie felt his old doubts about mrs belswin revive as he thought of the doubtful juxtaposition of this suspicious character with the companion why had she gone to london at the time of sir ruperts arrival why had she returned with a stranger who had been on the terrace on the night of the murder and why had sir rupert been murdered on the night of her return only one person could answer all these inquiries and that person was mrs belswin there was certainly something very mysterious about her conduct but doubtless she would be able to give a satisfactory explanation otherwise a cold sweat broke out on maxwells brow as he thought of the alternative suspense is always more terrible than the event itself and archie full of suspicion against mrs belswin and the unknown foreigner tortured his mind to a frightful extent over the possibility of this woman being concerned in the murder if however she was innocent she would be able to exculpate herself from any complicity in the affair but if she was guilty it was terrible to think that she was the daily and nightly companion of kaituna she had possibly killed the father if so she might also kill the daughter was she some one whom sir rupert had wronged and who thus avenged herself by the hand of another the idea was terrible and maxwell filled with the agony of uncertainty determined to go at once to mrs belswin and demand an explanation he made a point of calling that afternoon and was lucky enough to find mrs belswin alone as kaituna had gone out on a shopping excursion with mrs valpy who had come up to town the previous day mrs belswin informed the young man of this and invited him to wait until kaituna returned at the hour of five oclock meanwhile she said ringing the bell sit down and we will have some tea maxwell mechanically took a seat and glanced at the clock the hands of which pointed to four this would give him a full hour to speak to mrs belswin before the arrival of kaituna and in that time he expected to learn all he desired to know the lady seemed preoccupied and as maxwell was racking his brains to invent some leading question neither of them spoke for a few minutes the servant brought in the tea and while mrs belswin busied herself with the cups she for the first time noticed the unusual silence of the young man well mr maxwell she said handing him his tea with a smile speech i understand was given to us to conceal our thoughts you i perceive conceal them without speaking i have come to see you on a matter of business said archie abruptly putting down his cup on a small table near at hand the paleness of his face the abruptness of his speech the agitation of his manner at once put mrs belswin on her guard and a thrill of fear shot through her heartfear lest he should have discovered anything about her past life which would be fatal to her living with kaituna her iron stoicism however prevailed and she awaited with outward calm but inward perturbation his next words mrs belswin he said slowly bending towards her do you know this diamond pin oh muttered mrs belswin under her breath recognising it at once more misfortune what do you say before i answer your question mr maxwell she observed fixing her keen eyes on his face i wish to know why you put it certainly that is only fair do you remember the day i met you at the deswarth railway station yes there was a stranger with you a stranger pray do not evade the question said maxwell in an annoyed tone i mean the dark gentleman whom you sent off to see about your portmanteau and who accompanied you from town how do you know he accompanied me from town i saw you both leave a firstclass carriage together that proves nothing travelling in the same carriage does not prove that he accompanied me from town but he looked after your luggage at your request yes he did so certainly but what does that prove simply this that you know the gentleman mrs belswin would have liked to deny this as she saw from the production of the diamond pin and the mention of ferrari that maxwell knew something but she was so afraid lest failing her he should ask kaituna and so possibly discover more than she wished that she answered him frankly yes i do know the gentleman ah and you know his name yes his name isbut why do you want to know because he wore this diamond pin on the day i saw him with you and this diamond pin yes yes cried mrs belswin breathlessly clasping her hands was found on the terrace of thornstream the morning after the murder the woman sprang to her feet with a cry ferrari impossible is his name ferrari yes no that is mr maxwell she cried seizing the young man by the lappet of his coat what do you mean what do you suspect i mean that this diamond pin belongs to ferrari whom you have just named i suspect that he murdered sir rupert pethram mrs belswin uttered a cry of terror no no it cannot be then let him prove his innocence prove his innocence yes said maxwell with an air of determination i have made up my mind to bring the murderer of sir rupert pethram to justice appearances are dead against this man and i intend to put the matter in the hands of the police you will never find him maxwell bounded from his seat and crossing rapidly to mrs belswin seized her wrist tell me he said imperiously have you any reason for wishing this man to escape i she murmured evasively i wish him to escape yes to all appearances he is your friend he comes down with you to deswarth a jewel belonging to him is found at the window of a room in that room a man is found dead what does it all mean wait cried the woman wrenching herself from his grasp wait i must think maxwell obeyed and returned to his seat with a cloud on his brow for the complicity of mrs belswin in the affair now began to assume gigantic proportions on her part mrs belswin saw at a glance the dangers by which she was environed and her active brain was already at work seeking some plan by which she could extricate herself she already saw that maxwell suspected her and if he did so she trembled lest he should communicate his suspicions to her daughter with her hands pressed to her burning face she rapidly glanced at the aspect of affairs in order to know how to act towards this young man whose attitude towards her was undeniably hostile if she refused to tell him anything he would put the matter into the hands of the police and they would immediately arrest ferrari in doing so they would have no difficulty as he being a singer was easily to be found and appearances were sufficiently strong against him to authorise the granting of a warrant for his arrest if ferrari were arrested he would certainly urged by a fear of the law reveal all about her in his examination and kaituna would then learn that mrs belswin the companion was her mother if she did so mrs belswin trembled for the result of such a discovery so at once she made up her mind to promise maxwell an interview with ferrari and meanwhile warn the italian of his peril by this means she hoped that if guilty ferrari would at once fly from england or if innocent he would be able to exculpate himself without incriminating her so that in either case she would still preserve the secret of her true relationship to kaituna mr maxwell she said at length suppressing her agitation i will tell you all i know and then you can judge for yourself thank you mrs belswin replied maxwell in a tone of relief i think that will be the best way as i am anxious to avoid the interference of the police and why sir demanded mrs belswin with a piercing glance the young man made no reply but looked confused upon which the woman laughed bitterly ah i see she said with scorn you think that i a stranger to the late sir rupert am implicated in his death i have not said so madam murmured the young man hastily i swear before god cried mrs belswin rising from her seat and raising her right handi swear before god that i know nothing of the death of this man but ferrari i believe ferrari to be innocent appearances are against him it is true but that does not render him guilty listen mr maxwell stephano ferrari is a friend of mine for i met him in america before i came to england i was an operasinger and he was singing with me in the same company we are engaged to be married you yes i wanted to rest my voice and as i had but little money i became companion to miss pethram you know whether i have been a good friend to her or not you have been a good friend certainly my duties kept me near miss pethram so i saw ferrari but rarely and as he is devoted to me naturally he missed my society at the time i left deswarth i came to london to see about my marriage and on my returnwhich was on a sundayferrari came down with me as he was not singing that night is there anything strange in this no it seems quite natural replied maxwell after a pause i would act the same way towards kaituna signor ferrari resumed mrs belswin coldly stayed that night at the chequers and returned i believe next morning to town i did not see him as owing to the terrible death of sir rupert i had to stay with kaituna i do not know how he spent the night i do not know at what hour he returned in the morning but this scarfpin it is certainly his but what of that he may have come to thornstream to see me and lost it on the terrace if so why did he not see you i do not know i know nothing beyond what i have told you but set your mind at rest come here tomorrow morning at eleven oclock and i will take you to signor ferrari who will doubtless be able to explain all to your satisfaction you will yes at eleven tomorrow i am sure he is innocent i hope so said maxwell heartily if only for your sake you are still suspicious i see replied mrs belswin with a faint smile well it is only natural and i hope your suspicions will be dispelled by signor ferraris explanation but now i must ask you to permit me to retire as all this exciting talk has given me a headache if however you will wait for kaituna not tonight thank you said maxwell hastily taking his hat and stick im too disturbed to see her goodbye i rely on your promise tomorrow at eleven at eleven i will wait you answered mrs belswin truthfully so at present goodbye and dont think worse of me than you can help maxwell said nothing but bowing politely left the room while mrs belswin annoyed at his silence stood frowning angrily he still suspects she muttered ringing the bell ferrari must put an end to his suspicionsif he can the servant entered the room a hansom at once she put on her cloak and bonnet and returned to the sittingroom to wait for the cab im in terrible danger she said pulling on her glovesterrible danger one false step and all may be known ferrari is my only hope can he be guilty appearances are against him if he is a murderer let him suffer as long as he keeps silence the cab maam mrs belswin went downstairs i dont care what happens she cried when driving away as long as i keep my child chapter xxx a clever defence you say twas i indeed sir tis not so my hands are innocent of this mans blood nay never fear i pardon what you say your judgment is misled by false report why if you heed the idle tongues that wag theres not an honest man would scape the law for every act bears two interpretations one good one badso that our enemies use that which fits in best with their desires as evil witness gainst our true intents there is no doubt that peril sharpens the wits of all therefore mrs belswin in her interview with the italian proved herself such an able diplomatist that after some difficulty she obtained what she wanted according therefore to the arrangement she made with ferrari he was to tell maxwell as much as possible of his doings at deswarth without mentioning the name of mrs belswin on first hearing of maxwells accusation ferrari wanted to fly as he plainly said it would be difficult for him to defend himself against such a charge although he swore on the crucifix that he was perfectly innocent mrs belswin dissuaded him from this course as she pointed out that if he acknowledged the truth of the accusation by flight maxwell would immediately inform the police and he would be arrested before he could leave england on the contrary however if he faced the charge boldly and explained the presence of the diamond scarfpin on the terrace to the satisfaction of the young man he would not only by doing so clear his own character but might possibly lead to the capture of the true criminal ferrari agreed therefore to grant the interview desired by maxwell and tell the truth without betraying mrs belswins true position towards the dead man in any way but during this very curious conversation both the man and the woman asked each other the same question are you guilty mrs belswin solemnly swore that she was innocent and told ferrari the same story as she had told dombrain concerning her doings on that night this explanation satisfied the italian and then in response to mrs belswins question as to his innocence he gave an account of how he had passed the night after you departed carissima he said volubly i went to seek you but the time was darkness cospetto how black i knew not the villaggio so i returned to the osteria in one few minutes were you in the hotel before eleven demanded mrs belswin artfully cara mia you fled at ten hours i went i came back at ten and ten so i could not have killed il marito mrs belswin believed this story as had he been out longer the landlord would certainly have talked about it and ferrari would have been arrested at once on suspicion as it was she felt quite satisfied that he was innocent and having thus come to a complete understanding with him she departed mrs belswin therefore declared that she was innocent ferrari also declared his innocence if this were the case who was guilty ah that was to be revealed the next day to archie maxwell true to his promise the young man called for mrs belswin at eleven oclock the following morning and after a short interview with kaituna to whom he talked on the most indifferent subjects he departed with the companion mrs belswin was fearfully pale as all her future depended upon the caution observed by ferrari and she was afraid lest carried away by his impulsive southern nature the italian should reveal more than was desirable to maxwell she was not afraid of being accused of the crime as dombrain alone could give evidence as to her being in the room after the murder and she had a perfect understanding with him but she was terribly afraid of maxwells finding out her true relationship to kaituna in which case she would certainly lose the companionship of her child to retain which she had fought so hard maxwell was also somewhat preoccupied as in spite of his desire to think the best of mrs belswin all her conduct her hesitations her equivocations appeared so mysterious that he was forced to believe that she knew more than she chose to tell her conduct however in conducting him to a personal interview with ferrari was one argument in her favour for it never for a moment struck this simpleminded young man that she had in any way prepared the ground beforehand perfectly honest and straightforward in himself maxwell foolishly supposed all other human beings to possess the same desirable qualities and in the hands of two practised diplomatists like the italian and mrs belswin he could not possibly hold his own his life had always been a perfectly open one and although he was not rich he had never been put to any shifts for money in any way consequently his wits had grown somewhat rusty from want of exercise mrs belswin and her friend however had led a reckless bohemian existence which called for craft courage coolness and dexterity in a very high degree therefore they were thoroughly competent in dealing with a delicate affair like the present which required subtle management still a blundering bluebottle often breaks the web spun by the craftiest spider so mrs belswin feared lest the straightforward honesty of the young man should rush through all her careful schemes and by sheer boldness arrive at the truth on their arrival at ferraris chambers he was already waiting for them and mrs belswin having introduced him to archie the three sat down to talk it was a fencing match and the third fencer was maxwell who not only had two opponents against him but those same opponents were gifted with powers of attack and parry of which he was completely ignorant you speak english i see said archie to ferrari after the first greetings had passed certainly signor replied the italian showing his white teeth i have been long from italy oh yes the estates of america where i had the pleasure of meeting signor ferrari observed mrs belswin ceremoniously at this the signor bowed but made no remark so maxwell seeing that he would not commit himself to speech unless questioned began at once on the main object of the interview mrs belswin i presume told you i wished to see you signor ferrari the italian bowed about an article of jewellery belonging to you ferrari bowed again which was found on the terrace at thornstream the residence of the late sir rupert pethram the signor bowed for the third time and maxwell hotblooded in all things began to lose his temper at this persistent silence well sir he said sharply perhaps you will be kind enough to inform me how this scarfpin came to be on the terrace in question one moment said ferrari politely lifting his hand will you kindly tell me who found what you have maxwell hesitated a moment but seeing no reason why he should conceal the part mrs belk had taken in the affair spoke out boldly a woman you dont knowmrs belk dio great heavens these ejaculations proceeded the first from ferrari the second from mrs belswin and in hearing them maxwell looked suspiciously from the one to the other you seem surprised so will you be surprised said mrs belswin gloomily when you hear what the signor has to tell you i am at signor ferraris service per bacco it is most strange cried ferrari throwing himself back on his skyblue sofa alfieri himself could have thought nothing so terrible the story sir the story eh signor i excite your wonder said the italian equably is it not so dio i myself am lost in fear signor i will tell all maxwell bit his nether lip with impatience at the leisurely way in which ferrari was acting as he saw from the agitation of mrs belswin that the name of the woman who had found the scarfpin moved her powerfully signor said ferrari gracefully i departed with the signora here to the villagio on the day you saw me myself i waited at the osteria you know of i doubt not the signora departed to the casa of il of sir rupert interrupted mrs belswin quickly grazia signora to the casa of seer ruperts i am alone and i weary of being myself at the osteria see then signor i take a leetle walk for amusement i come to the ground of seer ruperts and there i meet a galantuomo handsome as the apollo samson belk yes the signora tells me that is his name well this large one orders me away from the place i say no and he would fight methe box signor you understand i am not afraid and i tell him i am not afraid then he says i will put you in prison because you are on the estate of seer ruperts at this i fear i know not the english laws so i say addio i will go but he signor answers not so then what am i to do i cannot fight that large man i have not the box i do not know the english laws and he may truly place me in prison for being on the grounds of seer ruperts then signor i think aha the money but not he refuses the money again i say signor i will give you my pin of diamonds if you let me depart he says alright i give him the pin of diamonds i go away and that signor is all i am informed of but signor cried maxwell jumping to his feet in a state of uncontrollable agitation by this story the diamond pin was in the possession of belk cospetto i believe so and belk must have lost it on the terrace doubtless signor great heavens said archie violently his own mother found it if he committed the crime he is betrayed to the law by his own mother through ignorance interposed mrs belswin quickly nevertheless it hands her son over to justice oh its horrible its horrible and the young man covered his face with his hands i regret this sorrow signor said ferrari composedly dio it is a tragedy like lucrezia borgia but i have told you the truth yes yes muttered maxwell resuming his seat you could not make up such a horrible thing as to myself signor resumed ferrari quietly if you think a doubt of me the man of the osteria will tell you i was in the casa on that night you can prove an alibi but i do not understand signor said the italian in a perplexed tone looking inquiringly at mrs belswin oh yes he can prove an alibi said that lady quickly the landlord of the chequers can give evidence as to his being in the house all night i did take a leetle walk a walk ejaculated maxwell lifting his head but i returned at ten hours finished ferrari triumphantly no signor i have nothing to do with this death i can swear it to your police the man i spoke to had my diamond it is found on the terrace ebbene he alone can have lost it there what motive could belk have for killing sir rupert muttered maxwell to himself eh who knows mrs belswin said nothing her eyes were cast down and she was tapping the ground nervously with her foot the fact is she was in a state of considerable trepidation as she fancied she knew the motive belk had in killing sir ruperta motive of which all but herself were ignorant belk loved her he was in intelligence little raised above the brute of the fields so if he had overheard the interview between herself and sir rupert and seen how ignominiously she was treated he might havebut no it was too horrible and with a cry she covered her face with her hands what is the matter mrs belswin asked maxwell looking at her quickly mrs belswin at once told a lie its so horrible to think of a mother being the means of her sons death we dont know if he is guilty yet then how can he explain his presence on the terrace on that night his presence there does not mean that he committed the crime he may be able to explain as well as signor ferrari you doubt me signor cried ferrari wrathfully starting to his feet i have not said so but you think dio i am not blind well if you doubt bring me to this man signor i will make him tell all to you before me will you then come down to deswarth with me on sunday that is tomorrow eh yes signor i will come and i too mr maxwell you mrs belswin yes i cannot believe this horrible thing of that poor young man said mrs belswin hurriedly i will also come do you intend to have belk arrested on sunday no cried maxwell vehemently i want to hear what he has to say first im afraid your nature is too soft for a detective mr maxwell said mrs belswin cruelly do you think so he answered angrily no but look mrs belswin at the horrible position of the case a mother betrays unconsciously to death the son whom she adores oh its terrible he may be innocent per bacco i hope so cried ferrari anxiously i myself think it is too much a tragedy i will not speak to the police said maxwell taking up his hat we three will go to deswarth together and confront this man if he is innocent so much the better if he is guilty well asked mrs belswin seeing him pause i will do nothing nothing no if i took advantage of what mrs belk told me to hang her son i should never have a moments peace for the rest of my life but kaituna she will think the same as i do said maxwell quickly and you mrs belswinsurely you would not counsel otherwise mrs belswin looked heavenward with a look of almost sublime pity on her strongly marked face no i am a mother and i know how a mother feels for her only child chapter xxxi a tragic situation a deeds to be done there is sin in the doing oh see how the mother her child is pursuing she smites him unknowing oh mother blind mother thy son thou hast slainnot the son of another the deed thou hast done bodes a lifetime of rueing thy son thou hast slaughtered as cain did his brother it was on friday morning that mrs belk had her fatal interview with maxwellfatal indeed to her son to benefit whom that same interview had been sought for had she not been of such a secretive disposition she would have told samson of the finding of the jewel and how she intended to obtain money thereon as a clue to the assassin of sir rupert in which case he would doubtless have prevented her doing so anxious however to surprise samson with a piece of good news she had refrained from taking him into her confidence and thus inadvertently placed him in a situation of extreme peril ignorant of this however she left maxwell with the fifty pounds in her purse and joy in her heart thinking she could now give her son a chance of making money by his physical strength determined to see for herself what rivals he would have in the event of his entering the arena as a strong man on friday night she went to totahoops music hall where the new milo was exhibiting his world renowned feats of strength after witnessing his performance she was satisfied that her son had nothing to fear in the way of comparison and on saturday night went to a rival variety entertainment to see the modern hercules this gentleman in mrs belks opinion proved equally disappointing so the next day which was sunday she departed for deswarth with the full conviction that her son aided by the fifty pounds obtained from maxwell would only have to appear before a london audience to easily distance both the milo and the hercules she went down by the morning train but on arriving at her cottage found that samson had gone to a town some distance away on an errand for sir thomas his new master and would not be back again until the afternoon under these circumstances she was forced to curb her impatience and wait some hours before she could reveal the good news to her son meanwhile as fate was thus delaying the warning to samson which such a revelation would have brought about archie maxwell accompanied by mrs belswin and her italian friend had arrived at the chequers from whence they intended to go to belks cottage and demand an explanation from him as to the discovery of the scarfpin on the terrace at thornstream confronted with the landlord of the chequers signor ferrari had no difficulty in proving to maxwell that he was in the house at ten oclock on that fatal night and as the doctor at the inquest had asserted that sir rupert had been shot shortly before eleven maxwell was forced to believe by this circumstantial evidence that ferrari was innocent of the crime mrs belswin had also recalled to the young mans mind her evidence at the inquest so he could not possibly suspect her in any way therefore to all appearances belk was the only person to whom suspicion pointed in any strong degree this being the case after the interview with the landlord of the chequers mr maxwell and his two friends set off to belks cottage where mrs belk was now impatiently awaiting the arrival of her son it seemed to mrs belswin superstitious as she was in the highest degree that fortune was dead against her in every way firstly she had been beaten on every point by silas oates secondly it was only by the merest chance that she had been able to conceal her identity from maxwell in the matter of his accusation against ferrari and now she was afraid of samson belk afraid because the finding of the scarfpin proved conclusively that he was on the terrace on that night in which case he might have overheard her interview with sir rupert if this was the case in order to save himself he would certainly tell archie all he knew and she would be lost there was no time to see and warn him as she had done ferrari so she walked on to the cottage with a set smile on her face and a deadly fear in her heart on their arrival mrs belk opened the door and was very much surprised at such an invasion however she said nothing but standing in her doorway waited for an explanation of their visit is your son at home mrs belk asked maxwell abruptly no sir replied mrs belk dropping a curtsey but im expecting him every minute oh in that case well wait yes sir certainly mrs belk moved unwillingly on one side as she was in a state of considerable mystification as to the reason of mr maxwells unexpected arrival and they all entered the cottage the little woman gave them seats and then stood waiting to hear what they had to say maxwells business however was with samson belk and not with his mother so he preserved a masterly silence in order to give her no opportunity of finding out his errand and perhaps by a look putting her son on his guard i hope nothing is wrong about the money sir said mrs belk after a long pause no that is all right have you found out anything sir you mean about the scarfpin said maxwell evasively yes sir mr maxwell has found out the owner of it interposed mrs belswin coldly i am the owner said ferrari complacently you cried mrs belk with a sudden flush on her face you sir even i signora mrs belk felt quite taken back she was quite sure that the owner of the scarfpin had killed sir rupert yet here he was calmly acknowledging that it belonged to him which he certainly would not do if he were guilty the little woman looked from ferrari to maxwell from maxwell to mrs belswin and saw in their eyes the same expressiona look of pity a sudden thrill of fear shot through her heart and she turned towards maxwell with a cry of alarm sir sir she stammered nervously what does this meanwhy do you come here we want to see your son mrs belk my son sir is anything wrong oh tell me sir samson has been doing nothing wrong none of the three persons present answered her so filled were their hearts with pity for her coming agony is it anything to do with the diamond sir yes oh cried mrs belk with an expression of relief on her face perhaps you think my son stole it your son said mrs belswin quickly did he have that scarfpin in his possession mrs belk faced round fiercely no maam he knows nothing about it ebbene murmured the italian we shall see what do you say sir i say replied ferrari coolly that the scarfpin was mine and i gave it totoyour son to my son shrieked mrs belk her pale face growing yet paler but i found the diamond on the terrace per bacco who loses finds mrs belk kept silent for a moment overwhelmed by the thought of the perilous position in which she had placed her son for in a single instant she saw all then staggering against the wall she gave a cry which was scarcely human in its agony scarcely had it died away when hurried footsteps were heard and the door was dashed open to admit samson belk with a look of astonishment on his face mother what is the matter mrs belswin yes said mrs belswin advancing a step we have come the mother saw the movement and with a shriek of jealous rage darted between them and flung herself into her sons arms yes my son yes she cried convulsively they have come to kill you to hang you mother they say you killed the master its a lie samson belk placed his mother in a chair where she sat in a halffainting condition and turned fiercely towards the two men like a lion at bay now then he saidhis habitually slow voice sharp and quickwhats all this maxwell held out his hand and in the palm of it lay the diamond scarfpin do you know this he demanded slowly belk gave a mighty laugh of scorn know it yes i know it tis the diamond i got from yonder chap you acknowledge that he gave it to you then of course why shouldnt i because i found it on the terrace samson cried his mother madly well what of that i lost it there mother when did you lose it asked maxwell quickly belk thought a moment and then started as the full meaning of this interrogation flashed across his dull brain eh then you chaps say i killed sir rupert we do not say so said maxwell emphatically we only say that this diamond scarfpin which you acknowledge to have had in your possession was found near the window where the body was lying and that pin hangs me sir not if you can account satisfactorily for its being there you aint got the police sir no samson samson wailed his mother clinging to him say it was not you killed the master quiet mother said her son replacing her in the chair i can tell my own story you are innocent asked mrs belswin impulsively innocent repeated belk with scorn if i wasnt id have been off to the states by this time sit down gentlemen sit down madam i can tell you the truth all resumed their seats mechanically but belk leaned his mighty frame against the wall and looked at them quietly from ferrari his eyes wandered to maxwell and finally rested on mrs belswin with a curious expression at which she turned pale my god she murmured clasping her hands tightly what is he going to say belk guessed her thoughts and reassured her at once my storys only about myself he said abruptly looking at her again upon which she thanked him with a silent look of gratitude although she felt a thrill of fear at the thought that perhaps he knew her secret one word before you speak said maxwell quietly as you know i am going to marry miss pethram and i promised her to find out the assassin of her father chance in the person of your mother placed in my hands a clue which led me to believe that signor ferrari had something to do with the crime cospetto what honour signor ferrari however resumed archie quietly has proved his innocence and in order to do so has unintentionally made out a very strong case against you mr belk whether you are guilty or not i do not know but you see i have not informed the police about anything connected with the matter and why sir because the clue was placed in my hands by your mother and i would not have it on my conscience however guilty you may be to take advantage of the innocent betrayal of a son by his mother mrs belk sobbed violently at this and belk with a sudden flush held out his hand but drew it back at once no sir he said bluffly i wont give you my hand yet till youve heard my story i did get that diamond from the foreign gent as he says he was trespassing and i could have made things hot for him but to get off he gave me the diamond do you think that was right seeing signor ferrari is a foreigner and ignorant of english laws asked maxwell i dont say it was right sir replied belk with a queer look and it was not altogether the trespass there was something else i need not tell you of that made me take his diamond mrs belswin darted a sudden look on both men who were eyeing her jealously and flushed a deep red but maxwell was so interested in belks story that he did not notice her perturbation and signed to him to continue well sir i stuck the pin in my scarf careless like as i was in a hurry to go up to the hall to see sir rupert what hour was this about four oclock sir i went up to the hall and sir rupert sir he was in his study so instead of going in by the door i went in by the window so you first went along the terrace yes sir and as the pin was stuck in careless i suppose it fell as i went into the room by the window not impossible said maxwell thoughtfully i saw sir rupert took my orders and then came home sir and didnt go out again that night eh cried mrs belk starting up no more you did lad i can swear to that and so can mr gelthrip the parson sir said belk triumphantly he called here in the evening and i saw him so you see sir as i didnt go near the hall until the next morning i didnt have nought to do with the killing no certainly not maxwell heaved a sigh of relief at the turn things had taken for if both mrs belk and the curate could prove that samson had been at home on that fatal night the young man certainly could not be guilty meanwhile he wanted to get away and think the matter over for what with the story of ferrari and the story of belk he was quite bewildered so my samson is innocent cried mrs belk triumphantly yes and im glad to hear it replied maxwell as he went out goodbye mrs belk im pleased on your account but sorry on my own ebbene but who killed ili am talking of seer rupert cried ferrari putting on his hat belk shrugged his shoulders i dont know he replied nonchalantly the master had lots of enemies i reckon belk cried maxwell overhearing this come to the chequers tonight i want to speak to you very well sir you are not coming up to town with us then mr maxwell said mrs belswin who was lingering behind no i wish to ask belk some questions about sir ruperts enemies from what he says it appears he had some and belk knows them maxwell and ferrari both went down to the gate and mrs belswin was left alone with samson the mother still being in the house dont go she said in a low tone oh yes ill go he replied in the same tone i tell nothing what she said uneasily do you know anything belk looked at her with his languid eyes and stroked his golden beard slowly i know what i know he replied emphatically and with this reply which roused all her suspicions mrs belswin was forced to be content chapter xxxii news from

millionaires to paupers change transformation swift and strange genii no nor fairy kings could not do such wondrous things as are daily done by scores on australias golden shores what passed between maxwell and samson belk at their interview mrs belswin could never discover but as archie did not in any way change his manner towards her she was satisfied that her name had not transpired during the conversation or if it had belk had said nothing detrimental to her in any way as to belk himself she saw him when he came up to london but he refused to tell her whether he had overheard the conversation between herself and sir rupert and she was therefore forced to remain in a constant state of uneasiness although belk denied that he had been out of the house after his return from the four oclock interview and supported this assertion by the evidence of his mother and the curate yet mrs belswin had a kind of half suspicion that he had been on the terrace on the night in question and had heard more than he was willing to confess but then she argued to herself that if this were the case he would certainly use his power over her to force her into marriage with him whereas he did nothing of the sort but behaved as if he knew absolutely nothing it was now three months since the famous interview at the belk cottage and samson had carried out the plan proposed by his mother he had appeared at a firstclass music hall as the nineteenth century samson and by his superior strength had easily distanced his rivals both the new milo and the modern hercules they of course were furious at being eclipsed but his mother was delighted with his success the music hall manager was charmed at the crowds drawn by his new star and perhaps the only person not thoroughly happy was the star himself the reason of this discontent was that in order to preserve his strength he had to lead a very abstemious life both as regards food and drink so that although he was making a large income he was not enjoying it despite his discontent however he still led his life of an ascetic and saved all his money which was a marked contrast to his former extravagant ways but then he had a purpose in economising and the purpose was mrs belswin whom he had made up his mind to marry as soon as he was rich enough in the meantime that lady was leading a sufficiently comfortable life as when she ran short of money she always drew on dombrain who did not dare to refuse it to her kaituna still lived with her and as some time had elapsed since the death of her father she had recovered nearly all her former vivacity and was looking anxiously forward to her marriage with archiea marriage which was soon to take place owing to the good news from australia about the pole star silver mine toby clendon had duly arrived in the land of the southern cross and had sent home brilliantly written letters of his travels which satisfied the editor and delighted the readers of the weekly scorpion in addition to this excellent literary work which by the way was giving him a name in journalistic circles he had made inquiries about the pole star mine and although the information he obtained was disheartening enough at first yet after a time the pole star silver shares began to be inquired about and in a few weeks were actually worth money archie who had benefited by his mining experiences in the colony and moreover had made friends with an enterprising share broker who was as they say in the know sent to kaituna for the scrip lying in the hands of dombrain after some difficulty archie who acted as her agent obtained it from the unwilling dombrain and sent all the scrip to the value of two thousand shares out to toby with a power of attorney authorising him to deal with them as he judged best acting by the advice of his stockbroker toby judged it best to hold the scrip as the shares were on the rise and in a few days his confidence in the mine was justified a lode was discovered in the pole star ground which was said to rival the celebrated comstock lode in california which sent all frisco mad in the old days and the shares began to rise rapidly so rapidly indeed that toby was justified in thinking that kaituna would be a great heiress after all they went from nothing up to twenty pounds a share again by slow gradations they rose to fifty pounds each and toby wanted to sell but his stockbroker still advised him to hold in a month they were worth one hundred pounds each and toby still held on the excitement in melbourne was intense and other silver mining companies began to spring round the famous pole star in several of which toby invested the salary he drew from the weekly scorpion the surrounding mines were very fluctuating in the share market but the pole star itself never faltered for a moment in its upward career and at the end of three months toby wired to maxwell that the shares were now worth the enormous value of two hundred pounds each maxwell in a state of great excitement consulted mrs belswin and kaituna and they considering that a bird in the hand was worth two in the bush decided to sell at that price instructions were wired out to clendon to realise without delay which he did carefully by selling the shares in parcels as two thousand thrown on the market for no apparent cause would have caused a drop in the price the selling took some time but at the end of a month or so the whole two thousand were disposed of and the amount standing to the credit of miss kaituna pethram in the bank of australia was somewhere about four hundred thousand pounds which was certainly a very respectable fortune for a girl formerly penniless kaituna herself was wild with joy and wanted to marry maxwell at once but strange to say he that had urged on the marriage when she was poor now held back lest it should be said he was marrying her for her money mrs belswin however promptly settled all that and talked him over into getting married at once then a letter was received from toby saying that he also had been successful in mining speculations to the amount of some thousands and was on his way home to miss valpy and matrimony ultimately the two girls decided that they would be married in the same way and archie felt deeply grateful that things had turned out so well while mrs belswin confident now that kaitunas happiness was secured both as regards income and marriage looked upon her lifes work as over of course she had to reckon with ferrari who still urged her to marry him and as she had told archie that she was engaged to the italian she did not very well see how she was going to escape this match which was decidedly repugnant to her as it separated her from her child and gave her to a man for whom she cared nothing belk also hinted that his intentions were matrimonial as soon as he had amassed sufficient money so mrs belswin lamented the good looks which had placed her between two matrimonial fires while she was in this unpleasant situation fate in the person of mr dombrain intervened and decided the question in a highly unpleasant manner after his failure to convict ferrari and belk of the crime of murder archie had quite given up the idea of finding out the assassin and kaituna began to think that he would never be discovered she proposed to archie when they were married to devote their newly gained wealth to seeking out the cowardly assassin but maxwell who had grave doubts about mrs belswin ferrari and belk endeavoured to dissuade her it will be said that if maxwell had doubts like this why did he permit kaituna to remain with the companion but the fact is all his doubts were very undecided he could not accuse mrs belswin as he had no evidence to go on so he was forced to remain quiet and let things take their course in the acquirement of the money through the pole star mine in thinking of the double marriage soon to take place the death of sir rupert was beginning to be almost forgotten when suddenly it was brought to the minds of all interested by a terrible event mrs belswin was arrested on a charge of having committed the murder chapter xxxiii mr dombrain shows his teeth an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth that as i take it is bibletruth you have robbed me of my good name i will bring you to want and shame both are wicked so both shall fall god in his heaven shall judge of it all mrs belswin brought it all on herself she would play with fire and although a lifelong experience had taught her how dangerous was that pastime she nevertheless indulged in it even at the risk of burning her fingers indeed so many times had she rushed into danger in her fierce impulsive way and so many times had she emerged scatheless by sheer good luck that she became reckless in her daring and at last the inevitable happenedshe went too far everything was now progressing smoothly both with herself and with those she loved kaituna had received an unexpected access of fortune so that the difficulties of her marriage with archie maxwell were now removed by the power of gold and mrs belswin herself living constantly with her darling had now nothing left to wish for yes there was one thing she desired and that was to see silas oates in order to taunt him with the news of her good fortune it was sheer devilry made her do this as she cared nothing for her old lover but some fiend having whispered in her ear that good fortune to her would be gall and wormwood to the american she one day went straight to the langham hotel in order to enjoy her triumph luckily for himself oates was absent in paris at the time where he had gone on a matter of business but on his return he found mrs belswins card and naturally enough being ignorant of her real object in paying him a visit thought she had called for the sole purpose of getting more money out of him silas oates in a most unjust fashion did not blame his quondam ladylove for her persistency knowing her real nature too well to expect anything from her but he blamed mr dombrain for not keeping his promise and making mrs belswin stop her pecuniary importunities the lady herself had entirely forgotten mr dombrain and his threats or if she did remember them it was with a contemptuous sneer as she thought in her own heart that he could do nothing to harm her but if mrs belswin thus proved forgetful of the solicitor silas oates did not mr oates was genuinely angry at the way dombrain permitted mrs belswin to annoy him so as the unfortunate lawyer had omitted to fulfil his promise of acting as watchdog the american determined to punish him as he had threatened for his negligence silas went about the affair in a way peculiarly his own and in a very few days mr dombrain received a letter demanding an explanation of certain allegations concerning his past made against him by an american gentleman the unfortunate man was quite stunned at the suddenness of his calamity nor was he comforted when a spiteful note arrived from silas which stated that he had revealed everything about the convict damberton to the law society as a punishment for the negligence of the lawyer dombrain of course the poor wretch could not defend himself although he made a feeble attempt to do so and the consequence of mrs belswins folly and mr oatess letter was that alfred dombrain of london solicitor was struck off the rolls as not fit to have his name inscribed thereon it was truly a terrible thing to happen to this man who not having saved much money now found himself reduced from an honourable profession which gained him a competence to a disgraceful position and absolute beggary the loss of his money troubled him but little the loss of his name a great deal for having once more regained the esteem of his fellowmen by years of exemplary life he felt keenly the bitterness of being reduced to the same ignoble position he had occupied years before he tried every means in his power to escape the disgrace but the law society were relentless and dombrain lawyer once more became that phantom of the pastdamberton outcast neither lawyer nor outcast however were satisfied to accept this crushing blow without making some return thereto and when mr dombrain found that all his ideas of respectability were at an end he turned round venomously to punish mrs belswin whom he considered to be the main cause of his unmerited disgrace he did not write to her he did not see her he did not even mention her name to a soul but he went straight to the nearest police magistrate told his story of what had taken place at thornstream on that fatal night and as a result obtained a warrant of arrest against mrs belswin for the murder of sir rupert pethram this being done he departed in company with two detectives to feast his eyes on the disgrace of this woman who had cost him his hardly earned position and for the first time for many days he laughednot a pleasant laugh but a nasty sardonic sneering laugh which boded ill to the liberty and peace of mind of jezebel manners alias lady pethram alias mrs belswin in spite of the tragic force of the whole matter there was something positively grotesque in the situation for silas oates wronged by mrs belswin had revenged himself upon mr dombrain and mr dombrain wronged by silas oates had revenged himself upon mrs belswin it was a threecornered duel to speak paradoxically in which every one shot at every one else but the only person of the three principals who came off scotfree was the american and he appreciated the grim irony of the situation meanwhile mrs belswin quite unaware how dearly her attempt to see oates had cost her was seated in company with kaituna and archie maxwell at afternoon tea and the trio were talking about the pole star shares the expected arrival of toby clendon and of course about the approaching marriages and you will be perfectly happy kaituna said mrs belswin looking wistfully at her daughterthe daughter whom she dare not acknowledge kaituna caught hold of archies hand with a quick flush and a look of delight in her large black eyes yes perfectly happy she replied smiling we are going to be the darby and joan of romance are we not archie i trust so dear but darby and joan oh what a prosaic comparison no kaituna we will belet me thinkwe will be like lord lovel and lady nancy bell in the old ballad fie that is a worse comparison than mine they were unhappy and if a red rose and a briar did grow out of their respective graves i dont know that such a miracle proves your case well you certainly ought to be happy said mrs belswin with a quick sigh as she realised how soon she was to lose the girl she loved health wealth and lovewhat a trinity of perfections all of which are to be found in kaituna but you mrs belswin what about signor ferrari oh i have not made up my mind yet to marry him mr maxwell besides i have another offer another offer cried kaituna gaily oh fortunate woman and from whom mr samson belk oh said maxwell smiling he is the other romeo in the field well he is certainly very handsome and is very fond of me interrupted mrs belswin quickly but all the same i am not for him nor for signor ferrari either laughed kaituna going over to her chaperon and putting her arms round her neck ah there is a third person i think you can pretty well guess whom that third person is said mrs belswin kissing the girl but mr maxwell is going to rob me of my third person i cannot deny the soft impeachment replied archie with a gay nod as soon as toby comes home we will be married the talk was certainly frivolous but then after all the trials these three people had undergone it was a great relief to chatter idly in a desultory manner especially when all three beheld the brightness of the future for them the storms and trials of life had passedso they fondly thought and the elder woman looking back at the dismal past thanked god in her heart for the peaceful present while the lovers saw before them nothing but a shining path strewn with roses leading to the paradise of perfect felicity at this moment a knock came at the door and the servant entered with a frightened look on her face oh mum she said going quickly to mrs belswin there are three gentleman to see you who are they asked mrs belswin in some surprise never thinking for a moment of the coming storm mr dombrain mum and mr dombrain repeated mrs belswin with a chill of fear at her heart what does he want i want you jezebel manners said dombrain making his appearance at the door with a malignant grin on his coarse red face the moment she heard the name mrs belswin knew it was all over and with a cry of agony held out her imploring hands to the lawyer oh not before her not before her she moaned piteously kaituna overcome with astonishment at this strange scene went up to mrs belswin as if to protect her but the woman shrank from her with a moan of pain and hid her face in her hands what does this mean demanded maxwell as soon as he recovered his breath you will soon know retorted dombrain savagely jezebel manners pethram belswin or whatever name you like to call yourself i warned you the last time we met what i would do if you played me false you have done so to my ruin my shame my disgrace and i have come to drag you down to where you have hurled me this is the woman officers one of the detectives advanced and touched mrs belswin on the shoulder in the queens name i arrest you arrest her interrupted kaituna her face flaming with indignation but for whatfor what for the murder of rupert pethram kaituna gave a shriek of horror and seized maxwell by the arm while he scarcely less thunderstruck stared at the detective with a look of amazement on his face it is false it is false shrieked mrs belswin throwing herself on her knees before kaituna i swear to you it is false i did not kill your father you did said dombrain in a deep voice i saw you do it liar mrs belswin sprang to her feet and made a bound forward with a fierce light flashing in her eyes and it would have been a bad thing for mr dombrain had she succeeded in reaching him the detective however was on the watch and throwing himself on the wretched woman had the handcuffs on her wrists in a moment i cannot believe it i cannot believe it moaned kaituna hiding her face on maxwells breastmrs belswin my kind good friend your friend scoffed dombrain with an ugly glitter in his ferretlike eyes yes you dont know who your friend is for gods sake silence shrieked mrs belswin pale to the lips no i will not keep silence you fiend who have ruined me i will tell all miss pethram do you see that wretched woman with the handcuffs onthat guilty wretch who murdered your father that i see mrs belswin cried kaituna with sudden fire i see the woman who saved me from starvation and i do not believe this base charge you make with noble indignation she walked across to mrs belswin and threw her arm round the poor womans neck while archie who respected and liked the companion mutely approved of the girls generous action ah you put your arm on her neck now said dombrain with a sneer but you will take it away when you know dombrain cried the wretched woman for the last time spare mespare me i will spare you as you have spared me be silent with your cowardly threats sir said kaituna looking proudly at him and do your worst who is mrs belswin your mother kaituna gave a cry and recoiled from her companion my mother she said hoarsely it cannot be my mother is dead dombrain played his trump card your mother is alive she stands there and you can now know her for what she isa guilty wifea divorced womanand the murderer of her husband kaituna gazed at this gibing devil with a terrified stare in her dilated eyes then turned slowly and looked at her miserable mother the unhappy woman with a grey worn face haggard and scarred with myriad wrinkles made a step forward as if to embrace her child but the girl with a look of terror shrank back and fell in a faint on the floor at the feet of maxwell while mrs belswin sank on her knees with a piteous cry wringing her manacled hands over the unconscious form of the daughter she had foundand lost chapter xxxiv in open court whos sure of lifes game when fate interferes for praise or for blame whos sure of lifes game a sentencea name turns joy into tears whos sure of lifes game when fate interferes this strange caseparticulars of which in some mysterious way got into the daily papersexcited much curiosity in london and when the preliminary inquiry into the affair took place the court was crowded to suffocation the public of course learned all about the matter from the newspapers but how the reporters managed to learn so much was most extraordinary as they gave an account of mrs belswins previous lifeof her presence under a false name in the house of her late husbandof the murder of that husbandand of the wonderful amount of money realised by the sale of the pole star shares for the daughter of the murdered man and the woman accused of the crime all this more or less garbled and exaggerated appeared in the leading morning papers and the pethram paradoxso it was calledtook a prominent place among the sensations of the day maxwell deeply angered at this publicity which would make the public judge mrs belswin guilty before she had a chance of defending herself made several attempts to find dombrain whom he suspected of being the author of this malignant gossip in order to damage the chance of the unfortunate woman during her trial but mr dombrain suspecting that he would be looked for made himself scarce and until the day of the preliminary inquiry nothing was seen or heard of him by those on the side of mrs belswin kaituna noblehearted girl as she was persistently refused to believe her mother guilty and through maxwell engaged the most prominent legal talent of the day for her defence but although she sought an interview with mrs belswin in jail the unhappy woman persistently refused to see her until she was publicly proved innocent of the terrible crime laid to her charge at this trying time archie maxwell proved himself worthy of the high opinion entertained of him by kaituna and acting as mrs belswins friend did everything in his power to assist her during the coming ordeal signor ferrari too mad with impulsive italian wrath at the accusation made by mr dombrain offered himself as a witness but on discovering that his evidence would be detrimental to mrs belswins defence the lawyer declined to take advantage of his offer as for belk whom maxwell thought would be one of the first to come forward and help the unhappy woman he professed to love he kept persistently out of the way and neither by word nor deed showed that he took the least interest in her fate when the day of the preliminary inquiry therefore came mrs belswin was left with only three friends who believed in her innocencekaituna maxwell and ferrari who were all present in court when she was placed in the prisoners dock she looked terribly pale and haggard for mrs belswin having one of those natures which are only strong through impulse was quite unable to bear up against the calamity which had befallen her all her fierceness her iron nerve her reckless daring which had successfully coped with so many perils had now deserted her for this blow so long dreaded having descended she seemed unable to fight against it and stood silently in the dock a pale weeping woman quite unlike the borgialike creature of other days the follower of mahomet will fight bravely as long as fortune goes with him but when the tide turns and he believes that it is the will of allah that evil should befall him he says kismet and bows to the decree of heaven mrs belswin behaved in exactly the same wayshe had fought bravely against overwhelming odds to keep her daughter and her secret but now that the worst had come she thought it useless to struggle against destiny so resigned herself to the inevitable the counsel for the prosecution stated that this was one of the most painful cases that had ever come under his notice it would be remembered that some months previously the public had been horrified to hear of the murder of sir rupert pethram of thornstream berkshire who had been shot while standing at the window of his study in spite of the utmost vigilance of the police the person who had committed this dastardly crime could not be discovered but now by the evidence of mr alfred dombrain the prisoner was accused of being the guilty person the chain of circumstances which culminated in the committal of this crime were so extraordinary that he would take leave to inform the court of the whole affair and the motive for the murder would be clearly proved against the prisoner it appears that many years ago the deceased baronetwho at that time had not succeeded to the titlehad married in new zealand where he was then living the prisoner jezebel manners who was a halfcaste the daughter of a maori mother and a european father a woman of violent and rash temper one child was born of the marriage which turned out to be very unhappy and eventually mrs pethram eloped with an american called silas oates the late baronet obtained a decree absolute against her and remained in new zealand where he looked after the welfare of his motherless child while his divorced wife went to san francisco with the corespondent oates the divorced woman and her lover were together for some time but he ultimately left her evidently being quite unable to bear with her outrageous temper the prisoner then went on the stage and sang successfully in opera for many years under the name of madame tagni finally about eight months previously she came to england and found that her husband by the death of his brother had succeeded to the title and was living at thornstream in berkshire with his daughter kaituna the prisoner anxious to see her child again concocted a scheme by which to enter the house as a companion to miss pethram sir rupert had gone out to new zealand on business and according to his instructions mr dombrain advertised for a companion for miss pethram during his absence the prisoner applied and was engaged for the situation by mr dombrain who was quite in ignorance of her antecedents and her connection with the late baronet she took possession of the situation and while sir rupert was absent everything went well on his arrival however he had an interview with the socalled mrs belswin and recognising his guilty wife ordered her out of the house this interview took place at night about nine oclock in the study at thornstream and mrs belswin left the house by the window vowing vengeance for the course adopted by her husband instead therefore of going away she lurked outside on the terrace and when her husband came to the window she shot him with a pistol she had in her possession having committed this terrible crime she had coolly stepped across the body of the man she had murdered and reentering the house went to her bedroom all the household being ignorant alike of her interview with the late baronet and her antecedents she was never for a moment suspected except by mr dombrain that gentleman hearing the noise of mrs belswin coming upstairs looked out of the door of his bedroom and saw her pass him next morning when the crime was known he would have denounced her but owing to the darkness of the night was unable to be certain of the identity of the woman who crept upstairs the other day however he taxed mrs belswin with the crime and although she denied it yet from her agitated manner he felt certain she was the criminal upon which he at once gave information to the police mrs belswin was arrested on a warrant and now stood charged with the murder of her late husband sir rupert pethram the first and only witness he would call would be mr alfred dombrain upon whose accusation the prisoner had been arrested this skilfully worded speech made things look very black against mrs belswin and when dombrain stepped into the witnessbox to substantiate the terrible statements made by the counsel for the prosecution there were many who looked upon the prisoners committal for trial as a foregone conclusion mr dombrain having been duly sworn stated that he had acted as the legal adviser of the late baronet and in pursuance of his instructions had engaged the prisoner as a companion for miss pethram he was wholly ignorant of her former life and that she was the divorced wife of the late sir rupert but as she seemed a suitable person for a chaperon he had engaged her at once upon which she went down to thornstream in order to take up her duties upon the arrival of sir rupert in england he had gone down to thornstream in connection with some legal business the late baronet wished to see him about mrs belswin was not at thornstream on his arrival as she had gone to london a few days previous about some private matter but she arrived at thornstream on the same afternoon as he did she did not appear at dinner but on leaving the study after an interview with sir rupert he had seen the prisoner enter as she did not reappear in the drawingroom where he was sitting with miss pethram he retired to bed and he believed miss pethram also retired to bed having a bad headache towards eleven oclock he thought he heard the sound of a shot but was not certain although he sprang out of bed and went to the door of his room it was near the staircase and as he leaned over the banisters in the darkness he heard the study door shut with a slight noise after which mrs belswin came hastily upstairs and went into her own room next morning when the crime was discovered she said she had not been out of her room at that hour he was not quite sure if it was mrs belswin as the staircase was dark a week ago she came to his office on business and he accused her of having committed the murder which accusation she at first denied but afterwards half confessed to her guilt he at once gave information to the police and she was arrested in crossexamination mr dombrain said he had found out all about the prisoners relations with the deceased from some papers in his possession and knew mrs belswin was the divorced wife from the description given of her in the handwriting of the deceased counsel for the accusedi see that at the inquiry into the death of sir rupert you said you had not heard a pistolshot mr dombraini was not certain and sooner than declare i heard i thought it best to reply in the negative counselis it not true mr dombrain that you have a grudge against the prisoner dombrainno it is not true counselthe prisoner declares that she knew you in new zealand dombrainit is a lie i never was in new zealand counselnot under the name of damberton dombrainno counseli understand your name has been struck off the rolls dombraini dont see what that has to do with the case counselah you are rather dense i will explain your real name is alfred damberton you were imprisoned in new zealand for embezzlement and on your release you came to england is this not true dombrain violentlyno sir it is false who accuses me the prisonerand why because i have brought her to justice through her lies i have been struck off the rolls but i can prove myself innocent and will do so shortly counseli wish you every success mr dombrain but i am afraid you will find it difficult when dombrain left the witnessbox the counsel for the prosecution said he had no more witnesses to call at present upon which the counsel for the defence made a short speech and said that as his learned brother had set the example of brevity he would do the same thing and only call one witness in defence of the prisoner the name of that witness was samson belk mrs belswin looked surprised when she heard this name not for a moment thinking that belks evidence could do her any good and kaituna also appeared to be astonished as she knew how belk had kept out of the way since her mothers arrest maxwells face however wore a contented smile and this smile was reflected in the countenance of the defending counsel so without doubt these two men knew that belks evidence was valuable and were prepared to abide by the result samson belk stepping into the witnessbox made oath according to law and gave the following remarkable evidence in favour of the prisoner he had been steward to the deceased baronet and on the night of the murder had come up to the hall to ask his master a question about the discharge of farm hands if was nearly eleven oclock when he arrived at the door of the hall and he hesitated whether to disturb sir rupert at that hour however seeing the light streaming out of the window of sir ruperts study he advanced along in that direction but on hearing angry voices he had hidden himself behind a bush on the terrace in order to see what was the matter the voices were those of sir rupert and another man whose tones he did not recognise the other man was imploring sir rupert to keep some secret but the baronet refused and said all the world would know the truth on the morrow the man began to threaten and sir rupert thrust him out of the window on to the terrace telling him he would ruin him by revealing everything so strong had been the baronets push that the man fell down upon the side of the terrace near the balustrade and sir rupert with outstretched hand stood pointing at him the light of the lamp within shone on the man crouching at the baronets feet and i saw him take out somethingi did not know whatand point it at sir rupert who stood in the window there was no sound and yet the baronet fell and the man with a cry of triumph rushed away into the darkness witness ran forward to see what was the matter with his master and found him dead he the witness had had a quarrel with sir rupert on that day and being afraid lest if he gave the alarm he should be accused of the murder and could not defend himself he went away and said nothing about it the crime was discovered next morning but no suspicion was fixed upon him as no one had known of his presence on the terrace that night counsel for the prosecutionbut could you not denounce the man who committed the crime belki did not know who he wasi never saw him before or since the light fell on him through the window until counsel for the prosecutionuntil when belkuntil i saw him today there was a great sensation in court and every one looked at one another in astonishment while a gleam of triumph flashed from the eyes of the prisoner counsel for the prosecutionif you saw him today as you say do you know his name belkyes counsel for the prosecutionand the name of this man who killed sir rupert belkthe man who accuses the prisoner of the murderthe man you call dombrain if there was excitement before there was ten times more excitement now and the crier found great difficulty in reducing all present to silence there was a sudden pause in the noise and the prisoner raising her eyes to heaven said in a solemn voice it is true i am innocent of this crime he has fallen himself into the pit he digged for another yes she was innocent and the man who accused her guilty but when they looked for dombrain in order to arrest him he had disappearedvanished into the depths of mighty london when he heard his name coupled with that of murder chapter xxxv expiation what fools are they who think god ever sleeps or views their follies with a careless eye fortune may heap her favours on their heads blithe pleasure lull them with her jingling bells and life for them be one long carnival but in their triumph of prosperity when all the smiling future seems serene god frowning stretches out his mighty arm and lo the hungry grave gapes at their feet so mrs belswin was delivered from her great peril and was taken home by kaituna and her lover with great rejoicing maxwell indeed after hearing the story of this woman had hesitated for a moment as to whether he ought to let her be with her daughter seeing that she had forfeited her maternal rights by her own act but when he hinted this to kaituna she rebuked him with one sentence she is my mother so maxwell held his peace and after mrs belswin had been released from her position of ignominy and shame he had escorted both mother and daughter to their lodgings there he left them and at mrs belswins request went to seek for belk and bring him there to receive the thanks of the woman he had saved having departed on his errand kaituna sat down beside her mother in order to hear from her own lips the story of her sad life with many sobs mrs belswin told the whole pitiful story of her sin which had brought her to such a bitter repentance and when she had ended fell weeping at the feet of the daughter she feared now would despise her ah she little knew the tenderness which the girl had cherished for her mother and which she cherished for her even now when the dead saint had changed into the living sinner pitifullytenderly she raised her mother from her abject position of sorrow and kissed away the bitter tears of shame and agony that fell down the hollow cheeks mother she said clasping her arms round the poor womans breast if you have sinned you have also suffered the one false step you made has brought its own punishment but why did you not tell me all this before and so have saved yourself this bitter agony tell you before said her mother sadly child child what good would such a confession have done you could not have helped me no dearest but i could have loved you i could have made your life less hard oh mother poor mother how you must have suffered when i treated you as a stranger i did suffer replied mrs belswin in a low tone but not so much as you think for even then you treated me more like a mother than as a companion and i was the little child of whom you spoke yes dear oh blind blind how could i have been so blind as not to guess your secret you betrayed yourself in a hundred ways my poor mother but i never saw it but nownow that i know the truth i see how blind i have been ah kaituna if i had only known you would have received me like this but i feared to tell you of my shame lest you should turn from me in scorn hush dear mother hush and it was terrible to think that the little child i had borne at my breast should spurn me mother oh my sin my sin wailed mrs belswin rocking herself to and fro how it has cursed my lifehow it has turned the earth into a hell of repentance do not say another word mother cried kaituna wiping the tears from her mothers eyes the past is dead we will speak of it no more but the future ah my child the future for you is bright you will marry your lover and have him by your side during the rest of your life but ichild i must leave you leave me yes you know what i am you know my sin my folly my shame i cannot look into your clear eyes my child for i have lost the right to be your mother no kaituna while you did not know me and believed your mother to be a pure good woman i stayed beside you to love you and hear you talk of me as i once was but nownowah no no i dare not remain in your presence i dare not kiss you for my kisses would pollute your lips i will go awayfar away and expiate my sin but mother you will not leave me it is for your good childit is for your good you shall not leave me said kaituna winding her arms round the elder womans neck you have suffered enough for your sin and for the rest of your days i will help you to forget the past archie thinks the same as i do come mother you will not leave me promise to stay beside me for ever i cannot promise cried mrs belswin breaking away from the tender bonds that held her oh what a paradox i am when you did not know me i wished to stay now you know i am your wretched guilty mother i wish to fly i must go i must seek not to detain me child as ye sow so shall ye reap the bible kaituna the biblelet me go to my harvest mrs belswin with her savage nature maddened by the mental agonies she had undergone had worked herself up into one of those uncontrollable fits of passion which made her so dangerous she had found her child and now she was going to leave her of her own freewill because she could not bear to live with her own daughter who knew how vile she was with a cry of agony unable to bear any more implorings from kaituna she flew to the door in order to escape but her daughter who was determined not to let the poor distraught creature go perhaps to her death sprang after her and wrenching her away flung herself back against the door with outstretched arms no no she cried panting with excitement that way lies death oh mother mother i know what you would do but do not leave me if you have any pity in your heart for the child you bore let me keep you ever at my side where would you go out into the darkness of londonto the terrible stormy streetsto the riverah the river is that what you think no no mother my own dear mother you must not let me mourn your death twice the evening sun was shining through the windows touching the furniture the draperies the mirrors with soft gleams of light and kaituna with her head thrown back and her arms outstretched stood against the door while mrs belswin with a sudden cessation of her mad anguish stared vacantly at her daughter and round the room ah what was that gleaming in the sunlight from behind a heavy purple curtainsteelthe barrel of a pistol and it was pointed full at kaituna with a shriek of rage mrs belswin guessing the truth sprang in front of her daughter to shield her from harm and in another moment had fallen in a heap at the feet of the child she loved there was no sound of a report and kaituna in a state of horrified amazement fell on her knees beside her mother as she did so a man ran from behind the curtain and wrenching open the door flung down a pistol and spoke rapidly i wanted to kill you he said with a snarl to punish her but she came between you and the pistol so let her die as she deserves to with my curses on her with a shriek kaituna recognised him it was dombrain and she sprang to her feet to seize him but eluding her grasp he ran out of the door and down the stairs into the street kaituna could not follow him as her limbs tottered under her but she managed to drag herself back to her motherthe mother alas who was dying the red blood was welling slowly from a wound in her breast and a thick sluggish stream was stealing heavily along the polished floor lifting the dying womans head on her lap the girl cried aloud for help upon which the servant came rushing in she shrieked when she saw mrs belswin lying unconscious in her blood and ran out to call in aidran right into the arms of maxwell belk and ferrari who were just entering help help cried the servant rushing past them a doctora doctor she is dying kaituna exclaimed archie with a sudden fear in his breast and without a moments pause the three men rushed into the room where the girl was sitting with a look of agony on her pale face as she bent over the unconscious woman kaitunamrs belswin it is my mothermy poor mother cried kaituna in an agony of sorrow have you caught him have you caught him who shouted maxwell and belk while ferrari in a paroxysm of grief threw himself beside the body of the woman he loved dombrain dombrain yes yes he was here he shot my mother with that pistol he has just left the house god cried belk starting he was the man we saw running down the street and he was out of the room in pursuit without saying another word a doctor a doctor said kaituna imploringly oh archie she will die she will die stella adora moaned the italian covering the cold white hand with kisses a doctor will be here in a few minutes said maxwell approaching the unconscious form of mrs belswin the servant has gone for one ferrari help me to place her on the sofa but ferrari could do nothing but tear his hair and cry endearing words in italian to the woman he loved so kaituna pale as marble but wonderfully brave helped archie to place mrs belswin on the sofa she was breathing heavily and maxwell tearing open her dress strove to staunch the blood with his handkerchief while ferrari remained on his knees and kaituna stood beside him with clasped hands good heavens she will bleed to death just as maxwell spoke the doctor entered with the scared servant and at once proceeded to examine the wound having done so he looked very grave and kaituna caught him by the arm with a cry of terror as he arose from his knees she will live she will live say she will live im afraid not my dear young lady said the doctor gravely the bullet has gone right through the lungs do you think she will die doctor asked maxwell in a tone of horror yes i am sure of it die cried the italian wildly no no lucreziamy beautiful lucreziayou must not die take that man away said the doctor sharply and get me some brandy kaituna was the first to obey the nerve of this girl was wonderful and notwithstanding all the agonies she had come through she gave no sign of fainting and the terrible strain on her mind could only be told by the pallor of her face my brave girl said archie as he assisted her to get what the doctor required how slowly the hours passed in that room where this poor woman was dying yes dying for although the doctor did all in his power to save her life there was no hope that she would live through the night she was still lying on the sofa from which she was unable to be removed and when she recovered consciousness after the shock she had sustained she opened her eyes to see kaituna kneeling fondly by her side and maxwell belk ferrari and the doctor in the background belk had not been able to find the assassin who was lost among the crowds that thronged the streets so had returned in an agony of grief to see the woman he loved die before his eyes without being able to save her so strange the scene was in this little drawingroom with the couch upon which rested the dying woman standing near the piano the glitter of mirrors and ornaments in the dim candlelight and the silent group standing round the one who was passing away outside the sunlight had died out of the sky the purple twilight deepened to night and the melancholy light of the moon streamed in through the windows the blinds of which no one had troubled to pull down in the passage crouched the servant sobbing as if her heart would break but kaituna could not cry she could only kneel there with tearless eyes and a look of anguish on her white face watching her mother die kaituna said mrs belswin faintly i am here dear mother you are not hurt no no thank god said her mother with a tone of joy in her weak voice i have paid the debt with your lifewith your life moaned the girl wringing her hands in despair doctor can you do nothing nothing i know i am dying went on mrs belswin in a stronger voice having swallowed some restorative it is better so hush hush my poor child god knows what is best if i sinned against you in the past he has permitted me to expiate that sin by saving you from death archie take her take my darling and make her a good husband as there is a god above i will said maxwell solemnly taking the now weeping girl in his arms my poor stephano is it you ah cara miacara mia cried ferrari throwing himself on his knees beside the sofa do not leave medo not alas stephano it is not in my power weep weep poor heart your tears show me how much love i have lostlove that i did not deserve and i said belk coming forward you are a good man said the dying woman faintly stretching out her hand you will find some one to love you better than i would have done never ah never believe me what i say is true ah she cried with a terrified look on her face kaituna my dearest in a moment kaituna was on her knees again bending over her mother with the hot tears falling from her eyes mother mother would you like to see a clergyman no my darling no i have sinnedi have sinned bitterly but perhaps god in his mercy will accept the expiation archie be good to my little child oh my little girl whom i lost for so many weary weary years put your arms your dear arms round me and let the outcast die on the bosom of her child the murmuring noise from the street penetrated into the room the dim light of the candles flickered and flared in the faint breath of the wind and there was silence among all kneeling there save for the sobs of kaituna and the broken mutterings of the dying woman repeating a prayer our father which art in heavenoh my child my child will he forgive mewill he forgive me im sure he will mother half a savage half civilised ah if i had only been guided i might have been a good woman but we were both wrong rupert and kaituna my little child ii am leaving you oh my babykiss me my dearestmy little her head fell inertly on the encircling arm of the girl and kaituna knew by the terribly calm look on the placid face that not all her lovenot all her moneynot all her prayers had availed to save from death this mother whom she had lost and foundthis mother who had sinned and repentedthis mother who had given her life to save that of her child chapter xxxvi a memory of the past de mortuisyou know the phrase i think a kindly saying such as poor humanity mutters at times when talking of the dead therefore i pray you speak not any ill of this poor soul who suffered sinned and died seeing her sinning brought her but to this yourself when gone may need a pitying word when all your virtues with you are entombed and naught remains but sins to curse your name so it was dombrain after all who had committed this crime and by accusing mrs belswin of the murder placed her life in jeopardy in order both to revenge and save himself had it not been for the unexpected evidence of samson belk without doubt the unhappy woman would have been found guilty and suffered in the place of the astute mr dombrain when this exlawyer exconvict and constant blackguard heard himself accused of the crime he slipped out of the court and vanished before he could be arrested knowing that he could make no defence part of his evidence was true for he had been in the drawingroom he had seen mrs belswin enter the study but here his truth ceased and his lies began fearing lest his name should be mentioned by the infuriated woman during the interview which would be sure to end in the discomfiture of mrs belswin the lawyer trembling for his respectable position went to his bedroom and took his airpistol so as to be prepared for emergencies it is but fair to mr dombrain to say that he had no intention of using the weapon unless everything was lost so creeping out of the house he placed himself beside the open window of the study in order to hear what mrs belswin would say in accordance with his expectations she did tell sir rupert all about him and when dombrain heard the declaration of the baronet that he would denounce him he knew that all was lost and that the sin of his early youth was going to cost him the respectable position of his middle age when mrs belswin thrust forth by her unforgiving husband fled out into the night dombrain trembling sick at heart at seeing all that made his life worth living vanish crouched still beside the window and here sir rupert who had come out to make sure that his divorced wife had taken herself off found him then an interview between the lawyer and the baronet took place in which the latter swore to reveal all the infamy of dombrain and have him struck off the rolls in vain the wretched man pleaded for mercy coldly and inflexibly the baronet thrust him out of doors the same way he had done his wife and then mad with anger at the terrible future before him dombrain shot sir rupert in the manner described by belk in the witnessbox after committing the crime and assuring himself that his victim was dead he coolly stepped across the body and took refuge in his own room from whence he did not emerge for the rest of the night it was true as he said that his room was near the head of the staircase for he saw mrs belswin leave the study as he described so it was then that the idea came into his head to secure himself by sacrificing her and thus both save and revenge himself at one time on leaving the court after having been denounced by belk his rage against all the world for his thwarted revenge and his perilous position knew no bounds he had no idea of escaping justice but determined before he was seized to punish the woman who hadas he believeddragged him down even lower than his former position then he had simply embezzled money but now he had committed a crime for which he would lose his life and thus seeing that his doom was fixed he determined that mrs belswin should suffer for placing him in such a perilous position with this idea in his head he took the airpistol with which he had killed sir rupert and went to the lodgings of the dead mans daughter and mrs belswin skilfully managing to evade the notice of the servant he ensconced himself behind the curtains in the drawingroom and shot the unhappy woman as described at first knowing how bitter it would be to mrs belswin he had intended to kill kaituna but the unexpected action of the mother had saved the daughter from a terrible death satisfied with his work dombrain threw down the pistol and disappeareddisappeared into the depths of london from whence he never emerged what became of him nobody ever knew whether he took another name and resumed his profession in provincial england whether he left the country whether he died in the gutter no one ever discovered falling into the immense ocean of london like a drop of rain he became obliterated lost unknown but no doubt in due time he met his reward for his evil doings and his victim alas poor soul her troubles her trials her follies were all at an end and a simple cross marked the place where she was buried to that humble grave a year after the events described came mr and mrs maxwell in reverence for the memory of the womanthe mother who had given her life for that of her child maxwell had married kaituna in due course after a decent time had elapsed from the death of mrs belswin and later on he had gone to south america on business connected with his profession for in spite of kaitunas wealth archie could not bring himself to live upon her income he had gone away for a few months to buenos ayres and had now returned to the side of kaituna for ever after much difficulty she had persuaded him to accept her view of the question and share the proceeds of the pole star mine to this after much hesitation maxwell consented and now the husband and wife had arranged to make a tour of the world together before leaving england however they came to kensal green cemetery to pay a last visit to the grave of the woman who had sinned but who also had suffered poor mother said kaituna as she leaned on the strong arm of her husband what a terribly bitter life she had and her death was hardly less sad she saved you my darling replied maxwell with a fond smile and that in her eyes was recompense enough for the sudden ending of her life if that wretch who killed her had only been punished ive no doubt he is punished it is true he escaped the hands of men but i am certain he will not escape the punishment of god but come my dear kaituna these thoughts make you sad let us leave this dreary place yes but see archie that withered wreath of roses it has been placed there by ferrari i am sure but i thought he had gone to italy only three weeks ago he came to me and talked a great deal about our poor mother whom he loved very dearly in his own impulsive way but now he is back in his own country he no doubt will forget about her men have such short memories dont say that remember belk oh he will go the same way said kaituna a little bitterly certainly he behaved very well for he used to bring flowers here every week along with ferrari how these two men must have loved my mother she deserved their love replied maxwell after a pause she had sinned it is true but she was bitterly punished for her sin well she lies here and the two men who loved her have gone far awayone to italy the other to america ah all our friends go thus not all my dear remember toby clendon and his wife who are living so happily at deswarth we must go down and see them before we leave england no no said kaituna with a sudden shudder i cannot bear to go near thornstream after those terrible events which cost the lives of both my parents come dear one urged maxwell seeing how overcome she was with emotion let us go away one moment replied kaituna kneeling beside the grave i must say farewell to my poor mother and kneeling there in the long green grass she breathed a prayer for the soul of her unhappy mother whose natural love had cost her so dear maxwell who had removed his hat when he heard this prayer mount like incense to the throne of god quoted a text from the scriptures in a low voice she suffered much so much shall be forgiven of her the end
