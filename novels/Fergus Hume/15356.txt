surprise red money chapter i the drama of little things gypsies how very delightful i really must have my fortune told the dear things know all about the future as mrs belgrove spoke she peered through her lorgnette to see if anyone at the breakfasttable was smiling the scrutiny was necessary since she was the oldest person present and there did not appear to be any future for her save that very certain one connected with a funeral but a society lady of sixty made up to look like one of forty her maid could do no more with an excellent digestion and a constant desire like the athenians of old for something new can scarcely be expected to dwell upon such a disagreeable subject as death nevertheless mrs belgrove could not disguise from herself that her demise could not be postponed for many more years and examined the faces of the other guests to see if they thought so too if anyone did he and she politely suppressed a doubtful look and applauded the suggestion of a fortunetelling expedition let us make up a party and go said the hostess only too thankful to find something to amuse the houseparty for a few hours where did you say the gypsies were garvington in the abbots wood replied her husband a fat small roundfaced man who was methodically devouring a large breakfast thats only three miles away we can drive or ride or motor or bicycle or use shanks mare remarked miss greeby rather vulgarly not that any one minded such a speech from her as her vulgarity was merely regarded as eccentricity because she had money and brains an exceedingly long tongue and a memory of other peoples failings to match lord garvington made no reply as breakfast in his opinion was much too serious a business to be interrupted he reached for the marmalade and requested that a bowl of devonshire cream should be passed along his wife who was lean and anxiouslooking even for an august hostess looked at him wrathfully he never gave her any assistance in entertaining their numerous guests yet always insisted that the house should be full for the shooting season and being poor for a titled pair they could not afford to entertain even a shoeblack much less a crowd of hungry sportsmen and a horde of frivolous women who required to be amused expensively it was really too bad of garvington at this point the reflections of the hostess were interrupted by miss greeby who always had a great deal to say and who always tried as an american would observe to run the circus i suppose you men will go out shooting as usual she said in her sharp clear voice the men present collectively declared that such was their intention and that they had come to the manor for that especial purpose so it was useless to ask them or any one of them to go on a fortunetelling expedition when they could find anything of that sort in bond street and its all a lot of rot anyhow declared one sporting youth with obviously more muscle and money than brains no one can tell my fortune i can billy you will be prime minister flashed out miss greeby at which there was a general laugh then garvington threw a bombshell youd better get your fortunes told today if you want to he grunted wiping his mustache for tomorrow im going to have these rotters moved off my land straight away theyre thieves and liars so are many other people snapped miss greeby who had lost heavily at bridge on the previous night and spoke feelingly her host paid no attention to her theres been a lot of burglaries in this neighborhood of late i daresay these gypsies are mixed up in them burglaries cried mrs belgrove and turned pale under her rouge as she remembered that she had her diamonds with her oh its all right dont worry said garvington pushing back his chair they wont try on any games in this house while im here if any one tries to get in ill shoot the beast is that allowed by law asked an army officer with a shrug i dont know and i dont care retorted garvington an englishmans house is his castle you know and he can jolly well shoot any one who tries to get into it besides i shouldnt mind potting a burglar great sport youd ask his intentions first i presume said lady garvington tartly not me any one getting into the house after dark doesnt need his intentions to be asked id shoot what about romeo asked a poeticlooking young man he got into juliets house but did not come as a burglar he came as a guest i believe said a quiet silvery voice at the end of the table and every one turned to look at lady agnes pine who had spoken she was garvingtons sister and the wife of sir hubert pine the millionaire who was absent from the house party on this occasion as a rule she spoke little and constantly wore a sad expression on her pale and beautiful face and agnes pine really was beautiful being one of those tall slim willowylooking women who always look well and act charmingly and indeed her undeniable charm of manner probably had more to do with her reputation as a handsome woman than her actual physical grace with her dark hair and dark eyes her greek features and ivory skin faintly tinted with a tearose hue she looked very lovely and very sad why she should be was a puzzle to many women as being the wife of a superlatively rich man she had all the joys that money could bring her still it was hinted on good authoritybut no one ever heard the name of the authoritythat garvington being poor had forced her into marrying sir hubert for whom she did not care in the least people said that her cousin noel lambert was the husband of her choice but that she had sacrificed herself or rather had been compelled to do so in order that garvington might be set on his legs but lady agnes never gave any one the satisfaction of knowing the exact truth she moved through the social world like a gentle ghost fulfilling her duties admirably but apparently indifferent to every one and everything clippin to look at said the young men but tombs to talk to no sport at all but then the young men did not possess the key to lady agnes pines heart nor did her husband apparently her voice was very low and musical and every one felt its charm garvington answered her question as he left the room romeo or no romeo guest or no guest he said harshly ill shoot any beast who tries to enter my house come on you fellows we start in half an hour for the coverts when the men left the room miss greeby came and sat down in a vacant seat near her hostess what did garvington mean by that last speech she asked with a significant look at lady agnes oh my dear when does garvington ever mean anything said the other woman fretfully he is so selfish he leaves me to do everything well drawled miss greeby with a pensive look on her masculine features he looked at agnes when he spoke what do you mean demanded lady garvington sharply miss greeby gave a significant laugh i notice that mr lambert is not in the house she said carelessly but some one told me he was near at hand in the neighborhood surely garvington doesnt mean to shoot him clara the hostess sat up very straight and a spot of color burned on either sallow cheek i am surprised at you noel is staying in the abbots wood cottage and indulging in artistic work of some sort but he can come and stay here if he likes you dont mean to insinuate that he would climb into the house through a window after dark like a burglar thats just what i do mean retorted miss greeby daringly and if he does garvington will shoot him he said so he said nothing of the sort cried lady garvington angrily rising well he meant it i saw him looking at agnes and we know that sir hubert is as jealous as othello garvington is on guard i suppose and will you hold your tongue whispered the mistress of the manor furiously and she would have shaken miss greeby but that she had borrowed money from her and did not dare to incur her enmity agnes will hear you she is looking this way cant you see as if i cared laughed miss greeby pushing out her full lower lip in a contemptuous manner however for reasons best known to herself she held her peace although she would have scorned the idea that the hint of her hostess made her do so lady garvington saw that her guests were all chattering with one another and that the men were getting ready to leave for the days shooting so she went to discuss the dinner in the housekeepers room but all the time she and the housekeeper were arguing what lord garvington would like in the way of food the worried woman was reflecting on what miss greeby had said when the menu was finally settledno easy task when it concerned the master of the houselady garvington sought out mrs belgrove that juvenile ancient was sunning herself on the terrace in the hope of renewing her waning vitality and being alone permitted herself to look old she brisked up with a kittenish purr when disturbed and remarked that the hengishire air was like champagne my spirits are positively wild and wayward said the wouldbe hebe with a desperate attempt to be youthful ah you havent got the house to look after sighed lady garvington with a weary look and dropped into a basket chair to pour out her woes to mrs belgrove that person was extremely discreet as years of society struggling had taught her the value of silence her discretion in this respect brought her many confidences and she was renowned for giving advice which was never taken whats the matter my dear you look a hundred said mrs belgrove putting up her lorgnette with a chuckle as if she had made an original observation but she had not for lady garvington always appeared worn and weary and sallow and untidy she was the kind of absentminded person who depended upon pins to hold her garments together and who would put on her tiara crookedly for a drawingroom clara greebys a cat said poor worried lady garvington hunting for her pocket handkerchief which was rarely to be found has she been making love to garvington pooh no woman attracts garvington unless she can cook or knows something about a kitchen range i might as well have married a soup tureen im sure i dont know why i ever did marry him lamented the lady staring at the changing foliage of the park trees hes a pauper and a pig my dear although i wouldnt say so to every one i wish my mother hadnt insisted that i should attend cooking classes what on earth has that to do with it to do with what asked lady garvington absentmindedly i dont know what youre talking about im sure but mother knew that garvington was fond of a good dinner and made me attend those classes so as to learn to talk about french dishes we used to flirt about soups and creams and haunches of venison until he thought that i was as greedy as he was so he married me and ive been attending to his meals ever since why even for our honeymoon we went to mont st michel they make splendid omelettes there and garvington ate all the time ugh and the poor lady shuddered mrs belgrove saw that her companion was meandering and would never come to the point unless forced to face it so she rapped her knuckles with the lorgnette what about clara greeby she demanded sharply shes a cat oh were all cats mewing or spitting as the fit takes us said mrs belgrove comfortably i cant see why cat should be a term of opprobrium when applied to a woman cats are charmingly pretty animals and know what they want also how to get it well my dear i believe she was in love with noel herself ruminated lady garvington who was in love come to the point my dear jane clara greeby mrs belgrove laughed oh that ancient history every one who was anybody knew that clara would have given her eyesand very ugly eyes they areto have married noel lambert i suppose you mean him noel isnt a common name quite so you mean him well clara wanted to buy him he hasnt any money and as a bankers heiress she is as rich as a jew but he wouldnt have her why wouldnt he asked lady garvington waking upshe had been reflecting about a new soup which she hoped would please her husband clara has quite six thousand a year and doesnt look bad when her maid makes her dress in a proper manner and talking about maids mine wants to leave and shes too like boadicea interrupted mrs belgrove keeping her companion to the subject of miss greeby a masculine sort of hussy noel is far too artistic to marry such a maypole shes six foot two if shes an inch and her hands and feet mrs belgrove shuddered with a gratified glance at her own slim fingers you know the nonsense that garvington was talking about shooting a burglar said the other woman vaguely such nonsense for im sure no burglar would enter a house filled with nothing but early victorian furniture well well well said mrs belgrove impatiently clara beeby thought that garvington meant to shoot noel why in heavens name because noel is his heir im sure i cant help it if ive no children said lady garvington going off on another trailthe one suggested by mrs belgroves remark id be a happier woman if i had something else to attend to than dinners i wish we all lived on roots so that garvington could dig them up for himself my dear hed send you out with a trowel to do that said mrs belgrove humorously but why does garvington want to shoot noel oh he doesnt i never said he did clara greeby made the remark you see noel loved agnes before she married hubert and i believe he loves her still which isnt right seeing shes married and isnt half so goodlooking as she was and noel stopping at that cottage in the abbots wood painting in watercolors i think he is but im not sure if it isnt in oils and the well well well asked mrs belgrove again it isnt well at all when you think what a tongue clara greeby has snapped lady garvington she said if noel came to see agnes by night garvington taking him for a burglar might shoot him she insisted that he looked at agnes when he was talking about burglars and meant that what nonsense cried mrs belgrove vigorously at last having arrived at a knowledge of why lady garvington had sought her noel can come here openly so there is no reason he should steal here after dark well hes romantic you know dear and romantic people always prefer windows to doors and darkness to light the windows here are so insecure added lady garvington glancing at the facade above her untidy hair he could easily get in by sticking a penknife in between the upper and lower sash of the window it would be quite easy what nonsense you talk jane said mrs belgrove impatiently noel is not the man to come after a married woman when her husband is away i have known him since he was a harrow schoolboy so i have every right to speak where is sir hubert he is at paris or pekin or something with a p said lady garvington in her usual vague way im sure i dont know why he cant take agnes with him they get on very well for a married couple all the same she doesnt love him he loves her for im sure hes that jealous that he cant scarcely bear her out of his sight it seems to me that he can remarked mrs belgrove dryly since he is at paris or pekin and she is here garvington is looking after her and he owes sir hubert too much not to see that agnes is all right mrs belgrove peered at lady garvington through her lorgnette i think you talk a great deal of nonsense jane as i said before she observed i dont suppose for one moment that agnes thinks of noel or noel of agnes clara greeby says oh i know what she says and what she wishes she would like to get noel into trouble with sir hubert over agnes simply because he will not marry her as to her chatter about burglars garvingtons chatter corrected her companion well then garvingtons its all rubbish agnes is a sweet girl and girl lady garvington laughed disdainfully she is twentyfive a mere baby people cannot be called old until they are seventy or eighty it is a bad habit growing old i have never encouraged it myself by the way tell me something about sir hubert pine i have only met him once or twice what kind of a man is he tall and thin and dark and i know his appearance but his nature hes jealous and can be very disagreeable when he likes i dont know who he is or where he came from he made his money out of penny toys and south african investments he was a member of parliament for a few years and helped his party so much with money that he was knighted thats all i know of him except that he is very mean mean what you tell me doesnt sound mean im talking of his behavior to garvington explained the hostess touching her ruffled hair he doesnt give us enough money why should he give you any asked mrs belgrove bluntly well you see dear garvington would never have allowed his sister to marry a nobody unless unless the nobody paid for his footing i quite understand every one knows that agnes married the man to save her family from bankruptcy poor girl mrs belgrove sighed and she loved noel what a shame that she couldnt become his wife oh that would have been absurd said lady garvington pettishly whats the use of hunger marrying thirst noel has no money just like ourselves and if it hadnt been for hubert this place would have been sold long ago im telling you secrets mind my dear you tell me nothing that everybody doesnt know then what is your advice about what my dear about what i have been telling you the burglar and i have told you before that it is rubbish if a burglar does come here i hope lord garvington will shoot him as i dont want to lose my diamonds but if the burglar is noel he wont be noel clara greeby has simply made a nasty suggestion which is worthy of her but if youre afraid why not get her to marry noel he wont have her said lady garvington dolefully i know he wont still a persevering woman can do wonders and clara greeby has no selfrespect and if you think noel is too near get agnes to join her husband in pekin i think its paris well then paris she can buy new frocks agnes doesnt care for new frocks such simple tastes she has wanting to help the poor rubbish i call it why when her husband helps lord garvington asked mrs belgrove artlessly lady garvington frowned what horrid things you say i only repeat what every one is saying well im sure i dont care cried lady garvington recklessly and rose to depart on some vague errand im only in the world to look after dinners and breakfasts clara greebys a cat making all this fuss about hush there she is lady garvington fluttered round and drifted towards miss greeby who had just stepped out on to the terrace the bankers daughter was in a tailormade gown with a mans cap and a mans gloves and a mans bootsat least as mrs belgrove thought they looked like thatand carried a very masculine stick more like a bludgeon than a cane with her ruddy complexion and ruddy hair and piercing blue eyes and magnificent figurefor she really had a splendid figure in spite of mrs belgroves depreciationshe looked like a gigantic norse goddess with a flashing display of white teeth she came along swinging her stick or whirling her shillalah as mrs belgrove put it and seemed the embodiment of coarse vigorous health taking a sunbath she inquired brusquely and in a loud baritone voice very wise of you two elderly things i am going for a walk mrs belgrove was disagreeable in her turn going to the abbots wood how clever of you to guess miss greeby smiled and nodded yes im going to look up lambert she always spoke of her male friends in this hearty fashion he ought to be here enjoying himself instead of living like a hermit in the wilds hes painting pictures put in lady garvington do hermits paint no only society women do that said miss greeby cheerfully and mrs belgroves faded eyes flashed she knew that the remark was meant for her and snapped back are you going to have your fortune told by the gypsies dear she inquired amiably they might tell you about your marriage oh i daresay and if you ask they will prophesy your funeral i am in perfect health miss greeby so i should think since your cheeks are so red lady garvington hastily intervened to prevent the further exchange of compliments will you be back to luncheon or join the men at the coverts neither ill drop on lambert for a feed where are you going im sure i dont know said the hostess vaguely theres lots to do i shall know whats to be done when i think of it and she drifted along the terrace and into the house like a cloud blown any way by the wind miss greeby looked after her limp figure with a contemptuous grin then she nodded casually to mrs belgrove and walked whistling down the terrace steps cat indeed commented mrs belgrove to herself when she saw miss greebys broad back disappear behind the laurels nothing half so pretty shes like a great flanders mare and i wish henry viii was alive to marry her she added the epithet suggesting that king if only to cut her head off chapter ii in the wood miss greeby swung along towards her destination with a masculine stride and in as great a hurry as though she had entered herself for a marathon race it was a warm misty day and the pale august sunshine radiated faintly through the smoky atmosphere nothing was clearcut and nothing was distinct so hazy was the outlook the hedges were losing their greenery and had blossomed forth into myriad bunches of ruddy hips and haws and the usually hard road was soft underfoot because of the penetrating quality of the moist air there was no wind to clear away the misty greyness but yellow leaves without its aid dropped from the disconsolate trees the latelyreaped fields stretching on either side of the lane down which the lady was walking presented a stubbled expanse of brown and dim gold uneven and distressful to the eye the dying world was in ruins and nature had reduced herself to that necessary chaos out of which when the coming snow completed its task she would build a new heaven and a new earth an artist might have had some such poetic fancy and would certainly have looked lovingly on the alluring colors and forms of decay but miss greeby was no artist and prided herself upon being an aggressively matteroffact young woman with her big boots slapping the ground and her big hands thrust into the pockets of her mannish jacket she bent her head in a meditative fashion and trudged briskly onward what romance her hard nature was capable of was uppermost now but it had to do strictly with her personal feelings and did not require the picturesque autumn landscape to improve or help it in any way one mans name suggested romance to bluff breezy clara greeby and that name was noel lambert she murmured it over and over again to her heart and her hard face flushed into something almost like beauty as she remembered that she would soon behold its owner but he wont care she said aloud and threw back her head defiantly then after a pause she breathed softly but i shall make him care if she hoped to do so the task was one which required a great amount of skill and a greater amount of womanly courage neither of which qualities miss greeby possessed she had no skill in managing a man as her instincts were insufficiently feminine and her courage was of a purely roughandtumble kind she could have endured hunger and thirst and cold she could have headed a forlorn hope she could have held to a sinking ship but she had no store of that peculiar feminine courage which men dont understand and which women cant explain however much they may exhibit it miss greeby was an excellent comrade but could not be the beloved of any man because of the very limitations of semimasculinity upon which she prided herself noel lambert wanted a womanly woman and lady agnes was his ideal of what a wife should be miss greeby had in every possible way offered herself for the post but lambert had never cared for her sufficiently to endure the thought of passing through life with her beside him he said she was a good sort and when a man says that of a woman she may be to him a good friend or even a platonic chum but she can never be a desirable wife in his eyes what miss greeby lacked was sex and lacking that lacked everything it was strange that with her rough common sense she could not grasp this want but the thought that lambert required what she could never givenamely the feminine tenderness which strong masculine natures lovenever crossed her very clear and mathematical mind so she was bent upon a fools errand as she strode towards the abbots wood although she did not know it her aim was to capture lambert as her husband and her plan to accomplish her wish by working on the hearthunger he most probably felt owing to the loss of agnes pine if he loved that lady in a chivalrous fashionand miss greeby believed that he didshe was absolutely lost to him as the wife of another man lambert would never degrade her into a divorce court appearance and perhaps after all as miss greeby thought hopefully his love for sir huberts wife might have turned to scorn that she had preferred money to true love but then again as miss greeby remembered with a darkening face agnes had married the millionaire so as to save the family estates from being sold rank has its obligation and lambert might approve of the sacrifice since he was the next heir to the garvington title we shall see what his attitude is decided miss greeby as she entered the abbots wood and delayed arranging her future plans until she fully understood his feelings towards the woman he had lost in the meantime lambert would want a comrade and miss greeby was prepared to sink her romantic feelings for the time being in order to be one the forestwhich belonged to garvington so long as he paid the interest on the mortgagewas not a very large one in the old days it had been of greater size and well stocked with wild animals so well stocked indeed that the abbots of a near monastery had used it for many hundred years as a hunting ground but the monastery had vanished off the face of the earth as not even its ruins were left and the game had disappeared as the forest grew smaller and the district around became more populous a lambert of the georgian periodthe family name of lord garvington was lamberthad acquired what was left of the monastic wood by winning it at a game of cards from the nobleman who had then owned it now it was simply a large patch of green in the middle of a somewhat naked county for hengishire is not remarkable for woodlands there were rabbits and birds badgers stoats and suchlike wild things in it still but the deer which the abbots had hunted were conspicuous by their absence garvington looked after it about as much as he did after the rest of his estates which was not saying much the fat round little lords heart was always in the kitchen and he preferred eating to fulfilling his duties as a landlord consequently the abbots wood was more or less public property save when garvington turned crusty and every now and then cleared out all interlopers but tramps came to sleep in the wood and gypsies camped in its glades while summer time brought many artists to rave about its sylvan beauties and paint pictures of ancient trees and silent pools and rugged lawns besprinkled with rainbow wild flowers people who went to the academy and to the various art exhibitions in bond street knew the abbots wood fairly well as it was rarely that at least one picture dealing with it did not appear miss greeby had explored the wood before and knew exactly where to find the cottage mentioned by lady garvington on the verge of the trees she saw the blue smoke of the gypsies camp fires and heard the vague murmur of romany voices but avoiding the vagrants she took her way through the forest by a winding path this ultimately led her to a spacious glade in the centre of which stood a dozen or more rough monoliths of mossy gray and weatherworn stones disposed in a circle probably these were all that remained of some druidical temple and archaeologists came from far and near to view the weird relics and in the middle of the circle stood the cottage a thatched dwelling which might have had to do with a fairy tale with its whitewashed walls covered with ivy and its latticed windows on the ledges of which stood pots of homely flowers there was no fence round this rustic dwelling as the monoliths stood as guardians and the space between the cottage walls and the gigantic stones was planted thickly with fragrant english flowers snapdragon sweetwilliam marigolds and scented clove carnations were all to be found there also there was thyme mint sage and other potherbs and the whole perfumed space was girdled by trees old and young which stood back from the emerald beauty of untrimmed lawns a more ideal spot for a dreamer or an artist or a hermit or for the straying prince of a fairy tale it would have been quite impossible to find miss greebys vigorous and coarse personality seemed to break in a noisy manneralthough she did not utter a single wordthe enchanted silence of the solitary place however the intruder was too matteroffact to trouble about the sequestered liveliness of this unique dwelling she strode across the lawns and passing beyond the monoliths marched like an invader up the narrow path between the radiant flowerbeds from the tiny green door she raised the burnished knocker and brought it down with an emphatic bang shortly the door opened with a pettish tug as though the person behind was rather annoyed by the noise and a very tall wellbuilt slim young man made his appearance on the threshold he held a palette on the thumb of one hand and clutched a sheaf of brushes while another brush was in his mouth and luckily impeded a rather rough welcome the look in a pair of keen blue eyes certainly seemed to resent the intrusion but at the sight of miss greeby this irritability changed to a glance of suspicion lambert from old associations liked his visitor very well on the whole but that feminine intuition which all creative natures possess warned him that it was wise to keep her at arms length she had never plainly told her love but she had assuredly hinted at it more or less by eye and manner and undue hauntings of his footsteps when in london he could not truthfully tell himself that he was glad of her unexpected visit for quite half a minute they stood staring at one another and miss greebys hard cheeks flamed to a poppy red at the sight of the man she loved well hermit she observed when he made no remark as the mountain would not come to mahomet the prophet has come to the mountain the mountain is welcome said lambert diplomatically and stood aside so that she might enter then adopting the bluff and breezy roughandreadymantoman attitude which miss greeby liked to see in her friends he added come in old girl its a pal come to see a pal isnt it rather assented miss greeby although womanlike she was not entirely pleased with this unromantic welcome we played as brats together didnt we yes she added meditatively when following lambert into his studio i think we are as chummy as a man and woman well can be true enough you were always a good sort clara how well you are lookingmore of a man than ever oh stop that said miss greeby roughly why lambert raised his eyebrows as a girl you always liked to be thought manly and said again and again that you wished you were a boy i find that i am a woman after all sighed the visitor dropping into a chair and looking round with a womans feelings too and very nice those feelings are since they have influenced you to pay me a visit in the wilds remarked the artist imperturbably what are you doing in the wilds painting was the laconic retort so i see stilllife pictures not exactly he pointed toward the easel behold and approve miss greeby did behold but she certainly did not approve because she was a woman and in love it was only a pictured head she saw but the head was that of a very beautiful girl whose face smiled from the canvas in a subtle defiant way as if aware of its wild loveliness the raven hair streamed straightly down to the shouldersfor the bust of the model was slightly indicatedand there bunched out into curls a red and yellow handkerchief was knotted round the brows and dangling sequins added to its barbaric appearance nose and lips and eyes and contours were all perfect and it really seemed as though the face were idealized so absolutely did it respond to all canons of beauty it was a gypsy countenance and there lurked in its loveliness that wild untamed look which suggested unrestricted roamings and the spacious freedom of the road the sudden jealous fear which surged into miss greebys heart climbed to her throat and choked her speech but she had wisdom enough to check unwise words and glanced round the studio to recover her composure the room was small and barely furnished a couch two deep armchairs and a small table filled its limited area the walls and roof were painted a pale green and a carpet of the same delicate hue covered the floor of course there were the usual painting materials brushes and easel and palettes and tubes of color together with a slightly raised platform near the one window where the model could sit or stand the window itself had no curtains and was filled with plain glass affording plenty of light the other windows of the cottage are latticed said lambert seeing his visitors eyes wander in that direction i had that glass put in when i came here a month ago no light can filter through latticesin sufficient quantity that isto see the true tones of the colors oh bother the window muttered miss greeby restlessly for she had not yet gained command of her emotions lambert laughed and looked at his picture with his head on one side and a very handsome head it was as miss greeby thought it bothered me until i had it put right i assure you but you dont seem pleased with my crib its not good enough for you since when have i been a sybarite clara i mean you ought to think of your position its too unpleasant to think about rejoined lambert throwing himself on the couch and producing his pipe may i smoke yes and if you have any decent cigarettes ill join you thanks she deftly caught the silver case he threw her but your position five hundred a year and no occupation since i have been brought up to neither trade nor profession said lambert leisurely well you are the heir to a title and to a large property which is heavily mortgaged as to the titlelambert shrugged his shouldersgarvingtons wife may have children i dont think so they have been married ten years and more you are certain to come in for everything everything consists of nothing said the artist coolly well drawled miss greeby puffing luxuriously at her cigarette which was turkish and soothing nothing may turn into something when these mortgages are cleared off who is going to clear them off sir hubert pine lamberts brows contracted as she knew they would when this name was mentioned and he carefully attended to filling his pipe so as to avoid meeting her hard inquisitive eyes pine is a man of business and if he pays off the mortgages he will take over the property as security i dont see that garvington will be any the better off in that case lambert said miss greeby very decidedly and determined to know precisely what he felt like garvington only allowed his sister to marry sir hubert because he was rich i dont know for certain of course but i should think it probable that he made an arrangement with pine to have things put straight because of the marriage possible and probable said the artist shortly and wincing but old friend as you are clara i dont see the necessity of talking about business which does not concern me speak to garvington agnes concerns you how objectionably direct you are exclaimed lambert in a vexed tone and how utterly wrong agnes does not concern me in the least i loved her but as she chose to marry pine why theres no more to be said if there was nothing more to be said observed miss greeby shrewdly you would not be burying yourself here why not i am fond of nature and art and my income is not enough to permit my living decently in london i had to leave the army because i was so poor garvington has given me this cottage rent free so im jolly enough with my painting and with mrs tribb as housekeeper and cook shes a perfect dream of a cook ended lambert thoughtfully miss greeby shook her red head you cant deceive me who wants to anyhow demanded the man unconsciously american you do you wish to make out that you prefer to camp here instead of admitting that you would like to be at the manor because agnes lambert jumped up crossly oh leave agnes out of the question she is pines wife so that settles things its no use crying for the moon and then you still wish for the moon interpolated the woman quickly not even you have the right to ask me such a question replied lambert in a quiet and decisive tone let us change the subject miss greeby pointed to the beautiful face smiling on the easel i advise you to she said significantly you seem to have come here to give me good advice which you wont take she retorted because it isnt needed a mans a man and a womans a woman thats as true as taxes as mr barkis observed if you are acquainted with the writings of the late charles dickens well again miss greeby pointed to the picture shes very pretty i shouldnt have painted her otherwise oh then the original of that portrait does exist could you call it a portrait if an original didnt exist demanded the young man tartly since you want to know so much you may as well come to the gypsy encampment on the verge of the wood and satisfy yourself he threw on a panama hat with a cross look since when have you come to the conclusion that i need a dry nurse oh dont talk bosh said miss greeby vigorously and springing to her feet you take me at the foot of the letter and too seriously i only came here to see how my old pal was getting on im all right and as jolly as a sandboy now are you satisfied quite only dont fall in love with the original of your portrait its rather late in the day to warn me said lambert dryly for i have known the girl for six months i met her in a gypsy caravan when on a walking tour and offered to paint her she is down here with her people and you can see her whenever you have a mind to theres no time like the present said miss greeby accepting the offer with alacrity come along old boy then when they stepped out of the cottage garden on to the lawns she asked pointedly what is her name chaldea nonsense that is the name of the country i never denied that my dear girl but chaldea was born in the country whence she takes her name down mesopotamia way i believe these gypsies wander far and wide you know shes very pretty and has the temper of the foul fiend himself only kara can keep her in order who is kara a servian gypsy who plays the fiddle like an angel hes a crookedbacked blackfaced hairy ape of a dwarf but highly popular on account of his music also hes crazy about chaldea and loves her to distraction does she love him miss greeby asked in her direct fashion no replied lambert coloring under his tan and closed his lips firmly he was a very presentable figure of a man as he walked beside the unusually tall woman his face was undeniably handsome in a fair saxon fashion and his eyes were as blue as those of miss greeby herself while his complexion was much more delicate in fact she considered that it was much too good a complexion for one of the male sex but admitted inwardly that its possessor was anything but effeminate when he had such a heavy jaw such a firm chin and such set lips lambert indeed at first sight did indeed look so amiable as to appear for the moment quite weak but danger always stiffened him into a dangerous adversary and his face when aroused was most unpleasantly fierce he walked with a military swing his shoulders well set back and his head crested like that of a striking serpent a rough and warlike life would have brought out his best points of endurance capability to plan and strike quickly and iron decision but the want of opportunity and the enervating influences of civilized existence made him a man of possibilities when time and place and chance offered he could act the hero with the best but lacking these things he remained innocuous like gunpowder which has no spark to fire it thinking of these things miss greeby abandoned the subject of chaldea and of her possible love for lambert and exclaimed impulsively why dont you chuck civilization and strike the outtrail why should i he asked unmoved and rather surprised by the change of the subject im quite comfortable here too comfortable she retorted with emphasis this loafing life of justenoughtoliveon doesnt give you a chance to play the man go out and fight and colonize and prove your qualities lamberts color rose again and his eyes sparkled i would if the chance ah bah hercules and omphale interrupted his companion what do you mean never mind retorted miss greeby who guessed that he knew what she meant very well his quick flush showed her how he resented this classical allusion to agnes pine youd carry her off if you were a man chaldea asked lambert wilfully misunderstanding her meaning if you like only dont try to carry her off at night garvington says he will shoot any burglar who comes along after dark i never knew garvington had anything to do with chaldea neither did i oh i think you know very well what i mean perhaps i do said the young man with an angry shrug for really her interference with his affairs seemed to be quite unjustifiable but i am not going to bring a woman i respect into the divorce court respect love you mean to say lambert stopped and faced her squarely i dont wish to quarrel with you clara as we are very old friends but i warn you that i do possess a temper and if you wish to see it you are going the best way to get what you evidently want now hold your tongue and talk of something else here is chaldea watching for you muttered miss greeby as the slight figure of the gypsy girl was seen advancing swiftly ha and she snorted suspiciously rye cried chaldea dancing toward the artist sarishan rye miss greeby didnt understand romany but the look in the girls eyes was enough to reveal the truth if lambert did not love his beautiful model it was perfectly plain that the beautiful model loved lambert o baro duvel atch pa leste said chaldea and clapped her slim hands chapter iii an unexpected recognition i wish you wouldnt speak the calo jib to me chaldea said lambert smiling on the beautiful eager face you know i dont understand it nor i put in miss greeby in her manly tones what does oh baro devil and all the rest of it mean the great god be with you translated chaldea swiftly and duvel is not devil as you gorgios call it only the difference of a letter replied the gentile lady goodhumoredly show us round your camp my good girl the mere fact that the speaker was in lamberts company let alone the offensively patronizing tone in which she spoke was enough to rouse the gypsy girls naturally hot temper she retreated and swayed like a cat making ready to spring while her black eyes snapped fire in a most unpleasant manner but miss greeby was not to be frightened by withering glances and merely laughed aloud showing her white teeth her rough merriment and masculine looks showed chaldea that as a rival she was not to be feared so the angry expression on the dark face changed to a wheedling smile avali avali the gorgios lady wants her fortune told for the sake of diplomacy miss greeby nodded and fished in her pocket ill give you half a crown to tell it not menot me dear lady mother cockleshell is our great witch take me to her then replied the other and rapidly gathered into her brain all she could of chaldeas appearance lambert had painted a very true picture of the girl although to a certain extent he had idealized her reckless beauty chaldeas looks had been damaged and roughened by wind and rain by long tramps and by glaring sunshine yet she was superlatively handsome with her warm and swarthy skin under which the scarlet blood circled freely to an oval face a slightly hooked nose and two vermilion lips rather full she added the glossy black eyes of the true romany peaked at the corners her jetty hair descended smoothly from under a red handkerchief down to her shoulders and there at the tips became tangled and curling her figure was magnificent and she swayed and swung from the hips with an easy grace which reminded the onlookers of a panthers lithe movements and there was a good deal of the dangerous beastofprey beauty about chaldea which was enhanced by her picturesque dress this was ragged and patched with all kinds of colored cloths subdued to mellow tints by wear and weather also she jingled with coins and beads and barbaric trinkets of all kinds her hands were perfectly formed and so doubtless were her feet although these last were hidden by heavy lacedup boots on the whole she was an extremely picturesque figure quite comforting to the artistic eye amidst the drab sameness of latterday civilization all the same i suspect she is a sleeping volcano whispered miss greeby in her companions ear as they followed the girl through the camp scarcely sleeping answered lambert in the same tone she explodes on the slightest provocation and not without damaging results well you ought to know but if you play with volcanic fire youll burn more than your clever fingers pooh the girl is only a model ha not much of the lay figure about her anyway lambert according to his custom shrugged his shoulders and did not seek to explain further if miss greeby chose to turn her fancies into facts she was at liberty to do so besides her attention was luckily attracted by the vivid life of the vagrants which hummed and bustled everywhere the tribe was a comparatively large one andas miss greeby learned laterconsisted of lees loves bucklands hernes and others all mixed up together in one gypsy stew the assemblage embraced many clans and not only were there pure gypsies but even many diddikai or halfbloods to be seen perhaps the gradually diminishing romany clans found it better to band together for mutual benefit than to remain isolated units but the camp certainly contained many elements and these acting cooperatively formed a large and somewhat reckless community which justified garvingtons alarm a raid in the night by one or two or three or more of these lean wiry dangerouslooking outcasts was not to be despised but it must be admitted that in a general way law and order prevailed in the encampment there were many caravans painted in gay colors and hung round with various goods such as brushes and brooms goatskin rugs and much tinware together with baskets of all sorts and sizes the horses which drew these rainbowhued vehicles were pasturing on the outskirts of the camp hobbled for the most part interspersed among the travelling homes stood tents great and small wherein the genuine romany had their abode but the autumn weather was so fine that most of the inmates preferred to sleep in the moonshine of course there were plenty of dogs quarrelling over bones near various fires or sleeping with one eye open in odd corners and everywhere tumbled and laughed and danced brownfaced lithelimbed children who looked uncannily eastern and the men showing their white teeth in smiles together with the fawning women young and handsome or old and hideously ugly seemed altogether alien to the quiet tame domestic english landscape there was something prehistoric about the scene and everywhere lurked that sense of dangerous primeval passions held in enforced check which might burst forth on the very slightest provocation its a migrating tribe of aryans driven to new hunting grounds by hunger or overpopulation said miss greeby for even her unromantic nature was stirred by the unusual picturesqueness of the scene the sight of these people and the reek of their fires make me feel like a cavewoman there is something magnificent about this brutal freedom very sordid magnificence replied lambert raising his shoulders but i understand your feelings on occasions we all have the nostalgia of the primitive life at times and delight to pass from ease to hardship well civilization isnt much catch so far as i can see argued his companion it makes men weaklings certainly not women he answered glancing sideways at her amazonian figure i agree with you for some reason men are going down while women are going up both physically and mentally i wonder what the future of civilized races will be here is mother cockleshell best ask her the trio had reached a small tent at the very end of the camp by this time snugly set up under a spreading oak and near the banks of a babbling brook their progress had not been interrupted by any claims on their attention or purses for a wink from chaldea had informed her brother and sister gypsies that the gentile lady had come to consult the queen of the tribe and like lord burleighs celebrated nod chaldeas wink could convey volumes at all events lambert and his companion were unmolested and arrived in due course before the royal palace a croaking voice announced that the queen was inside her arab tent and she was crooning some romany song chaldea did not open her mouth but simply snapped her fingers twice or thrice rapidly the woman within must have had marvellously sharp ears for she immediately stopped her incantationthe songs sounded like oneand stepped forth oh said miss greeby stepping back i am disappointed she had every reason to be after the picturesqueness of the camp in general and chaldea in particular for mother cockleshell looked like a threadbare pewopener or an almshouse widow who had seen better days apparently she was very old for her figure had shrivelled up into a diminutive monkey form and she looked as though a moderately high wind could blow her about like a feather her face was brown and puckered and lined in a most wonderful fashion where a wrinkle could be there a wrinkle was and her nose and chin were of the true nutcracker order as a witchs should be only her eyes betrayed the powerful vitality that still animated the tiny frame for these were large and dark and had in them a piercing look which seemed to gaze not at any one but through and beyond her figure dried like that of a mummy was surprisingly straight for one of her ancient years and her profuse hair was scarcely touched with the gray of age arrayed in a decent black dress with a decent black bonnet and a black woollen shawl the old lady looked intensely respectable there was nothing of the picturesque vagrant about her therefore miss greeby and with every reason was disappointed and when the queen of the woodland spoke she was still more so for mother cockleshell did not even interlard her english speech with romany words as did chaldea good day to you my lady and to you sir said mother cockleshell in a stronger and harsher voice than would have been expected from one of her age and diminished stature i hope i sees you well and she dropped a curtsey just like any village dame who knew her manners oh cried miss greeby again you dont look a bit like a gypsy queen ah my lady looks aint everything but im a truebred romanya stanley of devonshire gentilla is my name and the tent my home and i can tell fortunes as no one else on the road can avali and that is true put in chaldea eagerly gentillas a bori chovihani the child means that i am a great witch my lady said the old dame with another curtsey though shes foolish to use romany words to gentiles as dont understand the tongue which the dear lord spoke in edens garden as the good book tells us in what part of the bible do you find that asked lambert laughing oh my sweet gentleman it aint for the likes of me to say things to the likes of you said mother cockleshell getting out of her difficulty very cleverly but the dear lady wants her fortune told dont she why dont you say dukkerin i dont like them wicked words sir answered mother cockleshell piously wicked words muttered chaldea tossing her black locks and them true romany as was your milk tongue no wonder the gentiles dont fancy you a true one of the road if i were queen of a vicious little devil flashed out of the old womans eyes and her respectable looks changed on the instant tol yer chib or ill heat the bones of you with the fires of bongo tem she screamed furiously and in a mixture of her mothertongue and english ja pukenus slut of the gutter she shook her fist and chaldea with an insulting laugh moved away bengis your see bengis your see and that my generous lady she added turning round with a sudden resumption of her fawning respectability means the devil in your heart which i spoke witchlylike to the child ah but shes a bad one miss greeby laughed outright this is more like the real thing poor chaldea said lambert youre too hard on her mother and you my sweet gentleman aint hard enough shell sell you and get kara to put the knife between your ribs why should he im not in love with the girl the tree dont care for the ivy but the ivy loves the tree said mother cockleshell darkly youre a good and kind gentleman and i dont want to see that slut pick your bones so i think whispered miss greeby in his ear you play with fire aye my good lady said mother cockleshell catching the whispershe had the hearing of a cat with the fire of bongo tern the which you may call the crooked land and she pointed significantly downward hell do you mean asked miss greeby in her bluff way the crooked land we romany calls it insisted the old woman and the child will go there for her witchly doings shes too goodlooking to lose as a model at all events said lambert hitching his shoulders i shall leave you to have your fortune told clara and follow chaldea to pacify her as he went toward the centre of the camp miss greeby took a hesitating step as though to follow him in her opinion chaldea was much too goodlooking let alone clever for lambert to deal with alone gentilla stanley saw the look on the hard face and the softening of the hard eyes as the cheeks grew rosy red from this emotion she drew her conclusions and she chuckled to think of how true a fortune she could tell the visitor on these premises mother cockleshells fortunetelling was not entirely fraudulent but when her clairvoyance was not in working order she made use of characterreading with good results wont the gorgios lady have her fortune told she asked in wheedling tones cross mother cockleshells hand with silver and shell tell the coming years truly why do they call you mother cockleshell demanded miss greeby waiving the question of fortunetelling for the time being bless your wisdom it was them fishermen at grimsby who did so i walked the beaches for years and told charms and gave witchly spells for fine weather gentilla stanley am i called but mother cockleshell was their name for me but the fortune my tender gentile i dont want it told interrupted miss greeby abruptly i dont believe in such rubbish there is rubbish and there is truth said the ancient gypsy darkly and them as knows can see whats hidden from others well you will have an opportunity this afternoon of making money some fools from the manor are coming to consult you mother cockleshell nodded and grinned to show a set of beautifully preserved teeth i know the manor said she rubbing her slim hands and lord garvington with his pretty sister lady agnes pine asked miss greeby how do you know her ive been in these parts before my gentle lady and she was good to me in a sick way i would have died in the hard winter if she hadnt fed me and nursed me so to speak i shall love to see her again to dick a puro pal is as commoben as a aushti habben the which my precious angel is true romany for the gentile saying to see an old friend is as good as a fine dinner avali avali she nodded smilingly i shall be glad to see her though here i use romany words to you as doesnt understand the lingo miss greeby was not at all pleased to hear lady agnes praised as knowing that lambert had loved her and probably loved her still she was jealous enough to wish her all possible harm however it was not diplomatic to reveal her true feelings to mother cockleshell lest the old gypsy should repeat her words to lady agnes so she turned the conversation by pointing to a snowwhite cat of great size who stepped daintily out of the tent i should think as a witch your cat ought to be black said miss greeby mother cockleshell screeched like a nightowl and hastily pattered some gypsy spell to avert evil why the old devil is black she cried and why should i have him in my house to work evil this is my white ghost her words were accompanied by a gentle stroking of the cat and good is what she brings to my rooftree but i dont eat from white dishes or drink from white mugs no no that would be too witchly miss greeby mused i have heard something about these gypsy superstitions before she remarked meditatively avo avo they are in a book written by a great romany rye leland is the name of that rye a gypsy lee with gentile land he added land to the lea as he was told by one of our people such a nice gentleman kind and free of his money and clever beyond tellings as i always says many a time has he sat pallike with me and gentilla says he yourre a bori chovihani and that my generous lady is the gentle language for a great witch chaldea said that you were that observed miss greeby carelessly the child speaks truly come cross my hand sweet lady miss greeby passed along half a crown i only desire to know one thing she said offering her palm shall i get my wish mother cockleshell peered into the hands although she had already made up her mind what to say her faculties sharpened by years of chicanery told her from the look which miss greeby had given when lambert followed chaldea that a desire to marry the man was the wish in question and seeing how indifferent lambert was in the presence of the tall lady mother cockleshell had no difficulty in adjusting the situation in her own artful mind no my lady she said casting away the hand with quite a dramatic gesture you will never gain your wish miss greeby looked angry bah your fortunetelling is all rubbish as i have always thought and she moved away tell me that in six months screamed the old woman after her why six months demanded the other pausing ah thats a dark saying scoffed the gypsy call it seven my hopefulforwhatyouwontget like the cat after the cream for sevens a sacred number and the spell is set gypsy jargon gypsy lies muttered miss greeby tossing her ruddy mane i dont believe a word tell me theres no time to say more interrupted mother cockleshell rudely for having secured her money she did not think it worth while to be polite especially in the face of her visitors scepticism one of our tribeaye and hes a great romany for sureis coming to camp with us each minute he may come and i go to get ready a stew of hedgehog for gentile words i must use to you who are a gorgio and so good day to you my lady ended the old hag again becoming the truly respectable pewopener then she dropped a curtseywhether ironical or not miss greeby could not telland disappeared into the tent followed by the white cat who haunted her footsteps like the ghost she declared it to be clearly there was nothing more to be learned from mother cockleshell who in the face of her visitors doubts had become hostile so miss greeby dismissing the whole episode as over and done with turned her attention toward finding lambert with her bludgeon under her arm and her hands in the pockets of her jacket she stalked through the camp in quite a masculine fashion not vouchsafing a single reply to the greetings which the gypsies gave her shortly she saw the artist chatting with chaldea at the beginning of the path which led to his cottage beside them on the grass squatted a queer figure it was that of a little man very much undersized with a hunch back and a large dark melancholy face covered profusely with black hair he wore corduroy trousers and clumsy bootshis feet and hands were enormoustogether with a green coat and a red handkerchief which was carelessly twisted round his hairy throat on his tangled locksdistressingly shaggy and unkempthe wore no hat and he looked like a brownie grotesque though somewhat sad but even more did he resemble an apeor say the missing linkand only his eyes seemed human these were large dark and brilliant sparkling like jewels under his elflocks he sat crosslegged on the sward and hugged a fiddle as though he were nursing a baby and no doubt he was as attached to his instrument as any mother could be to her child it was not difficult for miss greeby to guess that this weird hairy dwarf was the servian gypsy kara of whom lambert had spoken she took advantage of the knowledge to be disagreeable to the girl is this your husband asked miss greeby amiably chaldeas eyes flashed and her cheeks grew crimson not at all she said contemptuously i have no rom ah your are not married no declared chaldea curtly and shot a swift glance at lambert she is waiting for the fairy prince said that young gentleman smiling and he is coming to this camp almost immediately ishmael hearne is coming replied the gypsy but he is no rom of mine and never will be who is he then asked lambert carelessly one of the great romany miss greeby remembered that mother cockleshell had also spoken of the expected arrival at the camp in these terms a kind of king she asked chaldea laughed satirically yes a kind of king she assented then turned her back rudely on the speaker and addressed lambert i cant come rye ishmael will want to see me i must wait what a nuisance said lambert looking annoyed fancy clara i have an idea of painting these two as beauty and the beast or perhaps as esmeralda and quasimodo i want them to come to the cottage and sit now but they will wait for this confounded ishmael we can come tomorrow put in chaldea quickly this afternoon i must dance for ishmael and kara must play ishmael will meet with a fine reception said miss greeby and then anxious to have a private conversation with chaldea so as to disabuse her mind of any idea she may have entertained of marrying lambert she added i think i shall stay and see him in that case i shall return to my cottage replied lambert sauntering up the pathway which was strewn with withered leaves when are you coming to the manor called miss greeby after him never i am too busy he replied over his shoulder and disappeared into the wood this departure may seem discourteous but then miss greeby liked to be treated like a comrade and without ceremony that is she liked it so far as other men were concerned but not as regards lambert she loved him too much to approve of his careless leavetaking and therefore she frowned darkly as she turned her attention to chaldea the girl saw that miss greeby was annoyed and guessed the cause of her annoyance the idea that this redhaired and gaunt woman should love the handsome gorgio was so ludicrous in chaldeas eyes that she laughed in an ironical fashion miss greeby turned on her sharply but before she could speak there was a sound of many voices raised in welcome sarishan pal sarishan ba cried the voices and chaldea started ishmael she said and ran toward the camp followed leisurely by kara anxious to see the great romany whose arrival caused all this commotion miss greeby plunged into the crowd of excited vagrants these surrounded a black horse on which sat a slim darkfaced man of the true romany breed miss greeby stared at him and blinked her eyes as though she could not believe what they beheld while the man waved his hand and responded to the many greetings in gypsy language his eyes finally met her own as she stood on the outskirts of the crowd and he started then she knew sir hubert pine said miss greeby still staring sir hubert pine chapter iv secrets the scouting crowd apparently did not catch the name so busy were one and all in welcoming the newcomer but the man on the horse saw miss greebys startled look and noticed that her lips were moving in a moment he threw himself off the animal and elbowed his way roughly through the throng sir hubert began miss greeby only to be cut short hastily dont give me away interrupted pine who here was known as ishmael hearne wait till i settle things and then we can converse privately all right answered the lady nodding and gripped her bludgeon crosswise behind her back with two hands she was so surprised at the sight of the millionaire in the wood that she could scarcely speak satisfied that she grasped the situation pine turned to his friends and spoke at length in fluent romany he informed them that he had some business to transact with the gentile lady who had come to the camp for that purpose and would leave them for half an hour the man evidently was such a favorite that black looks were cast on miss greeby for depriving the romany of his society but pine paid no attention to these signs of discontent he finished his speech and then pushed his way again toward the lady who awkwardly for him was acquainted with his true position as a millionaire in a hurried whisper he asked miss greeby to follow him and led the way into the heart of the wood apparently he knew it very well and knew also where to seek solitude for the private conversation he desired for he skirted the central glade where lamberts cottage was placed and finally guided his companion to a secluded dell far removed from the camp of his brethren here he sat down on a mossy stone and stared with piercing black eyes at miss greeby what are you doing here he demanded imperiously just the question i was about to put to you said miss greeby amiably she could afford to be amiable for she felt that she was the mistress of the situation pine evidently saw this for he frowned you must have guessed long ago that i was a gypsy he snapped restlessly indeed i didnt nor i should think did any one else i thought you had nigger blood in you and i have heard people say that you came from the west indies but what does it matter if you are a gypsy there is no disgrace in being one no disgrace certainly rejoined the millionaire leaning forward and linking his hands together while he stared at the ground i am proud of having the gentle romany blood all the same i prefer the west indian legend for i dont want any of my civilized friends to know that i am ishmael hearne born and bred in a tent well thats natural pine what would garvington say oh curse garvington curse the whole family by all means retorted miss greeby coolly pine looked up savagely i except my wife naturally you always were uxorious perhaps said pine gloomily im a fool where agnes is concerned miss greeby quite agreed with this statement but did not think it worth while to indorse so obvious a remark she sat down in her turn and taking lamberts cigarette case which she had retained by accident out of her pocket she prepared to smoke the two were entirely alone in the fairy dell and the trees which girdled it were glorious with vivid autumnal tints a gentle breeze sighing through the wood shook down yew crisp leaves on the womans head so that she looked like danae in a shower of gold pine gazed heavily at the ground and coughed violently miss greeby knew that cough and a medical friend of hers had told her several times that sir hubert was a very consumptive individual he certainly looked ill and apparently had not long to live and if he died lady agnes inheriting his wealth would be more desirable as a wife than ever and miss greeby guessing whose wife she would be swore inwardly that the present husband should look so delicate but she showed no sign of her perturbations but lighted her cigarette with a steady hand and smoked quietly she always prided herself on her nerve the millionaire was tall and lean with a sinewy frame and an oval olivecomplexioned face it was cleanshaven and with his aquiline nose his thin lips and brilliant black eyes which resembled those of kara he looked like a longdescended hindoo prince the eastern blood of the romany showed in his narrow feet and slim brown hands and there was a wild roving look about him which miss greeby had not perceived in london i suppose its the dress she said aloud and eyed pine critically what do you say miss greeby he asked looking up in a sharp startled manner and again coughing in a markedly consumptive way the cowl makes the monk in your case replied the woman quietly your corduroy breeches and velveteen coat with that colored shirt and the yellow handkerchief round your neck seem to suit you better than did the frock coats and evening dress i have seen you in you did look like a nigger of sorts when in those clothes now i can tell you are a gypsy with half an eye that is because you heard me called ishmael and saw me among my kith and kin said the man with a tired smile dont tell agnes why should i its none of my business if you chose to masquerade as a gypsy i masquerade as sir hubert pine retorted the millionaire slipping off the stone to sprawl fulllength on the grass i am truly and really one of the lot in the camp yonder do they know you by your gentile name pine laughed you are picking up the gypsy lingo miss greeby no every one on the road takes me for what i am ishmael hearne and my friends in the civilized world think i am sir hubert pine a millionaire with colored blood in his veins how do you come to have a double personality and live a double life oh that is easily explained and since you have found me out it is just as well that i should explain so that you may keep my secret at all events from my wife as she would be horrified to think that she had married a gypsy you promise of course i shall say nothing but perhaps she would prefer to know that she had married a gypsy rather than a nigger what polite things you say said pine sarcastically however i cant afford to quarrel with you as you are rich i cant even bribe you to silence so i must rely on your honor oh i have some miss greeby assured him lightly when it suits you he retorted doubtfully it does on this occasion why ill tell you that when you have related your story there is really none to tell i was born and brought up on the road and thinking i was wasting my life i left my people and entered civilization in london i worked as a clerk and being clever i soon made money i got hold of a man who invented penny toys and saw the possibilities of making a fortune i really didnt but i collected enough money to dabble in stocks and shares the south african boom was on and i made a thousand other speculations created more than a million out of my thousand and now i have over two millions honestly made honestly queried miss greeby significantly yes i assure you honestly we gypsies are cleverer than you gentiles and we have the same moneymaking faculties as the jews have if my people were not so fond of the vagrant life they would soon become a power in the money markets of the world but save in the case of myself we leave all such grubbing to the jews i did grub and my reward is that i have accumulated a fortune in a remarkably short space of time i have land and houses and excellent investments and a title which he added sarcastically a grateful government bestowed on me for using my money properly you bought the title by helping the political party you belonged to said miss greeby with a shrug there was quite a talk about it so there was as if i cared for talk however that is my story not all of it you are supposed to be in paris and and you find me here interrupted pine with a faint smile well you see being a gypsy i cant always endure that undertheroof life you gentiles live i must have a spell of the open road occasionally and moreover as my doctor tells me that i have phthisis and that i should live as much as possible in the open air i kill two birds with one stone as the saying is my health benefits by my taking up the old romany wandering and i gratify my nostalgia for the tent and the wild you understand you und his speech was interrupted by a fresh fit of coughing it doesnt seem to do you much good this gypsying said miss greeby with a swift look for his life was of importance to her plans you look pretty rocky i can tell you pine and if you die your wife will be free to the man sat up and took away from his mouth a handkerchief spotted with blood his eyes glittered and he showed his white teeth my wife will be free to what he demanded viciously and the same devil that had lurked in mother cockleshells eye now showed conspicuously in his miss greeby had no pity on his manifest distress and visible wrath but answered obliquely you know that she was almost engaged to her cousin before you married her she hinted pointedly yes i know d him said pine with a groan and rolled over to clutch at the grass in a vicious manner but hes not at the manor now no agnes doesnt speak of him no pine drew a deep breath and rose slowly to his feet with a satisfied nod im glad of that shes a good woman is agnes and would never encourage him in any way she knows what is due to me i trust her do you when your secretary is also stopping at the manor silver pine laughed awkwardly and kicked at a tuft of moss well i did ask him to keep an eye on her although there is really no occasion silver owes me a great deal since i took him out of the gutter if lambert worried my wife silver would let me know and then and then asked miss greeby hastily the man clenched his fists and his face grew stormy as his blood untamed by civilization surged redly to the surface id twist his neck id smash his skull idididoh dont ask me what id do i should keep my temper if i were you miss greeby warned him and alarmed by the tempest she had provoked she had no wish for the man she loved to come into contact with this savage veneered by civilization yet lambert was in the neighborhood and almost within a stones throw of the husband who was so jealous of him keep your temper repeated miss greeby is there anything else you would like me to do raged pine fiercely yes leave this place if you wish to keep the secret of your birth from your wife lady garvington and mrs belgrove and a lot of people from the manor are coming to the camp to get their fortunes told you are sure to be spotted i shall keep myself out of sight said pine sullenly and suspiciously some of your gypsy friends may let the cat out of the bag not one of them knows there is a cat in the bag i am ishmael hearne to them and nothing else but i shant stay here long i wonder you came at all seeing that your wife is with her brother in the daring of my coming lies my safety said pine tartly i know what i am doing as to lambert if he thinks to marry my wife when i am dead he is mistaken well i hope you wont die for my sake why for your sake asked pine sharply because i love lambert and i want to marry him marry him said the millionaire hoarsely and ill give you thousands of pounds oh i forgot that you have a large income but marry him marry him miss greeby i shall help you all i can i can do without assistance said the woman coolly all i ask you to do is to refrain from fighting with lambert what pines face became lowering again is he at the manor you said i know what i said he is not at the manor but he is stopping in the cottage a stones throw from here pine breathed hard and again had a spasm of coughing whats he doing painting pictures he has not been near the manor no and what is more he told me today that he did not intend to go near the house i dont think you need be afraid pine lambert is a man of honor and i hope to get him to be my husband he shall never be my wifes husband said the millionaire between his teeth and scowling heavily i know that i shant live to anything like three score and ten your infernal hothouse civilization has killed me but if lambert thinks to marry my widow he shall do so in the face of garvingtons opposition and will find agnes a pauper what do you mean exactly miss greeby flung away the stump of her cigarette and rose to her feet pine wiped his brow and breathed heavily i mean that i have left agnes my money only on condition that she does not marry lambert she can marry any one else she has a mind to i except her cousin because she loves him yes and because he loves her dn him he doesnt cried miss greeby lying fluently and heartily wishing that her lie could be a truth he loves me and i intend to marry him now you can understand what i meant when i declared that i had honor enough to keep your secret lambert is my honor oh then i believe in your honor sneered pine cynically it is a selfish quality in this case which can only be gratified by preserving silence if agnes knew that i was a true romany tramp she might run away with lambert and as you want him to be your husband it is to your interest to hold your tongue thank you for nothing miss greeby i tell you lambert loves me cried the woman doggedly trying to persuade her heart that she spoke truly and whether you leave your money to your wife or to any one else makes no manner of difference i think otherwise he retorted and it is just as well to be on the safe side if my widow marries lambert she loses my millions and they go to he checked himself abruptly never mind who gets them it is a person in whom you can take no manner of interest miss greeby pushed the point of her bludgeon into the spongy ground and looked thoughtful if lambert loves agnes still which i dont believe she observed after a pause he would marry her even if she hadnt a shilling your will excluding him as her second husband is merely the twisting of a rope of sand pine you forget said the man quickly that i declared also he would have to marry her in the face of garvingtons opposition in what way cant you guess garvington only allowed me to marry his sister because i am a wealthy man i absolutely bought my wife by helping him and she gave herself to me without love to save the family name from disgrace she is a good woman is agnes and always places duty before inclination marriage with her pauper cousin meant practically the social extinction of the lambert family and nothing would have remained but the title therefore she married me and i felt mean at the time in accepting the sacrifice but i was so deeply in love with her that i did so i love her still and i am mean enough still to be jealous of this cousin she shall never marry him and i know that garvington will appeal to his sisters strong desire to save the family once more so that she may not be foolish enough to lose the money and two millions more or less ended pine cynically is too large a sum to pay for a second husband does agnes know these conditions no nor do i intend that she should know you hold your tongue miss greeby pulled on her heavy gloves and nodded i told you that i had some notion of honor will you let lambert know that you are in this neighborhood no there is no need i am stopping here only for a time to see a certain person silver will look after agnes and is coming to the camp to report upon what he has observed silver then knows that you are ishmael hearne yes he knows all my secrets and i can trust him thoroughly since he owes everything to me miss greeby laughed scornfully that a man of your age and experience should believe in gratitude well its no business of mine you may be certain that for my own purpose i shall hold my tongue and shall keep lambert from seeking your wife not that he loves her she added hastily as pines brows again drew together but she loves him and may use her arts dont you dare to speak of arts in connection with my wife broke in the man roughly she is no coquette and i trust her so long as silver looks after her finished miss greeby contemptuously what chivalrous confidence well i must be going any message to your no no no broke in pine once more she is not to know that i am here or anything about my true position and name you promised and you will keep your promise but there i know that you will as selfinterest will make you ah now you talk common sense it is a pity you dont bring it to bear in the case of silver whom you trust because you have benefited him goodday you very unsophisticated person i shall see you again in london as hubert pine said the millionaire abruptly and miss greeby with a goodhumored shrug marched away swinging her stick and whistling gayly she was very well satisfied with the knowledge she had obtained as the chances were that it would prove useful should lambert still hanker after the unattainable woman miss greeby had lulled pines suspicions regarding the young mans love for agnes but she knew in her heart that she had only done so by telling a pack of miserable lies now as she walked back to the manor she reflected that by using her secret information dexterously she might improve such falsehood into tolerable truth pine flung himself down again when she departed and coughed in his usual violent manner his throat and lungs ached and his brow was wet with perspiration with his elbows on his knees and his face between his hands he sat miserably thinking over his troubles there was no chance of his living more than a few years as the best doctors in europe and england had given him up and when he was placed below ground the chances were that agnes would marry his rival he had made things as safe as was possible against such a contingency but who knew if her love for lambert might not make her willing to surrender the millions unless garvington can manage to arouse her family pride groaned pine drearily she sacrificed herself before for that and perhaps she will do so again but who knows and he could find no answer to this question since it is impossible for any man to say what a woman will do where her deepest emotions are concerned a touch on pines shoulder made him leap to his feet with the alertness of a wild animal on the lookout for danger by his side stood chaldea and her eyes glittered as she came to the point of explanation without any preamble the girl was painfully direct i have heard every word she said triumphantly and i know what you are brother why did you come here demanded pine sharply and frowning i wanted to hear what a romany had to do with a gorgio lady brother and what do i hear why that you dwell in the gentile houses and take a gentile name and cheat in a gentile manner and have wed with a gentile romi speaking romanly brother it is not well it is as i choose sister replied pine quietly for since chaldea had got the better of him it was useless to quarrel with her and from what i do good will come to our people chaldea laughed and blew from her fingers a feather carelessly picked up while in the thicket which had concealed her eavesdropping for that i care that said she pointing to the floating feather slowly settling i looks to myself and to my love brother hey pine raised his eyebrows its a gorgio my heart is set on pursued chaldea steadfastly a regular romany rye brother do you think lambert is a good name its the name of the devil sister cried pine hastily the very devil i love to me sweet as to you sour and speaking romanly brother i want him to be my rom in the gentile fashion as you have a romi in your gorgious lady what will kara say said pine and his eyes flashed for the idea of getting rid of lambert in this way appealed to him the girl was beautiful and with her added cleverness she might be able to gain her ends and these accomplished would certainly place a barrier between agnes and her cousin since the woman would never forgive the man for preferring the girl kara plays on the fiddle but not on my heartstrings said chaldea in a cool manner and watched pine wickedly youd better help me brother if you dont want that gorgious romi of yours to pad the hoof with the rye the blood rushed to pines dark cheeks whats that no harm to my rye and i tell you brother dont use the knife that i will not do if a weddingring from him to you will do as well it will do brother said chaldea calmly my rye doesnt love me yet but he will when i get him away from the gentile ladys spells they draw him brother they draw him where do they draw him to demanded pine his voice thick with passion to the gorgious house of the baro rai the brother of your romi like an owl does he go after dusk to watch the nest owl muttered pine savagely cuckoo rather prove this my sister and i help you to gain the love you desire its a bargain brothershe held out her hand inquiringlybut no knife pine shook hands its a bargain sister your weddingring will part them as surely as any knife tell me more and chaldea in whispers told him all chapter v the woman and the man quite unaware that destiny that tireless spinner was weaving sinister red threads of hate and love into the web of his life lambert continued to live quietly in his woodland retreat in a somewhat misanthropic frame of mind he had retired to this hermitage after the failure of his love affair since lacking the society of agnes there was nothing left for him to desire from a garden of roses the world became a sandy desert and denied the sole gift of fortune which would have made him completely happy the disconsolate lover foreswore society for solitude as some seek religion so lambert hoped by seeking natures breast to assuage the pains of his sore heart but although the great mother could do so much she could not do all and the young man still felt restless and weary hard work helped him more than a little but he had his dark hours during those intervals when hand and brain were too weary to create pictures in one way he blamed agnes because she had married for money in another way he did not blame her because that same money had been necessary to support the falling fortunes of the noble family to which lambert belonged an ordinary person would not have understood this and would have seen in the mercenary marriage simply a greedy grasping after the loaves and fishes but lambert coming at the end of a long line of lordly ancestors considered that both he and his cousin owed something to those of the past who had built up the family thus his pride told him that agnes had acted rightly in taking pine as her husband while his love cried aloud that the sacrifice was too hard upon their individual selves he was a lambert but he was also a human being and the two emotions of love and pride strove mightily against one another although quite three years had elapsed since the victim had been offered at the altarand a willing victim to the family fetishthe struggle was still going on and because of its stress and strain lambert withdrew from society so that he might see as little as possible of the woman he loved they had met they had talked they had looked in a conventionally lighthearted way but both were relieved when circumstances parted them the strain was too great pine arranged the circumstances for hearing here there and everywhere that his wife had been practically engaged to her cousin before he became her husband he looked with jealous eyes upon their chance meetings neither to agnes nor lambert did he say a single word since he had no reason to utter it so scrupulously correct was their behavior but his eyes were sufficiently eloquent to reveal his jealousy he took his wife for an american tour and when he brought her back to london lambert knowing only too truly the reason for that tour had gone away in his turn to shoot big game in africa an attack of malaria contracted in the congo marshes had driven him back to england and it was then that he had begged garvington to give him the abbots wood cottage for six months he had been shut up here occasionally going to london or for a weeks walking tour and during that time he had done his best to banish the image of agnes from his heart doubtless she was attempting the same conquest for she never even wrote to him and now these two sorelytried people were within speaking distance of one another and strange results might be looked for unless honor held them sufficiently true seeing that the cottage was near the family seat and that agnes sooner or later would arrive to stay with her brother and sisterinlaw lambert might have expected that such a situation would come about in the natural course of things perhaps he did and perhapsas some busybodies saidhe took the cottage for that purpose but so far he had refrained from seeking the society of pines wife he would not even dine at the manor nor would he join the shootingparty although garvington with a singular blindness urged him to do so while daylight lasted the artist painted desperately hard and after dark wandered round the lanes and roads and across the fields haunting almost unconsciously the manor park if only to see in moonlight and twilight the casket which held the rich jewel he had lost this was foolish and lambert acknowledged that it was foolish but at the same time he added inwardly that he was a man and not an angel a sinner and not a saint so that there were limits etc etc etc using impossible arguments to quieten a lively conscience that did not approve of this dangerous philandering the visit of miss greeby awoke him positively to a sense of danger for if she talkedand talk she didother people would talk also lambert asked himself if it would be better to visit the manor and behave like a man who has got over his passion or to leave the cottage and betake himself to london while turning over this problem in his mind he painted feverishly and for three days after miss greeby had come to stir up muddy water he remained as much as possible in his studio chaldea visited him as usual to be painted and brought kara with his green coat and beloved violin and hairy looks the girl chatted kara played and lambert painted and all three pretended to be very happy and careless this was merely on the surface however for the artist was desperately wretched because the other half of himself was married to another man while chaldea getting neither lovelook nor caress felt savagely discontented as for kara he had long since loved chaldea who treated him like a dog and he could not help seeing that she adored the gentile artista knowledge which almost broke his heart but it was some satisfaction for him to note that lambert would have nothing to do with the siren and that she could not charm him to her feet sang she ever so tenderly it was an unhappy trio at the best the gypsies usually came in the morning since the light was then better for artistic purposes but they always departed at one oclock so that lambert had the afternoon to himself chaldea would fain have lingered in order to charm the man she loved into subjection but he never gave her the least encouragement so she was obliged to stay away all the same she often haunted the woods near the cottage and when lambert came out for a stroll which he usually did when it became too dark to paint he was bound to run across her since he had not the slightest desire to make love to her and did not fathom the depth of her passion he never suspected that she purposely contrived the meetings which he looked upon as accidental since chaldea hung round the house like a moth round a candle she saw every one who came and went from the woodland cottage on the afternoon of the third day since pines arrival at the camp in the character of ishmael hearne the gypsy saw lady agnes coming through the wood chaldea knew her at once having often seen her when she had come to visit mother cockleshell a few months previously with characteristic cunning the girl dived into the undergrowth and there remained concealed for the purpose of spying on the gentile lady whom she regarded as a rival immediately chaldea guessed that lady agnes was on her way to the cottage and as lambert was alone as usual for the afternoon the two would probably have a private conversation the girl swiftly determined to listen so that she might learn exactly how matters stood between them it might be that she would discover something which pinechaldea now thought of him as pinemight like to know so having arranged this in her own unscrupulous mind the girl behind a juniper bush jealously watched the unsuspecting lady what she saw did not please her overmuch as lady agnes was rather too beautiful for her unknown rivals peace of mind sir huberts wife was not really the exquisitely lovely creature chaldea took her to be but her fair skin and brown hair were such a contrast to the gypsys swarthy face and raven locks that she really looked like an angel of light compared with the dark child of nature agnes was tall and slender and moved with a great air of dignity and calm selfpossession and this to the uncontrolled chaldea was also a matter of offence she inwardly tried to belittle her rival by thinking what a milkandwater useless person she was but the steady and resolute look in the ladys brown eyes gave the lie to this mental assertion lady agnes had an air of breeding and command which with all her beauty chaldea lacked and as she passed along like a cold stately goddess the gypsy rolled on the grass in an ecstasy of rage she could never be what her rival was and what her rival was as she suspected formed lamberts ideal of womanhood when she again peered through the bush lady agnes had disappeared but there was no need for chaldea to ask her jealous heart where she had gone with the stealth and cunning of a red indian the gypsy took up the trail and saw the woman she followed enter the cottage for a single moment she had it in her mind to run to the camp and bring pine but reflecting that in a moment of rage the man might kill lambert chaldea checked her first impulse and bent all her energies towards getting sufficiently near to listen to a conversation which was not meant for her ears meanwhile agnes had been admitted by mrs tribb a driedup little woman with the rosy face of a winter apple and a continual smile of satisfaction with herself and with her limited world this consisted of the cottage in the wood and of the near villages where she repaired on occasions to buy food sometimes indeed she went to the manor for born and bred on the garvington estates mrs tribb knew all the servants at the big house she had married a gamekeeper who had died and unwilling to leave the country she knew best had gladly accepted the offer of lord garvington to look after the woodland cottage in this way lambert became possessed of an exceedingly clean housekeeper and a wonderfully good cook in fact so excellent a cook was mrs tribb that garvington had frequently suggested she should come to the manor but so far lambert had managed to keep the little woman to himself mrs tribb adored him since she had known him from babyhood and declined to leave him under any circumstances she thought lambert the best man in the world and challenged the universe to find another so handsome and clever and so considerate dear me my lady is it yourself said mrs tribb throwing up her dry little hands and dropping a dignified curtsey well i do call it good of you to come and see master noel he dont go out enough and dont take enough interest in his stomach if your ladyship will pardon my mentioning that part of him but you dont know my lady what it is to be a cook and to see the dishes get cold while he as should eat them goes on painting not but what master noel dont paint like an angel as ive said dozens of times while mrs tribb ran on in this manner her lively black eyes twinkled anxiously she knew that her master and lady agnes had been as she said herself next door to engaged and knew also that lambert was fretting over the match which had been brought about for the glorification of the family the housekeeper therefore wondered why lady agnes had come and asked herself whether it would not be wise to say that master noelfrom old associations she always called lambert by this juvenile titlewas not at home but she banished the thought as unworthy the moment it entered her active brain and with another curtsey in response to the visitors greeting she conducted her to the studio them two angels will never do no wrong anyhow was mrs tribbs reflection as she closed the door and left the pair together but i do hope as that blackfaced husband wont ever learn hes as jealous as cain and i dont want master noel to be no abel if mrs tribb instead of going to the kitchen which she did had gone out of the front door she would have found chaldea lying full length amongst the flowers under the large window of the studio this was slightly open and the girl could hear every word that was spoken while so swiftly and cleverly had she gained her point of vantage that those within never for one moment suspected her presence if they had they would assuredly have kept better guard over their tongues for the conversation was of the most private nature and did not tend to soothe the eavesdroppers jealousy lambert was so absorbed in his paintinghe was working at the esmeraldaquasimodo picturethat he scarcely heard the studio door open and it was only when mrs tribbs shrill voice announced the name of his visitor that he woke to the surprising fact that the woman he loved was within a few feet of him the blood rushed to his face and then retired to leave him deadly pale but agnes was more composed and did not let her hearts tides mount to highwater mark on seeing her selfpossession the man became ashamed that he had lost his own and strove to conceal his momentary lapse into a natural emotion by pushing forward an armchair this is a surprise agnes he said in a voice which he strove vainly to render steady wont you sit down thank you and she took her seat like a queen on her throne looking fair and gracious as any white lily what with her white dress white gloves and shoes and straw hat tied under her chin with a broad white ribbon in old georgian fashion she looked wonderfully cool and pure andas lambert inwardly observedholy her face was as faintly tinted with color as is a tearose and her calm brown eyes under her smooth brown hair added to the suggestive stillness of her looks she seemed in her placidity to be far removed from any earthly emotion and resembled a picture of the madonna serene peaceful and somewhat sad yet who could tell what anguished feelings were masked by her womanly pride i hope you do not find the weather too warm for walking said lambert reining in his emotions with an iron hand and speaking conventionally not at all i enjoyed the walk i am staying at the manor so i understand and you are staying here there can be no doubt on that point do you think you are acting wisely she asked with great calmness i might put the same question to you agnes seeing that you have come to live within three miles of my hermitage it is because you are living in what you call your hermitage that i have come rejoined agnes with a slight color deepening her cheeks is it fair to me that you should shut yourself up and play the part of the disappointed lover lambert who had been touching up his picture here and there laid down his palette and brushes with ostentatious care and faced her doggedly i dont understand what you mean he declared oh i think you do and in the hope that i may induce you in justice to me to change your conduct i have come over i dont think you should have come he observed in a low voice and threw himself on the couch with averted eyes lady agnes colored again you are talking nonsense she said with some sharpness there is no harm in my coming to see my cousin we were more than cousins once exactly and unfortunately people know that but you neednt make matters worse by so pointedly keeping away from me lambert looked up quickly do you wish me to see you often he asked and there was a new note in his voice which irritated her personally i dont but but what he rose and stood up very tall and very straight looking down on her with a hungry look in his blue eyes people are talking murmured the lady and stared at the floor because she could not face that same look let them talk what does it matter nothing to you perhaps but to me a great deal i have a husband as i know to my cost he interpolated then dont let me know it to my cost she said pointedly sit down and let us talk common sense lambert did not obey at once i am only a human being agnes quite so and a man at that act like a man then and dont place the burden on a womans shoulders what burden oh noel cant you understand i daresay i can if you will explain i wish you hadnt come here today i have enough to bear without that and have i nothing to bear she demanded a flash of passion ruffling her enforced calm do you think that anything but the direst need brought me here i dont know what brought you here i am waiting for an explanation what is the use of explaining what you already know i know nothing he repeated doggedly explain well said lady agnes with some bitterness it seems to me that an explanation is really necessary as apparently i am talking to a child instead of a man sit down and listen this time lambert obeyed and laughed as he did so your taunts dont hurt me in the least he observed i love you too much and i love in return no dont rise again i did not come here to revive the embers of our dead passion embers cried lambert with bitter scorn embers indeed and a dead passion how well you put it so far as i am concerned agnes the passion is not dead and never will be i am aware of that and so i have come to appeal to that passion love means sacrifice i want you to understand that i do by experience did i not surrender you for the sake of the family name understand i should think i did understand ithinknot said lady agnes slowly and gently it is necessary to revive your recollections we loved one another since we were boy and girl and we intended as you know to marry there was no regular engagement between us but it was an understood family arrangement my father always approved of it my brother did not no because he saw in you an article of sale out of which he hoped to make money sneered lambert nursing his ankle lady agnes winced dont make it too hard for me she said plaintively my life is uncomfortable enough as it is remember that when my father died we were nearly ruined only by the greatest cleverness did garvington manage to keep interest on the mortgages paid up hoping that he would marry a rich wifean american for choiceand so could put things straight but he married jane as you know because he is a glutton and she knows all about cooking well gluttony may be as powerful a vice as drinking and gambling and all the rest of it it is with garvington although i daresay that seeing the position he was in people would laugh to think he should marry a poor woman when he needed a rich wife but at that time hubert wanted to marry me and garvington got his cookwife while i was sacrificed seeing that i loved you and you loved me i wonder yes i know you wondered but you finally accepted my explanation that i did it to save the family name i did and much as i hated your sacrifice it was necessary more necessary than you think said lady agnes sinking her voice to a whisper and glancing round in a moment of madness garvington altered a check which hubert gave him and was in danger of arrest hubert declared that he would give up the check if i married him i did so to save my brother and the family name oh agnes lambert jumped up i never knew this it was not necessary to tell you i made the excuse of saving the family name and property generally you thought it was merely the bankruptcy court but i knew that it meant the criminal court however i married hubert and he put the check in the fire in my presence and in garvingtons he has also fulfilled his share of the bargain which he made when he bought me and has paid off a great many of the mortgages however garvington became too outrageous in his demands and lately hubert has refused to help him any more i dont blame him he has paid enough for me you are worth it said lambert emphatically well you may think so and perhaps he does also but does it not strike you noel what a poor figure i and garvington and the whole family yourself included cut in the eyes of the world we were poor and i was sold to get money to save the land yes but this changing of the check also the world doesnt know of that said agnes hurriedly hubert has been very loyal to me i must be loyal to him you are who dares to say that you are not no oneas yet she replied pointedly what do you mean by that he demanded flushing through his fair skin i mean that if you met me in the ordinary way and behaved to me as an ordinary man people would not talk but you shun my society and even when i am at the manor you do not come near because of my presence it is so hard to be near you and yet owing to your marriage so far from you muttered the man savagely if it is hard for you think how hard it must be for me said the woman vehemently her passion coming to the surface people talk of the way in which you avoid me and hint that we love one another still it is true agnes you know it is true need the whole world know that it is true cried agnes rising with a gust of anger passing over her face if you would only come to the manor and meet me in london and accept huberts invitations to dinner people would think that our attachment was only a boy and girl engagement that we had outgrown they would even give me credit for loving hubert but you dont cried lambert with a jealous pang yes i do he is my chosen husband and has carried out his part of the bargain by freeing many of garvingtons estates surely the man ought to have something for his money i dont love him as a wife should love her husband not with heartwhole devotion that is but i give him loyalty and i respect him and i try to make him happy in every way i do my part noel as you do yours since i have been compelled to sacrifice love for money at least let us be true to the sacrifice you didnt sacrifice yourself wholly for money no i did not it was because of garvingtons crime but no one knows of that and no one ever shall know in fact so happy am i and hubert happy said lambert wincing yes she declared firmly he thinks so and whatever unhappiness i may feel i conceal from him but you must come to the manor and meet me here there and everywhere so that people shall not say as they are doing that you are dying of love and that because i am a greedy fortunehunter i ruined your life they do not dare i have not heard any what can you hear in this jungle interrupted lady agnes with scorn you stop your ears with cotton wool but i am in the world hearing everything and the more unpleasant the thing is the more readily do i hear it you can end this trouble by coming out of your lovesick retirement and by showing that you no longer care for me that would be acting a lie and do i not act a lie she cried fiercely is not my whole marriage a lie i despise myself for my weakness in yielding and yet god help me what else could i do when garvingtons fair fame was in question think of the disgrace had he been prosecuted by hubert and hubert knows that you and i loved that i could not give him the love he desired he was content to accept me on those terms i dont say he was right but am i right are you right is garvington right is any one of us right not one not one the whole thing is horrible but i make the best of it since i did what i did do openly and for a serious purpose of which the world knows nothing do your part noel and come to the manor if only to show that you no longer care for me you understandshe clasped her hands in agony you surely understand yes said lambert in a low voice and suddenly looked years older i understand at last agnes you shall no longer bear the burden alone i shall be a loyal friend to you my dear and he took her hand will you be a loyal friend to my husband she asked withdrawing it yes said lambert and he bit his lip god helping me i will chapter vi the man and the woman the interview between lady agnes and lambert could scarcely be called a lovescene since it was dominated by a stern sense of duty chaldea lying at length amongst the crushed and fragrant flowers herself in her particolored attire scarcely distinguishable from the rainbow blossoms was puzzled by the way in which the two reined in their obvious passions to her simple barbaric nature the situation appeared impossible if he loved her and she loved him why did they not run away to enjoy life together the husband who had paid money for the wife did not count nor did the brother who had sold his sister to hide his criminal folly that lady agnes should have traded herself to save garvington from a welldeserved punishment seemed inexcusable to the gypsy if he had been the man she loved then indeed might she have acted rightly but having thrown over that very man in this silly fashion for the sake of what did not appear to be worth the sacrifice chaldea felt that agnes did not deserve lambert and she then and there determined that the gentile lady should never possess him of course on the face of it there was no question of possession the man being weaker than the woman would have been only too glad to elope and thus cut the gordian knot of the unhappy situation but the woman having acted from a high sense of duty which chaldea could not rise to evidently was determined to continue to be a martyr the question was could she keep up that pose in the face of the undeniable fact that she loved her cousin the listening girl thought not sooner or later the artificial barrier would be broken through by the heldback flood of passion and then lady agnes would run away from the man who had bought her and quite right too thought chaldea although she had no notion of permitting such an elopement to take place that agnes would hold to her bargain all her life because hubert had fulfilled his part never occurred to the girl she was not civilized enough to understand this problem of a highly refined nature since the situation was so difficult lambert was glad to see the back of his cousin he escorted her to the door but did not attend her through the wood in fact they parted rather abruptly which was wise all had been said that could be said and lambert had given his promise to share the burden with agnes by acting the part of a lover who had never really been serious but it did not do to discuss details as these were too painful so the woman hurried away without a backward glance and lambert holding his heart between his teeth returned to the studio neither one of the two noticed chaldea crouching amongst the flowers had they been less preoccupied they might have done so as it was she escaped observation as soon as the coast was clear chaldea stole like a snake along the ground through the high herbage of the garden and beyond the circle of the mysterious monoliths even across the lawns of the glade did she crawl so as not to be seen although she need not have taken all this trouble since lambert with a set face and a trembling hand was working furiously at a minor picture he utilized to get rid of such moods but the gypsy did not know this and so writhed into the woods like the snake of edenand of that same she was a very fair sampleuntil hidden by the boles of ancient trees she could stand upright when she did so she drew a long breath and wondered what was best to be done the most obvious course was to seek ishmael and make a lying report of the conversation that his wife should have been with lambert would be quite enough to awaken the civilized gypsys jealousy for after all his civilization was but skin deep still if she did this chaldea was clever enough to see that she would precipitate a catastrophe and either throw agnes into lamberts arms or make the man run the risk of getting pines knife tickling his fifth rib either result did not appeal to her she wished to get lambert to herself and his safety was of vital importance to her after some consideration she determined that she would boldly face the lover and confess that she had overheard everything then she would have him in her power since to save the wife from the vengeance of the husband although there was no reason for such vengeance he would do anything to keep the matter of the visit quiet of course the interview had been innocent and chaldea knew that such was the case nevertheless by a little dexterous lying and some vivid wordpainting she could make things extremely unpleasant for the couple this being so lambert would have to subscribe to her terms and these were that he should leave agnes and marry her that there was such a difference in their rank mattered nothing to the girl love levelled all ranks in her opinion but while arranging what she should do if lambert proved obstinate chaldea also arranged to fascinate him if possible into loving her she did not wish to use her power of knowledge until her power of fascination failed and this for two reasons in the first place it was not her desire to drive the man into a corner lest he should defy her and fight which would meanto her limited comprehensionthat everything being known to pine the couple would confess all and elope in the second place chaldea was piqued to think that lambert should prove to be so indifferent to her undeniable beauty as to love this pale shadow of a gentile lady she would make certain she told herself if he really preferred the lily to the fullblown rose and on his choice depended her next step gliding back to the camp she decided to attend to one thing at a time and the immediate necessity was to charm the man into submission for this reason chaldea sought out the servian gypsy who was her slave her slave kara certainly was but not her rom if he had been her husband she would not have dared to propose to him what she did propose he was amiable enough as a slave because he had no hold over her but if she married him according to the gypsy law he would then be her master and should she indulge her fancy for a gentile he would assuredly use a very nastylooking knife which he wore under the green coat even as it was kara would not be pleased to fiddle to her dancing since he already was jealous of lambert but chaldea knew how to manage this part of the business risky though it was the hairy little ape with the musicians soul had no claim on her unless she chose to give him that of a husband then indeed things would be different but the time had not come for marital slavery the schemer found kara at the hour of sunset sitting at the door of the tent he occupied drawing sweet tones from his violin this was the little mans way of conversing for he rarely talked to human beings he spoke to the fiddle and the fiddle spoke to him probably about chaldea since the girl was almost incessantly in his thoughts she occupied them now and when he raised his shaggy head at the touch on his humpback he murmured with joy at the sight of her flushed beauty had he known that the flush came from jealousy of a rival kara might not have been so pleased the two conversed in romany since the servian did not speak english brother questioned chaldea standing in the glory of the rosy sunset which slanted through the trees what of ishmael he is with gentilla in her tent sister do you wish to see him chaldea shook her proud head what have i to do with the half romany truly brother his heart is gentile though his skin be of egypt why should that be sister when his name signifies that he is of the gentle breed asked kara laying down his violin gentile but not gentle said chaldea punning then checked herself lest she should say too much she had sworn to keep pines secret and intended to do so until she could make capital out of it at present she could not so behaved honorably but hes romany enough to split words with the old witch by the hour so let him stay where he is brother would you make money kara nodded and looked up with diamond eyes which glittered and gloated on the beauty of her dark face then brother continued the girl the gorgio who paints gives me gold to dance for him the servians facewhat could be seen of it for hairgrew sombre and he spat excessively curses on the gentile he growled low in his throat on him but not on the money brother coaxed the girl stooping to pat his face its fine work cheating the rye but jealous you must not be if the gold is to chink in our pockets kara still frowned were you my romi sister aye if i were then indeed but your romi i am not yet some day you will be it would be a good fortune sister i am as ugly as you are lovely and we two together you dancing to my playing would make pockets of red gold white shows best when placed on black what a mine of wisdom you are jeered chaldea nodding yes it is so and my rom you may be if you obey but if you let the gorgio make love to you hey am i not a free roman brother you have not yet caught the bird it still sings on the bough if i kiss him i suck gold from his lips if i put fond arms around his neck i but gather wealth for us both can you snare a mouse without cheese brother kara looked at her steadily and then lifted his green coat to show the gleam of a butcher knife should you go too far he said significantly and touched the blade chaldea bent swiftly and snatching the weapon from his belt flung it into the coarse grass under the trees so i fling you away said she and stamped with rage truly brother speaking romanly you are a fool of fools and take cheating for honesty i lure the gorgio at my will and says you whimperinglike shes my romi the which is a lie bless your wisdom for a hairy toad and goodbye for i go to my own people near lundra and never will he who doubted my honesty see me more she turned away and kara limped after her to implore forgiveness he assured her that he trusted her fully and that whatever tricks she played the gentile would not be taken seriously by himself poison him i would grumbled the little gnome in his beard for his golden talk makes you smile sweetly upon him but for the gold yes for the gold we must play the fox well brother now that you talk so wait until the moon is up then hide in the woods round the cottage dell with your violin to your chin i lure the rabbit from its hole and then you play the dance that delights the gorgios but what i do with kisses or armloving my brother she added shaking her finger is but the play of the wind to shake the leaves believe me honest and my rom you shall besome day and she went away laughing to eat and drink for the long watching had tired her as for kara he crawled again into the underwood to search for his knife apparently he did not trust chaldea as much as she wanted him to thus it came about that when the moon rolled through a starry sky like a golden wheel lambert sighing at his studio window saw a slim and graceful figure glide into the clear space of lawn beyond the monoliths so searching was the thin moonlight that he recognized chaldea at once as she wandered here and there restless as a butterfly and apparently as aimless but had he known it she had her eyes on the cottage all the time and had he failed to come forth she would have come to inquire if he was at home but the artist did come forth thinking to wile away an hour with the fascinating gypsy girl always dressing for dinner even in solitude for the habit of years was too strong to lay asideand moreover he was fastidious in his dress to preserve his selfrespecthe appeared at the door looking slender and wellset up in his dark clothes although it was august the night was warm and lambert did not trouble to put on cap or overcoat with his hands in his pockets and a cigar between his lips he strolled over to the girl where she swayed and swung in the fairy light hullo chaldea he said leisurely and leaning against one of the mossgrown monoliths what are you doing here the rye exclaimed chaldea with a wellfeigned start of surprise avali the rye sarishan my gorgious gentleman you too are a nightbird have you come out mousing like an owl ha ha and you hear the nightingale singing speaking in the gentile manner and clapping her hands she lifted up a full rich voice dyal o pani repedishis mro pirano hegedishis what does that mean chaldea it is an hungarian song and means that while the stream flows i hear the violin of my love kara taught me the ditty and kara is your love no oh no oh no sang chaldea whirling round and round in quite a magical manner no rom have i but a mateless bird i wander still i hear the violin of my true love my new love who knows my droms and that means my habits rye she ended suddenly speaking in a natural manner i dont hear the violin however said lambert lazily and thinking what a picturesque girl she was in her manyhued ragtag garments and with the golden coins glittering in her black hair you will rye you will she said confidentially come my darling gentleman cross my hand with silver and i dance i swear it no hokkeny baro will you behold when the wind pipes for me hokkeny baro a great swindle my wise sir hai what a pity you cannot patter the gentle romany tongue kek kek what does it matter when you speak gentile gibberish like an angel sit rye and i dance for you quite like carmen and don jose in the opera murmured lambert sliding down to the foot of the rude stone what of her and of him were they romans carmen was and jose wasnt she danced herself into his heart chaldeas eyes flashed and she made a hasty sign to attract the happy omen of his saying to herself kushto bak cried chaldea using the gypsy for good luck and to me to me she clapped her hand hark my golden rye and watch me dance your love into my life the wind was rising and sighed through the wood shaking myriad leaves from the trees blending with its faint cry came a long sweet sustained note of music lambert started so weird and unexpected was the sound kara isnt it he asked looking inquiringly at chaldea he talks to the nighthe speaks with the wind ohahahah ahohaohaohaho sang the gypsy clapping her hands softly then as the music came breathing from the hidden violin in dreamy sensuous tones she raised her bare arms and began to dance the place the dancer the hour the mysterious music and the pale enchantments of the moonit was like fairyland lambert soon let his cigar go out so absorbed did he become in watching the dance it was a wonderful performance sensuous and weirdly unusual he had never seen a dance exactly like it before the violin notes sounded like actual words and the dancer answered them with responsive movements of her limbs so that without speech the onlooker saw a lovedrama enacted before his eyes chaldeaso he interpreted the danceswayed gracefully from the hips without moving her feet in the style of a nautch girl she was waiting for some one since to right and left she swung with a delicate hand curved behind her ear suddenly she started as if she heard an approaching footstep and in maidenly confusion glided to a distance where she stood with her hands across her bosom the very picture of a surprised nymph mentally the dance translated itself to lambert somewhat after this fashion she waits for her lover that little run forward means that she sees him coming she falls at his feet she kisses them he raises heri suppose that panther spring from the ground means that he raises her she caresses him with much fondling and many kisses by jove what pantomime now she dances to please him she stops and trembles the dance does not satisfy she tries another no no not that it is too dreamythe lover is in a martial mood this time she strikes his fancy kara is playing a wild hungarian polonaise wonderful wonderful he might well say so and he struggled to his feet leaning against the pillar of stone to see the dancer better from the wood came the fierce and stirring slav music and chaldeas whole expressive body answered to every note as a needle does to a magnet she leaped clicking her heels together advanced as if on the foe with a boundwas flung backso it seemedand again sprang to the assault she stiffened to stubborn resistanceshe unexpectedly became pliant and yielding and graceful and voluptuous while the music took on the dreamy tones of love and lambert translated the change after his own idea the music does not please the dancerit is too martial she fears lest her lover should rush off to the wars and seeks to detain him by the dance of venus but he will go he rises he speeds away she breaks off the dance ah what a cry of despair the violin gave just now she follows stretching out her empty arms but it is uselesshe is gone bah she snaps her fingers what does she care she will dance to please herself and to show that her heart is yet whole what a bacchanalian strain she whirls and springs and swoops and leaps she comes near to me whirling like a dervish she recedes and then comes spinning round again like a mad creature and thenoh hang it what do you mean chaldea what are you doing lambert had some excuse for suddenly bursting into speech when he cried out vigorously oh hang it for chaldea whirled right up to him and had laid her arms round his neck and her lips against his cheek the music stopped abruptly with a kind of angry snarl as if kara furious at the sight had put his wrath into the last broken note then all was silent and the artist found himself imprisoned in the arms of the woman which were locked round his neck with an oath he unlinked her fingers and flung her away from him fiercely you foolyou utter fool cried lambert striving to calm down the beating of his heart and restrain the racing of his blood for he was a man and the sudden action of the gypsy had nearly swept away his selfrestraint i love youi love you panted chaldea from the grass where he had thrown her oh my beautiful one i love you you are crazy retorted lambert quivering with many emotions to which he could scarcely put a name so shaken was he by the experience what the devil do you mean by behaving in this way and his voice rose in such a gust of anger that kara hidden in the wood rejoiced he could not understand what was being said but the tone of the voice was enough for him he did not know whether chaldea was cheating the gentile or cheating him but he gathered that in either case she had been repulsed the girl knew that also when her ardent eyes swept across lamberts white face and she burst into tears of anger and disappointment oh rye i give you all and you take nothing she wailed tearfully i dont want anything you silly girl do you think that for one moment i was ever in love with you iiwant youtotolove me sobbed chaldea grovelling on the grass then you want an impossibility and to lamberts minds eye there appeared the vision of a calm and beautiful face far removed in its pure looks from the flushed beauty of the fiery gypsy to gain control of himself he took out a cigar and lighted it but his hand trembled you little fool he muttered and sauntered purposely slowly toward the cottage chaldea gathered herself up with the spring of a tigress and in a moment was at his elbow with her face black with rage her tears had vanished and with them went her softer mood youyou reject me she said in grating tones and shaking from head to foot as she gripped his shoulder take away your hand commanded lambert sharply and when she recoiled a pace he faced her squarely you must have been drinking he declared hoping to insult her into common sense what would kara say if i dont want kara i want you interrupted chaldea her breast heaving and looking sullenly wrathful then you cant have me why should you think of me in this silly way we were very good friends and now you have spoiled everything i can never have you to sit for me again chaldeas lip drooped never again never again no it is impossible since you have chosen to act in this way come you silly girl be sensible and silly girl oh yes silly girl flashed out chaldea and what is she she lambert stiffened himself what do you mean i mean the gentile lady i was under the window this afternoon i heard all you were talking about the man stepped back a pace and clenched his hands youlistened he asked slowly and with a very white face chaldea nodded with a triumphant smile avali and why not you have no right to love another mans romi i do not love her began lambert and then checked himself as he really could not discuss so delicate a matter with this wildcat why did you listen may i ask he demanded passing his tongue over his dry lips because i love you and love is jealous lambert restrained himself by a violent effort from shaking her you are talking nonsense he declared with enforced calmness and it is ridiculous for you to love a man who does not care in the least for you it will comei can wait insisted chaldea sullenly if you wait until doomsday it will make no difference i dont love you and i have never given you any reason to think so cheechee bantered the girl is that because i am not a raclan a raclan a married gentile lady that is you love her iisee here chaldea i am not going to talk over such things with you as my affairs are not your business they are the business of the gorgious females rom rom her husband you mean what do you know of i know that the gentle pine is really one of us interrupted the girl quickly ishmael hearne is his name sir hubert pine ishmael hearne insisted chaldea pertly he comes to the fire of the gentle romany when he wearies of your gorgious fleshpots pine a gypsy muttered lambert and the memory of that dark lean eastern face impressed him with the belief that what the girl said was true avali a true son of the road he is here here lambert started violently what do you mean i say what i mean rye he you call pine is in our camp enjoying the old life shall i bring him to you she inquired demurely in a flash lambert saw his danger and the danger of agnes seeing that the millionaire was as jealous as othello however it seemed to him that honesty was the best policy at the moment i shall see him myself later he declared after a pause if you listened you must know that there is no reason why i should not see him his wife is my cousin and paid me a friendly visitthat is all yes that is all mocked the girl contemptuously but if i tell him tell him what that you love his romi he knows that said lambert quietly and knows also that i am an honorable man see here chaldea you are dangerous because this silly love of yours has warped your common sense you can make a lot of mischief if you so choose i know well and i shall choose my golden rye if you love me not then set about it at once said lambert boldly it is best to be honest my girl i have done nothing wrong and i dont intend to do anything wrong so you can say what you like tonight i shall go to london and if pine or hearne or whatever you call him wants me he knows my town address you defy me panted chaldea her breast rising and falling quickly yes truth must prevail in the end i make no bargain with a spy and he gave her a contemptuous look as he strode into the cottage and shut the door with an emphatic bang hai muttered the gypsy between her teeth hatch till the dood wells apre which means wait until the moon rises an ominous saying for lambert chapter vii the secretary was ever a man in so uncomfortable a position lambert asked himself this question as soon as he was safe in his studio and he found it a difficult one to answer it was true that what he had said to agnes and what agnes had said to him was perfectly honest and extremely honorable considering the state of their feelings but the conversation had been overheard by an unscrupulous woman whose jealousy would probably twist innocence into guilt it was certain that she would go to pine and give him a garbled version of what had taken place in which case the danger was great both to himself and to agnes lambert had spoken bravely enough to the marplot knowing that he had done no wrong but now he was by no means sure that he had acted rightly perhaps it would have been better to temporize but that would have meant a surrender young to chaldeas unmaidenly wooing and as the man had not a spark of love for her in a heart given entirely to another woman he was unwilling even to feign playing the part of a lover on reflection he still held to his resolution to go to london thinking that it would be best for him to be out of reach of agnes while pine was in the neighborhood the news that the millionaire was a gypsy had astonished him at first but now that he considered the mans dark coloring and unenglish looks he quite believed that what chaldea said was true and he could understand also that pineor hearne since that was his true namewould occasionally wish to breathe the free air of heath and road since he had been cradled under a tent and must at times feel strongly the longing for the old lawless life but why should he revert to his beginnings so near to his brotherinlaws house where his wife was staying unless he came to keep an eye on her murmured lambert and unconsciously hit on the very reason of the pseudogypsys presence at garvington after all it would be best to go to london for a time to wait until he saw what chaldea would do then he could meet pine and have an understanding with him the very fact that pine was a romany and was on his native heath appealed to lambert as a reason why he should not seek out the man immediately as he almost felt inclined to do in order to forestall chaldeas story as hearne the millionaires wild instincts would be uppermost and he would probably not listen to reason whereas if the meeting took place in london pine would resume to a certain extent his veneer of civilization and would be more willing to do justice yes decided lambert rising and stretching himself i shall go to london and wait to turn over matters in my own mind i shall say nothing to agnes until i know what is best to be done about chaldea meanwhile i shall see the girl and get her to hold her tongue for a timedamn he frowned its making the best of a dangerous situation but i dont see my way to a proper adjustment yet the most necessary thing is to gain time with this in his mind he hastily packed a gladstone bag changed into tweeds and told mrs tribb that he was going to london for a day or so i shall get a trap at the inn and drive to the station he said as he halted at the door you will receive a wire saying when i shall return and leaving the dry little woman openmouthed at this sudden departure the young man hastened away instead of going straight to the village he took a roundabout road to the camp on the verge of abbots wood here he found the vagrants in a state of great excitement as lord garvington had that afternoon sent notice by a gamekeeper that they were to leave his land the next day taken up with his own private troubles lambert did not pay much attention to those of the tribe and looked about for chaldea he finally saw her sitting by one of the fires in a dejected attitude and touched her on the shoulder at once like a disturbed animal she leaped to her feet the rye said chaldea with a gasp and a hopeful look on her face give me three days before you say anything to pine said lambert in a low voice and a furtive look round you understand no said the girl boldly unless you mean never mind what i mean interrupted the man hastily for he was determined not to commit himself will you hold your tongue for three days chaldea looked hard at his face upon which the red firelight played brightly but could not read what was in his mind however she thought that the request showed a sign of yielding and was a mute confession that he knew he was in her power i give you three days she murmured but i have your promise then so goodbye interrupted lambert abruptly and walked away hastily in the direction of garvington village his mind was more or less of a chaos but at all events he had gained time to reduce the chaos to some sort of order still as yet he could not see the outcome of the situation and departed swiftly in order to think it over chaldea made a step or two as if to follow but a reflection that she could do no good by talking at the moment and a certainty that she held him in the hollow of her hand made her pause with a hitch of her shapely shoulders she resumed her seat by the fire brooding sombrely on the way in which this gentile had rejected her love bending her black brows and showing her white teeth like an irritated dog she inwardly cursed herself for cherishing so foolish a love nevertheless she did not try to overcome it but resolved to force the gorgio to her feet then she could spurn him if she had a mind to as he had spurned her but she well knew and confessed it to herself with a sigh that there would be no spurning on her part since her wayward love was stronger than her pride did the gentile bring the gold my sister asked a harsh voice and she raised her head to see karas hairy face bent to her ear no brother he goes to lundra to get the gold did i not play my fish in fine style i took it for truth sister said kara looking at her searchingly chaldea nodded wearily i am a great witch as you can see you will be my romi when the gold chinks in our pockets yes for certain brother its a true fortune before our camp is changed sister persisted the man greedily no for tomorrow we may take the road since the great lord orders us off his land and yet chaldea stood up suddenly recollecting what had been said by pines wife why should we leave the rabbit cant kick dust in the foxs face sister said kara meaning that garvington was too strong for the gypsies there are rabbits and rabbits said chaldea sententiously where is hearne brother in gentillas tent with a gorgious gentleman hes trading a horse with the swell rye and wants no meddling with his time sister i meddle now snapped chaldea and walked away in her usual free and graceful manner kara shrugged his shoulders and then took refuge in talking to his violin to which he related his doubts of the girls truth and he smiled grimly as he thought of the recovered knife which was again snugly hidden under his weatherworn green coat chaldea who did not stand on ceremony walked to the end of the camp without paying any attention to the excited gypsies and flung back the flap of the old womans tent mother cockleshell was not within as she had given the use of her abode to pine and his visitor this latter was a small neat man with a smooth boyish face and reddish hair he had the innocent expression of a foxterrier and rather resembled one he was neatly and inoffensively dressed in blue serge and although he did not look exactly like a gentleman he would have passed for one in a crowd when chaldea made her abrupt entrance he was talking volubly to pine and the millionaire addressed himwhen he answeredas silver chaldea remembering the conversation she had overheard between pine and miss greeby speedily reached the conclusion that the neat little man was the secretary referred to therein probably he had come to report about lady agnes what is it sister demanded pine sharply and making a sign that silver should stop talking does the camp travel tomorrow brother perhaps yes retorted pine abruptly and perhaps no brother if you use your power silver raised his faint eyebrows and looked questioningly at his employer as if to ask what this cryptic sentence meant pine knew only too well since chaldea had impressed him thoroughly with the fact that she had overheard many of his secrets therefore he did not waste time in argument but nodded quietly sleep in peace sister the camp shall stay if you wish it i do wish it she glanced at silver and changed her speech to romany the ring will be here tapping her finger in one week if we stay so be it sister replied pine also in romany and with a gleam of satisfaction in his dark eyes go now and return when this gentile goes what of the golden gorgious one he seeks lundra this night for the ring sister chaldea looked hard at him for the ring she said abruptly then dropping the tentflap which she had held all the time she disappeared silver looked at his master inquiringly and noted that he seemed very satisfied what did she say in romany he asked eagerly true news and new news and news you never heard of mocked pine dont ask questions mark but since i am your secretary you are secretary to hubert pine not to ishmael hearne broke in the other man and when romany is spoken it concerns the last silvers palecolored redrimmed eyes twinkled in an evil manner you are afraid that i may learn too much about you you know all that is to be known retorted pine sharply but i wont have you meddle with my romany business a gentile such as you are cannot understand the chals try me there is no need you are my secretarymy trusted secretarythat is quite enough i pay you well to keep my secrets i dont keep them because you pay me said silver quickly and with a look of meekness belied by the sinister gleam in his pale bluish eyes it is devotion that makes me honest i owe everything to you i think you do observed pine quietly when i found you in whitechapel you were only a pauper toymaker an inventor of toys remember you made your fortune out of my inventions the three clever toys you invented laid the foundations of my wealth corrected the millionaire calmly but i made my money in the south african share business and if i hadnt taken up your toys you would have been now struggling in whitechapel since there was no one but me to exploit your brains in the toymaking way i have rescued you from starvation i have made you my secretary and pay you a good salary and i have introduced you to good society yes you do indeed owe everything to me yet he paused yet what miss greeby observed that those who have most cause to be grateful are generally the least thankful to those who befriend them i am not sure but what she is right silver pushed up his lower lip contemptuously and a derisive expression came over his cleanshaven face does a clever man like you go to that emancipated woman for experience emancipated women are usually very clever said pine dryly as they combine the logic of the male with the intuition of the female and i have observed myself in many cases that kindness brings out ingratitude silver looked sullen and uneasy i dont know why you should talk to me in this strain he said irritably i appreciate what you have done for me and have no reason to treat you badly if i did i would break you flamed out his employer angered by the mere thought so long as you serve me well silver i am your friend and i shall treat you as i have always done with every consideration but you play any tricks on me and he paused expressively oh i wont betray you if thats what you mean i am quite sure you wont said the millionaire with emphasis for if you do you return to your original poverty and remember mark that there is nothing in my life which has any need of concealment silver cast a look round the tent and at the rough clothes of the speaker no need of any concealment he asked significantly certainly not rejoined pine violently i dont wish my gypsy origin to be known in the gentile world but if the truth did come to light there is nothing to be ashamed of i commit no crime in calling myself by a gorgio name and in accumulating a fortune you have no hold over me the mans look was so threatening that silver winced i dont hint at any hold over you he observed mildly i am bound to you both by gratitude and selfinterest aha that last is better it is just as well that we have come to this understanding if you pines speech was ended by a sharp fit of coughing and silver looked at his contortions with a thinlipped smile youll kill yourself if you live this damp colonial sort of tentlife was his observation here take a drink of water pine did so and wiped his mouth with the sleeve of his rough coat youre a gorgio he said weakly for the fit had shaken him and cant understand how a bred and born romany longs for the smell of the smoke the space of the open country and the sound of the kalo jib however i did not ask you here to discuss these things but to take my instructions about lady agnes asked the secretary his eyes scintillating you have had those long ago although trusting my wife as i do there was really no need for me to ask you to watch her that is very true lady agnes is exceedingly circumspect is she happy silver lifted his shoulders as happy as a woman can be who is married to one man while she loves another he expected an outburst of anger from his employer but none came on the contrary pine sighed restlessly poor soul i did her a wrong in making her my wife she would have been happier with lambert in his poverty probably her tastes dont lie like those of other women in the direction of squandering money by the way i suppose since you are here that you know lambert is staying in the abbots wood cottage yes i know that and what of it demanded the millionaire sharply nothing only i thought you would like to know i fancied you had come here to see if i did not i can trust you to see that my wife and lambert do not meet without spying myself if you love and trust your wife so entirely i wonder you ask me to spy on her at all said silver with a faint sneer she is a woman and we gypsies have sufficient of the oriental in us to mistrust even the most honest women lambert has not been to the manor no thats a bad sign he cant trust himself in her presence ill choke the life out of you rat that you are if you talk in such a way about my wife what you think doesnt matter hold your tongue and come to business i asked you here to take my instructions silver was rather cowed by this outburst as he was cunning enough to know precisely how far he could venture with safety i am waiting he observed in sullen tones garvingtonas i knew he wouldhas ordered us off the land as the wood is really mine since i hold it as security having paid off the mortgage i dont choose that he should deal with it as though it were his own herehe passed along a letteri have written that on my office paper and you will see that it says i have heard how gypsies are camping here and that it is my wish they should remain garvington is not to order them off on any pretext whatsoever you understand yes silver nodded and slipped the paper into his breast pocket after a hasty glance at the contents which were those the writer had stated but if garvington wishes to know why you take such an interest in the gypsies what am i to say say nothing simply do what i have told you garvington may suspect that you are a romany he wont he thinks that im in paris and will never connect me with ishmael hearne if he asks questions when we meet i can tell him my own tale by the way why is he so anxious to get rid of the tribe there have been many burglaries lately in various parts of hengishire explained the secretary and garvington is afraid lest the gypsies should be mixed up with them he thinks this camp being near some of the men may break into the house what nonsense gypsies steal i dont deny but in an open way they are not burglars however and never will be garvington has never seen any near the manor that he should take fright in this way i am not so sure of that once or twice i have seen that girl who came to you hanging about the house chaldea pine started and looked earnestly at his companion yes she told mrs belgroves fortune one day when she met her in the park and also tried to make lady agnes cross her hand with silver for the same purpose nothing came of that however as your wife refused to have her fortune told pine frowned and looked uneasy remembering that chaldea knew of his gentile masquerading however as he could see no reason to suspect that the girl had betrayed him since she had nothing to gain by taking such a course he passed the particular incident over i must tell chaldea not to go near the manor he muttered you will be wise and tell the men also garvington has threatened to shoot any one who tries to enter his house garvingtons a little fool said pine violently there is no chance that the romany will enter his house he can set his silly mind at rest well youre warned said silver with an elaborate pretence of indifference pine looked up growling what the devil do you mean mark do you think that i intend to break in fool a romany isnt a thief of that sort i fancied from tradition that they were thieves of all sorts retorted the secretary coolly and suppose you took a fancy to come quietly and see your wife i should never do that in this dress interrupted the millionaire in a sharp tone my wife would then know my true name and birth i wish to keep that from her although there is nothing disgraceful in the secret i wonder why you say that he said looking searchingly at the little man only because lambert is in the lambert lambert you are always harping on lambert i have your interest at heart pine laughed doubtfully i am not so sure of that selfinterest rather i trust my wife you do since you make me spy on her said silver caustically i trust my wife so far pursued the other man if you will permit me to finish my sentence there is no need for her to see her cousin andas they have kept apart for so longi dont think there is any chance of their seeking one anothers company absence makes the heart grow fonder remarked the secretary sententiously and you may be living in a fools paradise lambert is within runningaway distance of her remember pine laughed in a raucous manner an elopement would have taken place long ago had it been intended he snapped tartly dont imagine impossibilities mark agnes married me for my money so that i might save the credit of the lambert family but for me garvington would have passed through the bankruptcy court long ago i have paid off certain mortgages but i hold them as security for my wifes good behavior she knows that an elopement with her cousin would mean the ruin of her brother you do indeed trust her observed silver sarcastically i trust her so far and no further repeated pine with an angry snarl a gentile she is and gentiles are tricky he stretched out a slim brown hand significantly and opened it i hold her and garvington there and he tapped the palm lightly you dont hold lambert and he is the dangerous one only dangerous if agnes consents to run away with him and she wont do that replied pine coolly well she certainly doesnt care for money she cares for the credit of her family and gave herself to me so that the same might be saved silver shrugged his narrow shoulders what fools these aristocrats are he observed pleasantly even if garvington were sold up he would still have his title and enough to live on in a quiet way probably but it was not entirely to save his estates that he agreed to my marriage with his sister said pine pointedly and quietly eh what the little mans foxy face became alive with eager inquiry nothing said pine roughly and rose heavily to his feet mind your own infernal business and mine also go back and show that letter to garvington i want my tribe to stay here my tribe laughed silver scrambling to his feet and when he took his departure he was still laughing he wondered what garvington would say did he know that his sister was married to a fullblooded romany pine in the character of a horsecoper saw him out of the camp and was staring after him when chaldea on the watch touched his shoulder i come to your tent brother she said with very bright eyes eh yes pine aroused himself out of a brown study avali miri pen you have things to say to me golden things which have to do with your happiness and mine brother hai a weddingring sister truly brother if you be a true romany and not the gentile you call yourself chapter viii at midnight silvers delivery of his employers orders to lord garvington were apparently carried out for no further intimation was given to the gypsies that they were to vacate abbots wood the master of the manor grumbled a good deal at the high tone taken by his brotherinlaw as having the instincts of a landlord he strongly objected to the presence of such riffraff on his estates however as pine had the whiphand of him he was obliged to yield although he could not understand why the man should favor the romany in this way some of his infernal philanthropy i suppose said garvington in a tone of disgust to the secretary pines always doing this sort of thing and people aint a bit grateful well said silver dryly i suppose thats his lookout if it is let him keep to his own side of the road retorted the other since i dont interfere with his business let him not meddle with mine as he holds the mortgage and can foreclose at any moment it is his business insisted silver tartly and after all the gypsies are doing no very great harm they will if they get the chance id string up the whole lot if i had my way silver poachers and blackguards every one of them i know that pine is always helping rotters in london but i didnt know that he had any cause to interfere with this lot how did he come to know about them well mr lambert might have told him answered the secretary not unwilling to draw that young man into the trouble he is at abbots wood yes i lent him the cottage and this is my reward he meddles with my business along with pine why cant he shut his mouth i dont say that mr lambert did tell him but he might have done so i am quite sure that he did said garvington emphatically and growing red all over his chubby face otherwise pine would never have heard since he is in paris i shall speak to lambert you wont find him at home i looked in at his cottage to pass the time and his housekeeper said that he had gone to london all of a sudden this very evening oh hell turn up again said garvington carelessly hes sick of town silver since the little man hesitated since when asked the secretary curiously never mind retorted the other gruffly for he did not wish to mention the enforced marriage of his sister to silver of course there was no need to as garvington aware that the neat foxyfaced man was his brotherinlaws confidential adviser felt sure that everything was known to him ill leave those blamed gypsies alone meanwhile finished garvington changing and finishing the conversation but ill speak to pine when i see him he returns from paris in three weeks remarked silver at which information the gross little lord simply hunched his fat shoulders much as pine had done for him garvington hated the man with all the power of his mean and narrow mind and as the millionaire returned this dislike with a feeling of profound contempt the two met as seldom as possible only lady agnes was the link between them the visible object of sale and barter which had been sold by one to the other it was about this time that the houseparty at the manor began to break up since it was now the first week in september and many of the shooters wished to go north for better sport many of the men departed and some of the women who were due at other country houses but mrs belgrove and miss greeby still remained the first because she found herself extremely comfortable and appreciated garvingtons cook and the second on account of lambert being in the vicinity miss greeby had been very disappointed to learn that the young man had gone to london but heard from mrs tribb that he was expected back in three days she therefore lingered so as to have another conversation with him and meanwhile haunted the gypsy camp for the purpose of keeping an eye on chaldea who was much too beautiful for her peace of mind sometimes silver accompanied her as the lady had given him to understand that she knew pines real rank and name so the two were made free of the bohemians and frequently chatted with ishmael hearne but they kept his secret as did chaldea and garvington had no idea that the man he dreaded and hatedwho flung money to him as if he were tossing a bone to a dogwas within speaking distance if he had known he would assuredly have guessed the reason why sir hubert pine had interested himself in the doings of a wandering tribe of undesirable creatures a week passed away and still although miss greeby made daily inquiries lambert did not put in an appearance at the forest cottage thinking that he had departed to escape her she made up her impatient mind to repair to london and to hunt him up at his club with this idea she intimated to lady garvington that she was leaving the manor early next morning the ladies had just left the dinnertable and were having coffee in the drawingroom when miss greeby made this abrupt announcement oh my dear said lady garvington in dismay i wish you would change your mind nearly everyone has gone and the house is getting quite dull thanks ever so much remarked mrs belgrove lightly she sat near the fire for the evening was chilly and what with paint and powder and hairdye to say nothing of her artistic and carefully chosen dress looked barely thirtyfive in the rosy lights cast by the shaded lamps i dont mean you dear murmured the hostess who was even more untidy and helpless than usual you are quite a host in yourself and that recipe you gave me for patagonian soup kept garvington in quite a good humor for ever so long but the house will be dull for you without clara agnes is here jane i fear agnes is not much of an entertainer said that lady smiling in a weary manner for this society chatter bored her greatly thats not to be wondered at struck in miss greeby abruptly for of course you are thinking of your husband lady agnes colored slightly under miss greebys very direct gaze but replied equably enough to save appearances he is still in paris when did you last hear from him dear questioned lady garvington more to manufacture conversation than because she really cared only today i had a letter he is carrying out some special business and will return in two or three weeks you will be glad to see him no doubt sneered miss greeby i am always glad to see my husband and to be with him answered lady agnes in a dignified manner she knew perfectly well that miss greeby hated her and guessed the reason but she was not going to give her any satisfaction by revealing the true feelings of her heart well i intend to stay here jane if its all the same to you cried mrs belgrove in her liveliest manner and with a side glance taking in both miss greeby and lady agnes only this morning i received a chitchat letter from mr lambertwe are great friends you knowsaying that he intended to come here for a few days such a delightful man he is oh dear me yes cried lady garvington starting i remember he wrote yesterday from london asking if he might come i told him yes although i mentioned that we had hardly anyone with us just now miss greeby looked greatly annoyed as mrs belgrove maliciously saw for she knew well that the heiress would now regret having so hastily intimated her approaching departure what was the expression on lady agness face the old lady could not see for the millionaires wife shielded itpresumably from the firewith a large fan of white feathers had mrs belgrove been able to read that countenance she would have seen satisfaction written thereon and would probably have set down the expression to a wrong cause in reality agnes was glad to think that lamberts promise was being kept and that he no longer intended to avoid her company so openly but if she was pleased miss greeby was not and still continued to look annoyed since she had burnt her boats by announcing her departure and what annoyed her still more than her hasty decision was that she would leave lambert in the house along with the rival she most dreaded though what the young man could see in this pale washedout creature miss greeby could not imagine she glanced at a near mirror and saw her own opulent fullblown looks clothed in a paleblue dinnergown which went so wellas she inartistically decided with her ruddy locks mrs belgrove considered that miss greeby looked like a paintbox or a sunset or one of turners most vivid pictures but the heiress was very well pleased with herself lady agnes in her favorite white with her pale face and serious looks was but a dull person of the nun persuasion and miss greeby did not think that lambert cared for nuns when he had an amazonian intelligent palso she put itat hand but of course he might prefer dark beauties like chaldea poor miss greeby she was pursuing her wooing under very great difficulties and became silent in order to think out some way of revoking in some natural manner the information of her departure there were other women in the room who joined in the conversation and all were glad to hear that mr lambert intended to pay a visit to his cousin for indeed the young man was a general favorite and then as two or three decidedmrs belgrove amongst the numberthere really could be nothing in the report that he loved lady agnes still else he would scarcely come and stay where she was as for pines wife she was a washedout creature who had never really loved her cousin as people had thought and after all why should she since he was so poor especially when she was married to a millionaire with the looks of an eastern prince and manners of quite an original nature although these were not quite conventional oh yes there was nothing in the scandal that said garvington had sold his sister to bolster up the family property lady agnes was quite happy and her husband was a dear man who left her a great deal to her own deviceswhich he wouldnt have done had he suspected the cousin and who gave her pots of money to spend and what more could a sensible woman want in this way those in the drawingroom babbled while agnes stared into the fire bracing herself to encounter lambert who would surely arrive within the next two or three days and while miss greeby savagely rebuked herself for having so foolishly intimated her departure then the men straggled in from their wine and bridge became the order of the night with some while others begged for music after a song or so and the execution of a beethoven sonata to which no one paid any attention a young lady gave a dance after the manner of maud allan to which everyone attended then came feats of strength in which miss greeby proved herself to be a female sandow and later a number of the guests sojourned to the billiardroom to play when they grew weary of that tobogganing down the broad staircase on trays was suggested and indulged in amidst shrieks of laughter afterwards those heated by this horseplay strayed on to the terrace to breathe the fresh air and flirt in the moonlight in fact every conceivable way of passing the time was taken advantage of by these very bored people who scarcely knew how to get through the long evening they seem to be enjoying themselves freddy said lady garvington to her husband when she drifted against him in the course of attending to her guests i really think they find this jolly i dont care a red copper what they find retorted the little man who was looking worried and not quite his usual self i wish the whole lot would get out of the house im sick of them aint you well freddy i knew that patagonian soup was too rich for you oh the soup was all rightripping soup snorted freddy smacking his lips over the recollection but im bothered over pine he isnt ill is he questioned lady garvington anxiously she liked her brotherinlaw who was always kind to her no hang him nothing worse than his usual lung trouble i suppose but he is in paris and wont answer my letters letters freddy dear yes jane dear he mocked hang it i want money and he wont stump up i cant even get an answer speak to mr silver damn mr silver well im sure frederick you neednt swear at me said poor wan lady garvington drawing herself up mr silver is very kind he went to that gypsy camp and found out how they cook hedgehog that will be a new dish for you dear you havent eaten hedgehog no and whats more i dont intend to eat it but you may as well tell me how these gypsies cook it and freddy listened with both his red ears to the description on hearing which he decided that his wife might instruct the cook how to prepare the animal but no one will eat it but me lady garvington shuddered i shant touch it myself those horrid snails you insisted on being cooked a week ago made me quite ill you are always trying new experiments freddy because i get so tired of everyday dishes growled lord garvington these cooks have no invention i wish id lived in rome when they had those banquets you read of in gibbon did he write a book on cookery asked lady garvington very naturally no he turned out a lot of dull stuff about wars and migrations of tribes you are silly jane whats that about migration of tribes asked mrs belgrove who was in a good humor as she had won largely at bridge you dont mean those dear gypsies at abbots wood do you lord garvington i met one of them the other dayquite a girl and very pretty in a dark way she told my fortune and said that i would come in for a lot of money im sure i hope so sighed mrs belgrove celestine is so expensive but no one can fit me like she can and she knows it and takes advantage the horrid creature i wish the tribe of gypsies would clear out snapped freddy standing before the fire and glaring at the company generally i know theyll break in here and rob well drawled silver who was hovering near dressed so carefully that he looked more of a foxy neat bounder than ever i have noticed that some of the brutes have been sneaking round the place mrs belgrove shrieked oh how lucky i occupy a bedroom on the third floor just like a little bird in its tinyweeny nest they cant get at me there can they lord garvington they dont want you observed miss greeby in her deep voice its your diamonds theyd like to get oh mrs belgrove shrieked again lock my diamonds up in your strong room lord garvington do do do to please poor little me and she effusively clasped her lean hands upon which many of the said diamonds glittered i dont think there is likely to be any trouble with these poor gypsies mrs belgrove remarked lady agnes negligently hubert has told me a great deal about them and they are really not so bad as people make out your husband cant know anything of such ragtags said miss greeby looking at the beautiful pale face and wondering if she really had any suspicion that pine was one of the crew she mentioned oh but hubert does answered lady agnes innocently he has met many of them when he has been out helping people you have no idea any of you how good hubert is she added addressing the company generally he walks on the embankment sometimes on winter nights and gives the poor creatures money and in the country i have often seen him stop to hand a shilling to some tramp in the lanes a gypsy for choice growled miss greeby marvelling that lady agnes could not see the resemblance between the tramps faces and that of her own husband however i hope pines darlings wont come here to rob ill fight for my jewels i can promise you one of the men laughed i shouldnt like to get a blow from your fist miss greeby smiled grimly and looked at his puny stature women have to protect themselves from men like you she said amidst great laughter for the physical difference between her and the man was quite amusing its all very well talking said garvington crossly but i dont trust these gypsies why dont you clear them off your land then asked silver daringly garvington glared until his gooseberry eyes nearly fell out of his red face ill clear everyone to bed thats what ill do he retorted crossing the room to the middle french window of the drawingroom i wish you fellows would stop your larking out there he cried its close upon midnight and all decent people should be in bed since when have you joined the methodists garvington asked an officer who had come over from some twelvemile distant barracks to pass the night and a girl behind him began to sing a hymn lady agnes frowned i wish you wouldnt do that miss ardale she said in sharp rebuke and the girl had the sense to be silent while garvington fussed over the closing of the window shutters going to stand a siege asked miss greeby laughing or do you expect burglars particularly on this night i dont expect them at all retorted the little man but i tell you i hate the idea of these lawless gypsies about the place still if anyone comes he added grimly i shall shoot then the attacking person or party neednt bother cried the officer i shouldnt mind standing up to your fire myself garvington with laughter and chatter and much merriment at the hosts expense the guests went their several ways the women to chat in one anothers dressingrooms and the men to have a final smoke and a final drink garvington with two footmen and his butler went round the house carefully closing all the shutters and seeing that all was safe his sister rather marvelled at this excessive precaution and said as much to her hostess it wouldnt matter if the gypsies did break in she said when alone with lady garvington in her own bedroom it would be some excitement for all these people must find it very dull here im sure i do my best agnes said the sisterinlaw plaintively of course you do you poor dear said the other kissing her but garvington always asks people here who havent two ideas a horrid rowdy lot they are i wonder you stand it garvington asks those he likes agnes i see he hasnt any brains and his guests suit him for the same reason they eat a great deal wailed lady garvington im sure i might as well be a cook all my time is taken up with feeding them well freddy married you jane because you had a genius for looking after food your mother was much the same she always kept a good table lady agnes laughed yours was a most original wooing jane id like to live on bread and water for my part agnes put freddy on it dear hes getting too stout i never thought that gluttony was a crime but when i look at freddychecking her speech she spread out her hands with an ineffable lookim glad that noel is coming she ended rather daringly at least he will be more interesting than any of these frivolous people you have collected lady garvington looked at her anxiously you dont mind noel coming no dear why should i well you see agnes i fancied dont fancy anything noel and i entirely understand one another i hope blurted out the other woman that it is a right understanding agnes winced and looked at her with enforced composure i am devoted to my husband she said with emphasis and i have every reason to be he has kept his part of the bargain so i keep mine but she added with a pale smile when i think how i sold myself to keep up the credit of the family and now see freddy entertaining this riffraff i am sorry that i did not marry noel whom i loved so dearly that would have meant our ruin bleated lady garvington sadly your ruin is only delayed jane freddy is a weak selfindulgent fool and is eating his way into the next world it will be a happy day for you when an apoplectic fit makes you a widow my dear the wife was shocked he is your brother mores the pity i have no illusions about freddy jane and i dont think you have either now go away and sleep its no use lying awake thinking over tomorrows dinner give freddy the bread and water you talked about lady garvington laughed in a weak aimless way and then kissed her sisterinlaw with a sigh after which she drifted out of the room in her usual vague manner very shortly the clock over the stables struck midnight and by that time garvington the virtuous had induced all his men guests to go to bed the women chatted a little longer and then in their turn sought repose by halfpast twelve the great house was in complete darkness and bulked a mighty mass of darkness in the pale september moonlight lady agnes got to bed quickly and tired out by the boredom of the evening quickly fell asleep suddenly she awoke with all her senses on the alert and with a sense of vague danger hovering round there were sounds of running feet and indistinct oaths and distant cries and she could have sworn that a pistolshot had startled her from slumber in a moment she was out of bed and ran to open her window on looking out she saw that the moonlight was very brilliant and in it beheld a tall man running swiftly from the house he sped down the broad path and just when he was abreast of a miniature shrubbery she heard a second shot which seemed to be fired therefrom the man staggered and stumbled and fell immediately afterwards her brothershe recognized his voice raised in angerran out of the house followed by some of the male guests terrified by the sight and the sound of the shots lady agnes huddled on her dressinggown hastily and thrust her bare feet into slippers the next moment she was out of her bedroom and down the stairs a wild idea had entered her mind that perhaps lambert had come secretly to the manor and had been shot by garvington in mistake for a burglar the corridors and the hall were filled with guests more or less lightly attired mostly women whitefaced and startled agnes paid no attention to their shrieks but hurried into the side passage which terminated at the door out of which her brother had left the house she went outside also and made for the group round the fallen man what is it who is it she asked gasping with the hurry and the fright go back agnes go back cried garvington looking up with a distorted face strangely pale in the moonlight but who is it who has been killed she caught sight of the fallen mans countenance and shrieked great heavens it is hubert is he dead yes said silver who stood at her elbow shot through the heart chapter ix afterwards with amazing and sinister rapidity the news spread that a burglar had been shot dead while trying to raid the manor first the garvington villagers learned it then it became the common property of the neighborhood until it finally reached the nearest county town and thus brought the police on the scene lord garvington was not pleased when the local inspector arrived and intimated as much in a somewhat unpleasant fashion he was never a man who spared those in an inferior social position it is no use your coming over darby he said bluntly to the redhaired police officer who was of irish extraction i have sent to scotland yard all in good time my lord replied the inspector coolly as the murder has taken place in my district i have to look into the matter and report to the london authorities if it should be necessary what right have you to class the affair as a murder inquired garvington i only go by the rumors i have heard my lord some say that you winged the man and broke his right arm others tell me that a second shot was fired in the garden and it was that which killed ishmael hearne it is true darby i only fired the first shot as those who were with me will tell you i dont know who shot in the garden and apparently no one else does it was this unknown individual in the garden that killed hearne by the way how did you come to hear the name half a dozen people have told me my lord along with the information i have just given you nothing else is talked of far and wide and it is just twelve oclock muttered the stout little lord wiping his scarlet face pettishly ill news travels fast however as you are here you may as well take charge of things until the london men arrive the london men arent going to usurp my privileges my lord said darby firmly theres no sense in taking matters out of my hands and if you will pardon my saying so i should have been sent for in the first instance i daresay snapped garvington coolly but the matter is too important to be left in the hands of a local policeman darby was nettled and his hard eyes grew angry i am quite competent to deal with any murder even if it is that of the highest in england much less with the death of a common gypsy thats just where it is darby the common gypsy who has been shot happens to be my brotherinlaw sir hubert pine questioned the inspector thoroughly taken aback yes of course i didnt know him when i fired or i should not have done so darby i understood and his wife my sister understood that sir hubert was in paris it passes my comprehension to guess why he should have come in the dead of night dressed as a gypsy to raid my house perhaps it was a bet said darby desperately puzzled bet be hanged pine could come openly to this place whenever he liked i never was so astonished in my life as when i saw him lying dead near the shrubbery and the worst of it is that my sister ran out and saw him also she fainted and has been in bed ever since attended by lady garvington you had no idea that the man you shot was sir hubert my lord hang it no would i have shot him had i guessed who he was no no my lord of course not said the officer hastily but as i have come to take charge of the case you will give me a detailed account of what has taken place i would rather wait until the scotland yard fellows come grumbled garvington as i dont wish to repeat my story twice still as you are on the spot i may as well ask your advice you may be able to throw some light on the subject im hanged if i can darby pulled out his notebook i am all attention my lord garvington plunged abruptly into his account first having looked to see if the library door was firmly closed as there have been many burglaries lately in this part of the world he said speaking with deliberation i got an idea into my head that this house might be broken into natural enough my lord interposed darby glancing round the splendid room a historic house such as this is would tempt any burglar so i thought remarked the other pleased that darby should agree with him so promptly and i declared several times within the hearing of many people that if a raid was made i should shoot the first man who tried to enter hang it an englishmans house is his castle and no man has a right to come in without permission quite so my lord but the punishment of the burglar should be left to the law said the inspector softly oh the deuce take the law i prefer to execute my own punishments however to make a long story short i grew more afraid of a raid when these gypsies came to camp at abbots wood as they are just the sort of scoundrels who would break in and steal why didnt you order them off your land asked the policeman alertly i did and then my brotherinlaw sent a message through his secretary who is staying here asking me to allow them to remain i did why did sir hubert send that message my lord hang it man thats just what i am trying to learn and i am the more puzzled because he came last night dressed as a gypsy he must be one said darby who had seen pine and now recalled his dark complexion and jetty eyes it seems from what i have been told that he stopped at the abbots wood camp under the name of ishmael hearne so silver informed me who is he pines secretary who knows all his confidential affairs silver declared when the secret could be kept no longer that pine was really a gypsy called ishmael hearne occasionally longing for the old life he stepped down from his millionaire pedestal and mixed with his own people when he was supposed to be in paris he was really with the gypsies so you can now understand why he sent the message asking me to let these vagrants stay you told me a few moments ago that you could not understand that message my lord said darby quickly and looking searchingly at the other man garvington grew a trifle confused did i well to tell you the truth darby im so mixed up over the business that i cant say what i do know or what i dont know youd better take all i tell you with a grain of salt until i am quite myself again natural enough my lord remarked the inspector again and quite believed what he said and the details of the murder i went to bed as usual said garvington wearily for the events of the night had tired him out and everyone else retired some time about midnight i went round with the footmen and the butler to see that everything was safe for i was too anxious to let them look after things without me then i heard a noise of footsteps on the gravel outside just as i was dropping off to sleep about what time was that my lord halfpast one oclock i cant be certain as to a minute i jumped up and laid hold of my revolver which was handy i always kept it beside me in case of a burglary then i stole downstairs in slippers and pajamas to the passageoh here garvington rose quickly come with me and see the place for yourself inspector darby put on his cap and with his notebook still in his hand followed the stout figure of his guide garvington led him through the entrance hall and into a sidepassage which terminated in a narrow door there was no one to spy on them as the master of the house had sent all the servants to their own quarters and the guests were collected in the drawingroom and smokingroom although a few of the ladies remained in their bedrooms trying to recover from the nights experience i came down here said garvington opening the door and heard the burglar as i thought he was prowling about on the other side i threw open the door in this way and the man plunged forward to enter i fired and got him in the right arm for i saw it swinging uselessly by his side as he departed was he in a hurry asked darby rather needlessly he went off like greased lightning i didnt follow as i thought that others of his gang might be about but closing the door again i shouted blue murder in a few minutes everyone came down and while i was waitingit all passed in a flash remember darbyi heard a second shot then the servants and my friends came and we ran out to find the man lying by that shrubbery quite dead i turned him over and had just grasped the fact that he was my brotherinlaw when lady agnes ran out when she learned the news she naturally fainted the women carried her back to her room and we took the body of pine into the house a doctor came along this morningfor i sent for a doctor as soon as it was dawnand said that pine had been shot through the heart and who shot him asked darby sagely garvington pointed to the shrubbery someone was concealed there he declared how do you know that my lord my sister attracted by my shot jumped out of bed and threw up her window she saw the manof course she never guessed that he was pinerunning down the path and saw him fall by the shrubbery when the second shot was fired her bedroom is then on this side of the house my lord up there said garvington pointing directly over the narrow door which was painted a rich blue color and looked rather bizarre set in the puritanic greyness of the walls my own bedroom is further along towards the right that is why i heard the footsteps so plainly on this gravel and he stamped hard while with a wave of his hand he invited the inspector to examine the surroundings darby did so with keen eyes and an alert brain the two stood on the west side of the mansion where it fronted the threemiles distant abbots wood the manor was a heterogeneouslooking sort of place suggesting the whims and fancies of many generations for something was taken away here and something was taken away there and this had been altered while that had been left in its original state until the house seemed to be made up of all possible architectural styles it was a tall building of three stories although the flattish redtiled roofs took away somewhat from its height and spread over an amazing quantity of land as darby thought it could have housed a regiment and must have cost something to keep up as wind and weather and time had mellowed its incongruous parts into one neutral tint it looked odd and attractive moss and lichen ivy and virginia creeperthis last flaring in crimson gloryclothed the massive stone walls with a gracious mantle of natural beauty narrow stone steps rather chipped led down from the blue door to the broad yellow path which came round the rear of the house and swept down hill in a wide curve past the miniature shrubbery right into the bosom of the park this path explained garvington stamping again runs right through the park to a small wicket gate set in the brick wall which borders the high road darby and that runs straightly past abbots wood mused the inspector of course sir hubert would know of the path and the wicket gate certainly dont be an ass darby cried garvington petulantly he has been in this house dozens of times and knows it as well as i do myself why do you ask so obvious a question i was only wondering if sir hubert came by the high road to the wicket gate you speak of lord garvington that also is obvious retorted the other irritably since he wished to come here he naturally would take the easiest way then why did he not enter by the main avenue gates because at that hour they would be shut andsince it is evident that his visit was a secret onehe would have had to knock up the lodgekeeper why was his visit a secret one questioned darby pointedly that is the thing that puzzles me anything more yes why should sir hubert come to the blue door i cant answer that question either the whole reason of his being here instead of in paris is a mystery to me oh as to that last the reply is easy remarked the inspector sir hubert wished to revert to his free gypsy life and pretended to be in paris so that he would follow his fancy without the truth becoming known but why he should come on this particular night and by this particular path to this particular door is the problem i have to solve quite so and i only hope that you will solve it for the sake of my sister darby reflected for a moment or so did lady agnes ask her husband to come here to see her privately hang it no man cried garvington aghast she believed as we all did that her husband was in paris and certainly never dreamed that he was masquerading as a gypsy three miles away there was no masquerading about the matter my lord said darby dryly since sir hubert really was a gypsy called ishmael hearne that fact will come out at the inquest it has come out now everyone knows the truth and a nice thing it is for me and lady agnes i dont think you need worry about that lord garvington the honorable way in which the late sir hubert attained rank and gained wealth will reflect credit on his humble origin when the papers learn the story confound the papers interrupted garvington fretfully i sincerely hope that they wont make too great a fuss over the business the little mans hope was vain as he might have guessed that it would be for when the news became known in fleet street the newspapers were only too glad to discover an original sensation for the dead season every day journalists and special correspondents were sent down in such numbers that the platform of wanbury railway station was crowded with them as the townit was the chief town of hengishirewas five miles away from the village of garvington every possible kind of vehicle was used to reach the scene of the crime and the manor became a rendezvous for all the morbid people both in the neighborhood and out of it the reporters in particular poked and pried all over the place passing from the great house to the village and thence to the gypsy camp on the borders of abbots wood from one person and another they learned facts which were published with such fanciful additions that they read like fiction on the authority of mother cockleshellwho was not averse to earning a few shillingsa kind of gil blas tale was put into print and the wanderings of ishmael hearne were set forth in the picturesque style of a picarooning romance but of the time when the adventurous gypsy assumed his gentile name the romany could tell nothing for obvious reasons until the truth became known because of the mans tragic and unforeseen death those in the camp were not aware that he was a gorgio millionaire but where the story of mother cockleshell left off that of mark silver began for the secretary had been connected with his employer almost from the days of hearnes first exploits as pine in london and silverwho also charged for the blended fact and fiction which he suppliedfreely related all he knew hearne came to london and called himself hubert pine he stated frankly and not hesitating to confess his own lowly origin we met when i was starving as a toymaker in whitechapel i invented some penny toys which pine put on the market for me they were successful and he made money i am bound to confess that he paid me tolerably well although he certainly took the lions share with the money he made in this way he speculated in south african shares and as the boom was then on he simply coined gold everything he touched turned into cash and however deeply he plunged into the money market he always came out top in the end by turning over his money and reinvesting it and by fresh speculations he became a millionaire in a wonderfully short space of time then he made me his secretary and afterwards took up politics the government gave him a knighthood for services rendered to his party and he became a wellknown figure in the world of finance he married lady agnes lambert andandthats all you were aware that he was a gypsy mr silver asked the reporter oh yes i knew all about his origin from the first days of our acquaintanceship he asked me to keep his true name and rank secret as it was none of my business i did so at times hearneor rather pine as i know him best by that namegrew weary of civilization and then would return to his own life of the tent and road no one suspected amongst the romany that he was anything else but a horsecoper he always pretended to be in paris or berlin on financial affairs when he went back to his people and i transacted all business during his absence you knew that he was at the abbots wood camp certainly i saw him there once or twice to receive instructions about business i expostulated with him for being so near the house where his brotherinlaw and wife were living as i pointed out that the truth might easily become known but pine merely said that his safety in keeping his secret lay in his daring to run the risk have you any idea that sir hubert intended to come by night to lord garvingtons house not the slightest in fact i told him that lord garvington was afraid of burglars and had threatened to shoot any man who tried to enter the house all this silver said in a perfectly frank freeandeasy manner and also related how the dead man had instructed him to ask garvington to allow the gypsies to remain in the wood the reporter published the interview with sundry comments of his own and it was read with great avidity by the public at large and by the many friends of the millionaire who were surprised to learn of the double life led by the man of course there was nothing disgraceful in pines past as ishmael hearne and all attempts to discover something shady about his antecedents were vain yetas was pointed outthere must have been something wrong else the adventurer as he plainly was would not have met so terrible a death but in spite of every ones desire to find fire to account for the smoke nothing to pines disadvantage could be learned even at the inquest and when the matter was thoroughly threshed out the dead mans character proved to be honorable andsave in the innocent concealment of his real name and originhis public and private life was all that could be desired the whole story was not criminal but truly romantic and the final tragedy gave a grim touch to what was regarded even by the most censorious as a picturesque narrative in spite of all his efforts inspector darby of wanbury could produce no evidence likely to show who had shot the deceased lord garvington under the natural impression that pine was a burglar had certainly wounded him in the right arm but it was the second shot fired by some one outside the house which had pierced the heart this was positively proved by the distinct evidence of lady agnes herself she rose from her sickbed to depose how she had opened her window and had seen the actual death of the unfortunate man whom she little guessed was her husband the burglaras she reasonably took him to bewas running down the path when she first caught sight of him and after the first shot had been fired it was the second shot which came from the shrubberymarked on the plan placed before the coroner and jurywhich had laid the fugitive low also various guests and servants stated that they had arrived in the passage in answer to lord garvingtons outcries to find that he had closed the door pending their coming some had even heard the second shot while descending the stairs it was proved therefore in a very positive manner that the master of the house had not murdered the supposed robber i never intended to kill him declared garvington when his evidence was taken all i intended to do and all i did do was to wing him so that he might be captured on the spot or traced later i closed the door after firing the shot as i fancied that he might have had some accomplices with him and i wished to make myself safe until assistance arrived you had no idea that the man was sir hubert pine asked a juryman certainly not i should not have fired had i recognized him the moment i opened the door he flung himself upon me i fired and he ran away it was not until we all went out and found him dead by the shrubbery that i recognized my brotherinlaw i thought he was in paris inspector darby deposed that he had examined the shrubbery and had noted broken twigs here and there which showed that some one must have been concealed behind the screen of laurels the grasssomewhat long in the thickethad been trampled but nothing had been discovered likely to lead to the discovery of the assassin who had been ambushed in this manner are there no footmarks questioned the coroner there has been no rain for weeks to soften the ground explained the witness therefore it is impossible to discover any footmarks the broken twigs and trampled grass show that some one was hidden in the shrubbery but when this person left the screen of laurels there is nothing to show in which direction the escape was made and indeed all the evidence was useless to trace the criminal the manor had been bolted and barred by lord garvington himself along with some footmen and his butler so no one within could have fired the second shot the evidence of mother cockleshell of chaldea and of various other gypsies went to show that no one had left the camp on that night with the exception of hearne and even his absence had not been made known until the fact of the death was made public next morning hearne as several of the gypsies stated had retired about eleven to his tent and had said nothing about going to the manor much less about leaving the camp silvers statements revealed nothing since far from seeking his brotherinlaws house pine had pointedly declared that in order to keep his secret he would be careful not to go near the place and pine had no enemies to my knowledge who desired his death declared the secretary we were so intimate that had his life been in danger he certainly would have spoken about it to me you can throw no light on the darkness asked the coroner hopelessly none said the witness nor so far as i can see is any one else able to throw any light on the subject pines secret was not a dishonorable one as he was such an upright man that no one could have desired to kill him apparently there was no solution to the mystery as every one concluded when the evidence was fully threshed out an open verdict was brought in and the proceedings ended in this unsatisfactory manner wilful murder against some person or persons unknown said lambert when he read the report of the inquest in his st jamess street rooms strange i wonder who cut the gordian knot of the rope which bound agnes to pine he could find no reply to this question nor could any one else chapter x a difficult position lord garvington was not a creditable member of the aristocracy since his vices greatly exceeded his virtues with a weak nature and the tastes of a sybarite he required a great deal of money to render him happy like the immortal becky sharp he could have been fairly honest if possessed of a large income but not having it he stopped short of nothing save actual criminality in order to indulge his luxurious tastes to the full candidly speaking he had already overstepped the mark when he altered the figures of a check his brotherinlaw had given him and had not pine been so generous he would have undoubtedly occupied an extremely unpleasant position however thanks to agnes the affair had been hushed up and with characteristic promptitude garvington had conveniently forgotten how nearly he had escaped the iron grip of justice in fact so entirely did it slip his memory thaton the plea of pines newly discovered originhe did not desire the body to be placed in the family vault but the widow wished to pay this honor to her husbands remains and finally got her own way in the matter for the simple reason that now she was the owner of pines millions garvington did not wish to offend her but as such a mean creature would he made capital out of the concession since i do this for you agnes he said bluntly when the question was being decided you must do something for me what do you wish me to do ahhumheyho gurgled garvington thinking cunningly that it was too early yet to exploit her we can talk about it when the will has been read and we know exactly how we stand besides your grief is sacred to me my dear shut yourself up and cry agnes had a sense of humor and the blatant hypocrisy of the speech made her laugh outright in spite of the genuine regret she felt for her husbands tragic death garvington was quite shocked do you forget that the body is yet in the house he asked with heavy solemnity i dont forget anything retorted agnes becoming scornfully serious not even that you count on me to settle your wretched financial difficulties out of poor huberts money of course you will my dear you are a lambert undoubtedly but i am not necessarily a fool oh i cant stop and hear you call yourself such a name said garvington ostentatiously dense to her true meaning it is hysteria that speaks and not my dear sister very natural when you are so grieved we are all mortal you are certainly silly in addition replied the widow who knew how useless it was to argue with the man go away and dont worry me when poor hubert is buried and the will is read i shall announce my intentions intentions intentions muttered the corpulent little lord taking a hasty departure out of diplomacy surely agnes wont be such a fool as to let the family estates go it never struck him that pine might have so worded the will that the inheritance he counted upon might not come to the widow unless she chose to fulfil a certain condition but then he never guessed the jealousy with which the hotblooded gypsy had regarded the early engagement of agnes and lambert if he had done so he assuredly would not have invited the young man down to the funeral but he did so and talked about doing so with a frequent mention that the body was to rest in the sacred vault of the lamberts so that every one should applaud his generous humility poor pine was only a gypsy said garvington on all and every occasion but i esteemed him as a good and honest man he shall have every honor shown to his memory noel and i as representatives of his wife my dear sister shall follow him to the lambert vault and there with my ancestors the body of this honorable though humble man shall rest until the day of judgment a cynic in london laughed when the speech was reported to him if garvington is buried in the same vault he said contemptuously he will ask pine for money as soon as they rise to attend the great assizes which bitter remark showed that the little man could not induce people to believe him so disinterested as he should have liked them to consider him however in pursuance of this artful policy he certainly gave the dead man what the landlady of the village inn called a dressy funeral all that could be done in the way of pomp and ceremony was done and the procession which followed ishmael hearne to the grave was an extraordinarily long one the villagers came because like all the lower orders they loved the excitement of an interment the gypsies from the camp followed since the deceased was of their blood and many people in financial and social circles came down from london for the obvious reason that pine was a wellknown figure in the city and the west end and also a member of parliament as for lambert he put in an appearance in response to his cousins invitation unwillingly enough but in order to convince agnes that he had every desire to obey her commands people could scarcely think that pine had been jealous of the early engagement to agnes when her former lover attended the funeral of a successful rival of course the house party at the manor had broken up immediately after the inquest it would have disintegrated before only that inspector darby insisted that every one should remain for examination in connection with the late tragical occurrence but in spite of questioning and crossquestioning nothing had been learned likely to show who had murdered the millionaire there was a great deal of talk after the body had been placed in the lambert vault and there was more talk in the newspapers when an account was given of the funeral but neither by word of mouth nor in print was any suggestion made likely to afford the slightest clue to the name or the whereabouts of the assassin having regard to pines romantic career it was thought by some that the act was one of revenge by a gypsy jealous that the man should attain to such affluence while others hinted that the motive for the crime was to be found in connection with the millionaires career as a gentile gradually as all conjecture proved futile the gossip died away and other events usurped the interest of the public pine who was really hearne had been murdered and buried his assassin would never be discovered since the trail was too well hidden and lady agnes inherited at least two millions on which she would probably marry her cousin and so restore the tarnished splendors of the lambert family in this way the situation was summed up by the gossips and then they began to talk of something else the tragedy was only a nine minutes wonder after all the gossips both in town and country were certainly right in assuming that the widow inherited the vast property of her deceased husband but what they did not know was that a condition attached to such inheritance irritated agnes and caused garvington unfeigned alarm pines solicitorhe was called jarwin and came from a stuffy little office in chancery lanecalled garvington aside when the mourners returned from the funeral and asked that the reading of the will might be confined to a few people whom he named there is a condition laid down by the testator which need not be made public said mr jarwin blandly a proposition which if possible must be kept out of print garvington with a sudden recollection of his iniquity in connection with the falsified check did not dare to ask questions but hastily summoned the people named by the lawyer as these were the widow lady garvington himself and his cousin noel the little man had no fear of what might be forthcoming since with relatives there could be no risk of betrayal all the same he waited for the reading of the will with some perturbation for the suggested secrecy hinted at some posthumous revenge on the part of the dead man and hardened as he was garvington did not wish his wife and lambert to become acquainted with his delinquency he was of course unaware that the latter knew about it through agnes and knew also how it had been used to coerce herfor the pressure amounted to coercioninto a loveless marriage the quintette assembled in a small room near the library and when the door and window were closed there was no chance that any one would overhear the conference lambert was rather puzzled to know why he had been requested to be present as he had no idea that pine would mention him in the will however he had not long to wait before he learned the reason for the document produced by mr jarwin was singularly short and concise pine had never been a great speaker and carried his reticence into his testamentary disposition five minutes was sufficient for the reading of the will and those present learned that all real and personal property had been left unreservedly to agnes pine the widow of the testator on condition that she did not marry noel tamsworth leighton lambert if she did so the money was to pass to a certain person whose name was mentioned in a sealed envelope held by mr jarwin this was only to be opened when agnes pine formally relinquished her claim to the estate by marrying noel lambert seeing that the will disposed of two millions sterling it was a remarkably abrupt document and the reading of it took the hearers breath away garvington relieved from the fears of his guilty conscience was the first to recover his power of speech he looked at the lean dry lawyer and demanded fiercely if no legacy had been left to him surely pine did not forget me he lamented with more temper than sorrow you have heard the will said mr jarwin folding up the single sheet of legal paper on which the testament was inscribed there are no legacies none at all hasnt pine remembered silver he has remembered nothing and no one save lady agnes jarwin bowed to the silent widow who could not trust herself to speak so angered was she by the cruel way in which her husband had shown his jealousy its all very dreadful and very disagreeable said lady garvington in her weak and inconsequent way im sure i was always nice to hubert and he might have left me a few shillings to get clothes everything goes in cooks and food and hold your tongue jane struck in her husband crossly youre always thinking of frocks and frills but i agree with you this will is dreadful i am not going to sit under such a beastly sell you know he added turning to jarwin i shall contest the will the lawyer coughed dryly and smiled as you are not mentioned in the testament lord garvington i fail to see what you can do hum hum hum garvington was rather disconcerted but agnes can fight it why should i questioned the widow who was very pale and very quiet why should you blustered her brother it prevents your marrying again pardon me it does not corrected mr jarwin with another dry cough lady agnes can marry any one she chooses to save his eyes rested on the calm and watchful face of lambert the young man colored and glancing at agnes was about to speak but on second thoughts he checked himself as he did not wish to add to the embarrassment of the scene it was the widow who replied did sir hubert tell you why he made such a provision she asked striving to preserve her calmness which was difficult under the circumstances why no said jarwin nursing his chin reflectively sir hubert was always of a reticent disposition he simply instructed me to draw up the will you have heard and gave me no explanation everything is in order and i am at your service madam whenever you choose to send for me but suppose i marry mr lambert agnes you wont be such a fool shouted her brother growing so scarlet that he seemed to be on the point of an apoplectic fit she turned on him with a look which reduced him to silence but carefully avoided the eyes of the cousin suppose i marry mr lambert she asked again in that case you will lose the money replied jarwin slightly weary of so obvious an answer having to be made you have heard the will who gets the money then this was another ridiculous question as jarwin and not without reason considered would you like me to read the will again he asked sarcastically no i am aware of what it contains in that case you must know madam that the money goes to a certain person whose name is mentioned in a sealed envelope now in my office safe who is the person demanded garvington with a gleam of hope that pine might have made him the legatee i do not know my lord sir hubert pine wrote down the name and address sealed the envelope and gave it into my charge it can only be opened when the ceremony of marriage takes place between he bowed again to lady agnes and this time also to lambert pine must have been insane said garvington fuming he disguises himself as a gypsy and comes to burgle my house and makes a silly will which ought to be upset sir hubert never struck me as insane retorted jarwin putting the disputed will into his black leather bag a man who can make two million pounds in so short a space of time can scarcely be called crazy but this masquerading as a gypsy and a burglar urged garvington irritably he was actually a gypsy remember my lord and it was natural that he should wish occasionally to get back to the life he loved as to his being a burglar i venture to disagree with you he had some reason to visit this house at the hour and in the manner he did and doubtless if he had lived he would have explained but whatever might have been his motive lord garvington i am certain it was not connected with robbery well snapped the fat little man candidly if i had known that pine was such a blighter as to leave me nothing im hanged if id have allowed him to be buried in such decent company freddy freddy the poor man is dead let him rest said lady garvington who looked more limp and untidy than ever i wish he was resting somewhere else than in my vault a damned gypsy and my husband said lady agnes sharply dont forget that garvington i wish i could forget it much use he has been to us you have no cause to complain said his sister with a meaning glance and garvington suddenly subsided wont you say something noel asked lady garvington dismally i dont see what there is to say he rejoined not lifting his eyes from the ground there you are wrong remarked agnes with a sudden flush there is a very great deal to say but this is not the place to say it mr jarwin she rose to her feet looking a queenly figure in her long black robes you can return to town and later will receive my instructions the lawyer looked hard at her marble face wondering whether she would choose the lover or the money it was a hard choice and a very difficult position he could not read in her eyes what she intended to do so mutely bowed and took a ceremonious departure paying a silent tribute to the widows strength of mind poor thing poor thing thought the solicitor i believe she loves her cousin it is hard that she can only marry him at the cost of becoming a pauper a difficult position for her indeed hm shell hold on to the money of course no woman would be such a fool as to pay two millions sterling for a husband in relation to nine women out of ten this view would have been a reasonable one to take but agnes happened to be the tenth who had the singular tastemadness some would have called itto prefer love to hard cash still she made no hasty decision seeing that the issues involved in her renunciation were so great garvington showing a characteristic want of tact began to argue the question almost the moment jarwin drove away from the manor but his sister promptly declined to enter into any discussion you and jane can go away said she cutting him short i wish to have a private conversation with noel for heavens sake dont give up the money whispered garvington in an agonized tone when at the door i sold myself once to help the family she replied in the same low voice but i am not so sure that i am ready to do so twice quite right dear said lady garvington patting the widows hand it is better to have love than money besides it only means that freddy will have to give up eating rich dinners which dont agree with him come away you fool cried freddy exasperated and seizing her arm he drew her out of the room growling like a sick bear agnes closed the door and returned to look at lambert who still continued to stare at the carpet with folded arms well she demanded sharply well he replied in the same tone and without raising his eyes is that all you have to say noel i dont see what else i can say pine evidently guessed that we loved one another although heaven knows that our affection has been innocent enough and has taken this way to part us forever will it part us forever i think so as an honorable man and one who loves you dearly i cant expect you to give up two millions for the sake of love in a cottage with me it is asking too much not when a woman loves a man as i love you this time lambert did look up and his eyes flashed with surprise and delight agnes you dont mean to say that you would she cut him short by sitting down beside him and taking his hand i would rather live on a crust with you in the abbots wood cottage than in park lane a lonely woman with ample wealth you neednt remain lonely long said lambert moodily pines will does not forbid you to marry any one else do i deserve that answer noel after what i have just said no dear no he pressed her hand warmly but you must make some allowance for my feelings it is right that a man should sacrifice all for a woman but that a woman should give up everything for a man seems wrong many women do if they love truly as i do but agnes think what people will say about me that will be your share of the sacrifice she replied promptly if i do this you must do that there is no difficulty when the matter is looked on in that light but there is a graver question to be answered lambert looked at her in a questioning manner and read the answer in her eyes you mean about the property of the family yes agnes heaved a sigh and shook her head i wish i had been born a village girl rather than the daughter of a great house rank has its obligations noel i recognized that before and therefore married hubert he was a good kind man and save that i lost you i had no reason to regret becoming his wife but i did not think that he would have put such an insult on me insult dear lambert flushed hotly what else can you call this forbidding me to marry you the will is certain to be filed at somerset house and the contents will be made known to the public in the usual way through the newspapers then what will people say noel why that i became huberts wife in order to get his money since knowing that he was consumptive i hoped he would soon die and that as a rich widow i could console myself with you they will chuckle to see how my scheme has been overturned by the will but you made no such scheme of course not still everyone will credit me with having done so as a woman who has been insulted and by a man who has no reason to mistrust me i feel inclined to renounce the money and marry you if only to show how i despise the millions but as a lambert i must think again of the family as i thought before the only question is whether it is wise to place duty above love for the second time considering the misery we have endured and the small thanks we have received for our selfdenial surely garvingtons estates are free by now no they are not hubert as i told you when we spoke in the cottage paid off many mortgages but retained possession of them he did not charge garvington any interest and let him have the income of the mortgaged land no one could have behaved better than hubert did until my brothers demands became so outrageous that it was impossible to go on lending and giving him money hubert did not trust him so far as to give back the mortgages so these will form a portion of his estate as that belongs to me i can settle everything with ease and place garvington in an entirely satisfactory condition but i do that at the cost of losing you dear should the estates pass to this unknown person the mortgages would be foreclosed and our family would be ruined are things as bad as that every bit as bad hubert told me plainly how matters stood for generations the heads of the family have been squandering money freddy is just as bad as the rest and moreover has no head for figures he does not know the value of money never having been in want of it but if everything was sold upand it must be if i marry you and lose the millionshe will be left without an acre of land and only three hundred a year oh the devil lambert jumped up and began to walk up and down the room with a startled air that would finish the lambert family with a vengeance agnes what do you wish me to do he asked after a pause wait she said quietly wait for whatthe deluge it wont come while i hold the money i have a good business head and hubert taught me how to deal with financial matters i could not give him love but i did give him every attention and i believe that i was able to help him in some ways i shall utilize my experience to see the family lawyer and go into matters thoroughly then we shall know for certain if things are as bad as hubert made out if they are i must sacrifice you and myself for the sake of our name if they are not well asked lambert seeing how she hesitated agnes crossed the room and placed her arms round his neck with a lovely color tinting her wan cheeks dear she whispered i shall marry you in doing so i am not disloyal to huberts memory since i have always loved you and he accepted me as his wife on the understanding that i could not give him my heart and now that he has insulted me she drew back and her eyes flashed i feel free to become your wife i see lambert nodded we must wait we must wait duty comes before love but i trust that the sacrifice will not be necessary goodbye dear and she kissed him goodbye repeated lambert returning the kiss then they parted chapter xi blackmail having come to the only possible arrangement consistent with the difficult position in which they stood lambert and lady agnes took their almost immediate departure from the manor the young man had merely come to stay there in response to his cousins request so that his avoidance of her should not be too marked and the suspicions of pine excited now that the man was dead there was no need to behave in this judicious way and having no great love for garvington whom he thoroughly despised lambert returned to his forest cottage there he busied himself once more with his art and waited patiently to see what the final decision of agnes would be he did not expect to hear for some weeks or even months as the affairs of garvington being very much involved could not be understood in a moment but the lovers parted by a strict sense of duty eased their minds by writing weekly letters to one another needless to say garvington did not at all approve of the decision of his sister which she duly communicated to him he disliked lambert both as the next heir to the estates and because he was a more popular man than himself even had pine not prohibited the marriage in his will garvington would have objected to agnes becoming the young mans wife as it was he stormed tempests but without changing the widows determination being a remarkably selfish creature all he desired was that agnes should live a solitary life as a kind of banker to supply him with money whenever he chose to ask for the same pine he had not been able to manage but he felt quite sure that he could bully his sister into doing what he wanted it both enraged and surprised him to find that she had a will of her own and was not content to obey his egotistical orders agnes would not even remain under his roofas he wanted her to lest some other person should get hold of her and the desirable millionsbut returned to her london house the only comfort he had was that lambert was not with her and thereforeas he devoutly hopedshe would meet some man who would cause her to forget the abbots wood recluse so long as agnes retained the money garvington did not particularly object to her marrying as he always hoped to cajole and bully ready cash out of her but he would have preferred had she remained single as then she could be more easily plundered and yet i dont know he said to his longsuffering wife while shes a widow theres always the chance that she may take the bit between her teeth and marry noel in which case she loses everything it will be as well to get her married you will have no selection of the husband this time said lady garvington whose sympathies were entirely for agnes she will choose for herself let her retorted garvington with feigned generosity so long as she does not choose noel hang him hes the very man she will choose replied his wife and garvington uneasily conscious that she was probably right cursed freely all women in general and his sister in particular meanwhile he went to paris to look after a famous chef of whom he had heard great things and left his wife in london with strict injunctions to keep a watch on agnes the widow was speedily made aware of these instructions for when lady garvington came to stay with her sisterinlaw at the sumptuous mayfair mansion she told her hostess about the conversation more than that she even pressed her to marry noel and be happy money doesnt do so much after all when you come to think of it lamented lady garvington and i know youd be happier with noel than living here with all this horrid wealth what would freddy say if he heard you talk so jane i dont know what else he can say rejoined the other reflectively hes never kept his temper or held his tongue with me his liver is nearly always out of order with overeating however she added cheering up he is sure to die of apoplexy before long and then i shall live on tea and buns for the rest of my life i simply hate the sight of a dinner table freddy isnt a pretty sight during a meal admitted his sister with a shrug all the same you shouldnt wish him dead jane you might have a worse husband id rather have a profligate than a glutton agnes but freddy wont die my dear hell go to wiesbaden or vichy or schwalbach and take the waters to get thin then hell return to eat himself to the size of a prize pig again but thank goodness said lady garvington cheering up once more hes away for a few weeks and we can enjoy ourselves but do let us have plain joints and no sauces agnes oh you can live on bread and water if you choose said the widow goodhumoredly its a pity i am in mourning as i cant take you out much but the motor is always at your disposal and i can give you all the money you want get a few dresses and hats and boots and shoes andandoh i dont know what else youre a dear agnes and although i dont want to ruin you i do want heaps of things im in rags as freddy eats up our entire income you cant ruin a woman with two millions jane get what you require and ill pay i am only too glad to give you some pleasure since i cant attend to you as i ought to but you see nearly three times a week i have to consult the lawyers about settling freddys affairs on these conditions four or five weeks passed away very happily for the two women lady garvington certainly had the time of her life and regained a portion of her lost youth she revelled in shopping went in a quiet way to theatres patronized skating rinks and even attended one or two small winter dances and to her joy she met with a nice young man who was earnestly in pursuit of a new religion which involved much fasting and occasional vegetarian meals he taught her to eat nuts and eschew meats talking meanwhile of the psychic powers which such abstemiousness would develop in her of course lady garvington did not overdo this asceticism but she was thankful to meet a man who had not read beetons cookery book besides he flirted quite nicely agnes pleased to see her sisterinlaw enjoying life gave her attention to garvingtons affairs and found them in a woeful mess it really did appear as if she would have to save the lambert family from everlasting disgrace and from being entirely submerged by keeping hold of her millions but she did not lose heart and worked on bravely in the hope that an adjustment would save a few thousand a year for freddy without touching any of pines money if she could manage to secure him a sufficient income to keep up the title and to prevent the sale of the manor in hengishire she then intended to surrender her husbands wealth and retire to a country life with noel as her husband he can paint and i can look after the cottage along with mrs tribb she told mrs belgrove who called to see her one day more painted and dyed and padded and tastefully dressed than ever we can keep fowls and things you know she added vaguely quite an idyl tittered the visitor and then went away to tell her friends that lady agnes must have been in love with her cousin all the time and as the contents of the will were now generally known every one agreed that the woman was a fool to give up wealth for a dull existence in the woods all the same its very sweet sighed mrs belgrove having made as much mischief as she possibly could i should like it myself if i could only dress as a watteau shepherdess you know and carry a lamb with a blue ribbon round its dear neck of course lady agnes heard nothing of this illnatured chatter since she did not go into society during her period of mourning and received only a few of her most intimate friends moreover besides attending to garvingtons affairs it was necessary that she should have frequent consultations with mr jarwin in his stuffy chancery lane office relative to the large fortune left by her late husband there on three occasions she met silver the exsecretary when he came to explain various matters to the solicitor with the consent of lady agnes the man had been discharged when jarvin took over the management of the millions but having a thorough knowledge of pines financial dealings it was necessary that he should be questioned every now and then silver was rather sulky over his abrupt dismissal but cunningly concealed his real feelings when in the presence of the widow since she was too opulent a person to offend it was silver who suggested that a reward should be offered for the detection of pines assassin lady agnes approved of the idea and indeed was somewhat shocked that she had not thought of taking this course herself therefore within seven days every police office in the united kingdom was placarded with bills stating that the sum of one thousand pounds would be given to the person or persons who should denounce the culprit the amount offered caused quite a flutter of excitement and public interest in the case was revived for nearly a fortnight at the conclusion of that period as nothing fresh was discovered people ceased to discuss the matter it seemed as though the reward large as it was would never be claimed but having regard to the fact that silver was interesting himself in the endeavor to avenge his patrons death lady agnes was not at all surprised to receive a visit from him one foggy november afternoon she certainly did not care much for the little man but feeling dull and somewhat lonely she quite welcomed his visit lady garvington had gone with her ascetic admirer to a lecture on souls and sorrows therefore agnes had a spare hour for the exsecretary he was shown into her own particular private sittingroom and she welcomed him with studied politeness for try as she might it was impossible for her to overcome her mistrust goodday mr silver she said when he bowed before her this is an unexpected visit wont you be seated silver accepted her offer of a chair with an air of demure shyness and sitting on its edge stared at her rather hard he looked neat and dapper in his bond street kit and for a man who had started life as a whitechapel toymaker his manners were inoffensive while pines secretary he had contrived to pick up hints in the way of social behavior and undoubtedly he was clever since he so readily adapted himself to his surroundings he was not a gentleman but he looked like a gentleman and therein lay a subtle difference as lady agnes decided she unconsciously in her manner affable as it was suggested the gulf between them and silver quickly contacting the atmosphere did not love her any the more for the hint nevertheless he admired her statuesque beauty the fairness of which was accentuated by her sombre dress blinking like a wellfed cat silver stared at his hostess and she looked questioningly at him with his foxy face his reddish hair and suave manners too careful to be natural he more than ever impressed her with the idea that he was a dangerous man yet she could not see in what way he could reveal his malignant disposition what do you wish to see me about mr silver she asked kindly but did notas he swiftly noticedoffer him a cup of tea although it was close upon five oclock i have come to place my services at your disposal he said in a low voice really i am not aware that i need them replied lady agnes coldly and not at all anxious to accept the offer i think said silver dryly and clearing his throat that when you hear what i have to say you will be glad that i have come indeed will you be good enough to speak plainer she colored hotly when she asked the question as it struck her suddenly that perhaps this plotter knew of garvingtons slip regarding the check but as that had been burnt by pine at the time of her marriage she reflected that even if silver knew about it he could do nothing unless and it was this thought that made her turn red garvington had again risked contact with the criminal courts the idea was not a pleasant one but being a brave woman she faced the possibility boldly well she asked calmly as he did not reply immediately what have you to say its about pines death said silver bluntly sir hubert if you please and why lady agnes silver raised his faint eyebrows we were more like brothers than master and servant and remember that it was by the penny toys that i invented your husband first made money in talking to me i prefer that you should call my late husband sir hubert insisted the widow haughtily what have you discovered relative to his death silver did not answer the question directly sir hubert since you will have it so lady agnes was a gypsy he remarked carelessly that was made plain at the inquest mr silver quite so lady agnes but there were other things not made plain on that occasion it was not discovered who shot him you tell me nothing new i presume you have come to explain that you have discovered a clew to the truth silver raised his pale face steadily would you be glad if i had certainly can you doubt it the man shirked a reply to this question also sir hubert did not treat me over well he observed irrelevantly i fear that has nothing to do with me mr silver and i was dimissed from my post he went on imperturbably on mr jarwins advice she informed him quickly there was no need for you to be retained but i believe that you were given a years salary in lieu of notice that is so he admitted i am obliged to you and to mr jarwin for the money although it is not a very large sum considering what i did for sir hubert and how he built up his fortune out of my brains i think that i have been treated shabbily lady agnes rose and moved towards the fireplace to touch the ivory button of the electric bell on that point i refer you to mr jarwin she said coldly this interview has lasted long enough and can lead to nothing it may lead to something unpleasant unless you listen to me said silver acidly i advise you not to have me turned out lady agnes what do you mean she dropped the hand she had extended to ring the bell and faced the smoothfaced creature suddenly i dont know what you are talking about if you will sit down lady agnes i can explain i can receive your explanation standing said the widow frowning be brief please very well to put the matter in a nutshell i want five thousand pounds five thousand pounds she echoed aghast on account said silver blandly on account lady agnes and for what reason sir hubert was a gypsy he said again and with a significant look well he stopped at the camp near abbots wood well there is a gypsy girl there called chaldea chaldea chaldea muttered the widow passing her hand across her brow i have heard that name oh yes miss greeby mentioned it to me as the name of a girl who was sitting as mr lamberts model yes assented silver grinning she is a very beautiful girl the color rushed again to the womans cheeks but she controlled her emotions with an effort so miss greeby told me she knew that the man was hinting that lambert admired the girl in question but her pride prevented her admitting the knowledge chaldea is being painted as esmeralda to the quasimodo of her lover a servian gypsy called kara as i have been informed mr silver but what has all this to do with me dont be in a hurry lady agnes it will take time to explain how dare you take this tone with me demanded the widow clenching her hands leave the room sir or i shall have you turned out oh i shall leave since you wish it replied silver rising slowly and smoothing his silk hat with his sleeve but of course i shall try and earn the reward you offered by taking the letter to the police agnes was so surprised that she closed again the door she had opened for her visitors exit what letter that one which was written to inveigle sir hubert to the manor on the night he was murdered replied silver slowly and suddenly raising his eyes he looked at her straightly i dont understand she said in a puzzled way i have never heard that such a letter was in existence where is it chaldea has it and will not give it up unless she receives five thousand pounds answered the man glibly give it to me and it passes into your possession lady agnes give you what five thousand poundson account on account of blackmail how dare you make such a proposition to me you know said silver pointedly i know nothing it is the first time i have heard of any letter who wrote it may i ask you know said silver again lady agnes was so insulted by his triumphant look that she could have struck his grinning face however she had too strong a nature to lower herself in this way and pointed to a chair let me ask you a few questions mr silver she said imperiously oh i am quite ready to answer whatever you choose to ask he retorted taking his seat again and secretly surprised at her selfcontrol you say that chaldea holds a letter which inveigled my husband to his death demanded lady agnes coolly yes and she wants five thousand pounds for it why doesnt she give it to the police one thousand pounds is not enough for the letter it is worth moreto some people and silver raised his pale eyes again to me i presume you mean then when he bowed she continued her examination the five thousand pounds you intimate is on account yet you say that chaldea will deliver the letter for that sum to me rejoined the exsecretary impudently and when it is in my possession i can give it to you for twenty thousand pounds lady agnes laughed in his face i am too good a business woman to make such a bargain she said with a shrug well you know best replied silver imitating her shrug i know nothing i am quite in the dark as to the reason for your blackmailing mr silver that is a nasty word lady agnes it is the only word which seems to suit the situation why should i give twentyfive thousand pounds for this letter its production will place the police on the track of the assassin and is not that what i desire why did i offer a reward of one thousand pounds if i did not hope that the wretch who murdered my husband should be brought to justice silver exhibited unfeigned surprise you wish that certainly i do where was this letter discovered chaldea went to the tent of your husband in the camp and found it in the pocket of his coat he apparently left it behind by mistake when he went to watch watch yes the letter stated that you intended to elope that night with mr lambert and would leave the house by the blue door sir hubert went to watch and prevent the elopement in that way he came by his death since lord garvington threatened to shoot a possible burglar of course sir hubert when the blue door was opened by lord garvington who had heard the footsteps of the supposed burglar threw himself forward thinking you were coming out to meet mr lambert sir hubert was first shot in the arm by lord garvington who really believed for the moment that he had to do with a robber but the second shot ended silver with emphasis was fired by a person concealed in the shrubbery who knew that sir hubert would walk into the trap laid by the letter during this amazing recital lady agnes with her eyes on the mans face and her hands clasped in sheer surprise had sat down on a near couch she could scarcely believe her ears is this true she asked in a faltering voice silver shrugged his shoulders again the letter held by chaldea certainly set the snare in which sir hubert was caught unless the person in the shrubbery knew about the letter the person would scarcely have been concealed there with a revolver i know about the letter for certain since chaldea showed it to me when i went to ask questions about the murder in the hope of gaining the reward the rest of my story is theoretical who was the person who fired the shot asked lady agnes abruptly i dont know who wrote the letter which set the snare silver shuffled chaldea loves mr lambert he said hesitating go on ordered the widow coldly and retaining her selfcontrol she is jealous of you lady agnes because there is no reason to explain interrupted the listener between her teeth well then chaldea hating you says that you wrote the letter oh indeed lady agnes replied calmly enough although her conflicting emotions almost suffocated her then i take it that this gypsy declares me to be a murderess oh i shouldnt say that exactly i do say it cried lady agnes rising fiercely if i wrote the letter and set the snare i must necessarily know that some one was hiding in the shrubbery to shoot my husband it is an abominable lie from start to finish i am glad to hear you say so but the letter the police will deal with that the police you will let chaldea give the letter to the police i am innocent and have no fear of the police your attempt to blackmail me has failed mr silver be wise and take time for reflection he urged walking towards the door for i have seen this letter and it is in your handwriting i never wrote such a letter then who didin your handwriting perhaps you did yourself mr silver since you are trying to blackmail me in this bareface way silver snarled and gave her an ugly look i did no such thing he retorted vehemently and as it seemed honestly enough i had every reason to wish that sir hubert should live since my income and my position depended upon his existence but you what about me demanded lady agnes taking so sudden a step forward that the little man retreated nearer the door people say i know what people say and what you are about to repeat she said in a stifled voice you can tell the girl to take that forged letter to the police i am quite able to face any inquiry is mr lambert also able mr lambert agnes felt as though she would choke he was at his cottage on that night i deny that he went to london chaldea can prove that he was at his cottage and you had better go said lady agnes turning white and looking dangerous go before you say what you may be sorry for i shall tell mr lambert the story you have told me and let him deal with the matter silver threw off the mask as he was enraged she should so boldly withstand his demands i give you one week he said harshly and if you do not pay me twentyfive thousand pounds that letter goes to the inspector at wanbury it can go now she declared dauntlessly in that case you and mr lambert will be arrested at once agnes gripped the mans arm as he was about to step through the door i take your week of grace she said with a sudden impulse of wisdom i thought you would retorted silver insultingly but remember i must get the money at the end of seven days its twentyfive thousand pounds for me or disgrace to you and with an abrupt nod he disappeared sneering twentyfive thousand pounds or disgrace whispered agnes to herself chapter xii the conspiracy it was lucky that lambert did not know of the ordeal to which agnes had to submit unaided since he was having a most unhappy time himself in a sketching expedition he had caught a chill which had developed once more a malarial fever contracted in the congo marshes some years previously whenever his constitution weakened this ague fit would reappear and for days sometimes weeks he would shiver with cold and alternately burn with fever as the autumn mists were hanging round the leafless abbots wood it was injudicious of him to sit in the open however warmly clothed seeing that he was predisposed to disease but his desire for the society of the woman he loved and the hopelessness of the outlook rendered him reckless and he was more often out of doors than in the result was that when agnes came down to relate the interview with silver she found him in his sittingroom swathed in blankets and reclining in an armchair placed as closely to a large wood fire as was possible he was very ill indeed poor man and she uttered an exclamation when she saw his wan cheeks and hollow eyes lambert was now as weak as he had been strong and with the mothering instinct of a woman she rushed forward to kneel beside his chair my dear my dear why did you not send for me she wailed keeping back her tears with an effort oh im all right agnes he answered cheerfully and fondly clasping her hand mrs tribb is nursing me capitally im doing my best said the rosyfaced little housekeeper who stood at the door with her podgy hands primly folded over her apron plenty of bed and food is what i give master noel but bless you my lady he wont stay between the blankets being always a worrit from a boy it seems to me that i am very much between the blankets now murmured lambert in a tired voice and with a glance at his swathed limbs go away mrs tribb and get lady agnes something to eat i only want a cup of tea said agnes looking anxiously into her lovers bluishtinted face im not hungry mrs tribb took a long look at the visitor and pursed up her lips as she shook her head hungry you maynt be my lady but food you must have and that of the most nourishing and delicate you look almost as much a corpse as master noel there yes agnes you do seem to be ill said lambert with a startled glance at her deadly white face and at the dark circles under her eyes what is the matter dear nothing nothing dont worry mrs tribb still continued to shake her head and to vary the movement nodded like a chinese mandarin you aint looked after proper my lady for all your fine london servants who aint to be trusted nohow having neither hands to do nor hearts to feel for them as wants comforts and attentions i remember you my lady a blooming young rose of a gal and now sheets aint nothing to your complexion but rose you shall be again my lady if wine and food can do what theyre meant to do tea you shant have nohow but a glass or two of burgundy and a plate of pattyfoograss sandwiches and later a bowl of strong beef tea with port wine to strengthen the same and mrs tribb with a determined look on her face went away to prepare these delicacies my dear my dear murmured agnes again when the door closed you should have sent for me nonsense answered lambert smoothing her hair im not a child to cry out at the least scratch its only an attack of my old malarial fever and i shall be all right in a few days not a few of these days said agnes looking out of the window at the gaunt dripping trees and gray sky and melancholy monoliths you ought to come to london and see the doctor had i come i should have had to pay you a visit and i thought that you did not wish me to until things were adjusted agnes drew back and kneeling before the fire spread out her hands to the blaze will they ever be adjusted she asked herself despairingly but did not say so aloud as she was unwilling to worry the sick man well i only came down to the manor for a few days she said aloud and in a most cheerful manner jane wants to get the house in order for garvington who returns from paris in a week agnes agnes lambert shook his head you are not telling me the truth i know you too well my dear i really am staying with jane at the manor she persisted oh i believe that but you are in trouble and came down to consult me yes she admitted faintly i am in great trouble but i dont wish to worry you while you are in this state you will worry me a great deal more by keeping silence said lambert sitting up in his chair and drawing the blankets more closely round him do not trouble about me im all right but you he looked at her keenly and with a dismayed expression the trouble must be very great he remarked it may become so noel it has to do withoh here is mrs tribb and she broke off hurriedly as the housekeeper appeared with a tray now my lady just you sit in that armchair opposite to master noel and ill put the tray on this small stool beside you sandwiches and burgundy wine my lady and see that you eat and drink all you can walking over on this dripping day cried mrs tribb bustling about giving yourself your death of cold and you with carriages and horses and them spitting cats of motive things youre as bad as master noel my lady as for him god bless him evermore hes mrs tribb raised her hands to show that words failed her and once more vanished through the door to get ready the beef tea agnes did not want to eat but lambert who quite agreed with the kindhearted practical housekeeper insisted that she should do so to please him she took two sandwiches and a glass of the strong red wine which brought color back to her cheeks in some degree when she finished and had drawn her chair closer to the blaze he smiled we are just like darby and joan said lambert who looked much better for her presence i am so glad you are here agnes you are the very best medicine i can have to make me well the idea of comparing me to anything so nasty as medicine laughed agnes with an attempt at gayety but indeed noel i wish my visit was a pleasant one but it is not whatever you may say i am in great trouble from whatwith whatin what stuttered lambert so confusedly and anxiously that she hesitated to tell him are you well enough to hear of course i am he answered fretfully for the suspense began to tell on his nerves i would rather know the worst and face the worst than be left to worry over these hints has the trouble to do with the murder yes and with mr silver pines secretary i thought you had got rid of him oh yes mr jarwin said that he was not needed so i paid him a years wages instead of giving him notice and let him go but i have met him once or twice at the lawyers as he has been telling mr jarwin about poor huberts investments and yesterday afternoon he came to see me what about agnes came to the point at once seeing that it would be better to do so and put an end to lamberts suspense about a letter supposed to have been written by me as a means of luring hubert to the manor to be murdered lamberts sallow and pinched face grew a deep red is the man mad hes sane enough to ask twentyfive thousand pounds for the letter she said in a dry tone theres not much madness about that request twentyfive thousand pounds gasped lambert gripping the arms of his chair and attempting to rise yes dont get up noel you are too weak agnes pressed him back into the seat twenty thousand for himself and five thousand for chaldea chaldea chaldea what has she got to do with the matter she holds the letter said agnes with a sideglance and being jealous of me she intends to make me suffer unless i buy her silence and the letter otherwise according to mr silver she will show it to the police i have seven days more or less in which to make up my mind either i must be blackmailed or i must face the accusation lambert heard only one word that struck him in this speech why is chaldea jealous of you he demanded angrily i think you can best answer that question noel i certainly can and answer it honestly too who told you about chaldea mr silver for one as i have just confessed clara greeby for another she said that the girl was sitting to you for some picture esmeralda and quasimodo replied the artist quickly you will find what i have done of the picture in the next room but this confounded girl chose to fall in love with me and since then i have declined to see her i need hardly tell you agnes that i gave her no encouragement no dear i never for one moment supposed that you would all the same and in spite of my very plain speaking she continues to haunt me agnes i have avoided her on every occasion but she comes daily to see mrs tribb and ask questions about my illness then if she comes this afternoon you must get that letter from her was the reply i wish to see it silver declares that you wrote it he does chaldea showed it to him it is in your handwriting so mr silver declares lambert rubbed the bristles of his three days beard and wriggled uncomfortably in his seat i cant gather much from these hints he said with the fretful impatience of an invalid give me a detailed account of this scoundrels interview with you and report his exact words if you can remember them agnes i remember them very well a woman does not forget such insults easily damn the beast muttered lambert savagely go on dear agnes patted his hand to soothe him and forthwith related all that had passed between her and the exsecretary lambert frowned once or twice during the recital and bit his lip with anger weak as he was he longed for silver to be within kicking distance and it would have fared badly with the foxy little man had he been in the room at the moment when agnes ended her lover reflected for a few minutes its a conspiracy he declared a conspiracy noel yes chaldea hates you because the fool has chosen to fall in love with me the discovery of this letter has placed a weapon in her hand to do you an injury and for the sake of money silver is assisting her i will do chaldea the justice to say that i dont believe she asks a single penny for the letter to spite you she would go at once to the police but silver seeing that there is money in the business has prevented her doing so as to this letter he stopped and rubbed his chin again vexedly it must be a forgery without doubt but not of your handwriting i fancy in spite of what this daring blackguard says he informed you that the letter stated how you intended to elope with me on that night and would leave the manor by the blue door also on the face of it it would appear that you had written the letter to your husband since otherwise it would not have been in his possession you would not have given him such a hint had an elopement really been arranged agnes frowned there was no chance of an elopement being arranged she observed rather coldly of course not you and i know as much but i am looking at the matter from the point of view of the person who wrote the letter it cant be your forged handwriting for pine would never have believed that you would put him on the track as it were no agnes depend upon it the letter was a warning sent by some sympathetic friend and is probably an anonymous one agnes nodded meditatively you may be right noel but who wrote to hubert we must see the letter and find out but if it is my forged handwriting i dont believe it is said lambert decisively no conspirator would be so foolish as to conduct his plot in such a way however chaldea has the letter according to silver and we must make her give it up she is sure to be here soon as she always comes bothering mrs tribb in the afternoon about my health just ring that handbell agnes do you think chaldea wrote the letter she asked having obeyed him no she has not the education to forge or even to write decently perhaps mr silverbut no i taxed him with setting the trap and he declared that hubert was more benefit to him alive than dead which is perfectly true here is mrs tribb noel lambert turned his head has that gypsy been here today he asked sharply not yet master noel but theres no saying when she may come for shes always hanging round the house id tar and feather her and slap and pinch her if i had my way say what you like my lady ive no patience with gals of that freeandeasy lightheaded butterwontmeltinyourmouth kind if she comes today show her in here said lambert paying little attention to mrs tribbs somewhat german speech of mouthfilling words the housekeepers black eyes twinkled and she opened her lips then she shut them again and looking at lady agnes in a questioning way trotted out of the room it was plain that mrs tribb knew of chaldeas admiration for her master and could not understand why he wished her to enter the house when lady agnes was present she did not think it a wise thing to apply fire to gunpowder which in her opinion was what lambert was doing there ensued silence for a few moments then agnes staring into the fire remarked in a musing manner i wonder who did shoot hubert mr silver would not have done so as it was to his interest to keep him alive do you think that to hurt me noel chaldea might have no no no it was to her interest also that pine should live since she knew that i could not marry you while he was alive agnes nodded understanding him so well that she did not need to ask for a detailed explanation it could not have been any of those staying at the manor she said doubtfully since every one was indoors and in bed garvington of course only broke poor huberts arm under a misapprehension who could have been the person in the shrubbery silver hints that i am the individual said lambert grimly yes he does assented lady agnes quickly i declared that you were in london but he said that you returned on that night to this place i did worse luck i went to town thinking it best to be away while pine was in the neighborhood and you knew that hubert was a gypsy and at the camp interrupted agnes in a nervous manner for the information startled her yes chaldea told me so when she was trying to make me fall in love with her i did not tell you as i thought that you might be vexed although i dare say i should have done so later however i went to town in order to prevent trouble and only returned for that single night i went back to town next morning very early and did not hear about the murder until i saw a paragraph in the evening papers afterwards i came down to the funeral because garvington asked me to and i thought that you would like it why did you come back on that particular night my dear agnes i had no idea that hubert would be murdered on that especial night so did not choose it particularly i returned because i had left behind a parcel of your letters to me when we were engaged i fancied that chaldea might put hubert up to searching the cottage while i was away and if he had found those letters he would have been more jealous than ever as you can easily understand no i cant understand flashed out agnes sharply hubert knew that we loved one another and that i broke the engagement to save the family i told him that i could not give him the affection he desired and he was content to marry me on those terms the discovery of letters written before i became his wife would not have caused trouble since i was always loyal to him there was no need for you to return and your presence here on that night lends color to mr silvers accusation but you dont believe certainly i dont all the same it is awkward for both of us i think it was made purposely awkward agnes whosoever murdered hubert must have known of my return and laid the trap on that night so that i might be implicated but who set the trap the person who wrote that letter and who wrote the letter that is what we have to find out from chaldea at that moment as if he had summoned her the gypsy suddenly flung open the door and walked in with a sulky expression on her dark face at first she had been delighted to hear that lambert wanted to see her but when informed by mrs tribb that lady agnes was with the young man she had lost her temper however the chance of seeing lambert was too tempting to forego so she marched in defiantly ready to fight with her rival if there was an opportunity of doing so but the gentile lady declined the combat and took no more notice of the jealous gypsy than was absolutely necessary on her side chaldea ostentatiously addressed her conversation to lambert how are you rye she asked stopping with effort in the middle of the room for her impulse was to rush forward and gather him to her heaving bosom have you taken drows my precious lord what do you mean by drows chaldea poison no less you look drabbed for sure drabbed poisoned but i waste the kalo jib on you my gorgious god bless you for a sick one say i and thats a bad dukkerin the which in gentle romany means fortune my gentile swell drop talking such nonsense said lambert sharply and annoyed to see how the girl ignored the presence of lady agnes i have a few questions to ask you about a certain letter kushto bak to the rye who showed it to the lady said chaldea tossing her head so that the golden coins jingled he did not show it to me girl remarked lady agnes coldly hai it seems that the rumy of hearne can lie i shall put you out of the house if you speak in that way said lambert sternly silver went to lady agnes and tried to blackmail her hes a boro pappin and thats romany for a large goose my gorgious rye for i asked no gold you told him to ask five thousand pounds may i die in a ditch if i did cried chaldea vehemently touch the gold of the raclan i would not though i wanted bread the tiny rye took the letter to give to the prastramengro and thats a policeman my gentleman so that there might be trouble but i wished no gold from her romany speaking i should like to poison her i love you and have done with this nonsense chaldea talk like that and out you go i can see from what you admit that you have been making mischief thats as true as my father laughed the gypsy viciously and glad am i to say the word my boro rye and why should the raclan go freefooted when she drew her rom to be slaughtered like a pig i did nothing of the sort cried agnes with an angry look duvel it is true chaldea still addressed lambert and took no notice of agnes i swear it on your biblebook i found the letter in my brothers tent the day after he perished hearne for hearne he was and a gentle romany also read the letter saying that the raclan his own romi was running away with you who wrote the letter demanded agnes indignantly this time chaldea answered her fiercely you did my gorgious rani and lie as you may its the truth i tell ill as he was lambert could not endure seeing the girl insult agnes with unexpected strength he rose from his chair and took her by the shoulders to turn her out of the room chaldea laughed wildly but did not resist it was agnes who intervened let her stay until we learn the meaning of these things noel she said rapidly in french she insults you he replied in the same tongue but released the girl never mind never mind agnes turned to chaldea and reverted to english girl you are playing a dangerous game i wrote no letter to the man you call hearne and who was my husbandsir hubert pine chaldea laughed contemptuously avali that is true the letter was written by you to my precious rye here and hearnes dukkerin brought it his way how did he get it those who know know retorted chaldea indifferently hearnes breath was out of him before i could ask why do you say that i wrote the letter the tiny rye swore by his god that you did it is absolutely false oh my mother there are liars about jeered the gypsy sceptically catch you blabbing your doings on the crook my rani chore mandy speak english interrupted agnes who was quivering with rage you cant cheat me translated chaldea sulkily you write my rye here the letter swearing to run worldwide with him and let it fall into your roms hands so as to fetch him to the big house then did you my cunning gentleman she whirled round on the astounded lambert viciously hide so quietly in the bushes to shoot hai it is so and i love you for the boldness my gorgious one it is absolutely false cried lambert echoing agnes true true and twice times true may i go crazy meg if it isnt you wanted the raclan as your romi and so plotted my brothers death but your sweet one will go before the poknees and with irons on her wrists and a rope round her you shedevil shouted lambert in a frenzy of rage and forgetting in his anger the presence of agnes words of honey under the moon mocked the girl then suddenly became tender let her go rye let her go my love is all for you and when we pad the hoof together those who hate us shall take off the hat lambert sat glaring at her furiously and agnes glided between him and the girl fearful lest he should spring up and insult her but she addressed her words to chaldea why do you think i got mr lambert to kill my husband she asked wincing at having to put the question but seeing that it was extremely necessary to learn all she could from the gypsy the other woman drew her shawl closely round her fine form and snapped her fingers contemptuously it needs no chovihani to tell hearne the romany was poor pine the gentile chinked gold in his pockets says you to yourself he i love isnt him with money and says you if i dont get my true rom the beauty of the world will clasp him to her breast so you goes for to get hearne out of the flesh to wed the rye here on my brothers rich possessions avali she nodded vigorously that is so though no you says to me for wisdom red money you have gained my daring sister for the blood of a romany chal has changed the color but im no how long she would have continued to rage at lady agnes it is impossible to say for the invalid with the artificial strength of furious anger sprang from his chair to turn her out of the room chaldea dodged him in the alert way of a wild animal thats no loveembrace my rye she jibed retreating swiftly later later when the moon rises my angel and she slipped deftly through the door with a contemptuous laugh lambert would have followed but that agnes caught his arm and with tears in her eyes implored him to remain but what can we do in the face of such danger she asked him when he was quieter and breaking down she sobbed bitterly we must meet it boldly silver has the forged letter he must be arrested but the scandal noel dare we agnes you are innocent i am innocent innocence can dare all things both sick both troubled both conscious of the dark clouds around them they looked at one another in silence then lambert repeated his words with conviction to reassure himself as much as to comfort her innocence can dare all things said lambert positively chapter xiii a friend in need it was natural that lambert should talk of having silver arrested as in the first flush of indignation at his audacious attempt to levy blackmail this appeared the most reasonable thing to do but when agnes went back to the manor and the sick man was left alone to struggle through a long and weary night the reaction suggested a more cautious dealing with the matter silver was a venomous little reptile and if brought before a magistrate would probably produce the letter which he offered for sale at so ridiculous a price if this was made public agnes would find herself in an extremely unpleasant position certainly the letter was forged but that would not be easy to prove and even if it were proved and agnes cleared her character the necessary scandal connected with the publicity of such a defence would be both distressing and painful in wishing to silence silver and yet avoid the interference of the police lambert found himself on the horns of a dilemma having readjusted the situation in his own mind lambert next day wrote a lengthy letter to agnes setting forth his objections to drastic measures he informed hernot quite truthfullythat he hoped to be on his feet in twentyfour hours and then would personally attend to the matter although he could not say as yet what he intended to do but five out of the seven days of grace allowed by the blackmailer yet remained and much could be done in that time return to town and attend to your own and to your brothers affairs as usual concluded the letter all matters connected with silver can be left in my hands and should he attempt to see you in the meantime refer him to me the epistle ended with the intimation that agnes was not to worry as the writer would take the whole burden on his own shoulders the widow felt more cheerful after this communication and went back to her town house to act as her lover suggested she had every belief in lamberts capability to deal with the matter the young man was more doubtful for he could not see how he was to begin unravelling this tangled skein the interview with chaldea had proved futile as she was plainly on the side of the enemy and to apply to silver for information as to his intentions would merely result in a repetition of what he had said to lady agnes it only remained to lay the whole matter before inspector darby and lambert was half inclined to go to wanbury for this purpose he did not however undertake the journey for two reasons firstly he wished to avoid asking for official assistance until absolutely forced to do so and secondly he was too ill to leave the cottage the worry he felt regarding agness perilous position told on an already weakened frame and the invalid grew worse instead of better finally lambert decided to risk a journey to the camp which was not so very far distant and interview mother cockleshell the old lady had no great love for chaldea who flouted her authority and would not therefore be very kindly disposed towards the girl the young man believed in some vague way that chaldea had originated the conspiracy which had to do with the letter and was carrying her underhand plans to a conclusion with the aid of silver mother cockleshell who was very shrewd might have learned or guessed the girls rascality and would assuredly thwart her aims if possible also the gypsyqueen would probably know a great deal about pine in his character of ishmael hearne since she had been acquainted with him intimately during the early part of his life but whatever she knew or whatever she did not know lambert considered that it would be wise to enlist her on his side as the mere fact that chaldea was one of the opposite party would make her fight like a wild cat and as the whole affair had to do with the gypsies and as gentilla stanley was a gypsy it was just as well to apply for her assistance nevertheless lambert was quite in the dark as to what assistance could be rendered in this way the young man made his plans only to be thwarted by the weakness of his body he could crawl out of bed and sit before the fire but in spite of all his willpower he could not crawl as far as the camp baffled in this way he decided to send a note asking mother cockleshell to call on him although he knew that if chaldea learned about the visitwhich she was almost certain to doshe would be placed on her guard but this had to be risked and lambert moreover believed that the old woman was quite equal to dealing with the girl however fate took the matter out of his hands and before he could even write the invitation a visitor arrived in the person of miss greeby who suggested a way out of the difficulty by offering her services matters came to a head within half an hour of her presenting herself in the sittingroom miss greeby was quite her old breezy masculine self and her presence in the cottage was like a breath of moorland air blowing through the languid atmosphere of a hothouse she was arrayed characteristically in a shortskirted tailormade gown of a brown hue and bound with brown leather and wore in addition a mans cap dogskin gloves and heavy lacedup boots fit to tramp miry country roads with her fresh complexion and red hair and a large frame instinct with vitality she looked aggressively healthy and lambert with his failing life felt quite a weakling beside this magnificent goddess hallo old fellow cried miss greeby in her best mantoman style feeling chippy why you do look a wreck i must say whats up the fevers up and im down replied lambert who was glad to see her if only to distract his painful thoughts its only a touch of malaria my dear clara i shall be all right in a few days youre hopeful i must say lambert what about a doctor i dont need one mrs tribb is nursing me coddling you muttered miss greeby planting herself manfully in an opposite chair and crossing her legs in a gentlemanly manner fresh air and exercise beefsteaks and tankards of beer are what you need defy nature and you get the better of her kill or cure is my motto as i have strong reasons to remain alive i shant adopt your prescription dr greeby said lambert dryly what are you doing in these parts i thought you were shooting in scotland so i was admitted the visitor frankly and laying her bludgeonshe still carried itacross her knee but i grew sick of the sport knocked over the birds too easy lambert so there was no fun the birds are getting as silly as the men well women knock them over easy enough thats what i mean said miss greeby vigorously its a rotten world this unless one can get away into the wilds why dont you go there well miss greeby leaned forward with her elbows on her knees and dandled the bludgeon with both hands i thought id like a change from the rough and ready this case of pines rather puzzled me and so im on the trail as a detective lambert was rather startled thats considerably out of your line clara miss greeby nodded exactly and so im indulging in the novelty one must do something to entertain ones self you know lambert it struck me that the gypsies know a lot more about the matter than they chose to say so i came down yesterday and put up at the garvington arms in the village here im going to stay until i can get at the root of the matter what root i wish to learn who murdered pine poor devil ah lambert smiled you wish to gain the reward not me ive got more money than i know what to do with as it is silver is more anxious to get the cash than i am silver have you seen him lately a couple of days ago miss greeby informed him easily hes my secretary now lambert yes the poor beast was chucked out of his comfortable billet by the death of pine and hearing that i wanted some one to write my letters and run my errands and act like a tame cat generally he applied to me since i knew him pretty well through pine i took him on hes a cunning little fox but all right when hes kept in order and i find him pretty useful although ive only had him as a secretary for a fortnight lambert did not immediately reply the news rather amazed him as it had always been miss greebys boast that she could manage her own business it was queer that she should have changed her mind in this respect although she was woman enough to exercise that very feminine prerogative but the immediate trend of lamberts thoughts were in the direction of seeking aid from his visitor he could not act himself because he was sick and he knew that she was a capable person in dealing with difficulties also simply for the sake of something to do she had become an amateur detective and was hunting for the trail of pines assassin it seemed to lambert that it would not be a bad idea to tell her of his troubles she would as he knew be only too willing to assist and in that readiness lay his hesitation he did not wish if possible to lie under any obligation to miss greeby lest she should demand in payment that he should become her husband and yet he believed that by this time she had overcome her desires in this direction to make sure he ventured on a few cautious questions were friends arent we clara he asked after a long pause sure said miss greeby nodding heartily does it need putting into words i suppose not but what i mean is that we are pals he used the word which he knew most appealed to her masculine affectations sure said miss greeby again and once more heartily real honest pals i never believed in that stuff about the impossibility of a man and woman being pals unless theres love rubbish about the business at one time lambert i dont deny but what i had a feeling of that sort for you and now questioned the young man with an uneasy smile now its gone or rather my love has become affection and thats quite a different thing old fellow i want to see you happy and you arent now i daresay youre still crying for the moon eh she looked at him sharply you asked me that before when you came here said lambert slowly and i refused to answer i can answer now the moon is quite beyond my reach so i have dried my tears miss greeby who was lighting a cigarette threw away the match and stared hard at his haggard face well i didnt expect to hear that now we know how the moon call things by their right name interrupted lambert sharply agnes is now a widow if thats what you mean it is if you call agnes a thing of course youll marry her since the barrier has been removed meaning pine no im not certain on that point she is a rich widow and im a poor artist in honor bound i cant allow her to lose her money by becoming my wife miss greeby stared at the fire i heard about that beastly will she said frowning horribly unfair i call it still i believed that you loved the moonwell then agnes since you wish us to be plainand would carry her off if you had the pluck i have never been accused of not having pluck clara but theres another thing to be considered and thats honor oh bosh cried miss greeby with boyish vigor you love her and she loves you so why not marry im not worth paying two million for clara you are if she loves you she does and would marry me tomorrow if i would let her the hesitation is on my part more fool you if i were in her position id soon overcome your scruples i think not said lambert delicately oh i think so she retorted a woman always gets her own way and sometimes wrecks continents to get it id wreck this one anyhow said miss greeby dryly however were pals and if theres anything i can do yes there is said lambert abruptly and making up his mind to trust her since she showed plainly that there was no chance of love on her part destroying friendship im sick here and cant move let me engage you to act on my behalf as what if you dont mind my asking lambert as what you are for the moment a detective ho said miss greeby in a guttural manner whats that i want you to learn on my behalf and as my deputy who murdered pine so that you can marry agnes no the will has stopped my chances in that direction her two million forms quite an insurmountable barrier between us now as the fact of her being pines wife did formerly now you understand the situation and that i am prevented by honor from making her my wife dont let us talk any more on that especial subject right you are assented miss greeby affably only ill say this that you are too scrupulous and if i can help you to marry agnes i shall do so why demanded lambert bluntly because im your pal and wish to see you happy you wont be happy like the pears soap advertisement until you get it agnes is the it well then leave the matter alone clara said lambert taking the privilege of an invalid and becoming peevish as things stand i can see no chance of marrying agnes without violating my idea of honor then why do you wish me to help you demanded miss greeby sharply how do i wish you to help me you mean not at all i know what you wish me to do act as detective i know about it my dear boy you dont retorted lambert again fractious but if you listen ill tell you exactly what i mean miss greeby made herself comfortable with a fresh cigarette and nodded in an easy manner im all attention old boy fire away you must regard my confidence as sacred theres my hand on it but i should like to know why you desire to learn who murdered pine because if you dont track down the assassin agnes will get into trouble ho ejaculated miss greeby guttural again go on lambert wasted no further time in preliminary explanations but plunged into the middle of things in a quarter of an hour his auditor was acquainted with the facts of a highly unpleasant case but exhibited no surprise when she heard what her secretary had to do with the matter in fact she rather appeared to admire his acuteness in turning such shady knowledge to his own advantage at the same time she considered that agnes had behaved in a decidedly weak manner if id been in her shoes id have fired the beast out in doublequick time said miss greeby grimly and id have belted him over the head in addition then he would have gone straight to the police oh no he wouldnt one thousand reward against twentyfive thousand blackmail isnt good enough he wont get his blackmail said lambert tightening his lips you bet he wont now that ive come into the matter but theres no denying hes got the whiphand so far agnes never wrote the letter said lambert quickly oh that goes without the saying my dear fellow agnes knew that if she became a rich widow your uneasy sense of honor would never let you marry her she had no reason to get rid of pine on that score or on any score you may add miss greeby nodded certainly you and agnes should have got married and let garvington get out of his troubles as best he could thats what i should have done as im not an aristocrat and cant see the use of becoming the sacrifice for a musty fusty old family however agnes made her bargain and kept to it shes all right although other people may be not of that opinion there isnt a man or woman who dare say a word against agnes a good many will say lots of words should what you have told me get into print rejoined miss greeby dryly i agree with you therefore do i ask for your assistance what is best to be done clara we must get the letter from silver and learn who forged it once that is made plain the truth will come to light since the individual who forged and sent that letter must have fired the second shot quite so but silver wont give up the letter oh yes he will hes my secretary and ill make him even as your secretary he wont said lambert dubiously well see about that old boy ill heckle and harry and worry silver on to the gallows if he doesnt do what hes told the gallows you dont think oh i think nothing it was to silvers interest that pine should live so i dont fancy he set the trap it was to chaldeas interest that pine should not live since she loves you and i dont think she is to blame garvington couldnt have done it as he has lost a good friend in pine andandgo on lambert suggest some one else i cant and two out of three you mention were inside the manor when the second shot was fired so can prove an alibi im not bothering about who fired the second shot said miss greeby leisurely but as to who wrote that letter once we find the forger well soon discover the assassin true but how are you going about it i shall see silver and force him to give me the letter if you can oh ill manage somehow the little beasts a coward and ill bully him into compliance miss greeby spoke very confidently then well see the kind of paper the letter is written on and there may be an envelope which would show where it was posted of course the forger must be well acquainted with agness handwriting thats obvious said lambert promptly well i suppose that your way of starting the matter is the best but we have only four days before silver makes his move when i get the letter he wont make any move reported miss greeby and she looked very determined let us hope so but clara before you return to town i wish you would see mother cockleshell that old gypsy fortuneteller who looks like an almshouse widow why she hates chaldea and i suspect that chaldea has something to do with the matter of this conspiracy ha miss greeby rubbed her aquiline nose a conspiracy perhaps you may be right but its reason lambert colored chaldea wants me to marry her you know the minx i know she does i warned you against having her to sit for you lambert but theres no sense in your suggestion my boy it wasnt any catch for her to get pine killed and leave his wife free to marry you no and yetand yethang it the young man clutched his hair in desperation and glared at the fire i cant see any motive nor can i unless it is to be found in the city gypsies are more lawless than city men observed the other quickly and hearne would have enemies rather than pine i dont agree with you said miss greeby rising and getting ready to go away hearne was nobody pine was a millionaire successful men have enemies all over the shop at the inquest it was said that pine had no enemies oh rubbish a strong man like that couldnt make such a fortune without exciting envy ill bet that his assassin is to be found in a frock coat and a silk hat however ill look up mother cockleshell as it is just as well to know what she thinks of this pretty gypsy hussy of yours not of mine i dont care for her in the least as if that mattered there is always one who loves and one who is loved as heine says and that is the cause of all lifes tragedies of this tragedy maybe although i think some envious stockbroker may have shot pine as a too successful financial rival however we shall see about it and see about another thing clara said lambert quickly call on agnes and tell her that she need not worry over silver she expects the deluge in a few days remember write and tell her that i have the case in hand and that she neednt trouble about silver ill straighten him out i fear you are too hopeful i dont fear anything of the sort ill break his neck if he doesnt obey me i wouldnt hesitate to do it either lambert ran his eyes over her masculine personality and laughed i quite believe that clara but i say wont you have some tea before you go no thanks i dont eat between meals afternoon tea is a meal nonsense its a weakness im not garvington by the way where is he in paris but he returns in a few days then dont let him meddle with this matter or hell put things wrong i shall allow no one but yourself to meddle clara garvington shant know a single thing miss greeby nodded right all we wish kept quiet would be in the papers if garvington gets hold of our secrets hes a loosetongued little glutton well goodbye old chap and do look after yourself good people are scarce lambert gripped her large hand im awfully obliged to you clara wait until i do something before you say that old son she laughed and strode towards the door by the way oughtnt i to send the doctor in no confound the doctor im all right youll see me on my legs in a few days then we can work together at the case keep your flag flying old chap for im at the helm to steer the bark and with this nautical farewell she went off with a manly stride whistling a gay tune left alone the invalid looked into the fire and wondered if he had been right to trust her after some thought he concluded that it was the best thing he could have done since in his present helpless state he needed some one to act as his deputy and there was no doubt that miss greeby had entirely overcome the passion she had once entertained for him i hope agnes will think so also thought lambert when he began a letter to the lady she was always rather doubtful of clara chapter xiv miss greeby detective as miss greeby had informed lambert she intended to remain at the garvington arms until the mystery of pines death was solved but her interview with him necessitated a rearrangement of plans since the incriminating letter appeared to be such an important piece of evidence to obtain it miss greeby had decided to return to london forthwith in order to compel its surrender silver would undoubtedly show fight but his mistress was grimly satisfied that she would be able to manage him and quite counted upon gaining her end by bullying him into compliance when in possession of the letter she decided to submit it to agnes and hear what that lady had to say about it as a dexterous piece of forgery then on what was said would depend her next move in the complicated game meanwhile since she was on the spot and desired to gather all possible evidence connected with chaldeas apparent knowledge of the crime miss greeby went straight from lamberts cottage to the gypsy camp here she found the community of vagrants in the throes of an election or rather their excitement was connected with the deposition of gentilla stanley from the bohemian throne and the elevation of chaldea miss greeby mixed with the throng dispensed a few judicious shillings and speedily became aware of what was going on it appeared that chaldea being pretty and unscrupulous and having gained by cunning a wonderful influence amongst the younger members of the tribe was insisting that she should be elected its head the older men and women believing wisely that it was better to have an experienced ruler than a pretty figurehead stood by mother cockleshell therefore the camp was divided into two parties tongues were used freely and occasionally fists came into play while the gypsies gathered round the tent of the old woman and listened to the duet between her and the younger aspirant to this throne of brentford miss greeby with crossed legs and leaning on her bludgeon listened to the voluble speech of mother cockleshell which was occasionally interrupted by chaldea the oration was delivered in romany and miss greeby only understood such scraps of it as was hastily translated to her by a wildeyed girl to whom she had given a shilling gentilla less like a sober pewopener and more resembling the hecate of some witchgathering screamed objurgations at the pitch of her crocked voice and waved her skinny arms to emphasize her words in a most dramatic fashion oh ye romans she screeched vehemently are ye not fools to be gulled by a babe with her mothers milkand curses that it fed herscarcely dry on her living lips who am i who speak asses of the common gentilla stanley whose father was pharaoh before her and who can call up the ghosts of dead egyptian kings with a tent for a palace and a cudgel for a sceptre and the wisdom of our people at the service of all things have changed cried out chaldea with a mocking laugh for old wisdom is dead leaves and i am the tree which puts forth the green of new truths to make the gorgios take off their hats to the romans oh spawn of the old devil but you lie truth is truth and changes not can you read the hand can you cheat the gentile do you know the law of the poknees and can you diddle them as has money says you i can and in that you lie like your mother before you bless your wisdommother cockleshell made an ironical curtsey age must bow before a brat beauty draws money to the romans and wheedles the gorgios to part with red gold wrinkles you have mother and weak wits to weak wits you drab my weakest wits are your strongest wrinkles says you in your cunning way and flaunts your brazen smoothness i spit on you for a fool the old woman suited her action to the word every wrinkle is the mark of lessons learned and them is wisdom which the romans take from my mouth hear the witchly hag cried chaldea in her turn she and her musty wisdom that puts the romans under the feet of the gentiles are not three of our brothers in choky have we not been turned off common and out of field isnt the fire low and the pot empty and every purse without gold bad luck she has brought us snarled the girl pointing an accusing finger and bad luck we romans will have till she is turned from the camp like a dog you would send me away shrieked mother cockleshell glancing round and seeing that chaldeas supporters outnumbered her own but im dangerous and go i shall as a queen should at my own free will i cast a shoe amongst youshe flung one of her own hastily snatched off her footand curses gather round it under its heels shall you lie ye romans till time again and time once more be accomplished i go on my own she turned and walked to the door of her tent alone i go to cheat the gentiles and win my food take your new queen and with her sorrow and starvation prison and the kicks of the gorgios so it is as i have said and so it shall be she vanished into the tent and the older members of the tribe shaking their heads over the illomen of her concluding words withdrew sorrowfully to their various habitations in order to discuss the situation but the young men and women bowed down before chaldea and forthwith elected her their ruler fawning on her kissing her hands and invoking blessings on her pretty face that face which they hoped and believed would bring prosperity to them and there was no doubt that of late under mother cockleshells leadership the tribe had been unfortunate in many ways it was for this reason that chaldea had raised the standard of rebellion and for this reason also she gained her triumph to celebrate her coronation she gave kara who hovered constantly at her elbow a couple of sovereigns and told him to buy food and drink in a high state of enjoyment the gypsies dispersed in order to prepare for the forthcoming festivity and chaldea weary but victorious stood alone by the steps of the caravan which was her perambulating home seizing her opportunity miss greeby approached my congratulations to your majesty she said ironically im sorry not to be able to stay for your coronation which i presume takes place tonight but i have to go back to london to see a friend of yours i have no friends my gentile lady retorted chaldea with a fiery spark in each eye and what do you here amongst the gentle romany gentle miss greeby chuckled thats a new word for the row thats been going on my girl do you know me as i know the road and the tent and the art of dukkerhin you stay at the big house and you love the rye who lived in the wood very clever of you to guess that said miss greeby coolly but as it happens you are wrong the rye is not for me and not for you he marries the lady he worships on his knees forgive me for speaking in this highflowing manner ended miss greeby apologetically but in romantic situations one must speak romantic words chaldea did not pay attention to the greater part of this speech as only one statement appealed to her the rye shall not marry the gentile lady she said between her white teeth oh i think so chaldea your plotting has all been in vain my plotting what do you know of that a certain portion my girl and im going to know more when i see silver chaldea frowned darkly i know nothing of him i think you do since you gave him a certain letter patchessa tu adove asked chaldea scornfully then seeing that her visitor did not understand her explained do you believe in that yes said miss greeby alertly you found the letter in pines tent when he was camping here as hearne and passed it to silver so that he might ask money for it its a lie i swear its a lie i ask no money i told the tiny rye silver i presume put in miss greeby carelessly aye silver is his name and a good one for him as has no gold he will get gold from lady agnes for the letter no drodiah bah broke off chaldea you dont understand romanes i speak the gorgio tongue to such as you listen i found the letter which lured my brother to his death the rani wrote that letter and i gave it to the tiny rye saying tell her if she gives up the big rye free she shall go if not take the letter to those who deal in the law the police i suppose you mean said miss greeby coolly a very pretty scheme my good girl but it wont do you know lady agnes never wrote that letter and had nothing to do with the death of her husband she set a trap for him cried chaldea fiercely and hearne walked into it like a rabbit into a snare the big rye waited outside and shot thats a lie interrupted miss greeby just as fiercely and determined to defend her friend he would not do such a thing ha but i can prove it and will when the time is ripe he becomes my rom does the big rye or round his neck goes the rope and she dances longside i swear what a bloodthirsty idea you savage devil and how do you propose to prove that mr lambert shot the man aha sneered chaldea contemptuously you take me for a fool saying more than i can do but know this my precious angelshe fumbled in her pocket and brought out a more or less formless piece of leadwhats this may i ask the bullet which passed through hearnes heart and buried itself in a treetrunk miss greeby made a snatch at the article but chaldea was too quick for her and slipped it again into her pocket you cant prove that it is the bullet snapped miss greeby glaring for she dreaded lest its production should incriminate lambert innocent though she believed him to be kara can prove it he went to where hearne was shot and saw that there was a big tree by the blue door and before the shrubbery a shot fired from behind the bushes would by chance strike the tree the bullet which killed my brother was not found in the heart it passed through and was in the treetrunk kara knifed it out and brought it to me if this chaldea held up the bullet again jeeringly fits the pistol of the big rye he will swing for sure the letter hangs her and the bullet hangs him i want my price you wont get it then said miss greeby eyeing the pocket into which the girl had again dropped the bullet mr lambert was absent in london on that night i heard that by chance then you heard wrong my gentile lady avali quite wrong the big rye returned on that very night and went to lundra again in the morning even if he did said miss greeby desperately he did not leave the cottage his housekeeper can prove nothing snapped chaldea triumphantly she was in her bed and the golden rye was in his bed my brother was killed after midnight and if the rye took a walk then who can say where he was you have to prove all this you know chaldea snapped her fingers first the letter to shame her then the bullet to hang him the rest comes after my price you know my gorgious artful i toves my own gad its a good proverb lady and true romany what does it mean i wash my own shirt said chaldea significantly and sprang up the steps of her gailypainted caravan to shut herself in what a fool i am not to take that bullet from her thought miss greeby standing irresolutely before the vehicle and she cast a glance around to see if such an idea was feasible it was not as she speedily decided for a single cry from chaldea would bring the gypsies round to protect their new queen it was probable also that the girl would fight like a wild cat although miss greeby felt that she could manage her so far but she was not equal to fighting the whole camp of vagrants and so was compelled to abandon her scheme in a somewhat discontented mood she turned away feeling that so far chaldea had the whiphand then it occurred to her that she had not yet examined mother cockleshell as had been her original intention when she came to the camp forthwith she passed back to the tent under the elm to interview the deposed queen here she found gentilla stanley placing her goods in an untidy bundle on the back of a large gray donkey which was her private property the old creatures eyes were red with weeping and her gray hair had fallen down so that she presented a somewhat wild appearance this in connection with her employment reminded miss greebywhose reading was wideof a similar scene in borrows lavengro when mrs pentulengros mother shifted herself and for the moment mother cockleshell had just the hairy looks of mrs hern and also at the moment probably had the same amiable feelings feeling that the old woman detested her successful rival miss greeby approached guessing that now was the right moment to work on her mind and thus to learn what she could of chaldeas underhand doings she quite expected a snub as gentilla could scarcely be expected to answer questions when taken up with her own troubles but the artful creature seeing by a sideglance that miss greeby was a wealthy gentile lady dropped one of her almshouse curtseys when she approached and bundled up her hair a change passed over her withered face and miss greeby found herself addressing not so much a fallen queen as a respectable old woman who had known better days and a blessing on your sweet face my angel mumbled mother cockleshell for a heart you have to feel for my sorrows here is a sign of my feelings said miss greeby handing over a sovereign for she rightly judged that the gypsy would only appreciate this outward symbol of sympathy now what do you know of pines murder mother cockleshell who was busy tying up the sovereign in a corner of her respectable shawl after biting it to make sure it was current gold looked up with a vacant expression murder my lady and what should i know of that miss greeby looked at her straightly what does chaldea know of it a vicious pair of devils looked out of the decent widows eyes in a moment and at once she became the romany hai she knows does she the drab i hope to see her hanged for what for killing of hearne may his bones rest sweetly miss greeby suppressed an exclamation she accuses lady agnes of laying a trap by writing a letter and says that mr lambert fired the shot avali avali mother cockleshell nodded vigorously but did not interrupt her preparations for departure that she would say since she loves the gorgio and hates the rani a rope round her neck to set the rye free to make chaldeamy curses on herhis true wife she couldnt have fired the shot herself you know went on miss greeby in a musing manner for then she would remove an obstacle to mr lambert marrying lady agnes blessings on her for a kind gentile lady said gentilla piously and looking more respectable than ever since the lurking devils had disappeared but chaldea is artful and knows the rye what do you mean this my lady hearne who was the gorgio pine had the angel to wife but he did not hope to live long because of illness miss greeby nodded consumption pine told me if he had died natural pursued mother cockleshell pulling hard at a strap maybe the gentile lady would have married the golden rye whom she loves but by the violent death chaldea has tangled up both in her knots and if they wed she will make trouble so she says but can she hai but shes a deep one maam believe me when i say so mother cockleshell nodded sapiently but foolish trouble has she given herself when the death of hearne natural or by the pistolshot would stop the marriage what do you mean inquired miss greeby once more you gentiles are fools said gentilla politely for you put other things before true love hearne as pine had much gold and that he left to his wife should she not marry the golden rye how do you know that chaldea was told so by the dead and told me my lady now the angel of the big house would give up the gold to marry the rye for her heart is all for him but says he and tell me if im wrong says he no if i make you my romi that would beggar you and fair it would not be for a romany rye to do so my lady the red gold parts them because its red money red money blood money the taint of blood is on the wealth of the dead one and so it divides by a curse the true hearts of the living you see my lady miss greeby did see and the more readily since she had heard lambert express exactly the sentiments with which the old gypsy credited him an overstrained feeling of honor prevented him in any case from making agnes his wife whether the death had come by violence or by natural causes but it was amazing that gentilla should know this and miss greeby wonderingly asked her how she came by such knowledge the respectable widow chuckled i have witchly ways maam and the golden rye has talked many a time to me in my tent when i told him of the gorgious ladys goodness to me when ill they loveaye that is surebut the money divides their hearts and that is foolish chaldea had no need to shoot to keep them apart how do you know she shot pine oh i can say nothing the poknees would listen to said mother cockleshell readily for i speak only as i think and not as i know but the child was impatient for joy and hoped by placing the cruel will between true hearts to gain that of the golden rye for her own part but that she will not ha ha nor you my lady nor you me miss greeby colored even redder than she was by nature gentilla looked at her shrewdly la la la la she croaked age brings a mighty wisdom they were fools to throw me out and she jerked her grizzled head in the direction of the caravans and tents dont talk rubbish you old donkey mr lambert is only my friend youre a woman and hes a man said mother cockleshell sententiously we are chums pals whatever you like to call us i want to see him happy he will never be happy my lady unless he marries the rani and death by bringing the money between their true love has divided them forever unless the golden rye puts his heart before his fear of silly chatter for them he moves amongst the child was right to shoot hearne so far although she could have waited and gained the same end the rye is free to marry her or to marry you maam but never to marry the angel unless mother cockleshell adjusted the bundle carefully on the donkey and then cut a long switch from the tree i dont want to marry mr lambert said miss greeby decisively and ill take care that chaldea doesnt gentilla chuckled again oh trust you for that as to chaldea shooting pine leave it to me leave it to me maam said the old gypsy with a grandiloquent wave of her dirty hand but i wish to learn the truth and save lady agnes from this trouble you wish to save her chuckled mother cockleshell and not the golden rye ah well my angel there are women and women she faced round and the humor died out of her wrinkled face you wish for help and so have come to see me is it not so yes said miss greeby tartly chaldea will make trouble the child wont i can manage her miss greeby hitched up her broad shoulders contemptuously she has managed you just now there are ways and ways and when the hour arrives the sun rises to scatter the darkness said gentilla mystically let the child win for the moment for my turn comes then you know something what i know mustnt be said till the hour strikes but content yourself my gorgious lady with knowing that the child will make no trouble she has parted with the letter i know of that letter hearne showed it to me and would make for the big house although i told him fair not to doubt his true wife how did he get the letter thats tellings said mother cockleshell with a wink of her lively eye ive a good mind to take you to the police and then youd be forced to say what you know said miss greeby crossly for the vague hints irritated her not a little the old woman cackled in evident enjoyment do that and the pot will boil over maam i wish to help the angel rani who nursed me when i was sick and i have debts to pay to chaldea both i do in my own witchly way you will help me to learn the truth surely surely my gorgious one and now mother cockleshell gave a tug at the donkeys mouth i goes my ways but where can i find you again when the time comes the mouth will open and them as thinks theyre high will find themselves in the dust aye and maybe lower if six feet of good earth lies atop and them burning in lime uncoffined and unblessed miss greeby was masculine and fearless but there was something so weird about this mystic sentence which hinted at capital punishment that she shrank back nervously mother cockleshell delighted to see that she had made an impression climbed on to the gray donkey and made a progress through the camp passing by chaldeas caravan she spat on it and muttered a word or so which did not indicate that she wished a blessing to rest on it chaldea did not show herself so the deposed queen was accompanied to the outskirts of the wood by the elder gypsies mourning loudly but when they finally halted to see the last of mother cockleshell she raised her hand and spoke authoritatively i go and i come my children forget not ye romans that i say so much when the seed needs rain it falls sarishan brothers and sisters all and with this strange speech mystical to the last she rode away into the setting sun on the gray donkey looking more like an almshouse widow than ever as for miss greeby she strode out of the camp and out of the abbots wood and made for the garvington arms where she had left her baggage what mother cockleshell knew she did not guess what mother cockleshell intended to do she could not think but she was satisfied that chaldea would in some way pay for her triumph and the downfall of the girl was evidently connected with the unravelling of the murder mystery in a witchly way as the old woman would have said herself she intended to adjust matters ill leave things so far in her hands thought miss greeby now for silver chapter xv guesswork whether miss greeby found a difficulty as was probable in getting silver to hand over the forged letter or whether she had decided to leave the solution of this mystery to mother cockleshell it is impossible to say but she certainly did not put in an appearance at lady agnes pines town house to report progress until after the new year nor in the meantime did she visit lambert although she wrote to say that she induced the secretary to delay his threatened exposure the position of things was therefore highly unsatisfactory since the consequent suspense was painful both to agnes and her lover and of course the widow had been duly informed of the interview at the cottage and naturally expected events to move more rapidly however taking the wise advice of isaiah to make no haste in time of trouble agnes possessed her soul in patience and did not seek out miss greeby in any way either by visiting or by letter she attended at her lawyers offices to supervise her late husbands affairs and had frequent consultations with garvingtons solicitors in connection with the freeing of the lambert estates everything was going on very satisfactorily even to the improvement of lamberts health so agnes was not at all so ill at ease in her mind as might have been expected certainly the sword of damocles still dangled over her head and over the head of lambert but a consciousness that they were both innocent assured her inwardly that it would not fall nevertheless the beginning of the new year found her in anything but a placid frame of mind she was greatly relieved when miss greeby at last condescended to pay her a visit luckily agnes was alone when the lady arrived as garvington and his wife were both out enjoying themselves in their several ways the pair had been staying with the wealthy widow for christmas and had not yet taken their departure since garvington always tried to live at somebodys expense if possible he had naturally shut up the manor during the festive season as the villagers expected coals and blankets and port wine and plumpuddings which he had neither the money nor the inclination to supply in fact the greedy little man considered that they should ask for nothing and pay larger rents than they did by deserting them when peace on earth and goodwill to men prevailed or ought to have prevailed he disappointed them greatly and chuckled over their lamentations garvington was very human in some ways however both the corpulent little lord and his untidy wife were out of the way when miss greeby was announced and agnes was thankful that such was the case since the interview was bound to be an important one miss greeby as usual looked large and aggressively healthy bouncing into the room like an indiarubber ball her town dress differed very little from the garb she wore in the country save that she had a feathertrimmed hat instead of a mans cap and carried an umbrella in place of a bludgeon a smile which showed all her strong white teeth in a somewhat carnivorous way overspread her face as she shook hands vigorously with her hostess and miss greebys grip was so friendly as to be positively painful here you are agnes and here am i beastly day aint it rain and rain and rain again seems as though wed gone back to father noahs times dont it i expected you before clara remarked lady agnes rather hurriedly and too full of anxiety to discuss the weather well i intended to come before confessed miss greeby candidly only one thing and another prevented me agnes noticed that she did not specify the hindrances it was the deuces own job to get that letter oh by the way i suppose lambert told you about the letter mr silver told me about it and i told noel responded agnes gravely i also heard about your interview with oh thats ages ago long before christmas i should have gone and seen him to tell about my experiences at the gypsy camp but i thought that i would learn more before making my report as a detective by the way how is lambert do you know he is all right now and is in town at his old rooms i suppose for how long i want to see him for an indefinite period garvington has turned him out of the cottage the deuce whats that for well said agnes explaining reluctantly you see noel paid no rent as garvington is his cousin and when an offer came along offering a pound a week for the place garvington said that he was too poor to refuse it so noel has taken a small house in kensington and mrs tribb has been installed as his housekeeper i wonder you didnt know these things why should i asked miss greeby rather aggressively because it is mr silver who has taken the cottage miss greeby sat up alertly silver oh indeed then that explains why he asked me for leave to stay in the country said his health required fresh air and that london got on his nerves hum hum miss greeby bit the handle of her umbrella so hes taken the abbots wood cottage has he i wonder what thats for i dont know and i dont care said agnes restlessly of course i could have prevented garvington letting it to him since he tried to blackmail me but i thought it was best to see the letter and to understand his meaning more thoroughly before telling my brother about his impertinence noel wanted me to tell but i decided not toin the meantime at all events silvers meaning is not hard to understand said miss greeby drily and feeling in her pocket he wants to get twentyfive thousand pounds for this she produced a sheet of paper dramatically however i made the little animal give it to me for nothing never mind what arguments i used i got it out of him and brought it to show you agnes paling slightly took the letter and glanced over it with surprise well she said drawing a long breath if i had not been certain that i never wrote such a letter i should believe that i did my handwriting has certainly been imitated in a wonderfully accurate way who imitated it asked miss greeby who was watching her eagerly i cant say but doesnt mr silver oh he knows nothing or says that he knows nothing all he swears to is that chaldea found the letter in pines tent the day after his murder and before inspector darby had time to search the envelope had been destroyed so we dont know if the letter was posted or delivered by hand if i had written such a letter to noel said agnes quietly it certainly would have been delivered by hand in which case pine might have intercepted the messenger put in miss greeby it couldnt have been sent by post or pine would not have got hold of it unless he bribed mrs tribb into giving it up mrs tribb is not open to bribery clara and as to the letter i never wrote it nor did noel ever receive it it was written from the manor anyhow said miss greeby bluntly look at the crest and the heading someone in the house wrote it if you didnt im not so sure of that the paper might have been stolen well miss greeby again bit her umbrella handle reflectively theres something in that agnes chaldea told mrs belgroves fortune in the park and afterwards she came to the drawingroom to tell it again i wonder if she stole the paper while she was in the house even if she did an uneducated gypsy could not have forged the letter she might have got somebody to do so suggested miss greeby nodding then the somebody must be well acquainted with my handwriting retorted lady agnes and began to study the few lines closely she might have written it herself so much did it resemble her style of writing the terse communication stated that the writer who signed herself agnes pine would meet her dearest noel outside the blue door shortly after midnight and hoped that he would have the motor at the park gates to take them to london en route to paris hubert is sure to get a divorce ended the letter and then we can marry at once and be happy ever more it was certainly a silly letter and agnes laughed scornfully i dont express myself in that way she said contemptuously and still eyeing the writing wonderingly and as i respected my husband and respect myself i should never have thought of eloping with my cousin especially from garvingtons house when i had much better and safer chances of eloping in town had noel received this he would never have believed that i wrote it as i assuredly did not and a motor at the park gates she read why not at the postern gate which leads to the blue door that would have been safer and more reasonable pah i never heard such rubbish and she folded up the letter to slip it into her pocket miss greeby looked rather aghast oh you must give it back to me she said hurriedly i have to look into the case you know i shall not give it back to you said agnes in a determined manner it is in my possession and shall remain there i wish to show it to noel and what am i to say to silver whatever you like you can manage him you know hell make trouble now that he has lost this weaponagnes touched her pockethe cant wellmiss greeby shrugged her big shoulders and stood upjust as you please but it would be best to leave the letter and the case in my hands i think not rejoined agnes decisively noel is now quite well again and i prefer him to take charge of the matter himself is that all the thanks i get for my trouble my dear clara said the other cordially i am ever so much obliged to you for robbing mr silver of this letter but i dont wish to put you to any more trouble just as you please said miss greeby again and rather sullenly i wash my hands of the business and if silver makes trouble you have only yourself to thank i advise you also agnes to see mother cockleshell and learn what she has to say does she know anything she gave me certain mysterious hints that she did but she appears to have a great opinion of you my dear so she may be more open with you than she was with me where is she to be found i dont know chaldea is queen of the tribe which is still camped on the outskirts of abbots wood mother cockleshell has gone away on her own have you any idea who wrote the letter agnes took out the forged missive again and studied it not in the least she said shaking her head do you know of any one who can imitate your handwriting not that i knowoh she stopped suddenly and grew as white as the widows cap she wore oh she said blankly what is it demanded miss greeby on fire with curiosity have you thought of any one agnes shook her head again and placed the letter in her pocket i can think of no one she said in a low voice miss greeby did not entirely believe this as the sudden hesitation and the paleness hinted at some unexpected thought probably connected with the forgery however since she had done all she could it was best as she judged to leave things in the widows hands im tired of the whole business said miss greeby carelessly it wouldnt do for me to be a detective as i have no staying power and get sick of things still if you want me you know where to send for me and at all events ive drawn silvers teeth yes dear thank you very much said agnes mechanically so the visitor took her leave wondering what was rendering her hostess so absentminded a very persistent thought told her that agnes had made a discovery in connection with the letter but since she would not impart that thought there was no more to be said when miss greeby left the house and was striding down the street agnes for the third time took the letter from her pocket and studied every line of the writing it was wonderfully like her own she thought again and yet wondered both at the contents and at the signature i should never have written in this way to noel she reflected and certainly i should never have signed myself agnes pine to so intimate a note however we shall see and with this cryptic thought she placed the letter in her desk when garvington and his wife returned they found agnes singularly quiet and pale the little man did not notice this as he never took any interest in other peoples emotions but his wife asked questions to which she received no answers and looked at agnes uneasily when she saw that she did not eat any dinner to speak of lady garvington was very fond of her kindhearted sisterinlaw and would have been glad to know what was troubling her but agnes kept her worries to herself and insisted that jane should go to the pantomime as she had arranged with some friends instead of remaining at home but when garvington moved to leave the drawingroom after drinking his coffee his sister detained him i want you to come to the library to write a letter for me freddy she said in a tremulous voice cant you write it yourself said garvington selfishly as he was in a hurry to get to his club no dear i am so tired sighed agnes passing her hand across her brow then you should have kept on silver as your secretary grumbled garvington however if it wont take long i dont mind obliging you he followed her into the library and took his seat at the writing table who is the letter to he demanded taking up a pen in a hurry to mr jarwin i want him to find out where gentilla stanley is its only a formal letter so write it and sign it on my behalf like an infernal secretary sighed garvington taking paper and squaring his elbows what do you want with old mother cockleshell miss greeby was here today and told me that the woman knows something about poor huberts death garvingtons pen halted for a moment but he did not look round what can she possibly know he demanded irritably thats what i shall find out when mr jarwin discovers her said agnes who was in a low chair near the fire by the way freddy i am sorry you let the abbots wood cottage to mr silver why shouldnt i growled garvington writing industriously noel didnt pay me a pound a week and silver does you might have a more respectable tenant said agnes scathingly who says silver isnt respectable he asked looking round i do and i have every reason to say so oh nonsense garvington began to write again silver was pines secretary and now hes miss greebys they wouldnt have engaged him unless he was respectable although he did start life as a pauper toymaker i suppose that is what you mean agnes im surprised at your narrowness ah we have not all your tolerance freddy have you finished that letter there you are garvington handed it over you dont want me to address the envelope yes i do agnes ran her eyes over the missive and you can add a postscript to this telling mr jarwin he can take my motor to look for gentilla stanley if he chooses garvington did as he was asked reluctantly though i dont see why jarwin cant supply his own motors he grumbled and ten to one hell only put an advertisement in the newspapers as if mother cockleshell ever saw a newspaper retorted his sister oh thank you freddy you are good she went on when he handed her the letter in a newly addressed envelope no dont go i want to speak to you about mr silver garvington threw himself with a growl into a chair i dont know anything about him except that hes my tenant he complained then it is time you did perhaps you are not aware that mr silver tried to blackmail me what the little man grew purple and exploded oh nonsense its anything but nonsense agnes rose and went to her desk to get the forged letter he came to me a long time before christmas and said that chaldea found this she flourished the letter before her brothers eyes in huberts tent when he was masquerading as hearne a letter what does it say garvington stretched out his hand agnes drew back and returned to her seat by the fire i can tell you the contents she said coolly it is supposed to be written by me to noel and makes an appointment to meet him at the blue door on the night of huberts death in order to elope agnes you never wrote such a letter cried garvington jumping up with a furious red face his sister did not answer for a moment she had taken the letter just written to jarwin by garvington and was comparing it with that which miss greeby had extorted from silver no she said in a strange voice and becoming white i never wrote such a letter but i should be glad to know why you did i did garvington retreated and his face became as white as that of the woman who confronted him what the devil do you mean i always knew that you were clever at imitating handwriting freddy said agnes while the two letters shook in her grasp we used to make a joke of it i remember but it was no joke when you altered that check hubert gave you and none when you imitated his signature to that mortgage about which he told me i neveri never stammered the detected little scoundrel holding on to a chair for support i never spare me these lies interrupted his sister scornfully hubert showed the mortgage when it came into his possession to me he admitted that his signature was legal to spare you and also for my sake hushed up the affair of the check he warned you against playing with fire freddy and now you have done so again to bring about his death its a damned lie its a damned truth retorted agnes fiercely i got you to write the letter to mr jarwin so that i might compare the signature to the one in the forged letter agnes pine in one and agnes pine in the other both with the same twists and twirlsvery very like my signature and yet with a difference that i alone can detect the postscript about the motor i asked you to write because the word occurs in the forged letter motor and motorboth the same its a lie denied garvington again i have not imitated your handwriting in the letter to jarwin you unconsciously imitated the signature and you have written the word motor the same in both letters said agnes decisively i suddenly thought of your talent for writing like other people when clara greeby asked me today if i could guess who had forged the letter i laid a trap for you and you have fallen into it and youshe took a step forward with fiery glance so that garvington retreating nearly tumbled over a chairyou laid a trap for hubert into which he fell i never didi never did babbled garvington gray with fear yes you did i swear to it now i understand why you threatened to shoot any possible burglar who should come to the manor you learned in some way i dont know how that hubert was with the gypsies and knowing his jealous nature you wrote this letter and let it fall into his hands so that he might risk being shot as a robber and a thief iiididnt shoot him panted the man brokenly it was not for the want of trying you broke his arm and probably would have followed him out to inflict a mortal wound if your accomplice in the shrubbery had not been beforehand with you agnes i swear that i took pine for a burglar and i dont know who shot him really i dont you liar said agnes with intense scorn when you posted your accompl she had no chance to finish the word for garvington broke in furiously and made a great effort to assert himself i had no accomplice who shot pine i dont know i never wrote the letter i never lured him to his death he was more good to me alive than dead he never he was not more good to you alive than dead interrupted lady agnes in her turn for hubert despised you for the way in which you tried to trick him out of money he thought you little better than a criminal and only hushed up your wickedness for my sake you would have got no more money out of him and you know that much by killing him you hoped that i would get the fortune and then you could plunder me at your leisure hubert was hard to manage and you thought that i would be easy well i have got the money and you have got rid of hubert but i shall punish you punish me garvington passed his tongue over his dry lips and looked as though in his terror he would go down on his knees to plead oh not by denouncing you to the police said his sister contemptuously for bad as you are i have to consider our family name but you had hubert shot so as to get the money through me and now that i am in possession i shall surrender it to the person named in the sealed envelope no no no no dontdont yes i shall i can do so by marrying noel i shall no longer consider the financial position of the family i have sacrificed enough and i shall sacrifice no more hubert was a good husband to me and i was a good and loyal wife to him but his will insults me and you have made me your enemy by what you have done i did not do it i swear i did not do it yes you did and no denial on your part will make me believe otherwise i shall give you a few days to think over the necessity of making a confession and in any case i shall marry noel and lose the money you shant shant agnes stepped forward and looked fairly into his shifty eyes you are not in a position to say that freddy i am mistress both of the situation and of huberts millions go away she pushed him toward the door take time to think over your position and confess everything to me garvington got out of the room as swiftly as his shaky legs could carry him and paused at the door to turn with a very evil face you darent split on me he screeched i defy you i defy you you darent split on me alas agnes knew that only too well and when he disappeared she wept bitterly feeling her impotence chapter xvi the last straw lady agnes was inaccurate when she informed miss greeby that her cousin had taken a house in kensington since like many women she was accustomed to speak in general terms rather than in a precise way the young man certainly did live in the suburb she mentioned but he had simply rented a furnished flat in one of the cheaper streets he was the poorest of all the lamberts and could scarcely pay his club subscriptions much less live in the style his ancient name demanded the st jamess chambers had merely been lent to him by a friend and when the owner returned the temporary occupant had to shift therefore on the score of economy he hired the dingy flat and brought up mrs tribb to look after it the little woman on her masters account was disgusted with the mean surroundings when you ought to be living in a kind of buckingham palace master noel as i should declare with my dying breath she said indignantly and have the title too if things was as they ought to be i shouldnt be much better off if i did have the title mrs tribb replied lambert with a shrug its common knowledge that garvington can scarcely keep his head above water as an old family servant you should know ah master noel theres many things as i know as im sorry i do know said mrs tribb incoherently and them lords as is dead and buried did waste the money theres no denying but some of your cousins master noel have gone into trade and made money more shame to them i dont see that mrs tribb id go into trade myself if i had any head for figures theres no disgrace in trade not for them as isnt lamberts master noel and far be it from me to say so gentry not being so rich as they used to be when my mother was a gal i dont hold with it though for you sir but now lady agnes having millions and billions will make things easier for you certainly not mrs tribb how could i take money from her and why not master noel if youll excuse my making so free as a child shed give you anything in the way of toys and as a grownup her head is yours if not her heart as is there there dont talk any more said lambert coloring and vexed i havent annoyed you sir i hope its my heart as speaks i appreciate the interest you take in the family mrs tribb but you had better leave some things unsaid now go and prepare tea as lady agnes has written saying she will be here this afternoon oh master noel and you only tell me now then there aint time to cook them cakes she dotes on but lambert declined to argue further and mrs tribb withdrew murmuring that she would have to make shift with sardine sandwiches her tongue was assuredly something of a nuisance but the young man knew how devoted she was to the family and since she had looked after him when he was a child he sanctioned in her a freedom he would not have permitted any one else to indulge in and it is to be feared that the little woman in her zeal sometimes abused her privileges the sitting room was small and cramped and atrociously furnished in an overcrowded way there were patterns on the wallpaper on the carpet on the tablecloth and curtains until the eye ached for a clean surface without a design and there were so many illmatched colors misused for decorative purposes that lambert shuddered to the core of his artistic soul when he beheld them to neutralize the glaring tints he pulled down the blinds of the two windows which looked on to a dull suburban roadway and thus shut out the weak sunshine then he threw himself into an uncomfortable armchair and sought solace in his briar root the future was dark the present was disagreeable and the past would not bear thinking about so intimately did it deal with the murder of pine the threats of silver and the misery occasioned by the sacrifice of agnes to the family fetish it was in the young mans mind to leave england forthwith and begin a new life unhampered by former troubles and present grievances but agnes required help and could not be left to struggle unaided so lambert silently vowed again as he had vowed before to stand by her to the end yet so far he was unable to see what the end would be while he thus contemplated the unpleasantness of life he became aware that the front door bell was ringing and he heard mrs tribb hurrying along the passage so thin were the walls and so near the door that he heard also the housekeepers effusive welcome which was cut short by a gasp of surprise lambert idly wondered what caused the little womans astonishment but speedily learned when agnes appeared in the room with rare discretion mrs tribb ushered in the visitor and then fled to the kitchen to wonder why the widow had discarded her mourning and him only planted six months as you might say murmured the puzzled woman whatever will master noel say to such goings on master noel said nothing because he was too astonished to speak and agnes seeing his surprise and guessing its cause waited somewhat defiantly for him to make an observation she was dressed in a gray silk frock with a hat and gloves and shoes to match and drew off a furlined cloak of marooncolored velvet when she entered the room her face was somewhat pale and her eyes looked unnaturally large but she had a resolute expression about her mouth which showed that she had made up her mind lambert swift from long association to read her moods wondered what conclusion she had arrived at and proceeded to inquire whatever is the meaning of this he demanded considerably startled this dress of course where is your widows cap and in the fire and there they can remain until they are burned to ashes lambert stared harder than ever what does it mean he asked again it means said agnes replying very directly that the victim is no longer decked out for the sacrifice it means that as hubert insulted me by his will i no longer intend to consider his memory but agnes you respected him you always said that you did quite so until his will was read then when i found that his mean jealousywhich was entirely unreasonablehad arranged to rob me of my income by preventing my marriage with you i ceased to have any regard for him hubert knew that i loved you and was content to take me on those terms so long as i was loyal to him i was loyal and did what i could to show him gratitude for the way in which he helped the family now his will has broken the bargain i respect him no longer and for that reason i refuse to pose any longer as a grieving widow i wonder with these thoughts that you posed at all said lambert gloomily and pushed forward a chair i could not make up my mind until lately what to do explained agnes sitting down gracefully and while i accepted his money it appeared to me that i ought to show his memory the outward respect of crape and all the rest of it now she leaned forward and spoke meaningly i am resolved to surrender the money that breaks the link between us the will the will she tapped an impatient foot on the carpet how could you expect any woman to put up with such an insult lambert dropped on the sofa and looked at her hard whats up he asked anxiously i never saw you like this before i was not free when you last saw me she replied dryly oh yes you were a widow i mean free in my own mind to marry you i am now i dont intend to consider the family or society or mr silvers threats or anything else i have shaken off my fetters i have discarded my ring she violently pulled off her glove to show that the circle of gold was absent i am free and i thank god that i am free agnes agnes i cant reduce you to poverty by marrying you it would not be honorable of me and would it be honorable on my part for me to keep the money of a man i despise because his will insults me she retorted we argued all this before yes we did and concluded to wait until we saw how the estates could be freed before we came to any conclusion and do you see now how the estates can be freed without using pines money agnes asked lambert anxiously no things are ever so much worse than i thought garvington can hold out for another year but at the end of twelve months the estates will be sold up by the person whose name is in the sealed envelope and he will be reduced to some hundreds a year the lamberts she waved her arm dramatically are ruined my dear entirely ruined and for the simple reason that you wish us to place love before duty agnes leaned forward and took his hand firmly noel you love me of course i do do you love the family name better in one way i wish to save it in another i am willing to let it go hang yes those were my views until three or four days ago and what caused you to change your mind dear a visit which clara greeby paid me oh lambert sat up very straight she hasnt been making mischief has she not at all on the contrary she has done both of us a great service lambert nodded thankfully he felt doubtful as to whether miss greeby really had meant to renounce her absurd passion for himself and it was a relief to find that she had been acting honestly has she then learned who killed pine he asked cautiously lady agnes suddenly rose and began to pace the room twisting her gloves and trying to control herself usually she was so composed that lambert wondered at this restlessness he wondered still more when she burst into violent tears and therefore hastened to draw her back to the chair when she was seated he knelt beside her and passed his arm round her neck as distressed as she was it was so unlike agnes to break down in this way and more unlike her to sob brokenly oh im afraidim afraid afraid of what darling im afraid to learn who killed my husband he might have done so and yet he only fired the first shot agnes lambert rose up suddenly are you talking of garvington yes she leaned back and dried her tears in spite of what he says i am afraid he may be guilty lamberts heart seemed to stand still you talk rubbish he cried angrily i wish it was oh how i wish it was rubbish but i cant be sure of course he may have meant what he says what does he say tell me everything oh heavens lambert clutched his smooth hair what does it all mean ruin to the lambert family i told you so you have only told me scraps so far i dont understand how you can arrive at the conclusion that garvington is guilty agnes dont go on crying in so unnecessary a way if things have to be faced surely we are strong enough to face them dont let our emotions make fools of us stop it stop it he said sharply and stamping dry your eyes and explain matters ii cant help my feelings faltered agnes beginning to respond to the spur and becoming calmer yes you can i dont offer you brandy or smelling salts or anything of the sort because i know you to be a woman with a firm mind exert your will and compel your nerves to be calm this exhibition is too cheap oh cried agnes indignantly and this feeling was the one lambert wished to arouse how can you talk so because i love you and respect you he retorted she knew that he meant what he said and that her firmness of mind and selfcontrol had always appealed to him therefore she made a great effort and subdued her unruly nerves lambert gave her no assistance and merely walked up and down the room while waiting for her to recover it was not easy for her to be herself immediately as she really was shaken and privately considered that he expected too much but pride came to her aid and she gradually became more composed meanwhile lambert pulled up the blind to display the ugly room in all its deformity and the sightas he guessed it wouldextorted an exclamation from her oh how can you live in this horrid place she asked irrelevantly necessity knows no law are you better yes i am all right but you are brutal noel i wouldnt have been brutal to a weaker woman he answered and by acting as i have done i show how much i think of you rather a strange way of showing approval but your drastic methods have triumphed i am quite composed and shall tell you of our disgrace in as unemotional a manner as if i were reckoning pounds shillings and pence disgrace lambert fastened on the one word anxiously to us to garvington in the first place but sit down and listen i shall tell you everything from the moment clara came to see me lambert nodded and resumed his seat agnes with wonderful coolness detailed miss greebys visit and production of the letter thence she passed on to explain how she had tricked garvington into confession but he did not confess interrupted lambert at this point not at the moment he did yesterday in a letter to me you see he left my house immediately and slept at his club then he went down to the manor and sent for jane who by the way knows nothing of what i have explained here are two letters added agnes taking an envelope out of her pocket one is the forged one and the other came from garvington yesterday even though he is not imitating my writing you can see every now and then the similarity perhaps there is a family resemblance in our caligraphy her cousin examined the two epistles with a rather scared look for there was no doubt that things looked black against the head of the family however he did not read garvingtons letter but asked agnes to explain what excuse does he make for forging your name asked lambert in a businesslike way for there was no need to rage over such a worm as freddy a very weak one she replied so weak that i scarcely believe him to be in earnest besides freddy always was a liar he declares that when he went to see about getting the gypsies turned off the land he caught sight of hubert he did not speak to him but learned the truth from mr silver whom he forced to speak then he wrote the letter and let it purposely fall into mr silvers hands and by mr silver it was passed on to hubert freddy writes that he only wanted to hurt hubert so that he might be laid up in bed at the manor when he was weakhubert i meanfreddy then intended to get all the money he could out of him he did not wish to kill pine then no and all the evidence goes to show that he only broke huberts arm that is true murmured lambert thoughtfully for the evidence of the other guests and of the servants showed plainly at the inquest that the second shot was fired outside while garvington was indoors agnes nodded yes it really seems as though freddy for once in his life is telling the exact truth her cousin glanced at garvingtons lengthy letter of explanation do you really believe that he hoped to manage pine during the illness well said agnes reluctantly freddy has tremendous faith in his powers of persuasion hubert would do nothing more for him since he was such a cormorant for money but if hubert had been laid up with a broken arm it is just possible that he might have been worried into doing what freddy wanted if only to get rid of his importunity hum it sounds weak garvington certainly winged pine so that seems to corroborate the statement in this letter hes such a good shot that he could easily have killed pine if he wanted to then you dont think that freddy is responsible for the death inquired agnes with a look of relief lambert appeared worried i think not dear he lured hubert into his own private trap so as to get him laid up and extort money unfortunately another person aware of the trap waited outside and killed your poor husband according to what freddy says mr silver knew of the trap since he delivered the letter to hubert and mr silver knew that freddy had threatened to shoot any possible burglar it seems to me ended agnes deliberately that mr silver is guilty but why should he shoot pine to whom he owed so much i cant say and remember silver was inside the house yes assented lady agnes in dismay that is true it is a great puzzle noel however i am not trying to solve it clara says that mr silver will hold his tongue and certainly as the letter is now in my possession he cannot bring forward any evidence to show that i am inculpated in the matter i think the best thing to do is to let freddy and mr silver fight out the matter between them while we are on our honeymoon lambert started agnes what do you mean she grew impatient oh what is the use of asking what i mean when you know quite well noel hubert insulted me in his will and cast a slur on my character by forbidding me to marry you freddyalthough he did not fire the second shotcertainly lured hubert to his death by forging that letter i dont intend to consider my husbands memory any more nor my brothers position i shall never speak to him again if i can help it as he is a wicked little animal i have sacrificed myself sufficiently and now i intend to take my own way let the millions go and let freddy be ruined if only to punish him for his wickedness but dear how can i ask you to share my poverty said lambert greatly distressed i have only five hundred a year and you have been accustomed to such luxury i have another five hundred a year of my own said agnes obstinately which hubert settled on me for pin money he refused to make any other settlements i have a right to that money since i sacrificed so much and i shall keep it surely we can live on one thousand a year in england inquired lambert doubtfully and after you have led such a luxurious life no she said quickly i mean in the colonies let us go to australia or canada or south africa i dont care which and cut ourselves off from the past we have suffered enough let us now think of ourselves but are we not selfish to let the family name be disgraced freddy is selfish and will disgrace it in any case said agnes with a contemptuous shrug whats the use of pulling him out of the mud when he will only sink back into it again no noel if you love me you will marry me within the week but its so sudden dear he urged more and more distressed take time to consider how can i rob you of millions you wont rob me if you refuse i shall make over the money to some charity and live on my five hundred a year remember noel what people think of me that i married hubert to get his money and to become your wife when he died so that we could live on his wealth we can only prove that belief to be false by surrendering the millions and marrying as paupers you may be right and yet and yet and yetoh she cried wounded you dont love me the man did not answer but stood looking at her with all his soul in his eyes and shaking from head to foot never before had she looked so desirable and never before had he felt the tides of love surge to so high a watermark love you he said in a hoarse voice agnes i would give my soul for you then give it she wreathed her arms round his neck and whispered with her warm lips close to his ear give me all of you but two millions you are worth it darling you will repent repent she pressed him closer to her repent that i exchange a lonely life for companionship with you oh my dear how can you think so i am sick of money and sick of loneliness i want you you you noel noel it is your part to woo and here am i making all the love it is such a serious step for you to take it is the only step that i can take i am known as a mercenary woman and until we marry and give up the money everybody will think scornfully of me besides freddy must be punished and in no other way can i make him suffer so much as by depriving him of the wealth he sinned to obtain yes there is that view certainly and lambert gasped i love youoh never doubt that my darling i shall she whispered ardently unless you get a special license and marry me straightaway but garvington and silver and clara greeby and chaldea who both love you she mocked let them all fight out their troubles alone i have had enough suffering so have you so theres no more to be said now sir she added playfully wilt thou take this woman to be thy wedded wife yes he said opening his arms and gathering agnes to his heart but what will people say of your marrying so soon after pines death let them say what they like and do what they like we are going to the colonies and will be beyond reach of slanderous tongues now let us have tea noel for i am hungry and thirsty and quite tired out with trying to convince you of my earnestness lambert rang for the tea shall we tell jarwin that we intend to marry no we shall tell no one until we are married she replied and kissed him once twice thrice and again until mrs tribb entered with the tray then they both sat demurely at the first of many meals which they hoped would be the start of a new darby and joan existence and the outcome of the interview and of the decision that was arrived at appeared in a letter to mr jarwin of chancery lane a week later he received a communication signed by agnes lambert in which she stated that on the preceding day she had married her cousin by special license mr jarwin had to read the epistle twice before he could grasp the astounding fact that the woman had paid two millions for a husband shes mad crazy silly insane murmured the lawyer then his eyes lighted up with curiosity now i shall know the name of the person in the sealed letter who inherits and he forthwith proceeded to his safe chapter xvii on the trail great was the excitement in society when it became knownthrough the medium of a newspaper paragraphthat lady agnes pine had surrendered two millions sterling to become mrs noel lambert some romantic people praised her as a noble woman who placed love above mere money while others loudly declared her to be a superlative fool but one and all agreed that she must have loved her cousin all the time and that clearly the marriage with the deceased millionaire had been forced on by garvington for family reasons connected with the poverty of the lamberts it was believed that the fat little egotist had obtained his price for selling his sister and that his estates had been freed from all claims through the generosity of pine of course this was not the case but the fact was unknown to the general public and garvington was credited with an income which he did not possess the man himself was furious at having been tricked he put it in this way quite oblivious to his own actions which had brought about such a result he could not plead ignorance on this score as agnes had written him a letter announcing her marriage and plainly stating her reasons for giving up her late husbands fortune she ironically advised him to seek out the person to whom the money would pass and to see if he could not plunder that individual garvington angry as he was took the advice seriously and sought out jarwin but that astute individual declined to satisfy his curiosity guessing what use he would make of the information in due time as the solicitor said the name of the lucky legatee would be made public and with this assurance garvington was obliged to be content meanwhile the happy pairand they truly were extremely happyheard nothing of the chatter and were indifferent to either praise or blame they were all in all to one another and lived in a kind of paradise on the south coast of devonshire on one of his sketching tours lambert had discovered a picturesque oldworld village tucked away in a fold of the moorlands and hither he brought his wife for the golden hours of the honeymoon they lived at the small inn and were attended to by a gigantic landlady who made them very comfortable mrs anak as noel called her took the young couple for poor but artistic people since agnes had dropped her title as unsuited to her now humble position and in the colonies she explained to her husband during a moorland ramble it would be absurd for me to be called my lady mrs noel lambert is good enough for me quite so dear if we ever do go to the colonies we must noel as we have so little to live on oh one thousand a year isnt so bad he answered goodhumoredly it may seem poverty to you who have been used to millions my darling but all my life i have been hard up and i am thankful for twenty pounds a week you speak as though i had been wealthy all my life noel but remember that i was as hard up as you before i married hubert poor soul then dear you must appreciate the fact that we can never starve besides i hope to make a name as a painter in the colonies why not art is to be found there as in england change of scene does not destroy any talent one may possess but i am not so sure darling if it is wise to leave englandat least until we learn who murdered pine oh my dear do let us leave that vexed question alone the truth will never become known it must become known agnes said lambert firmly remember that silver and chaldea practically accuse us of murdering your husband they know it is a lie and wont proceed further said agnes hopefully oh yes they will and miss greeby also clara why she is on our side indeed she is not your guess that she was still in love with me turns out to be quite correct i received a letter from her this morning which was forwarded from kensington she reproaches me with marrying you after the trouble she took in getting the forged letter back from silver but you told me that she said she would help you as a friend she did so in orderto use an expressive phraseto pull the wool over my eyes but she intendedand she puts her intention plainly in her letterto help me in order to secure my gratitude and then she counted upon my making her my wife agnes flushed i might have guessed that she would act in that way when you told me that she was helping i had a suspicion what she was aiming at what else does she say oh all manner of things more or less silly she hints that i have acted meanly in causing you to forfeit two millions and says that no man of honor would act in such a way i see said mrs lambert coolly she believed that my possession of the money would be even a greater barrier to our coming together than the fact of my being married to hubert well dear what does it matter a great deal agnes replied noel wrinkling his brows she intends to make mischief and she can with the aid of silver who is naturally furious at having lost his chance of blackmail then theres chaldea she can do nothing she can join forces with miss greeby and the secretary and they will do their best to get us into trouble to defend ourselves we should have to explain that garvington wrote the letter and then heaven only knows what disgrace would befall the name but you dont believe that freddy is guilty asked agnes anxiously oh no still he wrote that letter which lured pine to his death and if such a mean act became known he would be disgraced forever freddy has such criminal instincts said mrs lambert gloomily that i am quite sure he will sooner or later stand in the dock we must keep him out of it as long as we can said noel decisively for that reason i intend to leave you here and go to garvington to see freddy yes and to see chaldea and to call on silver who is living in my old cottage also i wish to have a conversation with miss greeby in some way my dear i must settle these people or they will make trouble have you noticed agnes what a number of gypsies seem to cross our path yes but there are many gypsies in devonshire no doubt but many gypsies do not come to this retired spot as a rule and yet they seem to swarm chaldea is having us watched for what reason agnes opened her astonished eyes i wish to learn chaldea is now a queen and evidently has sent instructions to her kinsfolk in this county to keep an eye on us agnes ruminated for a few minutes i met mother cockleshell yesterday she observed but i thought nothing of it as she belongs to devonshire i believe mother cockleshell is on our side dear since she is so grateful to you for looking after her when she was sick but kara has been hovering about and we know that he is chaldeas lover then said mrs lambert rising from the heather on which they had seated themselves it will be best to face mother cockleshell and kara in order to learn what all this spying means lambert approved of this suggestion and the two returned to mrs anaks abode to watch for the gypsies but although they saw two or three or even more during the next few days they did not set eyes on the servian dwarf or on gentilla stanley thensince it never rains but it poursthe two came together to the inn agnes saw them through the sittingroom window and walked out boldly to confront them noel was absent at the moment so she had to conduct the examination entirely alone gentilla why are you spying on me and my husband asked agnes abruptly the respectable woman dropped a curtsey and clutched the shoulder of kara who showed a disposition to run away im no spy my angel said the old creature with a cunning glint in her eyes its this one who keeps watch for what reason bless you my lady dont call me by my title ive dropped it only for a time my dear i have read your fortune in the stars my gorgio one and higher you will be with money and rank than ever you have been in past days but not with the childs approval the child what child chaldea no less shes raging mad as the golden rye has made you his romi my sweet one and she has set many besides kara to overlook you so mr lambert and i thought and chaldeas reason she would make trouble replied mother cockleshell mysteriously but kara does not wish her to love the golden ryeas she still doessince he would have the child to himself she turned and spoke rapidly in romany to the small man in the faded green coat kara listened with twinkling eyes and pulling at his heavy beard with one hand while he held the neck of his violin with the other when mother cockleshell ceased he poured out a flood of the kalo jib with much gesticulation and in a voice which boomed like a gong of course mrs lambert did not understand a word of his speech and looked inquiringly at gentilla kara says translated the woman hurriedly that he is your friend since he is glad you are the golden ryes romi ever since you left lundra the child has set him and others to spy on you she makes mischief does the child in her witchly way ask him said agnes indicating the dwarf if he knows who murdered my late husband gentilla asked the question and translated the reply he knows nothing but the child knows much i go back to the wood in hengishire my dear to bring about much that will astonish chaldeacurses on her evil heart tell the rye to meet me at his old cottage in a week then the wrong will be made right ended mother cockleshell speaking quite in the style of meg merrilees and very grandiloquently and happiness will be yours by this and this i bless you my precious lady making several mystical signs she turned away forcing the reluctant kara to follow her but gentilla agnes hurried in pursuit no no my gorgious it is not the time seven days and seven hours and seven minutes will hear the striking of the moment sarishan my deary mother cockleshell hobbled away with surprising alacrity and mrs lambert returned thoughtfully to the inn evidently the old woman knew of something which would solve the mystery else she would scarcely have asked noel to meet her in hengishire and being an enemy to chaldea who had deposed her agnes was quite sure that gentilla would work her hardest to thwart the younger gypsys plans it flashed across her mind that chaldea herself might have murdered pine but since his death would have removed the barrier between lambert and herself agnes could not believe that chaldea was guilty the affair seemed to become more involved every time it was looked into however mrs lambert related to her husband that same evening all that had taken place and duly delivered the old gypsys message noel listened quietly and nodded he made up his mind to keep the appointment in abbots wood the moment he received the intelligence and you can stay here agnes he said no no she pleaded i wish to be beside you there may be danger my dear chaldea will not stick at a trifle to revenge herself you know all the more reason that i should be with you insisted agnes besides these wretches are plotting against me as much as against you so it is only fair that i should be on the spot to defend myself you have a husband to defend you now agnes still as i know you will be anxious if i leave you in this outoftheway place it will be best for us both to go to london there is a telephone at wanbury and i can communicate with you at once should it be necessary of course it will be necessary said mrs lambert with fond impatience i shall worry dreadfully to think that you are in danger i dont wish to lose you now that we are together you can depend upon my keeping out of danger for your sake dear said the young man caressing her moreover mother cockleshell will look after me should chaldea try any of her romany tricks stay in town darling oh dear me that flat is so dingy and lonely and disagreeable you shant remain at the flat theres a very pleasant hotel near hyde park where we can put up its so expensive never mind the expense just now when everything is square we can consider economy but i shall not be easy in my mind until poor pines murderer is in custody i only hope garvington wont be found to be an accomplice said agnes with a shiver bad as he is i cant help remembering that he is my brother and the head of the lamberts added her husband gravely you may be sure that i shall try and save the name from disgrace its a dismal ending to our honeymoon let us look upon it as the last hedge of trouble which has to be jumped agnes laughed at this quaint way of putting things and cheered up for the next few days they did their best to enjoy to the full the golden hours of love and peace which remained and then departed to the unfeigned regret of mrs anak but present pleasure meant future trouble so the happy pairand they were happy in spite of the lowering cloudswere forced to leave their temporary paradise in order to baffle their enemies miss greeby chaldea silver and perhaps garvington were all arrayed against them so a conflict could not possibly be avoided agnes took up her abode in the private hotel near the park which lambert had referred to and was very comfortable although she did not enjoy that luxury with which pines care had formerly surrounded her having seen that she had all she required noel took the train to wanbury and thence drove in a hired fly to garvington where he put up at the village inn it was late at night when he arrived so it might have been expected that few would have noted his coming this was true but among the few was chaldea who still camped with her tribe in abbots wood whosoever now owned the property on mortgage evidently did not desire to send the gypsies packing and of course garvington not having the power could not do so thus it happened that while lambert was breakfasting next morning somewhere about ten oclock word was brought to him by the landlady that a gypsy wished to see him the young man at once thought that mother cockleshell had called to adjust the situation and gave orders that she should be admitted he was startled and illpleased when chaldea made her appearance she looked as handsome as ever but her face wore a sullen vicious look which augured ill for a peaceful interview so you cheated me after all rye was her greeting and her eyes sparkled with anger at the sight of the man she had lost dont be a fool girl said lambert purposely rough for her persistence irritated him you know that i never loved you am i so ugly then demanded the girl bitterly that remark is beside the point said the man coldly and i am not going to discuss such things with you but i should like to know why you set spies on me when i was in devonshire chaldeas eyes sparkled still more and she taunted him oh the clever one that you are to know that i had you watched aye and i did my rye from the time you left the cottage you were under the looks of my people why may i ask because i want revenge cried chaldea stepping forward and striking so hard a blow on the table that the dishes jumped you scorned me and now you shall pay for that scorn dont be melodramatic please what can you do to harm me i should like to know you silly creature i can prove that you murdered my brother hearne oh can you and in what way i have the bullet which killed him said the gypsy speaking very fast so as to prevent interruption kara knifed it out of the treetrunk which grows near the shrubbery if i take it to the police and it fits your pistol then where will you be my precious cheat lambert looked at her thoughtfully if she really did possess the bullet he would be able to learn if garvington had fired the second shot since it would fit the barrel of his revolver so far as he was concerned when coming to live in the abbots wood cottage he had left all his weapons stored in london and would be able to prove that such was the case he did not fear for himself as chaldeas malice could not hurt him in this way but he wondered if it would be wise to take her to the manor where garvington was in residence in order to test the fitting of the bullet finally he decided to risk doing so as in this way he might be able to force the girls hand and learn how much she really knew if aware that garvington was the culprit she would exhibit no surprise did the bullet fit the barrel of that gentlemans revolver and should it be proved that she knew the truth she would not dare to say anything to the police lest she should be brought into the matter as an accomplice after the fact chaldea misunderstood his silence while he was thinking in this way and smiled mockingly with a toss of her head ah the rye is afraid his sin has come home to him she sneered hai you are at my feet now my gorgious one i think not said lambert coolly and rose to put on his cap come with me chaldea we go to the manor and what would i do in the boro ryes ken my precious lambert ignored the question have you the bullet with you avali chaldea nodded it lies in my pocket then we shall see at the manor if it fits the pistol hai you have left the shooter at the big house said the girl falling into the trap and thereby provedto lambert at leastthat she was really in the dark as regards the true criminal lord garvington has a revolver of mine said the young man evasively although the remark was a true one since he had presented his cousin with a brace of revolvers some twelve months before chaldea looked at him doubtfully and if the bullet fits then you can do what you like retorted lambert tartly come on i cant wait here all day listening to the rubbish you talk the gypsy followed him sullenly enough being overborne by his peremptory manner and anxious if possible to bring home the crime to him what she could not understand for all her cleverness was why he should be so eager to condemn himself and so went to the manor on the lookout for treachery chaldea always judged other people by herself and looked upon treachery as quite necessary on certain occasions had she guessed the kind of trap which lambert was laying for her it is questionable if she would have fallen into it so easily and lambert even at this late hour could not be certain if she really regarded him as guilty or if she was only bluffing in order to gain her ends needless to say garvington did not welcome his cousin enthusiastically when he entered the library to find him waiting with chaldea beside him the fat little man rushed in like a whirlwind and ignoring his own shady behavior heaped reproaches on lamberts head i wonder you have the cheek to come here he raged you and this beast of a girl i want no gypsies in my house i can tell you and youve lost me a fortune by your selfish behavior i dont think we need talk of selfishness when you are present garvington why not by marrying agnes you have made her give up the money she wished to give it up to punish you said lambert rebukingly to punish me garvingtons gooseberry eyes nearly fell out of his head and what have i done lambert laughed and shrugged his shoulders in the face of this dense egotism it was impossible to argue in any way he dismissed the subject and got to business as he did not wish to remain longer in garvingtons society than was absolutely necessary this girl he said abruptly indicating chaldea who stood passively at his elbow has found the bullet with which pine was shot kara found it my boro rye put in the gypsy quickly and addressing lord garvington who gurgled out his surprises in the treetrunk ah yes interrupted the other the elm which is near the shrubbery then why didnt you give the bullet to the police do you ask that garvington inquired lambert meaningly and the little man whirled round to answer with an expression of innocent surprise of course i do he vociferated growing purple with resentment you dont accuse me of murdering the man who was so useful to me i hope i shall answer that very leading question when you bring out the revolver with which you shot pine on that night i only winged him cried garvington indignantly the second shot was fired by some unknown person as was proved clearly enough at the inquest all the same i wish you to produce the revolver why the host looked suspicious and even anxious it was chaldea who replied and when doing so she fished out the battered bullet to see if this fits the barrel of the pistol which the golden rye gave you my great one said she significantly garvington started his color changed and he stole a queer look at the impassive face of his cousin the pistol which the golden rye gave me he repeated slowly and weighing the words did you give me one noel i gave you a couple in a case answered lambert without mentioning the date of the present and if this bullet fits the one you used it will prove nothing interrupted the other hurriedly and with a restless movement i fired from the doorstep and my bullet after breaking pines arm must have vanished into the beyond the shot which killed him was fired from the shrubbery and it is quite easy to guess how it passed through him and buried itself in the tree which was in the line of fire i want to see the pistols said lambert insistently and this time chaldea looked at him wondering why he was so anxious to condemn himself oh very well snapped garvington with some reluctance and walked toward the door there he paused and evidently awaited to arrive at some conclusion the nature of which his cousin could not guess oh very well he said again and left the room he thinks that you are a fool as i do my gorgious said chaldea scornfully you wish to hang yourself it seems my rye oh i dont think that i shall be the one to be hanged tell me chaldea do you really believe that i am guilty yes said the girl positively and if you had married me i should have saved you lambert laughed but was saved the trouble of a reply by the return of garvington who trotted in to lay a mahogany case on the table opening this he took out a small revolver of beautiful workmanship chaldea desperately anxious to bring home the crime to lambert hastily snatched the weapon from the little mans hand and slipped the bullet into one of the chambers it fittedmaking allowance for its battered conditionprecisely she uttered a cry of triumph so you did shoot the romany my bold one was her victorious speech because the bullet fits the barrel of a revolver i gave to my cousin some twelve months ago he inquired smiling chaldeas face fell twelve months ago she echoed greatly disappointed yes as lord garvington can swear to so i could not have used the weapon on that night you see i used it admitted garvington readily enough and winged pine exactly but i gave you a brace of revolvers of the same make the bullet which would fit oneas it doeswould fit the other i see there is only one in the case where is the other garvingtons color changed and he shuffled with his feet i lent it to silver he said in a low voice and reluctantly was it in silvers possession on the night pine was shot must have been he borrowed it a week before because he feared burglars then said lambert coolly and drawing a breath of relief for the tension had been great the inference is obvious silver shot hubert pine chapter xviii an amazing accusation beng in tutes bukko swore chaldea in good romany meaning that she wished the devil was in some ones body and she heartily meant what she said and cared little which of the two mens interior was occupied by the enemy of mankind since she hated both the girl was disappointed to think that lambert should escape from her snare and enraged that garvingtons production of one revolver and his confession that silver had the other tended to this end may the pair of you burn in hell she cried taking to english so that they could understand the insult ashes may you be in the crooked ones furnace lambert shrugged his shoulders as he quite understood her feelings and did not intend to lower himself by correcting her he addressed himself to his cousin and turned his back on the gypsy silver shot hubert pine he repeated with his eyes on garvingtons craven face its impossibleimpossible returned the other hurriedly silver was shut up in the house with the rest i saw to the windows and doors myself along with the butler and footmen at the inquest never mind about the inquest i know what you said there and i am now beginning to see why you said it what the devil do you mean i mean stated the other staring hard at him that you knew silver was guilty when the inquest took place and screened him for some reason i didnt know i swear i didnt know stuttered garvington wiping his heated face and with his lower lip trembling you must have done so replied lambert relentlessly this bullet will fit both the revolvers i gave you and as you passed on one to silver rubbish bosh nonsense babbled the little man incoherently until you brought the bullet i never knew that it would fit the revolver this was true as lambert admitted however he saw that garvington was afraid for some reason and pressed his advantage now that you see how it fits you must be aware that it could only have been fired from the revolver which you gave silver i dont see that protested garvington that bullet may fit many revolvers lambert shook his head i dont think so i had that brace of revolvers especially manufactured and the make is peculiar i am quite prepared to swear that the bullet would fit no other weapon andandhe hesitated then faced the girl who lingered sullen and disappointed you can go chaldea said lambert pointing to the french window of the library which was wide open the gypsy sauntered toward it clutching her shawl and gritting her white teeth together oh i go my ways my rye but i have not done with you yet may the big devil rack my bones if i have you win todayi win tomorrow and so good day to you and curses on you for a bad one the devil is a nice characterand thats you she screamed beside herself with rage the puro beng is a fino mush if you will have the kalo jib and with a wild cry worthy of a banshee she disappeared and was seen running unsteadily across the lawn lambert shrugged his shoulders again and turned to his miserable cousin who had sat down with a dogged look on his fat face i have got rid of her because i wish to save the family name from disgrace said lambert quietly there is no disgrace on my part remember to whom you are speaking i do i speak to the head of the family worse luck you have done your best to trail our name in the mud you altered a check which pine gave you so as to get more money you forged his name to a mortgage lies lies the lies of agnes screamed garvington jumping up and shaking his fist in puny anger the wicked speak properly of my wife or ill wring your neck said lambert sharply as to what she told me being lies it is only too true as you know i read the letter you wrote confessing that you had lured pine here to be shot by telling falsehoods about agnes and me i only lured him to get his arm broken so that i might nurse him when he was ill and get some money growled garvington sitting down again i am well aware of what you did and how you did it but you gave that forged letter to silver so that it might be passed on to pine i didnt i didnt i didnt i didnt you did and because silver knew too much you gave him the abbots wood cottage at a cheap rent or at no rent at all for all i know to be quite plain garvington you conspired with silver to have pine killed wingedonly winged i tell you i never shot him your accomplice did hes not my accomplice he was in the houseeverything was locked up by you said lambert quickly so it was easy for you to leave a window unfastened so that silver might get outside to hide in the shrubbery oh garvington jumped up again looking both pale and wicked you want to put a rope round my neck curse you thats a melodramatic speech which is not true replied the other coldly for i want to save you or rather our name from disgrace i wont call in the policegarvington winced at this wordbecause i wish to hush the matter up but since chaldea and silver accuse me and accuse agnes of getting rid of pine so that we might marry it is necessary that i should learn the exact truth i dont know it i know nothing more than i have confessed you are such a liar that i cant believe you however i shall go at once to silver and you shall come with me i shant garvington who was overfed and flabby and unable to hold his own against a determined man settled himself in his chair and looked as obstinate as a battery mule oh yes you will you little swine said lambert freezingly cold how dare you call me names names if i called you those you deserved i should have to annex the vocabulary of a texan muledriver how such a beast as you ever got into our family i cant conceive i am the head of the family and i order you to leave the room oh you do do you very good then i go straight to wanbury and shall tell what i have discovered to inspector darby no no no no garvington cornered at last sprang from his chair and made for his cousin with unsteady legs it might be unpleasant i daresayto you well will you come with me to abbots wood yes whimpered garvington wait till i get my cap and stick curse you for an interfering beast you dont know what youre doing ah then you do know something likely to reveal the truth i donti swear i dont i only oh damn you get your cap and let us be off broke in lambert angrily for i cant be here all day listening to your lies garvington scowled and ambled out of the room closely followed by his cousin who did not think it wise to lose sight of so shifty a person in a few minutes they were out of the house and took the path leading from the blue door to the postern gate in the brick wall surrounding the park it was a frosty sunny day with a hard blue sky overarching a wintry landscape a slight fall of snow had powdered the ground with a film of white and the mens feet drummed loudly on the iron earth which was in the grip of the frost garvington complained of the cold although he had on a fur overcoat which made him look like a baby bear youll give me my death of cold dragging me out like this he moaned as he trotted beside his cousin i believe you want me to take pneumonia so that i may die and leave you the title i should at least respect it more than you do said lambert with scorn why cant you be a man instead of a thing on two legs if you did die no one would miss you but cooks and provision dealers garvington gave him a vicious glance from his little pigs eyes and longed to be tall and strong and daring so that he might knock him down but he knew that lambert was muscular and dexterous and would probably break his neck if it came to a tussle therefore as the stout little lord had a great regard for his neck he judged it best to yield to superior force and trotted along obediently enough also he became aware within himself that it would be necessary to explain to silver how he had come to betray him and that would not be easy silver would be certain to make himself extremely disagreeable altogether the walk was not a pleasant one for the sybarite the abbots wood looked bare and lean with the leaves stripped from its many trees occasionally there was a fir clothed in dark green foliage but for the most part the branches of the trees were naked and quivered constantly in the chilly breeze even on the outskirts of the wood one could see right into the centre where the black monolithsthey looked black against the snowreared themselves grimly to the right there was a glimpse of gypsy fires and tents and caravans and the sound of the romany tongue was borne toward them through the clear atmosphere on such a day it was easy both to see and hear for long distances and for this reason chaldea became aware that the two men were walking toward the cottage the girl desperately angry that she had been unable to bring lambert to book had sauntered back to the camp but had just reached it when she caught sight of the tall figure and the short one in a moment she knew that lambert and his cousin were making for silvers abode which was just what she had expected them to do at once she determined to again adopt her former tactics which had been successful in enabling her to overhear the conversation between lambert and lady agnes and following at a respectful distance she waited for her chance it came when the pair entered the cottage for then chaldea ran swiftly in a circle toward the monoliths and crouched down behind one while peering from behind this shelter she saw silver pass the window of the studio and felt certain that the interview would take place in that room like a serpent as she was the girl crawled and wriggled through the frozen vegetation and finally managed to get under the window without being observed the window was closed but by pressing her ear close to the woodwork she was enabled to hear a great deal if not all candidly speaking chaldea had truly believed that lambert had shot pine but now that he had disproved the charge so easily she became desperately anxious to learn the truth lambert had escaped her but she thought that it might be possible to implicate his wife in the crime which would serve her purpose of injuring him just as well silver was not surprised to see his landlord as it seemed that garvington paid him frequent visits but he certainly showed an uneasy amazement when lambert stalked in behind the fat little man silver was also small and also cowardly and also not quite at rest in his conscience so he shivered when he met the very direct gaze of his unwelcome visitor you have come to look at your old house mr lambert he remarked when the two made themselves comfortable by the studio fire not at all i have come to see you was the grim response that is an unexpected honor said silver uneasily and his eyes sought those of lord garvington who was spreading out his hands to the blaze looking blue with cold he caught silvers inquiring look i couldnt help it said garvington crossly i must look after myself silvers smooth foxy face became livid and he could scarcely speak when he did it was with a sickly smile whatever are you talking about my lord oh you know d you i did give you that revolver you know the revolver silver stared yes why should i deny it i suppose you have come to get it back i have come to get it mr silver put in lambert politely hand it over to me if you please if you like it certainly has your name on the handle said the secretary so quietly that the other man was puzzled silver did not seem to be so uncomfortable as he might have been the revolver was one of a pair which i had especially made when i went to africa some years ago explained lambert elaborately and determined to make his listener understand the situation thoroughly on my return i made them a present to my cousin i understand mr silver that lord garvington lent you one and kept the other interrupted the man sharply that is true i was afraid of burglars since lord garvington was always talking about them so i asked him to lend me a weapon to defend myself with and you used it to shoot pine snapped garvington anxious to end his suspense and get the interview over as speedily as possible silver rose from his seat in an automatic manner and turned delicately pale are you mad he gasped looking from one man to the other its all very well you talking whimpered garvington with a shiver but pine was shot with that revolver i lent you its a lie oh i knew youd say that complained garvington shivering again but i warned you that there might be trouble since you carried that letter for me so that it might fall by chance into pines hands augh groaned silver sinking back into his chair and passing his tongue over a pair of dry gray lips hold your tongue my lord whats the use he knows and garvington jerked his head in the direction of his cousin the games up silverthe games up oh silvers eyes flashed and he looked like a rat at bay so you intend to save yourself at my expense but it wont do my lord you wrote that letter if i carried it to the camp i have admitted to my sister and to lambert here that i wrote the letter silver i had to or get into trouble with the police since neither of them will listen to reason but you suggested the plan to get pine winged so that he might be ill in my house and then we could both get money out of him you invented the plot and i only wrote the letter augh augh gulped silver unable to speak plainly do you confess the truth of lord garvingtons statement inquired lambert suavely and fixing a merciless eye on the trapped fox nothat isyes he swings on the same hook as i do indeed then lord garvington was aware that you shot pine i was not i was not screamed the head of the lambert family jumping up and clenching his hands i swear i never knew the truth until you brought the bullet to the library to fit the revolver thethebullet stammered silver whose smooth red hair was almost standing on end from sheer fright yes said lambert addressing him sharply kara under the direction of chaldea found the bullet in the trunk of the elm tree which was in the line of fire she came with me to the manor this morning and we found that it fitted the barrel of lord garvingtons revolver at the inquest and on unimpeachable evidence it was proved that he fired only the first shot which disabled pine without killing him the second shot which pierced the mans heart could only have come from the second revolver which was and is in your possession mr silver the bullet found in the tree trunk will fit no other barrel of no other weapon im prepared to swear to this silver covered his face with his hands and looked so deadly white that lambert believed he would faint however he pulled himself together and addressed garvington anxiously you know my lord that you locked up the house on that night and that i was indoors yes admitted the other hesitating so far as i knew you certainly were inside it is true noel he added catching his cousins eye even to save myself i must admit that oh youd admit anything to save yourself retorted his cousin contemptuously and noting the mistake in the wording of the sentence but admitting that silver was within doors doesnt save you so far as i can see there is no need for lord garvington to excuse himself spoke up silver attempting to enlist the little man on his side by defending him it was proved at the inquest as you have admitted mr lambert that he only fired the first shot and you fired the second i never did i was inside and in bed i only came down with the rest of the guests when i heard the firing is that not so my lord yes admitted garvington grudgingly so far as i know you had nothing to do with the second shot silver turned a relieved face toward lambert i shall confess this much sir he said trying to speak calmly and judicially pine treated me badly by taking my toy inventions and by giving me very little money when i was staying at the manor i learned that lord garvington had also been treated badly by pine he said if we could get money that we should go shares i knew that pine was jealous of his wife and that you were at the cottage here so i suggested that as lord garvington could imitate handwriting he should forge a letter purporting to come from lady agnes to you saying that she intended to elope on a certain night also i told lord garvington to talk a great deal about shooting burglars so as to give color to his shooting pine it was arranged to shoot him then no it wasnt cried garvington glaring at silver all we wanted to do was to break pines arm or leg so that he might be laid up in the manor yes that is so said silver feverishly and nodding i fanciedand for this reason i suggested the plotthat when pine was ill both lord garvington and myself could deal with him in an easier manner alsosince the business would be left in my handsi hoped to take out some money from various investments and share it with lord garvington we never meant that pine should be killed but only reduced to weakness so that we might force him to give us both money a very ingenious plot said lambert grimly and wondering how much of the story was true and then then lord garvington wrote the letter and when seeing pine i gave it to him saying that while keeping watch on his wifeas he asked me to said silver with an emphasis which made lambert wince i had intercepted the letter pine was furious as i knew he would be and said that he would come to the blue door at the appointed time to prevent the supposed elopement i told lord garvington who was ready and and i went down pretending that pine was a burglar said lord garvington continuing the story in a most shameless manner i opened the door quite expecting to find him there he rushed me believing in his blind haste that i was agnes coming to elope with you i shot him in the arm and he staggered away while i shut the door again whether on finding his mistake and knowing that he had met me instead of agnes he intended to go away i cant say as i was on the wrong side of the door but agnes attracted to the window by the shot declaredand you heard her declare it at the inquest noelthat pine walked rapidly away and was shot just as he came abreast of the shrubbery thats all and quite enough too said lambert savagely you tricky pair of beasts i suppose you hoped to implicate me in the crime it wasnt a crime protested silver but only a way to get money by going up to london you certainly delayed what we intended to do since we could not carry out our plan until you returned you did for one night as chaldea who was on the watch for you told us and then we acted did chaldea know of the trap no she knew nothing save that iit was silver who spokewanted to know about your return she found the letter in pines tent and really believed that lady agnes had written it and that you had shot pine it was to force you by threats to marry her that she gave the letter to me and she instructed you to show it to the police said lambert between his teeth whereas you tried to blackmail lady agnes i had to make my money somehow said silver insolently pine was dead and lady agnes had the coin you were to share in the twentyfive thousand pounds i suppose lambert asked his cousin indignantly no silver blackmailed on his own i hoped to get money from agnes in another wayas her hardup brother that is and if oh shut up you make me sick interrupted lambert suppressing a strong desire to choke his cousin you are as bad as silver and silver is as innocent as lord garvington struck in that gentleman whose face was recovering its natural color lambert turned on him sharply i dont agree with that you shot pine silver sprang up with a hysterical cry he had judged like agag that the bitterness of death was past but found that he was not yet safe i did not shoot pine he declared wringing his hands oh why cant you believe me because garvington gave you the second revolver and with thaton the evidence of the bulletpine was murdered that might be so butbut silver hesitated and shivered and looked round with a hunted expression in his eyes but what you may as well explain to me i shanti refuse to i am innocent you cant hurt me lambert brushed aside this puny rage inspector darby can i shall go to wanbury this evening and tell him all no dont do that cried garvington greatly agitated think of methink of the family i think of justice you two beasts arent fit to be at large im off and he made for the door in a moment silver was clutching his coat no dont he screamed i am innocent lord garvington say that i am innocent oh you get out of the hole as best you can im in as big a mess as you are unless lambert acts decently decently you wicked little devil said lambert scornfully i only propose to do what any decent man would do you trapped pine by means of the letter and silver shot him i didnt i didnt you had the revolver i hadnt i gave it away i lent it panted silver crying with terror you lent ityou gave ityou liar who to silver looked round again for some way of escape but could see none to miss greeby sheshesheshe shot pine i swear she did chapter xix mother cockleshell it was late in the afternoon when lambert got back to the village inn and he felt both tired and bewildered the examination of silver had been so long and what he revealed so amazing that the young man wished to be alone both to rest and to think over the situation it was a very perplexing one as he plainly saw since in the light of the new revelations it seemed almost impossible to preserve the name of the family from disgrace seated in his sitting room with his legs stretched out and his hands in his pockets lambert moodily glared at the carpet recalling all that had been confessed by the foxy secretary of miss greeby that he should accuse her of committing the crime seemed unreasonable according to silver the woman had overheard by chance the scheme to lure pine to the manor knowing that the millionaire was coming to abbots wood the secretary had propounded the plan to garvington long before the mans arrival hence the constant talk of the host about burglars and his somewhat unnecessary threat to shoot any one who tried to break into the house the persistence of this remark had roused miss greebys curiosity and noting that silver and his host were frequently in one anothers company she had seized her opportunity to listen for some time so cautious were the plotters she had heard nothing particular but after her recognition of hearne as pine when she visited the gypsy camp she became aware that these secret talks were connected with his presence then a chance remark of garvingtonshe was always loosetonguedgave her the clue and by threats of exposure she managed to make silver confess the whole plot far from thwarting it she agreed to let them carry it out and promised secrecy only extracting a promise that she should be advised of the time and place for the trapping of the millionaire and it was this acquiescence of miss greebys which puzzled lambert on the face of it since she was in love with him it was better for her own private plans that pine should remain alive because the marriage placed agnes beyond his reach why then should miss greeby have removed the barrierand at the cost of being hanged for murder lambert had asked silver this question but had obtained no definite answer since the secretary protested that she had not explained her reasons jokingly referring to possible burglars she had borrowed the revolver from silver which he had obtained from garvington and it was this action which first led the little secretary to suspect her afterward knowing that she had met pine in abbots wood he kept a close watch on her every action to see if she intended to take a hand in the game but silver protested that he could see no reason for her doing so and even up to the moment when he confessed to lambert could not conjecture why she had acted in such a manner however it appeared that she was duly informed of the hour when pine would probably arrive to prevent the pretended elopement and also learned that he would be hanging about the blue door when silver retired for the night he watched the door of her bedroomwhich was in the same wing of the mansion of his own also he occasionally looked out to see if pine had arrived as the window of his room afforded a fair view of the blue door and the shrubbery for over an houras he told lamberthe divided his attention between the passage and the window it was while looking out of the last and after midnight that he saw miss greeby climb out of her room and descend to the ground by means of the ivy which formed a natural ladder her window was no great height from the ground and she was an athletic woman much given to exercise wondering what she intended to do yet afraidbecause of pines expected arrivalto leave the house silver watched her cautiously she was arrayed in a long black cloak with a hood he said but in the brilliant moonlight he could easily distinguish her gigantic form as she slipped into the shrubbery when pine arrived silver saw him dash at the blue door when it was opened by garvington and saw him fall back after the first shot then he heard the shutting of the door immediately afterward the opening of lady agness window and noted that pine ran quickly and unsteadily down the path as he passed the shrubbery the second shot cameat this point silver simply gave the same description as lady agnes did at the inquestand then pine fell afterward garvington and his guests came out and gathered round the body but miss greeby slipping along the rear of the shrubbery doubled back to the shadow at the corner of the house silver having to play his part did not wait to see her reenter the mansion but presumed she did so by clambering up the ivy he ran down and mingled with the guests and servants who were clustered round the dead man and finally found miss greeby at his elbow artlessly inquiring what had happened for the time being he accepted her innocent attitude later on when dismissed by jarwin and in want of funds he sought out miss greeby and accused her at first she denied the story but finally as she judged that he could bring home the crime to her she compromised with him by giving him the post of her secretary at a good salary when he obtained the forged letter from chaldeaand she learned this from lambert when he was illmiss greeby made him give it to her alleging that by showing it to agnes she could the more positively part the widow from her lover miss greeby knowing who had written the letter counted upon agnes guessing the truth and had she not seen that it had entered her mind when the letter was brought to her she would have given a hint as to the forgers name but agness hesitation and sudden paleness assured miss greeby that she guessed the truth so the letter was left to work its poison silver of course clamored for his blackmail but miss greeby promised to recompense him and also threatened if he did not hold his tongue that she would accuse him and garvington of the murder since the latter had forged the letter and the former had borrowed the revolver which had killed pine it would have been tolerably easy for miss greeby to substantiate her accusation as to her share in the crime all she had to do was to deny that silver had passed the borrowed revolver on to her and there was no way in which he could prove that he had done so on the whole silver had judged it best to fall in with miss greebys plans and preserve silence especially as she was rich and could supply him with whatever money he chose to ask for she was in his power and he was in her power so it was necessary to act on the golden rule of give and take and the final statement which silver made to lambert intimated that garvington was ignorant of the truth until the bullet was produced in the library to fit the revolver it had never struck garvington that the other weapon had been used to kill pine and he had honestly believed that silveras was actually the casehad remained in his bedroom all the time until he came downstairs to play his part as to miss greeby being concerned in the matter such an idea had never entered garvingtons head the little mans hesitation in producing the revolver when he got an inkling of the truth was due to his dread that if silver was accused of the murderand at the time it seemed as though the secretary was guiltyhe might turn kings evidence to save his neck and explain the very shady plot in which garvington had been engaged but lambert had forced his cousins hand and silver had been brought to book with the result that the young man now sat in his room at the inn quite convinced that miss greeby was guilty yet wondering what motive had led her to act in such a murderous way also lambert wondered what was best to be done in order to save the family name if he went to the police and had miss greeby arrested the truth of garvingtons shady dealings would certainly come to light especially as silver was an accessory after the fact on the other hand if he left things as they were there was always a chance that hints might be thrown out by chaldeawho had everything to gain and nothing to losethat he and agnes were responsible for the death of pine of course lambert not knowing that chaldea had been listening to the conversation in the cottage believed that the girl was ignorant of the true state of affairs and he wondered how he could inform her that the actual criminal was known without risking her malignity he wanted to clear his character and that of his wife likewise he wished to save the family name but it seemed to him that the issue of these things lay in the hands of chaldea and she was bent upon injuring him if she could it was all very perplexing it was at this point of his meditation that mother cockleshell arrived at the inn he heard her jovial voice outside and judged from its tone that the old dame was in excellent spirits her visit seemed to be a hint from heaven as to what he should do gentilla hated chaldea and loved agnes so lambert felt that she would be able to help him as soon as possible he had her brought into the sitting room and having made her sit down closed both the door and the window preparatory to telling her all that he had learned the conversation was indeed an important one and he was anxious that it should take place without witnesses you are kind sir said mother cockleshell who had been supplied with a glass of gin and water but it aint for the likes of me to be sitting down with the likes of you nonsense we must have a long talk and i cant expect you to stand all the timeat your age some gentiles aint so anxious to save the legs of old ones remarked gentilla stanley cheerfully but i always did say as you were a golden one for kindness of heart well them as does whats unexpected gets what they dont hope for i have got my hearts desire mother said lambert sitting down and lighting his pipe i am happy now not as happy as youd like to be sir said the old woman speaking quite in the gentile manner and looking like a decent charwoman youve a dear wife as i dont deny mr lambert but money is what you want i have enough for my needs not for her needs sir she should be wrapped in cloth of gold and have a path of flowers to tread upon its a path of thorns just now muttered lambert moodily not for long sir not for long i come to put the crooked straight and to raise a lamp to banish the dark very good this white satin is said mother cockleshell irrelevantly and alluding to the gin and terbaccer goes well with it as theres no denying you wouldnt mind my taking a whiff sir would you and she produced a blackened clay pipe which had seen much service smoking is good for the nerves mr lambert the young man handed her his pouch fill up he said smiling at the idea of his smoking in company with an old gypsy hag bless you my precious said mother cockleshell accepting the offer with avidity and talking more in the romany manner i allers did say as you were what i said before you were and thats golden my gorgious one ahime she blew a wreath of blue smoke from her withered lips thats food to me my dearie and heat to my old bones lambert nodded you hinted in devonshire that you had something to say and a few moments ago you talked about putting the crooked straight and dont the crooked need that same chuckled gentilla nodding theres trouble at hand my gentleman the childs brewing witchs broth for sure chaldea lambert sat up anxiously he mistrusted the younger gypsy greatly and was eager to know what she was now doing aye aye aye mother cockleshell nodded three times like a veritable macbeth witch she came tearing rampagiouslike to the camp an hour or so back and put on her fine clothesmay they cleave with pain to her skinto go to the big city it is true rye kara ran by the side of the donkey she rode uponmay she have an accidentto wanbury to wanbury lambert looked startled as it crossed his mind and not unnaturally that chaldea might have gone to inform inspector darby about the conversation with garvington in the library to wanbury first sir and then to lundra how can you be certain of that the child treated me like the devils calls her said gentilla stanley shaking her head angrily and i have no trust in her for a witchly wrong un she is when she goes donkeywise to wanbury i says to a chal says i quicklike follow and watch her games so the chal runs secret behind hedges and comes on the child at the railway line making for lundra and off she goes on wheels in place of tramping the droms in true romany style what the deuce has she gone to london for lambert asked himself in a low voice but gentillas sharp ears overheard mischief for sure my gentleman hai but shes a bad one that same but she plays and i play with the winning for mesince the good cards are always in the old hand fear nothing my rye she cannot hurt though snake that she is her bite stings the young man did not reply he was uneasy in one way and relieved in another chaldea certainly had not gone to see inspector darby so she could not have any intention of bringing the police into the matter but why had she gone to london he asked himself this question and finally put it to the old woman who watched him with bright twinkling eyes shes gone for mischief answered gentilla nodding positively for mischiefs as natural to her as cheating is to a romany chal but im a dealer of cards myself rye and i deal myself the best hand i wish youd leave metaphor and come to plain speaking cried lambert in an irritable tone for the conversation was getting on his nerves by reason of its prolixity and indirectness mother cockleshell laughed and nodded then emptied the ashes out of her pipe and spoke out irrelevantly as it would seem the child has taken the hearts of the young from me said she shaking her grizzled head but the old cling to the old with them as trusts my wisdom my rye i goes across the black water to america and leaves the silly ones to the child shell get them into choky and trouble for sure and thats a true dukkerin have you the money to go to america money the old woman chuckled and hugged herself and why not sir when ishmael hearne was my child aye the child of my child for i am the bebee of hearne bebee being grandmother in our romany tongue sir lambert started from his seat almost too astonished to speak do you mean to say that you are pines grandmother pine who is pine a gentile i know not hearne he was born and hearne he shall be to me though the grass is now a quilt for him ohone hai mai ah me woe and woe my gentleman he was the child of my child and the love of my heart she rocked herself to and fro sorrowfully like a leaf has he fallen from the tree like the dew has he vanished into the blackness of the great shadow hai mai hai mai the sadness of it hearne your grandson murmured lambert staring at her and scarcely able to believe her true yes it is true said gentilla still rocking he left the road and the tent and the merry fire under a hedge for your gentile life but a born romany he was and no gorgio ahrrr she shook herself with disgust why did he labor for gold in the gentile manner when he could have chored and cheated like a truehearted black one her allusions to money suddenly enlightened the young man yours is the name mentioned in the sealed letter held by jarwin he cried with genuine amazement written largely on his face you inherit the millions mother cockleshell wiped her eyes with a corner of her shawl and chuckled complacently it is so young man therefore can i take those who hold to my wisdom to the great land beyond the water ah i am rich now sir and as a gorgious one could i live beneath a rooftree but for why i asks you my golden rye when i was bred to the open and the sky in a tent i was born in a tent i shall die should i go gentile its longing for the free life id be since romany i am and ever shall be as we says in our tongue my dear its allers the boro matcho that petalay dree the panni though true gypsy lingo you cant call it for sure what does it mean demanded lambert staring at the dingy possessor of two millions sterling its allers the largest fish that falls back into the water translated mrs stanley i told that to leland the boro rye and he goes and puts the same into a book for your readings my dearie then she uttered a howl and flung up her arms but what matter i am rich when my childs childs blood calls out for vengeance id give all the red goldand red money it is my loved one she added fixing a bright pair of eyes on lambert if i could find him as shot the darling of my heart knowing that he could trust her and pitying her obvious sorrow lambert had no hesitation in revealing the truth so far as he knew it it wasnt a him who shot your grandson but a her hai gentilla flung up her arms again then i was right my old eyes did see like a cat in the dark though brightly shone the moon when he fell what you know lambert started back again at this second surprise if its a gentile lady i know a red one large as a cow in the meadows and fierce as an unbroken colt miss greeby greeby greeby so your romi told me shrieked the old woman throwing up her hands in ecstasy says i to her whos the foxy one and says she smiling like greebys her name why did you ask my wife that demanded lambert much astonished hai she was no wife of yours then sir why did i ask her because i saw the shooting of pineof hearneof your son of who else of who else cried mother cockleshell clapping her skinny hand and paddling on the floor with her feet says ishmael to me bebee says he my romi is false and would run away with the golden rye this very night as ever was and says i to him its not so son of my son for your romi is as true as the stars and purer than gold but says he theres a letter he says and shows it to me lies son of my son says i and calls on him to play the trustful rom but he pitches down the letter and says he i go this night to stop them from paddling the hoof and says i to him no no says i shes a true one but he goes when all in the camp are sleeping deathlike and i watches and i follers and i hides where did you hide never mind dearie i hides securely and sees him walking up and down biting the lips of him and swinging his arms then i seesfor oliver was bright and olivers the moon loveythe big gentile woman come round and hide in the bushes says i to myself says i and whats your game i says not knowing the same till she shoots and my childs child falls dead as a hedgehog then she runs and i run and all is over why didnt you denounce her gentilla and for why my precious heart who would believe the old gypsy rather would the poknees say as id killed my dear one no no artful am i and patient in abiding my time but the hour strikes as i said when i spoke to your romi in devonshire no less and the foxy moll shall hang you see my dear i waited for some gentile to speak what i could speak to say as what i saw was truth for sure you speak and now i can tell my tale to the big policeman at wanbury so that my sons son may sleep quiet knowing that the evil has come home to her as laid him low but lovey oh lovey and my precious one cried the old woman darting forward to caress lamberts hand in a fondling way tell me how you know and what you learned at the cottage you were and maybe out in the open watching the winder of her you loved no said lambert sharply i was at the cottage certainly but in bed and asleep i did not hear of the crime until i was in london in this way i found out the truth mother and he related rapidly all that had been discovered bringing the narrative right up to the confession of silver which he detailed at length the old woman kept her sharp eyes on his expressive face and hugged his hand every now and then as various points in the narrative struck her at the end she dropped his hand and returned back to her chair chuckling its a sad dukkerin for the foxy lady said gentilla grinning like the witch she was hanged she will be and rightful it is to be so i agree with you replied lambert relentlessly your evidence and that of silver can hang her certainly yet if she is arrested and the whole tale comes out in the newspapers think of the disgrace to my family mother cockleshell nodded thats as true as true my golden rye she said pondering and i wish not to hurt you and the rani who was kind to me i go away she rose to her feet briskly and i think what will you do i cant say said lambert doubtfully and irresolutely i must consult my wife miss greeby should certainly suffer for her crime and yet aye aye aye the boro rye she meant garvington is a bad one for sure as we know shame to him is shame to you and i wouldnt have the rani miserablethe good kind one that she is wait aye wait my precious gentleman and we shall see you will say nothing in the meantime said lambert stopping her at the door and anxious to know exactly what were her intentions i have waited long for vengeance and i can wait longer sir said mother cockleshell becoming less the gypsy and more the respectable almshouse widow depend upon my keeping quiet until until what until when never you mind said the woman mysteriously them as sins must suffer for the sin but not you and her as is innocent no violence gentilla said the young man alarmed less the lawless gypsy nature should punish miss greeby privately i swear there shall be no violence rye wait for the child is making mischief and until we knows of her doings we must be silent give me your gripper my dearie she seized his wrist and bent back the palm of the hand to trace the lines with a dirty finger good fortune comes to you and to her my golden rye she droned in true gypsy fashion money and peace and honor and many children to carry on a stainless name your son shall you see and your sons son my noble gentleman and with your romi shall you go with happiness to the grave she dropped the hand so be it for a true dukkerin and remember gentilla stanley when the luck comes true but mother mother said lambert following her to the door as he was still doubtful as to her intentions concerning miss greeby the gypsy waved him aside solemnly never again will you see me my golden rye if the stars speak truly and if there be virtue in the lines of the hand i came into your life i go out of your life and what is written shall be she made a mystic sign close to his face and then nodded cheerily duveleste rye was her final greeting and she disappeared swiftly but the young man did not know that the romany farewell meant god bless you chapter xx the destined end as might have been anticipated lord garvington was in anything but a happy frame of mind he left silver in almost a fainting condition and returned to the manor feeling very sick himself the two cowardly little men had not the necessary pluck of conspirators and now that there seemed to be a very good chance that their nefarious doings would be made public they were both in deadly fear of the consequences silver was in the worst plight since he was well aware that the law would consider him to be an accessory after the fact and that although his neck was not in danger his liberty assuredly was he was so stunned by the storm which had broken so unexpectedly over his head that he had not even the sense to run away all manly gritwhat he possessed of ithad been knocked out of him and he could only whimper over the fire while waiting for lambert to act garvington was not quite so downhearted as he knew that his cousin was anxious to consider the fair fame of the family thinking thus he felt a trifle reassured for the forged letter could not be made public without a slur being cast on the name then again garvington knew that he was innocent of designing pines death and that even if lambert did inform the police he could not be arrested it is only just to say that had the little man known of miss greebys intention to murder the millionaire he would never have written the letter which lured the man to his doom and for two reasons in the first place he was too cowardly to risk his neck and in the second pine was of more value to him alive than dead comforting himself with this reflection he managed to maintain a fairly calm demeanor before his wife but on this night lady garvington was particularly exasperating for she constantly asked questions which the husband did not feel inclined to answer having heard that lambert was in the village she wished to know why he had not been asked to stay at the manor and defended the young man when garvington pointed out that an iniquitous person who had robbed agnes of two millions could not be tolerated by the mangarvington meant himselfhe had wronged then jane inquired why lambert had brought chaldea to the house and what had passed in the library but received no answer save a growl finally she insisted that freddy had lost his appetite which was perfectly true and i thought you liked that way of dressing a fish so much dear was her wail i never seem to quite hit your taste oh bother leave me alone jane im worried i know you are for you have eaten so little what is the matter everythings the matter confound your inquisitiveness hasnt agnes lost all her money because of this selfish marriage with noel hang him how the dickens do you expect us to carry on unless we borrow cant you get some money from the person who now inherits jarwin wont tell me the name but i know who it is said lady garvington triumphantly one of the servants who went to the gypsy camp this afternoon told my maid and my maid told me the gypsies are greatly excited and no wonder freddy stared at her excited what about why about the money dear dont you know no i dont shouted freddy breaking a glass in his irritation what is it bother you jane dont keep me hanging on in suspense im sure i never do freddy dear its huberts money which has gone to his mother garvington jumped up whowhowho is his mother he demanded furiously that dear old gentilla stanley what what what oh freddy said his wife plaintively you make my head ache yes its quite true celestine had it from william the footman fancy gentilla having all that money how lucky she is oh damn her damn her growled garvington breaking another glass why dear im sure shes going to make good use of the money she saysso william told celestinethat she would give a million to learn for certain who murdered poor hubert would she would she would she garvingtons gooseberry eyes nearly dropped out of his head and he babbled and burbled and choked and spluttered until his wife was quite alarmed freddy you always eat too fast go and lie down dear yes said garvington rapidly making up his mind to adopt a certain course about which he wished his wife to know nothing ill lie down jane and dont take any more wine warned jane as she drifted out of the diningroom you are quite red as it is dear but freddy did not take this advice but drank glass after glass until he became potvaliant he needed courage as he intended to go all by himself to the lonely abbots wood cottage and interview silver it occurred to freddy that if he could induce the secretary to give up miss greeby to justice mother cockleshell out of gratitude might surrender to him the sum of one million pounds of course the old hag might have been talking all round the shop and her offer might be bluff but it was worth taking into consideration garvington thinking that there was no time to lose since his cousin might be beforehand in denouncing the guilty woman hurried on his fur overcoat and after leaving a lying statement with the butler that he had gone to bed he went out by the useful blue door in a few minutes he was trotting along the wellknown path making up his mind what to say to silver the interview did not promise to be an easy one i wish i could do without him thought the treacherous little scoundrel as he left his own property and struck across the waste ground beyond the park wall but i cant dash it all since hes the only person who saw the crime actually committed course hell get jailed as an accessoryafterthefact but when he comes out ill give him a thousand or so if the old woman parts at all events ill see what silver is prepared to do and then ill call on old cockleshell and make things right with her hang it freddy had a qualmish feeling the exposure wont be pleasant for me over that unlucky letter but if i can snaffle a million its worth it curse the honor of the family ive got to look after myself somehow ho ho he chuckled as he remembered his cousin what a sell for noel when he finds that ive taken the wind out of his sails serve him jolly well right in this way garvington kept up his spirits during the walk and felt entirely cheerful and virtuous by the time he reached the cottage in the thin cold moonlight the wintry wood looked spectral and wan the sight of the frowning monoliths the gaunt frozen trees and the snowpowdered earth made the luxurious little man shiver also the anticipated conversation rather daunted him although he decided that after all silver was but a feeble creature who could be easily managed what freddy forgot was that he lacked pluck himself and that silver driven into a corner might fight with the courage of despair the sight of the secretarys deadly white and terrified face as he opened the door sufficient to peer out showed that he was at bay if you come in ill shoot he quavered brokenly illill brain you with the poker ill throw hot water on you andand scratch out youryour come come said garvington boldly its only mea friend silver recognized the voice and the dumpy figure of his visitor at once he dragged him into the passage and barred the door quickly breathing hard meanwhile i dont mind you he giggled hysterically youre in the same boat with me my lord but i fancied when you knocked that the policethe policehis voice died weakly in his throat he cast a wild glance around and touched his neck uneasily as though he already felt the hangmans rope encircling it garvington did not approve of this grim pantomime and swore im quite alone damn you he said roughly its all right so far he sat down and loosened his overcoat for the place was like a turkish bath for heat i want a drink youve been priming yourself i see and he pointed to a decanter of port wine and a bottle of brandy which were on the table along with a tray of glasses silly ass you are to mix imimkeeping up mymy spirits giggled silver wholly unnerved and pouring out the brandy with a shaking hand there you are my lord theres water but no soda keeping up your spirits by pouring spirits down said garvington venturing on a weak joke youre in a state of siege too silver certainly was he had bolted the shutters and had piled furniture against the two windows of the room on the table beside the decanter and bottles of brandy lay a poker a heavy club which lambert had brought from africa and had left behind when he gave up the cottage a revolver loaded in all six chambers and a large bread knife apparently the man was in a dangerous state of despair and was ready to give the officers of the law a hostile welcome when they came to arrest him he touched the various weapons feverishly ill give them beans he said looking fearfully from right to left every door is locked every window is bolted ive heaped up chairs and sofas and tables and chests of drawers and wardrobes and mattresses against every opening to keep the devils out and the lampslook at the lamps ugh he shuddered i cant bear to be in the dark plenty of light observed garvington and spoke truly for there must have been at least six lamps in the roomtwo on the table two on the mantelpiece and a couple on the sideboard and amidst his primitive defences sat silver quailing and quivering at every sound occasionally pouring brandy down his throat to keep up his courage the white looks of the man the disorder of the room the glare of the many lights and the real danger of the situation communicated their thrill to garvington he shivered and looked into shadowy corners as silver did then strove to reassure both himself and his companion dont worry so he said sipping his brandy to keep him up to concert pitch ive got an idea which will be good for both of us what is it questioned the secretary cautiously he naturally did not trust the man who had betrayed him do you know who has inherited pines money no the person named in the sealed envelope exactly and the person is mother cockleshell silver was so amazed that he forgot his fright what is gentilla stanley related to pine shes his grandmother it seems one of my servants was at the camp today and found the gypsies greatly excited over the old cats windfall whew silver whistled and drew a deep breath if id known that id have got round the old woman but its too late now since all the fat is on the fire mr lambert knows too much and you have confessed what should have been kept quiet i had to save my own skin said garvington sullenly after all i had nothing to do with the murder i never guessed that you were so mixed up in it until lambert brought that bullet to fit the revolver i lent you and which i gave to miss greeby snapped silver tartly she is the criminal not me what a wax she will be in when she learns the truth i expect your cousin will have her arrested i dont think so he has some silly idea in his head about the honor of our name and wont press matters unless he is forced to who can force him asked silver looking more at ease since he saw a gleam of hope chaldea shes death on making trouble cant we silence her remember you swing on my hook no i dont contradicted garvington sharply i cant be arrested for forging that letter you can not at all i did not write it to lure pine to his death but only wished to maim him that will get you into trouble insisted silver anxious to have a companion in misery it wont i tell you theres no one to prosecute you are the person who is in danger as you knew miss greeby to be guilty and are therefore an accessory after the fact if mr lambert has the honor of your family at heart he will do nothing said the secretary hopefully for if miss greeby is arrested along with me the writing of that letter is bound to come out i dont care its worth a million what is worth a million the exposure see here silver i hear that mother cockleshell is willing to hand over that sum to the person who finds the murderer of her grandson we know that miss greeby is guilty so why not give her up and earn the money the secretary rose in quivering alarm but id be arrested also you said so you know you said so and i say so again remarked garvington leaning back coolly youd not be hanged you know although she would a few years in prison would be your little lot and when you came out i could give you sayererten thousand pounds there thats a splendid offer where would you get the ten thousand tell me asked silver with a curious look from the million mother cockleshell would hand over to me for denouncing me for denouncing miss greeby you beast shrieked silver hysterically you know quite well that if she is taken by the police i have no chance of escaping id run away now if i had the cash but i havent i count on your cousin keeping quiet because of your family name and you shant give the show away but think said garvington persuasively a whole million for you and only ten thousand for me oh i like that well ill make it twenty thousand no no thirty thousand no no no forty fifty sixty seventyoh hang it you greedy beast ill give you one hundred thousand youd be rich for life then would i curse you silver clenched his fists and backed against the wall looking decidedly dangerous and risk a lifelong sentence to get the money while you take the lions share youd only get ten years at most argued the visitor annoyed by what he considered to be silly objections ten years are ten centuries at my time of life you shant denounce me garvington rose yes i shall he declared rendered desperate by the dread lest he should lose the million im going to wanbury tonight to tell inspector darby and get a warrant for miss greebys arrest along with yours as her accomplice silver flung himself forward and gripped garvingtons coat you darent yes i dare i cant be hurt i didnt murder the man and im not going to lose a pile of money for your silly scruples oh my lord consider silver in a panic dropped on his knees i shall be shut up for years it will kill me it will kill me and you dont know what a terrible and clever woman miss greeby is she may deny that i gave her the revolver and i cant prove that i did then i might be accused of the crime and hanged hanged cried the poor wretch miserably oh youll never give me away my lord will you confound you dont i risk my reputation to get the money raged garvington shaking off the trembling arms which were round his knees the truth of the letter will have to come out and then im dished so far as society is concerned i wouldnt do ittell that isbut that the stakes are so large one million is waiting to be picked up and im going to pick it up no no no no silver grovelled on the floor and embraced garvingtons feet but the more he wailed the more insulting and determined did the visitor become like all tyrants and bullies garvington gained strength and courage from the increased feebleness of his victim dont give me up wept the secretary nearly beside himself with terror dont give me up oh damn you get out of the way said garvington and made for the door i go straight to wanbury which statement was a lie as he first intended to see mother cockleshell at the camp and make certain that the reward was safe but silver believed him and was goaded to frenzy you shant go he screamed leaping to his feet and before garvington knew where he was the secretary had the heavy poker in his grasp the little fat lord gave a cry of terror and dodged the first blow which merely fell on his shoulder but the second alighted on his head and with a moan he dropped to the ground silver flung away the poker are you dead are you dead he gasped kneeling beside garvington and placed his hand on the senseless mans heart it still beat feebly so he arose with a sigh of relief hes only stunned panted silver and staggered unsteadily to the table to seize a glass of brandy ill ahahah he shrieked and dropped the tumbler as a loud and continuous knocking came to the front door naturally in his state of panic he believed that the police had actually arrived and here he had struck down lord garvington even though the little man was not dead silver knew that the assault would add to his punishment although he might have concluded that the lesser crime was swallowed up in the greater but he was too terrified to think of doing anything save hiding the stunned man and with a gigantic effort he managed to fling the body behind the sofa then he piled up rugs and cushions between the wall and the back of the sofa until garvington was quite hidden and ran a considerable risk of being suffocated all the time the ominous knocking continued as though the gallows was being constructed at least it seemed so to silvers disturbed fancy and he crept along to the door holding the revolver in an unsteady grip whowhois let me in let me in said a loud hard voice im miss greeby i have come to save you let me in silver had no hesitation in obeying since she was in as much danger as he was and could not hurt him without hurting herself with trembling fingers he unbolted the door and opened it to find her tall and stately and tremendously impatient on the threshold she stepped in and banged the door to without locking it silvers teeth chattered so much and his limbs trembled so greatly that he could scarcely move or speak on seeing thisfor there was a lamp in the passagemiss greeby picked him up in her big arms like a baby and made for the sittingroom when within she pitched silver on to the sofa behind which garvington lay senseless and placing her arms akimbo surveyed him viciously you infernal worm said miss greeby grim and savage in her looks you have split on me have you howhowhow do you know quavered silver mechanically noting that in her long driving coat with a mans cap she looked more masculine than ever how do i know because chaldea was hiding under the studio window this afternoon and overheard all that passed between you and garvington and that meddlesome lambert she knew that i was in danger and came at once to london to tell me since i had given her my address i lost no time but motored down here and dropped her at the camp now ive come to get you out of the country me out of the country stammered the secretary yes you cowardly swine although id rather choke the life out of you if it could be done with safety you denounced me you beast i had to my own neck was in danger its in danger now id strangle you for two pins but i intend to send you abroad since your evidence is dangerous to me if you are out of the way theres no one else can state that i shot pine heres twenty pounds in gold she thrust a canvas bag into the mans shaking hands get on your coat and cap and ill take you to the nearest seaport wherever that is my motor is on the verge of the wood you must get on board some ship and sail for the worlds end ill send you more money when you write come come she stamped sharps the word butbutbut miss greeby lifted him off the sofa by the scruff of the neck do you want to be killed she said between her teeth theres no time to be lost chaldea tells me that lambert threatens to have me arrested the prospect of safety and prosperity in a distant land so appealed to silver that he regained his courage in a wonderfully short space of time rising to his feet he hastily drained another glass of brandy and the color came back to his wan cheeks but for all the quantity he had drank that same evening he was not in the least intoxicated he was about to rush out of the room to get his coat and cap when miss greeby laid a heavy hand on his shoulder is there any one else in the house she asked suspiciously silver cast a glance towards the sofa theres no servant he said in a stronger voice i have been cooking and looking after myself since i came here butbutbut but what you hound she shook him fiercely garvingtons behind the sofa garvington miss greeby was on the spot in a moment pulling away the concealing rugs and cushions have you murdered him she demanded drawing a deep breath and looking at the senseless man no hes only stunned i struck him with the poker because he wanted to denounce me quite right miss greeby patted the head of her accomplice as if he were a child youre bolder than i thought go on hurry up before garvington recovers his senses well be far enough away denounce me denounce him will you she said looking at garvington while the secretary slipped out of the room you do so at your own cost my lord that forged letter wont tell in your favor ha she started to her feet whats that whos here she might well ask there was a struggle going on in the passage and she heard cries for help miss greeby flung open the sittingroom door and silver embracing mother cockleshell tumbled at her feet she got in by the door you left open cried silver breathlessly hold her or we are lost well never get away no you wont shouted the dishevelled old woman producing a knife to keep miss greeby at bay chaldea came to the camp and i learned through kara how shed brought you down my gentile lady i went to tell the golden rye and hes on the way here with the village policeman youre done for not yet miss greeby darted under the uplifted knife and caught gentilla round the waist the next moment the old woman was flung against the wall breathless and broken up but she still contrived to hurl curses at the murderess of her grandson i saw you shoot him i saw you shoot him screamed mother cockleshell trying to rise silver make for the motor its near the camp follow the path ordered miss greeby breathlessly theres no time to be lost as to this old devil she snatched up a lamp as the secretary dashed out of the house and flung it fairly at gentilla stanley in a moment the old woman was yelling with agony and scrambled to her feet a pillar of fire miss greeby laughed in a taunting manner and hurled another lamp behind the sofa youd have given me up also would you garvington she cried in her deep tone take that and that and that lamp after lamp was smashed and burst into flames until only one was left then miss greeby seeing with satisfaction that the entire room was on fire and hearing the sound of hasty footsteps and the echoing of distant voices rushed in her turn from the cottage as she bolted the voice of garvington screaming with pain and dread was heard as he came to his senses to find himself encircled by fire and mother cockleshell also shrieked not so much because of her agony as to stop miss greeby from escaping rye rye shes running catch her catch her ahaahaaha and she sank into the now blazing furnace of the room the walls of the cottage were of mud the partitions and roof of wood and thatch so the whole place soon burned like a bonfire miss greeby shot out of the door and strode at a quick pace across the glade but as she passed beyond the monoliths lambert in company with a policeman made a sudden appearance and blocked her way of escape with a grim determination to thwart him she kilted up her skirts and leaped like a kangaroo towards the undergrowth beneath the leafless trees by this time the flames were shooting through the thatched roof in long scarlet streamers and illuminated the spectral wood with awful light stop stop cried lambert racing to cut off the womans retreat closely followed by the constable miss greeby laughed scornfully and instead of avoiding them as they crossed her path she darted straight towards the pair in a moment by a dexterous touch of her shoulders right and left she knocked them over by taking them unawares and then sprang down the path which curved towards the gypsies encampment at its end the motor was waiting and so vivid was the light that she saw silvers black figure bending down as he frantically strove to start the machine she travelled at top speed fearful lest the man should escape without her then came an onrush of romany attracted to the glade by the fire they guessed from miss greebys haste that something was seriously wrong and tried to stop her but delivering blows straight from the shoulder here there and everywhere the woman managed to break through and finally reached the end of the pathway here was the motor and safety since she hoped to make a dash for the nearest seaport and get out of the kingdom before the police authorities could act but the stars in their course fought against her silver having started the machinery was already handling the steering gear and bent only upon saving his own miserable self had put the car in motion he could only drive in a slipslop amateur way and aimlessly zigzagged down the sloping bank which fell away to the high road as the motor began to gather speed miss greeby ran for her life and liberty ranging at length breathlessly alongside the gypsies tailed behind shouting stop you beast screamed miss greeby feeling fear for the first time and she tried to grab the car for the purpose of swinging herself on board but silver urged it to greater speed i save myself myself he shrieked shrilly and unhinged by deadly terror get away get away in his panic he twisted the wheel in the wrong direction and the big machine swerved obediently the next moment miss greeby was knocked down and writhed under the wheels she uttered a tragic cry but little silver cared for that rendered merciless with fear he sent the car right over her body and then drove desperately down the hill to gain the hard road miss greeby with a broken back lay on the ground and saw as in a ghastly dream her machine flash roaring along the highway driven by a man who could not manage it even in her pain a smile crept over her pale face hes done for the little beast she muttered hell smash lambert lambert the man whose name she breathed had arrived as she spoke and knelt breathlessly beside her to raise her head youyouoh poor creature he gasped im done for lambert she panted in deadly pain back broken i sinned for you butbut you cant hang me looklook after garvingtoncockleshell toolooklookaugh and she moaned where are they ininthecottage murmured the woman and fell back in a fainting condition with a wouldbe sneering laugh lambert started to his feet with an oath and leaving the wretched woman to the care of some gypsies ran back to the glade the cottage was a mass of streaming crackling flames and there was no water to extinguish these as he realized with sudden fear it was terrible to think that the old woman and garvington were burning in that furnace and desperately anxious to save at least one of the two lambert tried to enter the door but the heat of the fire drove him back and the flames seemed to roar at his discomfiture he could do nothing but stand helplessly and gaze upon what was plainly garvingtons funeral pyre by this time the villagers were making for the wood and the whole place rang with cries of excitement and dismay the wintry scene was revealed only too clearly by the ruddy glare and by the same sinister light lambert suddenly beheld chaldea at his elbow gripping his arm she spoke hoarsely the tiny rye is dead he drove the engine over a bank and it smashed him to a pulp oh ah andand miss greeby she is dying lambert clenched his hands and groaned garvington and mother cockleshell she is dead and he is dead by now said chaldea looking with a callous smile at the burning cottage both are deadlord garvington lord garvington lambert groaned again he had forgotten that he now possessed the title and what remained of the family estates avali cried chaldea clapping her hands and nodding toward the cottage with a meaning smile theres the bonfire to celebrate the luck chapter xxi a final surprise a week later and lambert was seated in the library of the manor looking worn and anxious his wan appearance was not due so much to what he had passed through trying as late events had been as to his dread of what inspector darby was about to say that officer was beside him getting ready for an immediate conversation by turning over various papers which he produced from a large and wellfilled pocketbook darby looked complacent and important as an examination into the late tragedy had added greatly to his reputation as a zealous officer things were now more shipshape as miss greeby had died after making confession of her crime and had been duly buried by her shocked relatives the ashes of lord garvington and mother cockleshell recovered from the debris of the cottage had also been disposed of with religious ceremonies and silvers broken body had been placed in an unwept grave the frightful catastrophe which had resulted in the death of four people had been the talk of the united kingdom for the entire seven days what lambert was dreading to hear was the report of miss greebys confession which inspector darby had come to talk about he had tried to see her himself at the village inn whither she had been transferred to die but she had refused to let him come to her dying bed and therefore he did not know in what state of mind she had passed away judging from the vindictive spirit which she had displayed lambert fancied that she had told darby the whole wretched story of the forged letter and the murder the last was bound to be confessed but the young man had hoped against hope that miss greeby would be silent regarding garvingtons share in the shameful plot wickedly as his cousin had behaved lambert did not wish his memory to be smirched and the family honor to be tarnished by a revelation of the little mans true character he heartily wished that the evil garvington had done might be buried with him and the whole sordid affair forgotten first my lord said darby leisurely when his papers were in order i have to congratulate your lordship on your accession to the title hitherto so busy have i been that there has been no time to do this thank you mr inspector but i regret that i should have succeeded through so tragic a death yes yes my lord the feeling does you honor darby nodded sympathetically but it must be some comfort for you to know that your poor cousin perished when on an errand of mercy although his aim was not perhaps quite in accordance with strict justice lambert stared i dont know what you mean he remarked being puzzled by this coupling of garvingtons name with any good deed of course you dont my lord but for you to understand i had better begin with miss greebys confession i must touch on some rather intimate things however said the inspector rather shyly meaning that miss greeby was in love with me exactly my lord her love for youif you will excuse my mentioning so private a subjectcaused the whole catastrophe indeed the young man felt a sense of relief as if darby put the matter in this way the truth about the forged letter could scarcely have come to light will you explain certainly my lord miss greeby always wished to marry your lordship but she knew that you loved your wife the present lady garvington who was then lady agnes pine she believed that you and lady agnes would sooner or later run away together there was no reason she should think so said noel becoming scarlet of course not my lord pardon me again for speaking of such very private matters but i can scarcely make your lordship understand how the late sir hubert pine came by his death unless i am painfully frank go on mr inspector noel leaned back and folded his arms be frank to the verge of rudeness if you like oh no no my lord certainly not darby said in a shocked manner i will be as delicate as i possibly can well then my lord miss greeby thinking that you might elope with the then lady agnes pine resolved to place an even greater barrier between you than the marriage what could be a possibly greater barrier your honor my lord your strict sense of honor miss greeby thought that if she got rid of sir hubert and lady agnes was in possession of the millions that you would never risk her losing the same for your sake she was right in supposing that mr inspector but how did miss greeby know that lady agnes would lose the money if she married me sir hubert told her so himself my lord when she discovered that he was at the abbots wood camp under the name of ishmael hearne his real name of course my lord of course and having made this discovery and knowing how jealous sir hubert was of his wifeif you will pardon my mentioning the factmiss greeby laid a trap to lure him to the manor that he might be shot the listener moved uneasily and he now quite expected to hear the revelation of garvingtons forgery go on mr inspector miss greeby pursued the officer glancing at his notes knew that the late mark silver who was sir huberts secretary was not well disposed toward his employer as he fancied that he had been cheated out of the proceeds of certain inventions miss greeby worked on this point and induced silver to forge a letter purporting to come from lady agnes to you saying that an elopement had been arranged oh lambert drew a breath of relief so silver laid a trap did he yes my lord and a very clever one the letter was arranged by silver to fall into sir huberts hands that unfortunate gentleman came to the blue door at the appointed time then miss greeby who had climbed out of the window of her bedroom to hide in the shrubbery shot the unsuspecting man she then got back into her roomand a very clever climber she must have been my lordand afterward mingled with the guests but why did she think of luring sir hubert to be shot asked noel with feigned ignorance when she ran such a risk of being discovered ah my lord therein lies the cleverness of the idea poor lord garvington had threatened to shoot any burglar and that gave miss greeby the idea it was her hope that your late cousin might kill sir hubert by mistaking him for a robber and she only posted herself in the shrubbery to shoot if sir hubert was not killed he was not as we know that the shot fired by lord garvington only broke his arm miss greeby made sure by killing him herself and very cleverly she did so and what about my late cousins philanthropic visit to silver ah my lord that was a mistake his lordship was informed of the forged letter by chaldea the gypsy girl who found it in sir huberts tent and for the sake of your family wished to get silver out of the country it would have been dreadfulas lord garvington rightly consideredthat the name of his sister and your name should be mentioned in connection with an elopement even though it was untrue he therefore went to induce silver to leave the country but the man instead of being grateful stunned his lordship with a blow from a poker which he had picked up how was that known mr inspector miss greeby had the truth from his own lips silver threatened to denounce her and knowing this chaldea went to london to warn her oh muttered lambert thinking of what gentilla stanley had said how did she find out she overheard a conversation between silver and lord garvington in the cottage lambert was relieved again since miss greeby had not evidently mentioned him as being mixed up with the matter yes mr inspector i can guess the rest this unfortunate woman came down to get silver who could have hanged her out of the country and he set fire to the cottage she set fire to it corrected darby quickly by chance as she told me she overturned a lamp of course lord garvington being senseless was burned to death gentilla stanley was also burned how did she come to be there oh it seems that gentilla followed hearnehe was her grandson i hear from the gypsiesto the manor on that night and saw the shooting but she said nothing not feeling sure if her unsupported testimony would be sufficient to convict miss greeby however she watched that lady and followed her to the cottage to denounce her and prevent the escape of silverwho knew the truth also as she ascertained silver knocked the old woman down and stunned her so she also was burned to death then silver ran for the motor car and crushed miss greebysince he could not manage the machine did he crush her on purpose do you think no said darby after a pause i dont think so miss greeby was rich and if the pair of them had escaped silver would have been able to extort money he no more killed her than he killed himself by dashing into that chalk pit near the road it was mismanagement of the motor in both cases lambert was quiet for a time is that all he asked looking up all my lord answered the inspector gathering his papers together is anything else likely to appear in the papers no my lord i noted said lambert slowly that there was no mention of the forged letter made at the inquest darby nodded i arranged that my lord since the forged letter made so free with your lordships name and that of the present lady garvington as you probably saw it was only stated that the late sir hubert had gone to meet his secretary at the manor and that miss greeby knowing of his coming had shot him the motive was ascribed as anger at the late sir hubert for having lost a great sum of money which miss greeby entrusted to him for the purpose of speculation and is it true that such money was entrusted and lost perfectly true my lord i saw in that fact a chance of hiding the real truth it would do no good to make the forged letter public and would cast discredit both on the dead and the living therefore all that has been said does not even hint at the trap laid by silver now that all parties concerned are dead and buried no more will be heard of the matter and your lordship can sleep in peace the young man walked up and down the room for a few minutes while the inspector made ready to depart noel was deeply touched by the mans consideration and made up his mind that he should not lose by the delicacy he had shown in preserving his name and that of agnes from the tongue of gossips he saw plainly that darby was a man he could thoroughly trust and forthwith did so mr inspector he said coming forward to shake hands you have acted in a most kind and generous manner and i cannot show my appreciation of your behavior more than by telling you the exact truth of this sad affair i know the truth said darby staring not the exact truth which closely concerns the honor of my family but as you have saved that by suppressing certain evidence it is only right that you should know more than you do know i shall keep quiet anything that you tell me my lord said darby greatly pleased that is anything that is consistent with my official duty of course also i wish you to know exactly how matters stand since there may be trouble with chaldea oh i dont think so my lord chaldea has married that dwarf kara the servian gypsy yes shes given him a bad time and he put up with it because he had no authority over her but now that shes his romias these people call a wifehell make her dance to his playing they left england yesterday for foreign partshungary i fancy my lord the girl wont come back in a hurry for kara will keep an eye on her lambert drew a long breath of relief i am glad he said simply as i never should have felt safe while she remained in england felt safe echoed the officer suspiciously his host nodded and told the man to take a seat again then without wasting further time he related the real truth about the forged letter darby listened to the recital in amazement and shook his head sadly over the delinquency of the late lord garvington well well said the inspector staring to think as a nobleman born and bred should act in this way why shouldnt a nobleman be wicked as well as the grocer said lambert impatiently and according to the socialistic press all the evil of humanity is to be found in aristocratic circles however you know the exact truth mr inspector and i have confided to you the secret which concerns the honor of my family you wont abuse my confidence darby rose and extended his hand you may be sure of that my lord what you have told me will never be repeated everything in connection with this matter is finished and you will hear no more about it im glad and thankful said the other again drawing a breath of relief and to show my appreciation of your services darby i shall send you a substantial check oh my lord i couldnt take it i only did my duty i think you did a great deal more than that answered the new lord garvington dryly and had you acted entirely on the evidence you gathered together and especially on the confession of that miserable woman you might have made public much that i would prefer to keep private take the money from a friend darby and as a mark of esteem for a man thank you my lord replied the inspector straightly i dont deny but what my conscience and my duty to the government will allow me to take it since you put it in that way and as i am not a rich man the money will be welcome thank you with a warm handshake the inspector took his departure and noel offered up a silent prayer of thankfulness to god that things had turned out so admirably his shifty cousin was now dead and there was no longer any danger that the honor of the family for which so much had been sacrificed both by himself and agnes would be smirched the young man regretted the death of mother cockleshell who had been so well disposed toward his wife and himself but he rejoiced that chaldea had left england under the guardianship of kara as henceforthif he knew anything of the dwarfs jealous dispositionthe girl would trouble him no more and silver was dead and buried which did away with any possible trouble coming from that quarter finally poor miss greeby who had sinned for love was out of the way and there was no need to be anxious on her account fate had made a clean sweep of all the actors in the tragedy and lambert hoped that this particular play was ended when the inspector went away lord garvington sought out his wife and his late cousins widow to them he reported all that had passed and gave them the joyful assurance that nothing more would be heard in connection with the late tragic events both ladies were delighted poor freddy sighed agnes who had quite forgiven her brother now that he had paid for his sins he behaved very badly all the same he had his good points noel ah he had he had said lady garvington the widow shaking her untidy head he was selfish and greedy and perhaps not so thoughtful as he might have been but there are worse people than poor freddy noel could not help smiling at this somewhat guarded eulogy of the dead but did not pursue the subject well jane you must not grieve too much no i shall not she admitted bluntly i am going to be quiet for a few months and then perhaps i may marry again but i shall marry a man who lives on nuts and roots my dear noel never again she shuddered shall i bother about the kitchen i shall burn freddys recipes and cookery books lady garvington evidently really felt relieved by the death of her greedy little husband although she tried her best to appear sorry but the twinkle of relief in her eyes betrayed her and neither noel nor agnes could blame her she had enough to live onsince the new lord had arranged this in a most generous mannerand she was free from the cares of the kitchen so ill go to london in a few days when ive packed up said the widow nodding you two dears can stay here for your second honeymoon it will be concerned with pounds shillings and pence then said agnes with a smile for noel has to get the estate put in order things are very bad just now as i know for certain but we must try to save the manor from going out of the family it was at this moment and while the trio wondered how the financial condition of the lamberts was to be improved that a message came saying that mr jarwin wished to see lord and lady garvington in the library wondering what the lawyer had come about and dreading further bad news the young couple descended leaving the widow to her packing up they found the lean dry solicitor waiting for them with a smiling face oh said agnes as she greeted him then its not bad news on the contrary said jarwin with his cough it is the best of news noel looked at him hard the best of news to me at the present moment would be information about money he said slowly i have a title it is true but the estate is much encumbered you need not trouble about that lord garvington mrs stanley has put all that right what asked agnes greatly agitated has she made over the mortgages to noel oh if she only has she has done better than that remarked jarwin producing a paper of no great size this is her will she wanted to make a deed of gift and probably would have done so had she lived but luckily she made the willand a hardandfast one it isfor i drew it up myself said mr jarwin complacently how does the will concern us asked agnes catching noels hand with a tremor for she could scarcely grasp the hints of the lawyer mrs stanley my dear lady had a great regard for you since you nursed her through a dangerous illness also you were as she put it a good and true wife to her grandson therefore as she approved of you and of your second marriage she has left the entire fortune of your late husband to you and to lord garvington here never cried lambert growing pale while his wife gasped with astonishment it is true and here is the proof jarwin shook the parchment one million to you lord garvington and one million to your wife listen if you please and the solicitor read the document in a formal manner which left no doubt as to the truth of his amazing news when he finished the lucky couple looked at one another scarcely able to speak it was agnes who recovered her voice first oh it cant be trueit cant be true she cried noel pinch me for i must be dreaming it is true as the will gives you to understand said the lawyer smiling in his dry way and if i may be permitted to say so lady garvington never was money more rightfully inherited you surrendered everything for the sake of true love and it is only just that you should be rewarded if mrs stanley had lived she intended to keep five or six thousand for herself so that she could transport certain gypsies to america but she would undoubtedly have made a deed of gift of the rest of the property oh what a very fortunate thing it was that she made this will cried jarwin genuinely moved at the thought of the possible loss of the millions for her unforeseen death would have spoiled everything if i had not the forethought to suggest the testament it is to you we owe our good fortune to mrs gentilla stanleyand to me partially i only ask for my reward that you will continue to allow me to see after the property the fees added jarwin with his dry cough will be considerable you can rob us if you like said noel slapping him on the back well to say that i am glad is to speak weakly i am overjoyed with this money we can restore the fortunes of the family again they will be placed higher than they have ever been before cried agnes with a shining face two millions oh what a lot of good we can do to yourselves inquired jarwin dryly and to others also said lambert gravely god has been so good to us that we must be good to others then be good to me lord garvington said the solicitor putting away the will in his bag for i am dying of hunger a little luncheon a very big one i am no great eater said jarwin and walked toward the door a wash and brushup and a plate of soup will satisfy me and i will say again what i said before to both of you that you thoroughly deserve your good fortune lord garvington you are the luckier of the two as you have a wife who is far above rubies andanddear me i am talking romance so foolish at my age to thinkwellwell i am extremely hungry so dont let luncheon be long before it appears and with a croaking laugh at his jokes the lawyer disappeared left alone the fortunate couple fell into one anothers arms it seemed incredible that the past storm should have been succeeded by so wonderful a calm they had been tested by adversity and they had proved themselves to be of sterling metal before them the future stretched in a long smooth road under sunny blue skies and behind them the black clouds out of which they had emerged were dispersing into thin air evil passes good endures two millions sighed agnes joyfully of red money remarked her husband why do you call it that mother cockleshellbless hercalled it so because it was tainted with blood but we must cleanse the stains agnes by using much of it to help all that are in trouble god has been good in settling our affairs in this way but he has given me a better gift than the money what is that asked lady garvington softly the love of my dear wife said the happiest of men to the happiest of women the end
