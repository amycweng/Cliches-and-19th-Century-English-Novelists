green mummy chapter i the lovers i am very angry pouted the maid in heavens name why questioned the bachelor you have so to speak bought me impossible your price is prohibitive indeed when a thousand pounds you are worth fifty and a hundred times as much pooh that interjection doesnt answer my question i dont think it is one which needs answering said the young man lightly there are more important things to talk about than pounds shillings and sordid pence oh indeed such as love on a day such as this is look at the sky blue as your eyes at the sunshine golden as your hair warm as your affection you should say affection so cold a word when i love you to the extent of one thousand pounds lucy you are awoman that money did not buy your love but the consent of your stepfather to our marriage had i not humored his whim he would have insisted upon your marrying random lucy pouted again and in scorn as if i ever would said she well i dont know random is a soldier and a baronet handsome and agreeable with a certain amount of talent what objection can you find to such a match one insuperable objection he isnt you archiedarling hm the adjective appears to be an afterthought grumbled the bachelor then when she merely laughed teasingly after the manner of women he added moodily no by jove random isnt me by any manner of means i am but a poor artist without fame or position struggling on three hundred a year for a grudging recognition quite enough for one you greedy creature and for two he inquired softly more than enough oh nonsense nonsense nonsense what when i am engaged to you actions speak much louder than remarks mr archibald hope i love you more than i do money angel angel you said that i was a woman just now what do you mean this and he kissed her willing lips in the lane which was empty save for blackbirds and beetles is any explanation a clear one not to an angel who requires adoration but to a woman wholet us walk on archie or we shall be late for dinner the young man smiled and frowned and sighed and laughed in the space of thirty secondssomething of a feat in the way of emotional gymnastics the freakish feminine nature perplexed him as it had perplexed adam and he could not understand this rapid change from poetry to prose how could it be otherwise when he was but fiveandtwenty and engaged for the first time threescore years and ten is all too short a time to learn what woman really is and every student leaves this world with the conviction that of the thousand sides which the female of man presents to the male of woman not one reveals the being he desires to know there is always a deep below a deep a veil behind a veil a sphere within a sphere its most remarkable said the puzzled man in this instance what is asked the enigma promptly to avoid an argument which he could not sustain archie switched his on to the weather this day in september one could well believe that it is still the month of roses what with those wilted hedges and falling leaves and reaped fields and golden haystacks andand she glanced around for further illustrations in the way of contradiction i can see all those things dear and the misplaced day also misplaced july day slipped into september it comes into the landscape of this autumn month as does love into the hearts of an elderly couple who feel too late the supreme passion lucys eyes swept the prospect and the springlike sunshine revealing all too clearly the wrinkles of aging nature assisted her comprehension i understand yet youth has its wisdom and old age its experience the law of compensation my dearest but i dont see he added reflectively what your remark and my answer have to do with the view whereat lucy declared that his wits wandered within the last five minutes they had emerged from a sunken lane where the hedges were white with dust and dry with heat to a vast open space apparently at the worldsend here the saltings spread raggedly towards the stately stream of the thames intersected by dykes and ditches by earthen ramparts crooked fences sod walls and irregular lines of stunted trees following the watercourses the marshes were shaggy with reeds and rushes and brown with coarse fading herbage although here and there gleamed emeraldhued patches of watersoaked soil fit for fairyrings beyond a moderately high embankment of turf and timber the lovers could see the broad river sweeping eastward to the nore with homewardbound and outwardfaring ships afloat on its golden tide across the gleaming waters from where they lipped their banks to the foot of low domestic kentish hills stretched alluvial lands sparsely timbered and in the clear sunshine clusters of houses great and small factories with tall smoky chimneys clumps of trees and rigid railway lines could be discerned the landscape was not beautiful in spite of the suns profuse gildings but to the lovers it appeared a paradise cupid lord of gods and men had bestowed on them the usual rosecolored spectacles which form an important part of his stockintrade and they looked abroad on a fairy world was not she there was not he there could romeo or juliet desire more from their feet ran the slim straight causeway which was the kings highway of the districta trim prim line of white above the picturesque disorder of the marshes it skirted the lowlying fields at the foot of the uplands and slipped through an iron gate to end in the far distance at the gigantic portal of the fort this was a squat ungainly pile of rugged gray stone symmetrically built but aggressively ugly in its very regularity since it insulted the graceful curves of nature everywhere discernible it stood nakedly amidst the bare bleak meadows glittering with pools of still water with not even the leaf of a creeper to soften its menacing walls although above them appeared the fullfoliaged tops of trees planted in the barrackyard it looked as though the grim walls belted a secret orchard what with the frowning battlements the very few windows diminutive and closely barred the sullen entrance and the absence of any gracious greenery gartley fort resembled the castle of giant despair on the hither side but invisible to the lovers great cannons scowled on the river they protected and when they spoke received answer from smaller guns across the stream there less extensive forts were concealed amidst trees and masked by turf embankments to watch and guard the golden argosies of london commerce lucy always impressionable shivered with her hand in that of archies as she stared at the landscape melancholy even in the brilliant sunshine i should hate to live in gartley fort said she abruptly one might as well be in jail if you marry random you will have to live there or on a baggage wagon he is rga captain remember and has to go where glory calls him like a good soldier glory can call until glory is hoarse for me retorted the girl candidly i prefer an artists studio to a camp why asked hope laughing at her vehemence the reason is obvious i love the artist and if you loved the soldier i should mount the baggage wagon and make him bovril when he was wounded but for you dear i shall cook and sew and bake and stop stop i want a wife not a housekeeper every sensible man wants the two in one but you should be a queen darling not with my own consent archie the work is much too hard existence on six pounds a week with you will be more amusing we can take a cottage you know and live the simple life in gartley village until you become the pra and i can be lady hope to walk in silk attire you shall be queen of the earth darling and walk alone how dull i would much rather walk with you and that reminds me that dinner is waiting let us take the short cut home through the village on the way you can tell me exactly how you bought me from my stepfather for one thousand pounds archie hope frowned at the incurable obstinacy of the sex i didnt buy you dearest how many times do you wish me to deny a sale which never took place i merely obtained your stepfathers consent to our marriage in the near future as if he had anything to do with my marriage being only my stepfather and having in my eyes no authority in what way did you get his consenthis unnecessary consent she repeated with emphasis of course it was waste of breath to argue with a woman who had made up her mind the two began to walk towards the village along the causeway and hope cleared his throat to explainpatiently as to a child you know that your stepfatherprofessor braddockis crazy on the subject of mummies lucy nodded in her pretty wilful way he is an egyptologist quite so but less famous and rich than he should be considering his knowledge of dryasdust antiquities well then to make a long story short he told me that he greatly desired to examine into the difference between the egyptians and the peruvians with regard to the embalming of the dead i always thought that he was too fond of egypt to bother about any other country said lucy sapiently my dear it isnt the country he cares about but the civilization of the past the incas embalmed their dead as did the egyptians and in some way the professor heard of a royal mummy swathed in green bandagesso he described it to me it should be called an irish mummy said lucy flippantly well this mummy is in possession of a man at malta and professor braddock hearing that it was for sale for one thousand pounds oh interrupted the girl vivaciously so this was why father sent sidney bolton away six weeks ago yes as you know bolton is your stepfathers assistant and is as crazy as the professor on the subject of egypt i asked the professor if he would allow me to marry you quite unnecessary interpolated lucy briskly archie passed over the remark to evade an argument when i asked him he said that he wished you to marry random who is rich i pointed out that you loved me and not random and that random was on a yachting cruise while i was on the spot he then said that he could not wait for the return of random and would give me a chance what did he mean by that well it seems that he was in a hurry to get this green mummy from malta as he feared lest some other person should snap it up this was two months ago remember and professor braddock wanted the cash at once had random been here he could have supplied it but as random was away he told me that if i handed over one thousand pounds to purchase the mummy that he would permit our engagement now and our marriage in six months i saw my chance and took it for your stepfather has always been an obstacle in our path lucy dear in a week professor braddock had the money as i sold out some of my investments to get it he then sent bolton to malta in a tramp steamer for the sake of cheapness and now expects him back with the green mummy has sidney bought it yes he got it for nine hundred pounds the professor told me and is bringing it back in the diverthats the same tramp steamer in which he went to malta so thats the whole story and you can see there is no question of you being bought the thousand pounds went to get your fathers consent he is not my father snapped lucy finding nothing else to say you call him so that is only from habit i cant call him mr braddock or professor braddock when i live with him so father is the sole mode of address left to me and after all she added taking her lovers arm i like the professor he is very kind and good although extremely absentminded and i am glad he has consented for he worried me a lot to marry sir frank random i am glad you bought me but i didnt cried the exasperated lover i think you did and you shouldnt have diminished your income by buying what you could have had for nothing archie shrugged his shoulders it was vain to combat her fixed idea i have still three hundred a year left and you were worth buying you have no right to talk of me as though i had been bought the young man gasped but you said oh what does it matter what i said i am going to marry you on three hundred a year so there it is i suppose when bolton returns my father will be glad to see the back of me and then will go to egypt with sidney to explore this secret tomb he is always talking about that expedition will require more than a thousand pounds said archie dryly the professor explained the obstacles to me however his doings have nothing to do with us darling let professor braddock fumble amongst the dead if he likes we live apart sighed lucy only for the next six months then we can get our cottage and live on love my dearest plus three hundred a year said the girl sensibly then she added oh poor frank random lucy cried her lover indignantly well i was only pitying him hes a nice man and you cant expect him to be pleased at our marriage perhaps said hope in an icy tone you would like him to be the bridegroom if so there is still time silly boy she took his arm as i have been bought you know that i cant run away from my purchaser you denied being bought just now it seems to me lucy that i am to marry a weathercock that is only an impolite name for a woman dear you have no sense of humor frank or you would call me an april lady because you change every five minutes hm its puzzling is it perhaps you would like me to resemble widow anne who is always funereal here she is looking like niobe they were strolling through gartley village by this time and the cottagers came to their doors and front gates to look at the handsome young couple everyone knew of the engagement and approved of the same although some hinted that lucy kendal would have been wiser to marry the soldierbaronet amongst these was widow anne who really was mrs bolton the mother of sidney a dismal female invariably arrayed in rusty stuffy aggressive mourning although her husband had been dead for over twenty years because of this same mourning and because she was always talking of the dead she was called widow anne and looked on the appellation as a compliment to her fidelity at the present moment she stood at the gate of her tiny garden mopping her red eyes with a dingy handkerchief ah young love young love my lady she groaned when the couple passed for she always gave lucy a title as though she really and truly had become the wife of sir frank but who knows how long it may last as long as we do retorted lucy annoyed by this prophetic speech widow anne groaned with relish so me and aaron as is dead and gone thought my lady but in six months he was knocking the head off me the man who would lay his hand on a woman save in the way of oh archie what nonsense you talk cried miss kendal pettishly ah sighed the woman of experience i called it nonsense too my lady afore aaron who now lies with the worms laid me out with a flatiron mens fit for jails only as i allays says a nice opinion you have of our sex remarked archie dryly i have sir i could tell you things as would make your head waggle with horror on there shoulders of yours what about your son sidney is he also wicked he would be if he had the strength which he hasnt exclaimed the widow with uncomplimentary fervor hes aarons son and aaron hadnt much to learn from them as is where hes gone too and she looked downward significantly sidney is a decent young fellow said lucy sharply how dare you miscall your own flesh and blood widow anne my father thinks a great deal of sidney else he would not have sent him to malta do try and be cheerful theres a good soul sidney will tell you plenty to make you laugh when he comes home if he ever does come home sighed the old woman what do you mean by that oh its all very well asking questions as cant be answered nohow my lady but i be all of a mubblefubble that i be what is a mubblefubble asked hope staring its a queerlike feeling of death and sorrow and tears of blood and not lifting your head for groans said widow anne incoherently and theres meanings in mubblefumbles as were told in scripture not but what the perfessers been a kind gentleman to sid in taking him from going round with the laundry cart and eddicating him to watch camphorated corpses not as what id like to keep an eye on them things myself but theres no more watching for my boy sid as i dreamed what did you dream asked lucy curiously widow anne threw up two gnarled hands wrinkled with age and laundry work screwing up her face meanwhile i dreamed of battle and murder and sudden death my lady with sid in his cold grave playing on a harp angellike yes she folded her rusty shawl tightly round her spare form and nodded there was sid looking beautiful in his coffin and cut into a hash as you might say with ugh ugh shuddered lucy and archie strove to draw her away with murder written all over his poor face pursued the widow and i woke up screeching with cramp in my legs and pains in my lungs and beatings in my heart and stiffness in my oh hang it shut up shouted archie seeing that lucy was growing pale at this ghoulish recital dont be fool woman professor braddock says that boltonll be back in three days with the mummy he has been sent to fetch from malta you have been having nightmare dont you see how you are frightening miss kendal the witch of endor sir deuce take the witch of endor and you also theres a shilling go and drink yourself into a more cheery frame of mind widow anne bit the shilling with one of her two remaining teeth and dropped a curtsey youre a good kind gentleman she smirked cheered at the idea of unlimited gin and when my boy sid do come home a corpse i hope youll come to the funeral sir what a raven said lucy as widow anne toddled away in the direction of the one publichouse in gartley village i dont wonder that the late mr bolton laid her out with a flatiron to slay such a woman would be meritorious i wonder how she came to be the mother of sidney said miss kendal reflectively as they resumed their walk hes such a clever smart and handsome young man i think bolton owes everything to the professors teaching and example lucy replied her lover he was an uncouth lad i understand when your stepfather took him into the house six years ago now he is quite presentable i shouldnt wonder if he married mrs jasher hm i rather think mrs jasher admires the professor oh hell never marry her if she were a mummy there might be a chance of course but as a human being the professor will never look at her i dont know so much about that archie mrs jasher is attractive hope laughed in a muttondressedaslamb way no doubt and she has money my father is poor and so you make up a match at once as every woman will do well let us get back to the pyramids and see how the flirtation is progressing lucy walked on for a few steps in silence do you believe in mrs boltons dream archie no i believe she eats heavy suppers bolton will return quite safe he is a clever fellow not easily taken advantage of dont bother any more about widow anne and her dismal prophecies ill try not to replied lucy dutifully all the same i wish she had not told me her dream and she shivered chapter ii professor braddock there was only one really palatial mansion in gartley and that was the ancient georgian house known as the pyramids lucys stepfather had given the place this eccentric name on taking up his abode there some ten years previously before that time the dwelling had been occupied by the lord of the manor and his family but now the old squire was dead and his impecunious children were scattered to the four quarters of the globe in search of money with which to rebuild their ruined fortunes as the village was somewhat isolated and rather unhealthily situated in a marshy country the huge roomy old grange had not been easy to let and had proved quite impossible to sell under these disastrous circumstances professor braddockwho described himself humorously as a scientific pauperhad obtained the tenancy at a ridiculously low rental much to his satisfaction many people would have paid money to avoid exile in these damp waste lands which as it were fringed civilization but their loneliness and desolation suited the professor exactly he required ample room for his egyptian collection with plenty of time to decipher hieroglyphics and study perished dynasties of the nile valley the world of the present day did not interest braddock in the least he lived almost continuously on that portion of the mental plane which had to do with the fardistant past and only concerned himself with physical existence when it consisted of mummies and mystic beetles sepulchral ornaments pictured documents hawkheaded deities and suchlike things of almost inconceivable antiquity he rarely walked abroad and was invariably late for meals save when he missed any particular one altogether which happened frequently absentminded in conversation untidy in dress unpractical in business dreamy in manner professor braddock lived solely for archaeology that such a man should have taken to himself a wife was mystery yet he had been married fifteen years before to a widow who possessed a limited income and one small child it was the opportunity of securing the use of a steady income which had decoyed braddock into the matrimonial snare of mrs kendal to put it plainly he had married the agreeable widow for her money although he could scarcely be called a fortunehunter like eugene aram he desired cash to assist learning and as that scholar had committed murder to secure what he wanted so did the professor marry to obtain his ends these were to have someone to manage the house and to be set free from the necessity of earning his bread so that he might indulge in pursuits more pleasurable than moneymaking mrs kendal was a placid phlegmatic lady who liked rather than loved the professor and who desired him more as a companion than as a husband with braddock she did not arrange a romantic marriage so much as enter into a congenial partnership she wanted a man in the house and he desired freedom from pecuniary embarrassment on these lines the prosaic bargain was struck and mrs kendal became the professors wife with entirely successful results she gave her husband a home and her child a father who became fond of lucy and whoconsidering he was merely an amateur parentacted admirably but this sensible partnership lasted only for five years mrs braddock died of a chill on the liver and left her five hundred a year to the professor for life with remainder to lucy then a small girl of ten it was at this critical moment that braddock became a practical man for the first and last time in his dreamy life he buried his wife with unfeigned regretfor he had been sincerely attached to her in his absentminded wayand sent lucy to a hampstead boarding school after an interview with his late wifes lawyer to see that the income was safe he sought for a house in the country and quickly discovered gartley grange which no one would take because of its isolation within three months from the burial of mrs braddock the widower had removed himself and his collection to gartley and had renamed his new abode the pyramids here he dwelt quietly and enjoyablyfrom his dryasdust point of viewfor ten years and here lucy kendal had come when her education was completed the arrival of a marriageable young lady made no difference in the professors habits and he hailed her thankfully as the successor to her mother in managing the small establishment it is to be feared that braddock was somewhat selfish in his views but the fixed idea of archaeological research made him egotistical the mansion was threestory flatroofed extremely ugly and unexpectedly comfortable built of mellow red brick with dingy white stone facings it stood a few yards back from the roadway which ran from gartley fort through the village and at the precise point where the pyramids was situated curved abruptly through woodlands to terminate a mile away at jessum the local station of the thames railway line an iron railing embedded in moldering stone work divided the narrow front garden from the road and on either side of the doorwhich could be reached by five shallow stepsgrew two small yew trees smartly clipped and trimmed into cones of dull green these yews possessed some magical significance which professor braddock would occasionally explain to chance visitors interested in occult matters for amongst other things egyptian the archaeologist searched into the magic of the sons of khem and insisted that there was more truth than superstition in their enchantments braddock used all the vast rooms of the ground floor to house his collection of antiquities which he had acquired through many laborious years he dwelt entirely in this museum as his bedroom adjoined his study and he frequently devoured his hurried meals amongst the brilliantly tinted mummy cases the embalmed dead populated his world and only now and then when lucy insisted did he ascend to the first floor which was her particular abode here was the drawingroom the diningroom and lucys boudoir here also were sundry bedrooms furnished and unfurnished in one of which miss kendal slept while the others remained vacant for chance visitors principally from the scientific world the third story was devoted to the cook her husbandwho acted as gardenerand to the house parlor maid a composite domestic who worked from morning until night in keeping the great house clean during the day these servants attended to their business in a comfortable basement where the cook ruled supreme at the back of the mansion stretched a fairly large kitchen garden to which the cooks husband devoted his attention this was the entire domain belonging to the tenant as of course the professor did not rent the arable acres and comfortable farms which had belonged to the dispossessed family everything in the house went smoothly as lucy was a methodical young person who went by the clock and the almanac braddock little knew how much of his undeniable comfort he owed to her fostering care for prior to her return from school he had been robbed right and left by unscrupulous domestics when his stepdaughter arrived he simply handed over the keys and the housekeeping moneya fixed sumand gave her strict instructions not to bother him miss kendal faithfully observed this injunction as she enjoyed being undisputed mistress and knew that so long as her stepfather had his meals his bed his bath and his clothes he required nothing save the constant society of his beloved mummies of which no one wished to deprive him these he dusted and cleansed and rearranged himself not even lucy dared to invade the museum and the mere mention of spring cleaning drove the professor into displaying frantic rage in which he used bad language on returning from her walk with archie the girl had lured her stepfather into assuming a rusty dress suit which had done service for many years and had coaxed him into a promise to be present at dinner mrs jasher the lively widow of the district was coming and braddock approved of a woman who looked up to him as the one wise man in the world even science is susceptible to judicious flattery and mrs jasher was never backward in putting her admiration into words female gossip declared that the widow wished to become the second mrs braddock but if this was really the case she had but small chance of gaining her end the professor had once sacrificed his liberty to secure a competence and having acquired five hundred a year was not inclined for a second matrimonial venture had the widow been a dollar heiress with a million at her back he would not have troubled to place a ring on her finger and certainly mrs jasher had little to gain from such a dreary marriage beyond a collection of rubbishas she saidand a dull country house situated in a district inhabited solely by peasants belonging to saxon times archie hope left lucy at the door of the pyramids and repaired to his village lodgings for the purpose of assuming evening dress lucy being her own housekeeper assisted the overworked parlor maid to lay and decorate the table before receiving the guests thus mrs jasher found no one in the drawingroom to welcome her and taking the privilege of old friendship descended to beard braddock in his den the professor raised his eyes from a newly bought scarabeus to behold a stout little lady smiling on him from the doorway he did not appear to be grateful for the interruption but mrs jasher was not at all dismayed being a manhunter by profession besides she saw that braddock was in the clouds as usual and would have received the king himself in the same absentminded manner pouf what an abominal smell exclaimed the widow holding a flimsy lace handkerchief to her nose kind of camphorsandalwood charnelhouse smell i wonder you are not asphyxiated pouf ugh burrr the professor stared at her with cold fishy eyes did you speak oh dear me yes and you dont even ask me to take a chair if i were a nasty stuffy mummy now you would be embracing me by this time dont you know that i have come to dinner you silly man and she tapped him playfully with her closed fan i have had dinner said braddock egotistic as usual no you have not mrs jasher spoke positively and pointed to a small tray of untouched food on the side table you have not even had luncheon you must live on air like a chameleonor on love perhaps she ended in a significantly tender tone but she might as well have spoken to the granite image of horus in the corner braddock merely rubbed his chin and stared harder than ever at the glittering visitor dear me he said innocently i must have forgotten to eat lamplight he looked round vaguely of course i remember lighting the lamps time has gone by very rapidly i am really hungry he paused to make sure then repeated his remark in a more positive manner yes i am very hungry mrs jasher he looked at her as though she had just entered of course mrs jasher do you wish to see me about anything particular the widow frowned at his inattention and then laughed it was impossible to be angry with this dreamer i have come to dinner professor do try and wake up you are half asleep and half starved too i expect i certainly feel unaccountably hungry admitted braddock cautiously unaccountably when you have eaten nothing since breakfast you weird man i believe you are a mummy yourself but the professor had again returned to examine the scarabeus this time with a powerful magnifying glass it certainly belongs to the twentieth dynasty he murmured wrinkling his brows mrs jasher stamped and flirted her fan pettishly the creatures soul she decided was certainly not in his body and until it came back he would continue to ignore her with the annoyance of a woman who is not getting her own way she leaned back in braddocks one comfortable chairwhich she had unerringly selectedand examined him intently perhaps the gossips were correct and she was trying to imagine what kind of a husband he would make but whatever might be her thoughts she eyed braddock as earnestly as braddock eyed the scarabeus outwardly the professor did not appear like the savant he was reported to be he was small of stature plump of body rosy as a little cupid and extraordinarily youthful considering his fiftyodd years of scientific wear and tear with a smooth cleanshaven face plentiful white hair like spun silk and neat feet and hands he did not look his age the dreamy look in his small blue eyes was rather belied by the hardness of his thinlipped mouth and by the pugnacious push of his jaw the eyes and the domelike forehead hinted that brain without much originality but the lower part of this contradictory countenance might have belonged to a prizefighter nevertheless braddocks plumpness did away to a considerable extent with his aggressive look it was certainly latent but only came to the surface when he fought with a brother savant over some tombdweller from thebes in the soft lamplight he looked like a fighting cherub and it was a pityin the interests of artthat the hairless pink and white face did not surmount a pair of wings rather than a rusty and illfitting dress suit hes nane sa dafty as he looks thought mrs jasher who was scotch although she claimed to be cosmopolitan with his mummies he is all right but outside those he might be difficult to manage and these things she glanced round the shadowy room crowded with the dead and their earthly belongings i dont think i would care to marry the british museum too much like hard work and i am not so young as i was the near mirrora polished silver one which had belonged ages ago to some coquette of memphisdenied this uncomplimentary thought for mrs jasher did not look a day over thirty although her birth certificate set her down as fortyfive in the lamplight she might have passed for even younger so carefully had she preserved what remained to her of youth she assuredly was somewhat stout and never had been so tall as she desired to be but the lines of her plump figure were still discernible in the cunningly cut gown and she carried her little self with such mighty dignity that people overlooked the mortifying height of a trifle over five feet her features were small and neat but her large blue eyes were so noticeable and melting that those on whom she turned them ignored the lack of boldness in chin and nose her hair was brown and arranged in the latest fashion while her complexion was so fresh and pink that if she did paintas jealous women averredshe must have been quite an artist with the hares foot and the rouge pot and the necessary powder puff mrs jashers clothes repaid the thought she expended upon them and she was artistic in this as in other things dressed in a crocusyellow gown with short sleeves to reveal her beautiful arms and cut low to display her splendid bust she looked perfectly dressed a woman would have declared the widenetted black lace with which the dress was draped to be cheap and would have hinted that the widow wore too many jewels in her hair on her corsage round her arms and ridiculously gaudy rings on her fingers this might have been true for mrs jasher sparkled like the milky way at every movement but the gleam of gold and the flash of gems seemed to suit her opulent beauty her slightest movement wafted around her a strange chinese perfume which she obtainedso she saidfrom a friend of her late husbands who was in the british embassy at pekin no one possessed this especial perfume but mrs jasher and anyone who had previously met her meeting her in the darkness could have guessed at her identity with a smile to show her white teeth with her goldenhued dress and glittering jewels the pretty widow glowed in that glimmering room like a tropical bird the professor raised his dreamy eyes and laid the beetle on one side when his brain fully grasped that this charming vision was waiting to be entertained she was better to look upon even than the beloved scarabeus and he advanced to shake hands as though she had just entered the room mrs jasherknowing his waysrose to extend her hand and the two small stout figures looked absurdly like a pair of chubby dresden ornaments which had stepped from the mantelshelf dear lady i am glad to see you you haveyou havethe professor reflected and then came back with a rush to the present centuryyou have come to dinner if i mistake not lucy asked me a week ago she replied tartly for no woman likes to be neglected for a mere beetle however ancient then you will certainly get a good dinner said braddock waving his plump white hands lucy is an excellent housekeeper i have no fault to find with herno fault at all but she is obstinateoh very obstinate as her mother was do you know dear lady that in a papyrus scroll which i lately acquired i found the recipe for a genuine egyptian dish which amenemhathe last pharaoh of the eleventh dynasty you knowmight have eaten and probably did eat i desired lucy to serve it tonight but she refused much to my annoyance the ingredients which had to do with roasted gazelle were oil and coriander seed andif my memory serves measafoetida ugh mrs jashers handkerchief went again to her mouth say no more professor your dish sounds horrid i dont wish to eat it and be turned into a mummy before my time you would make a really beautiful mummy said braddock paying what he conceived was a compliment and should you die i shall certainly attend to your embalming if you prefer that to cremation you dreadful man cried the widow turning pale and shrinking why i really believe that you would like to see me packed away in one of those disgusting coffins disgusting cried the outraged professor striking one of the brilliantly tinted cases can you call so beautiful a specimen of sepulchral art disgusting look at the colors at the regularity of the hieroglyphicswhy the history of the dead is set out in this magnificent series of pictures he adjusted his pincenez and began to read the osirian scemiophis that is a female name mrs jasherwho i dont want to have my history written on my coffin interrupted the widow hysterically for this funereal talk frightened her it would take much more space than a mummy case upon which to write it my life has been volcanic i can tell you by the way she added hurriedly seeing that braddock was on the eve of resuming the reading tell me about your inca mummy has it arrived the professor immediately followed the false trail not yet he said briskly rubbing his smooth hands but in three days i expect the diver will be at pierside and sidney will bring the mummy on here i shall unpack it at once and learn exactly how the ancient peruvians embalmed their dead doubtless they learned the art from the egyptians ventured mrs jasher rashly braddock glared nothing of the sort dear lady he snorted angrily absurd ridiculous i am inclined to believe that egypt was merely a colony of that vast island of atlantis mentioned by plato thereif my theory is correctcivilization begun and the kings of atlantisdoubtless the gods of historical tribesgoverned the whole world including that portion which we now term south america do you mean to say that there were yankees in those days inquired mrs jasher frivolously the professor tucked his hands under his shabby coattails and strode up and down the room warming his rage which was provoked by such ignorance good heavens madam where have you lived he exclaimed explosivelyare you a fool or merely an ignorant woman i am talking of prehistoric times thousands of years ago when you were probably a stray atom embedded in the slime oh you horrid creature cried mrs jasher indignantly and was about to give braddock her opinion if only to show him that she could hold her own when the door opened how are you mrs jasher said lucy advancing here am i and here is archie dinner is ready and you i am very hungry said mrs jasher i have been called an atom of the slime then she laughed and took possession of young hope lucy wrinkled her brow she did not approve of the widows manannexing instinct chapter iii a mysterious tomb one member of the braddock household was not included in the general staff being a mere appendage of the professor himself this was a dwarfish misshapen kanaka a pigmy in height but a giant in breadth with short thick legs and long powerful arms he had a large head and a somewhat handsome face with melancholy black eyes and a fine set of white teeth like most polynesians his skin was of a pale bronze and elaborately tattooed even the cheeks and chin being scored with curves and straight lines of mystical import but the most noticeable thing about him was his huge mop of frizzled hair which by some process known only to himself he usually dyed a vivid yellow the flaring locks streaming from his head made him resemble a peruvian image of the sun and it was this peculiar coiffure which had procured for him the odd name of cockatoo the fact that this grotesque creature invariably wore a white drill suit emphasized still more the suggestion of his likeness to an australian parrot cockatoo had come from the solomon islands in his teens to the colony of queensland to work on the plantations and there the professor had picked him up as his body servant when braddock returned to marry mrs kendal the boy had refused to leave him although it was represented to the young savage that he was somewhat too barbaric for sober england finally the professor had consented to bring him over seas and had never regretted doing so for cockatoo finding his scientific master a true friend worshipped him as a visible god having been captured when young by pacific blackbirders he talked excellent english and from contact with the necessary restraints of civilization was on the whole extremely well behaved occasionally when teased by the villagers and his fellowservants he would break into childish rages which bordered on the dangerous but a word from braddock always quieted him and when penitent he would crawl like a whipped dog to the feet of his divinity for the most part he lived entirely in the museum looking after the collection and guarding it from harm lucywho had a horror of the creatures uncanny looksobjected to cockatoo waiting at the table and it was only on rare occasions that he was permitted to assist the harassed parlormaid on this night the kanaka acted excellently as a butler and crept softly round the table attending to the needs of the diners he was an admirable servant deft and handy but his bluelined face and squat figure together with the obtrusively golden halo rather worried mrs jasher and indeed in spite of custom lucy also felt uncomfortable when this gnome hovered at her elbow it looked as though one of the fantastical idols from the museum below had come to haunt the living i do not like that golliwog breathed mrs jasher to her host when cockatoo was at the sideboard he gives me the creeps imagination my dear lady pure imagination why should we not have a picturesque animal to wait upon us he would wait picturesquely enough at a cannibal feast suggested archie with a laugh dont murmured lucy with a shiver i shall not be able to eat my dinner if you talk so odd that hope should say what he has said observed braddock confidently to the widow cockatoo comes from a cannibal island and doubtless has seen the consumption of human flesh no no my dear lady do not look so alarmed i dont think he has eaten any as he was taken to queensland long before he could participate in such banquets he is a very decent animal a very dangerous one i fancy retorted mrs jasher who looked pale only when he loses his temper and im always able to suppress that when it is at its worst you are not eating your meat my dear lady can you wonder at it and you talk of cannibals let us change the conversation to cereals suggested hope whose appetite was of the bestwheat for instance in this queer little village i notice the houses are divided by a field of wheat it seems wrong somehow for corn to be bunched up with houses thats old farmer jenkins said lucy vivaciously he owns three or four acres near the publichouse and will not allow them to be built over although he has been offered a lot of money i noticed myself archie the oddity of finding a cornfield surrounded by cottages its like alice in wonderland but fancy any one offering money for land here observed hope toying with his claret glass which had just been refilled by the attentive cockatoo at the backofbeyond as it were i shouldnt care to live herethe neighborhood is so desolate all the same you do live here interposed mrs jasher smartly and with a roguish glance at lucy archie caught the glance and saw the blush on miss kendals face you have answered your question yourself mrs jasher hesaid smiling i have the inducement you hint at to remain here and certainly as a landscape painter i admire the marshes and sunsets as an artist and an engaged man i stop in gartley otherwise i should clear out but i fail to see why a lady of your attractions should i may have a sentimental reason also interrupted the widow with a sly glance at the absentminded professor who was drawing hieroglyphics on the tablecloth with a fork also my cottage is cheap and very comfortable the late mr jasher did not leave me sufficient money to live in london he was a consul in china you know and consuls are never very well paid i will come in for a large income however indeed said lucy politely and wondering why mrs jasher was so communicative soon i hope it may be very soon my brother you knowa merchant in pekin he has come home to die and is unmarried when he does die i shall go to london but added the widow meditatively and glancing again at the professor i shall be sorry to leave dear gartley still the memory of happy hours spent in this house will always remain with me ah me ah me and she put her handkerchief to her eyes lucy telegraphed to archie that the widow was a humbug and archie telegraphed back that he quite agreed with her but the professor whom the momentary silence had brought back to the present century looked up and asked lucy if the dinner was finished i have to do some work this evening said the professor oh father when you said that you would take a holiday said lucy reproachfully i am doing so now look at the precious minutes i am wasting in eating my dear life is short and much remains to be done in the way of egyptian exploration there is the sepulchre of queen tahoser if i could only enter that and he sighed while helping himself to cream why dont you asked mrs jasher who was beginning to give up her pursuit of braddock for it was no use wooing a man whose interests centered entirely in egyptian tombs i have yet to discover it said the professor simply then warming to the congenial theme he glanced around and delivered a short historical lecture tahoser was the chief wife and queen of a famous pharaohthe pharaoh of the exodus in fact the one who was drowned in the red sea asked archie idly why yesbut that happened later before pursuing the hebrewsif the mosaic account is to be believedthis pharaoh marched far into the interior of africathe libya of the ancientsand conquered the natives of upper ethiopia being deeply in love with his queen he took her with him on this expedition and she died before the pharaoh returned to memphis from records which i discovered in the museum of cairo i have reason to believe that the pharaoh buried her with much pomp in ethiopia sacrificing i believe many prisoners at her gorgeous funeral rites from the wealth of that pharaohfor wealthy he must have been on account of his numerous victoriesand from the love he bore this princess i am confidentconfident added braddock striking the table vehemently that when discovered her tomb will be filled with riches and may also contain documents of incalculable value and you wish to get the money asked mrs jasher who was rather bored the professor rose fiercely money i care nothing for money i desire to obtain the funeral jewelry and golden masks the precious images of the gods so as to place them in the british museum and the scrolls of papyrus buried with the mummy of tahoser may contain an account of ethiopian civilization about which we know nothing oh that tombthat tomb braddock began to walk the room quite forgetting that he had not finished his dinner i know the mountains whose entrails were pierced to form the sepulchre were i able to go to africa i am certain that i should discover the tomb ah with what glory would my name be covered were i so fortunate why dont you go to africa sir and try asked hope fool cried the professor politely to fit out an expedition would take some five thousand pounds if not more i would have to penetrate through a hostile country to reach the chain of mountains i speak of where i know this precious tomb is to be found i need supplies an escort guns camels and all the rest of it a leader must be obtained to manage the fighting men necessary to pass through this dangerous zone it is no easy task to find the tomb of tahoser and yet if i couldif i could only get the money and he walked up and down with his head bent on his breast mrs jasher was used to braddocks vagaries by this time and merely continued to fan herself placidly i wish i could help you with the expedition she said quietly i should like to have some of that lovely egyptian jewelry myself but i am quite a pauper until my brother dies poor man then she hesitated what then asked braddock wheeling i shall aid you with pleasure its a bargain braddock stretched out his hand a bargain said mrs jasher accepting the grasp somewhat nervously for she had not expected to be taken so readily at her word a glance at lucy revealed her nervousness do sit down father and finish your dinner said that young lady i am sure you will have more than enough to do when the mummy arrives mummywhat mummy murmured braddock again beginning to eat the inca mummy of course the mummy of inca caxas which sidney is bringing from malta when i strip that corpse of its green bandages i shall find find what asked archie seeing that the professor hesitated braddock cast a swift look at his questioner i shall find the peculiar mode of peruvian embalming he replied abruptly and somehow the way in which he spoke gave hope the impression that the answer was an excuse but before he could formulate the thought that braddock was concealing something mrs jasher spoke frivolously i hope your mummy has jewels she said it has not replied braddock sharply so far as i know the inca race never buried their dead with jewels but i have read in prescotts history that they did said hope prescott prescott cried the professor contemptuously a most unreliable authority however ill promise you one thing hope that if there are any jewels or jewelry you shall have the lot give me some mr hope cried the widow i cannot laughed archie the green mummy belongs to the professor i cannot accept such a gift hope owing to circumstances i have been obliged to borrow the money from you otherwise the mummy would have been acquired by some one else but when i find the tomb of queen tahoser i shall repay the loan you have repaid it already said hope looking at lucy braddocks eyes followed his gaze and his brows contracted humph he muttered i dont know if i am right in consenting to lucys marriage with a pauper oh father cried the girl archie is not a pauper i have enough for lucy and me to live on said hope although his face had flushed and had i been a pauper i could not have given you that thousand pounds you will be repaidyou will be repaid said braddock waving his hand to dismiss the subject and now he rose with a yawn if this tedious feast is at an end i shall again seek my work without a word of apology to the disgusted mrs jasher he trotted to the door and there paused by the way lucy he said turning i had a letter today from random he returns in his yacht to pierside in two or three days in fact his arrival will coincide with that of the diver i dont see what his arrival has to do with me said lucy tartly oh nothing at allnothing at all said braddock airily only i thoughtthat is but never mind never mind cockatoo come down with me good night good night and he disappeared well said mrs jasher drawing along breath for rudeness and selfishness commend me to a scientist we might be all mud for what notice he takes of us never mind said miss kendal rising come to the drawingroom and have some music archie will you stop here no i dont care to sit over my wine alone said that young gentleman rising i shall accompany you and mrs jasher and lucy he stopped her at the door through which the widow had already passed what did your father mean by his hints concerning random i think he regrets giving his consent to my marriage with you she whispered back did you not hear him talk about that tomb he desires to get money for the expedition from random what rubbish sooner than thatif our marriage is stopped by the beastly businessill sell out and youll do nothing of the sort interrupted the girl imperiously we must live if we marry you have given my father enough but if random lends money for this expedition he does so at his own risk i am not going to marry sir frank because of my stepfathers requirements he has no rights over me and whether he consents or not i marry you my darling and archie kissed her before they followed mrs jasher into the drawingroom all the same he foresaw trouble chapter iv the unexpected for the next two or three days archie felt decidedly worried over his projected marriage with lucy certainly he hadto put it bluntlypurchased braddocks consent and that gentleman could scarcely draw back from his plighted word which had cost the lover so much nevertheless hope did not entirely trust the professor as from the few words which he had let drop at the dinner party it was plain that he hankered after money with which to fit out the expedition in search of the mysterious tomb to which he had alluded archie knew as did the professor that he could not supply the necessary five thousand pounds without practically ruining himself and already he had crippled his resources in paying over the price of the green mummy he had fondly believed that braddock would have been satisfied with the relic of peruvian humanity but it seemed that the professor having got what he wanted now clamored for what was at present beyond his reach the mummy was his property but he desired the contents of queen tahosers tomb also this particular moon which he cried for was a very expensive article and hope did not see how he could gain it unlessand here came in the cause of archies worryunless the five thousand pounds was borrowed from sir frank random the professor would have to content himself with the maltese mummy but from what the young man had seen of braddocks longing for the especial sepulchre which he desired to loot he believed that the scientist would not readily surrender his whim random could easily lend or give the money since he was extremely rich and extremely generous but it was improbable that he would aid braddock without a quid pro quo as the sole desire of the baronets heart was to make lucy his wife it could easily be guessed that he would only assist the professor to realize his ambition on condition that the savant used his influence with his stepdaughter that meant the breaking of the engagement with hope and the marriage of the girl to the soldier of course such a state of things would make lucy unhappy but braddock cared very little for that to gratify his craze for egyptian research he would be willing to sacrifice a dozen girls like lucy undoubtedly lucy would refuse to be passed along from one man to another like a bale of goods and archie knew that so far as in her lay she would keep to her engagement especially as she denied braddocks right to dispose of her hand all the same the professor in spite of his cherubical looks could make himself extremely disagreeable and undoubtedly would do so if thwarted the sole course that remained should braddock begin operations to break the present engagement would be to marry lucy at once archie would willingly have done so but pecuniary difficulties stood in the way he had never told any one of these not even the girl he loved but they existed all the same for many years he had been assisting needy relatives and thus had hampered himself in spite of his income by sheer force of will so as to force braddock into giving him lucy he had contrived to secure the necessary thousand pounds without confusing the arrangements he had made to pay off certain debts connected with his domestic philanthropy but this brought him to the end of his resources in six months he hoped to be free to have his income entirely to himself and thensmall as it washe could support a wife but until the half year elapsed he could see no chance of marrying lucy with any degree of comfort and meanwhile she would be exposed to the persecutions of the professor perhaps persecutions is too harsh a word as braddock was kind enough to the girl nevertheless he was pertinacious in gaining his aims where his pet hobby was concerned and undoubtedly could he see any chance of obtaining the money from random by selling his stepdaughter he would do so assuredly it was dishonorable to act in this way but the professor was a scientific jesuit and deemed that the end justified the means when any glory to himself and gain to the british museum was in question but i may be doing him an injustice said archie when he was explaining his fears to miss kendal on the third day after the dinner party after all the professor is a gentleman and will probably hold to the bargain which he has made i dont care whether he does or not cried lucy who had a fine color and a certain amount of fire in her eyes i am not going to be bought and sold to forward these nasty scientific schemes my father can say what he likes and do what he likes but i marry youtomorrow if you like thats just it said archie flushing we cant marry why she asked much astonished hope looked at the ground and drew patterns with his canepoint in the sand they were seated in the hot sunshinefor the indian summer still continuedunder a moldering brick wall which ran around the most delightful of kitchen gardens this was situated at the back of the pyramids and contained a multiplicity of pot herbs and fruit trees and vegetables it resembled the fairy garden in madame dalnoys story of the white cat and in the autumn yielded a plentiful crop of fineflavored fruit but now the trees were bare and the garden looked somewhat forlorn for lack of greenery but in spite of the lateness of the season lucy often brought a book to read under the glowing wall and there ripened like a peach in the warm sunshine on this occasion she brought archie into the oldworld garden as he had hinted at confidences and the time had come to speak plainly as hope began to think that he had not treated lucy quite fairly in hiding from her his momentarily embarrassed position why cant we marry at once asked lucy seeing that her lover held his peace and looked confused hope did not reply directly i had better release you from your engagement he said haltingly oh lucys nostrils dilated and she threw back her head scornfully and the other womans name there is no other woman i love you and you only butmoney what about money you have your income oh yesthat is sure small as it is but i have incurred debts on behalf of an uncle and his family these have embarrassed me for the moment and so i cannot see my way to marrying you for at least six months lucy he caught her hand i feel ashamed of myself that i did not tell you of this before but i feared to lose you yet on reflection i see that it is dishonorable to keep you in the dark and if you think that i have behaved badly well i do in a way she interrupted quickly as your silence was quite unnecessary dont treat me as a doll my dear i wish to share your troubles as well as your joys come tell me all about it you are not angry yes i amat your thinking i loved you so little as to be biased against our marriage because of money troubles pooh she flicked away a speck of dust from his coat i dont care that for such things you are an angel he cried ardently i am a very practical girl just now she retorted go on confess archie thus encouraged did so and it was a very mild confession that she heard involving a great deal of unnecessary sacrifice in helping a pauper uncle hope strove to belittle his good deeds as much as possible but lucy saw plainly the good heart that had dictated the giving up of his small income for some years when in possession of all the facts she threw her arms around his neck and kissed him you are a silly old boy she whispered as if what you tell me could make any difference to me but we cant be married for six months dearest of course not do you believe that i as a woman can gather together my trousseau under six months no my dear we must not marry in haste to repent at leisure in another half year you will enjoy your own income and then we can marry but meanwhile said archie after kissing her the professor will bother you to marry random oh no he has sold me to you for one thousand pounds there there do not say a single word i am only teasing you let us say that my father has consented to my marriage with you and cannot withdraw his word not that i care if he does i am my own mistress lucyhe took her hands again and looked into her eyesbraddock is a scientific lunatic and would do anything to forward his aims with regard to this very expensive tomb which he has set his heart on discovering as i cant lend or give the money he is sure to apply to random and random will want to marry me cried lucy rising no my dear not at all sir frank is a gentleman and when he learns that i am engaged to you he will simply become a dear friend there dont worry any more about the matter you ought to have told me of your troubles before but as i have forgiven you there is no more to be said in six months i shall become mrs hope and meanwhile i can hold my own against any inconvenience that my father may cause me but he rose and began to remonstrate anxious to abase himself still further before this angel of a maiden she placed her hand over his mouth not another word or i shall box your ears sirthat is i shall exercise the privilege of a wife before i become one and now she slipped her arm within his let us go in and see the arrival of the precious mummy oh it has arrived then not here exactly my father expects it at three oclock it is now a quarter to said archie consulting his watch as i have been to london all yesterday i did not know that the diver had arrived at pierside how is bolton lucy wrinkled her brows i am rather worried over sidney she said in an anxious voice and so is my father he had not appeared what do you mean by that well she looked at the ground in a pondering manner my father got a letter from sidney yesterday afternoon saying that the ship with the mummy and himself on board had arrived about four oclock the letter was sent on by special messenger and came at six then it arrived in the evening and not in the afternoon how particular you are said miss kendal with a shrug well then sidney said that he could not bring the mummy to this place last night as it was so late he intendedso he told my father in the letterto remove the case containing the mummy ashore to an inn near the wharf at pierside and there would remain the night so as to take care of it thats all right said hope puzzled wheres your difficulty a note came from the landlord of the inn this morning saying that by direction of mr boltonthat is sidney you knowhe was sending the mummy in its case to gartley on a lorry and that it would arrive at three oclock this afternoon well asked hope still puzzled well she rejoined impatiently cant you see show strange it is that sidney should let the mummy out of his sight after guarding it so carefully not only from malta to england but all the night in pierside at that hotel why doesnt he bring the mummy here himself and come on with the lorry there is no explanationno letter from sidney bolton none he wrote yesterday as i stated saying that he would keep the case in the hotel and send it on this morning did he use the word send or the word bring he said send then that shows he did not intend to bring it himself but why should he not do so i daresay he will explain when he appears i am very sorry for him when he does appear said lucy seriously for my father is furious why this precious mummy for which so much has been paid might have been lost pooh who would steal a thing like that a thing like that is worth nearly one thousand pounds said lucy in a dry tone and if anyone got wind of it stealing would be easy since sidney as appears likely has sent on the case unguarded well let us go in and see if sidney arrives with the case they passed out of the garden and sauntered round to the front of the house there standing in the roadway they beheld a ponderous lorry with a roughlooking driver standing at the horses heads the front door of the house was open so the mummy case had apparently arrived before its time and had been taken to braddocks museum while they were chatting in the kitchen garden did mr bolton come with the case asked lucy leaning over the railings and addressing the driver no one came miss except myself and my two mates who have taken the case indoor the driver jerked a coarse thumb over his shoulder was mr bolton at the hotel where the case remained for the night no missthat is i dunno who mr bolton is the landlord of the sailors rest told me and my mates to take the case to this here house and we done it thats all i know miss strange murmured lucy walking to the front door what do you think archie isnt it strange hope nodded but i daresay bolton will explain his absence said he following her he will arrive in time to open the mummy case along with the professor i hope so said miss kendal who looked much perplexed i cant understand sidney abandoning the case when it might so easily have been stolen come in and see my father archie and she passed into the house followed by the young man whose curiosity was now aroused as they entered the door the two men who had taken in the case blundered out and shortly drove away on the lorry towards jessum railway station in the museum they found braddock purple with rage and swearing vigorously he was staring at a large packing case which had been set up on end against the wall while beside him crouched cockatoo holding chisels and hammers and wedges necessary to open the treasure trove so the precious mummy has arrived father said lucy who saw that the professor was furious are you not pleased pleased pleased shouted the angry man of science how can i be pleased when i see how badly the case has been treated see how it has been bruised and battered and shaken ill have an action against captain hervey of the diver if my mummy has been injured sidney should have taken better care of so precious an object what does he say asked archie glancing round the museum to see if the delinquent had arrived say shouted braddock again and snatching a chisel from cockatoo oh what can he say when he is not here not here said lucy more and more surprised at the unaccountable absence of braddocks assistant where is he then i dont know i wish i did id have him arrested for neglecting to watch over this case as it is when he comes back ill dismiss him from my employment he can go back to his infernal laundry work along with his old witch of a mother but why hasnt bolton come back sir asked hope sharply braddock struck a furious blow at the head of the chisel which he had inserted into the case i want to know that he brought the case to the sailors rest and should have come on with it this morning instead of doing so he tells the landlorda most unreliable manto send it on and my precious mummythe mummy that has cost nine hundred pounds cried braddock working furiously and battering the chisel as though it were boltons head is left to be stolen by any scientific thief that comes along while the professor assisted by cockatoo loosened the lid of the packing case a mild voice was heard at the door lucy turned as did archie to see widow anne curtseying on the threshold of the door braddock himself took no notice of her entrance being occupied with his task and even while doing it swore scientifically under his breath he was furious against bolton for neglect of duty and hope rather sympathized with him it was a serious matter to have left a valuable object like the green mummy to the rough care of laborers i beg your pardon my lady whimpered widow anne who looked more lean and rusty and dismal than ever but has my sid come i saw the cart and the coffin wheres my boy coffin coffin bellowed braddock angrily between thunder blows what do you mean by calling this case a coffin well it do hold one of them camphorated corps sir said mrs bolton with another curtsey my boy sid told me as much afore he went to them furren parts have you seen him since he returned questioned lucy while braddock and cockatoo strained at the lid now nearly off why i aint set eyes on him moaned the widow dismally and summat tells me as i never will dont talk rubbish woman said archie tartly for he did not wish lucy to be upset again by this ancient ghoul woman indeed sir id have you knowoh the widow jumped and quavered as the lid of the packing case fell on the floor with a bang oh lor sir the start you did give me but braddock had no eyes for her and no ears for anyone he pulled lustily at the straw packing and soon the floor was littered with rubbish but no green case appeared and no mummy suddenly widow anne shrieked again theres my siddeadoh my son dead dead she spoke truly the body of sidney bolton was before them chapter v mystery after that one cry of agony from widow anne there was silence for quite one minute the terrible contents of the packing case startled and terrified all present faint and white lucy clung to the arm of her lover to keep herself from sinking to the ground as mrs bolton had done archie stared at the grotesque rigidity of the body as though he had been changed into stone while professor braddock stared likewise scarcely able to credit the evidence of his eyes only the kanaka was unmoved and squatted on his hams indifferently surveying the living and the dead as a savage he could not be expected to have the nerves of civilized man braddock who had dropped chisel and hammer in the first movement of surprise was the quickest to recover his powers of speech the sole question he asked revealed the marvelous egotism of a scientist nominated by one idea where is the mummy of inca caxas he murmured with a bewildered air widow anne groveling on the floor pulled her gray locks into wild confusion and uttered a cry of mingled rage and grief he asks that he asks that she cried stammering and choking when he has murdered my poor boy sid whats that demanded braddock sharply and recovering from a veritable stupor which the disappearance of the mummy and the sight of his dead assistant had thrown him into kill your son how could i kill your son what advantage would it have been to me had i killed your son god knows god knows sobbed the old woman but you mrs bolton you are raving said hope hastily and strove to raise her from the floor let miss kendal take you away and you go lucy this sight is too terrible for your eyes lucy inarticulate with nervous fear nodded and tottered towards the door of the museum but widow anne refused to be lifted to her feet my boy is dead she wailed my boy sid is a corp as i saw him in my dream in the coffin too cut to pieces rubbish rubbish interrupted braddock peering into the depths of the packing case i can see no wound mrs bolton leaped to her feet with an agility surprising in so aged a woman let me find the wound she screamed throwing herself forward hope caught her back and forced her towards the door no the body must not be disturbed until the police see it he said firmly the policeah yes the police remarked braddock quickly we must send for the police to pierside and tell them my mummy has been stolen that my boy has been murdered screeched widow anne waving her skinny arms and striving to break from archie you wicked old devil to kill my darling sid if he hadnt gone to them furren parts he wouldnt be a corp now but ill have the lawr youll be hanged youyou braddock lost his patience under this torrent of unjust accusations and rushed towards mrs bolton dragging cockatoo by the arm in less time than it takes to tell he had swept both archie and the widow out into the hall where lucy was trembling and cockatoo by his masters order was locking the door not a thing shall be touched until the police come hope you are a witness that i have not meddled with the dead you were present when i opened the packing case you have seen that a useless body has been substituted for a valuable mummy and yet this old witch daresdares braddock stamped and grew incoherent from sheer rage archie soothed him leaving go of widow annes arm to do so hush hush said the young man quietly the poor woman does not know what she is saying ill go for the police and no interrupted the professor sharply cockatoo can go for the inspector of pierside i shall call in the village constable meanwhile you keep the key of the museum he dropped it into hopes breastpocket so that you and the police may be sure the body has not been touched widow anne go home he turned angrily on the old creature who was now trembling after her burst of rage and dont dare to come here again until you ask pardon for what you have said i want to be near my poor boys corp wailed widow anne and im very sorry perfesser i didnt mean to but you have you witch go away and he stamped but by this time lucy had recovered her selfpossession which had been sorely shaken by the sight of the dead leave her to me she observed taking mrs boltons arm and leading her towards the stairs i shall take her to my room and give her some brandy father you must make some allowance for her natural grief and braddock stamped again take her away take her away he cried testily and keep her out of my sight is it not enough to have lost an invaluable assistant and a costly mummy of infinite historical and archaeological value without my being accused ofofoh the professor choked with rage and shook his hand in the air seeing that he was unable to speak lucy seized the opportunity of the lull in the storm and hurried the old woman sobbing and moaning up the stairs by this time the shrieks of mrs bolton and the wordy wrath of braddock had drawn the cook and her husband along with the housemaid from the basement to the ground floor the sight of their surprised faces only added to their masters anger and he advanced furiously go downstairs again go down i tell you but if theres anything wrong sir ventured the gardener timidly everything is wrong my mummy has been lost mr bolton has been murdered the police are coming andand he choked again but the servants waited to hear no more the mere mention of the words murder and police sent them palefaced and startled down to the basement where they huddled like a flock of sheep braddock looked around for hope but found that he had opened the front door and had vanished but he was too distracted to think why archie had gone and there was much to do in putting things straight beckoning to cockatoo he stalked into a side room and scribbled a pencil note to the inspector of police at pierside telling him of what had happened and asking him to come at once to the pyramids with his underlings this communication he dispatched by cockatoo who flew to get his bicycle in a short time he was riding at top speed to brefort which was on this side of the river facing pierside there he could ferry across to the town and deliver his terrible message having done all that he could until the police came braddock walked out of the front door and into the roadway to see if archie was in sight he could not see the young man but as luck would have it and by one of those coincidences which are much more common than is suspected he saw the gartley doctor walking briskly past hi shouted the professor who was purple in the face and perspiring profusely hi there dr robinson i want you come come hurry man hurry he ended in a testy rage and the doctor knowing braddocks eccentricities advanced with a smile he was a slim dark young medical practitioner with an amiable countenance which argued of no mighty intelligence well professor he remarked quietly do you want me to attend you for apoplexy take your time my dear sirtake your time he patted the scientist on the shoulder to soothe his clamorous rage you are already purple in the face dont let your blood rush to your head robinson youre aaa fool shouted braddock glaring at the suave looks of the doctor i am in perfect health damn you sir then miss kendal she is quite well also but bolton oh robinson looked interested has he returned with your mummy mummy bellowed braddock stamping like an insane cupidthe mummy hasnt arrived really professor you surprise me said the doctor mildly ill surprise you more growled braddock dragging robinson into the garden and up the steps gently gently my dear sir said the doctor who really began to think that much learning had made the professor mad didnt bolton bolton is dead you fool dead the doctor nearly tumbled backward down the steps murdered at least i think he is murdered at all events he arrived here today in the packing case which should have contained my green mummy come in and examine the body at once no braddock pushed back the doctor just as fiercely as he had dragged him forward wait until the constable comes i want him to see the body first and to observe that nothing has been touched i have sent for the pierside inspector to come there will be all sorts of trouble cried braddock despairingly and my workmost important workwill be delayed just because this silly young ass sidney bolton chose to be murdered and the professor stormed up and down the hall shaking impotent arms in the air good heavens stammered robinson who was young in years and somewhat new to his profession youyou must be mistaken mistaken mistaken shouted braddock with another glare come and see that poor fellows body then he is dead murdered by whom hang you sir how should i know in what way has he been murdered stabbed shot or i dont knowi dont know such a nuisance to lose a man like boltonan invaluable assistant what i shall do without him i really dont know and his mother has been here making no end of a fuss can you blame her said the doctor recovering his breath she is his mother after all and poor bolton was her only son i am not denying the relationship confound you snapped the professor ruffling his hair until it stood up like the crest of a parrot but she needntah he glanced through the open door and then rushed to the threshold here is hope and painter come income in i have the doctor here hope you have the key you observe constable that mr hope has the key open the door open the door and let us see the meaning of this dreadful crime crime sir queried the constable who had heard all that was known from hope but now wished to hear what braddock had to say yes crime crime you idiot i have lost my mummy but i thought sir that a murder oh of courseof course gabbled the professor as if the death was quite a minor consideration boltons deadmurdered i suppose as he could scarcely have nailed himself down in a packing case but its my precious mummy i am thinking of painter a mummyif you know what a mummy isthat cost me nine hundred pounds go in man go in and dont stand there gaping dont you see that mr hope has opened the door i have sent cockatoo to pierside to notify the police they will soon be here meanwhile doctor you can examine the body and painter here can give his opinion as to who stole my mummy the assassin stole the mummy said archie as the four men entered the museum and substituted the body of the murdered man that is all a b c snapped braddock issuing into the vast room but we want to know the name of the assassin if we are to revenge bolton and get back my mummy oh what a losswhat a loss i have lost nine hundred pounds or say one thousand considering the cost of bringing inca caxas to england archie forebore to remind the professor as to who had really lost the money as the scientist was not in a fit state to be talked to reasonably and seemed much more concerned because his peruvian relic of humanity had been lost than for the terrible death of sidney bolton but by this time paintera fairhaired young constable of small intelligencewas examining the packing case and surveying the dead dr robinson also looked with a professional eye and braddock wiping his purple face and gasping with exhaustion sat down on a stone sarcophagus archie folding his arms leaned against the wall and waited quietly to hear what the experts in crime and medicine would say the packing case was deep and wide and long made of tough teak and banded at intervals with iron bands within this was a case of tin which when it held the mummy had been soldered up impervious to air and water but the unknown person who had extracted the mummy to replace it by a murdered mans body had cut open the tin casing with some sharp instrument there was straw round the tin casing and straw within amongst which the body of the unfortunate young man was placed rigor mortis had set in and the corpse with straight legs and hands placed stiffly by its side lay against the back of the tin casing surrounded more or less by the straw packing or at least by so much as the professor had not torn away the face looked dark and the eyes were wide open and staring robinson stepped forward and ran his hand round the neck uttering an ejaculation he removed the woollen scarf which the dead man had probably worn to keep himself from catching cold and those who looked on saw that a redcolored window cord was tightly bound about the throat of the dead the poor devil has been strangled said the doctor quietly see the assassin has left the bowstring on and had the courage to place over it this scarf which belonged to bolton how do you know that sir asked painter heavily because widow anne knitted that scarf for bolton before he went to malta he showed it to me laughingly remarking that his mother evidently thought that he was going to lapland when did he show it to you sir before he went to malta of course said robinson in mild surprise you dont suppose he showed it to me when he returned when did he return to england he asked the professor with an afterthought yesterday afternoon about four oclock replied braddock then from the condition of the bodythe doctor felt the dead fleshhe must have been murdered last night hm with your permission painter ill examine the corpse the constable shook his head better wait sir until the inspector comes he said in his unintelligent way poor sid why i knew him he was at school with me and now hes dead who killed him none of his listeners could answer this question chapter vi the inquest like a geographical lord byron the isolated village of gartley awoke one morning to find itself famous previously unknown save to the inhabitants of brefort jessum and the surrounding country and to the soldiers stationed in the fort it became a nine days centre of interest inspector date of pierside arrived with his constables to inquire into the reported crime and the local journalists scenting sensation came flying to gartley on bicycles and in traps next morning london was duly advised that a valuable mummy was missing and that the assistant of professor braddock who had been sent to fetch it from malta was murdered by strangulation in a couple of days the three kingdoms were ringing with the news of the mystery and a mystery it proved to be for in spite of inspector dates efforts and the enterprise of scotland yard detectives summoned by the professor no clue could be found to the identity of the assassin briefly the story told by the newspapers ran as follows the tramp steamer divercaptain george hervey in commandhad berthed alongside the pierside jetty at four oclock on a wednesday afternoon in midseptember and some two hours later sidney bolton removed the case containing the green mummy ashore as it was impossible to carry the case to the pyramids on that night bolton had placed it in his bedroom at the sailors rest a mean little publichouse of no very savory reputation near the waters edge he was last seen alive by the landlord and the barmaid when after a drink of harmless gingerbeer he retired to bed at eight leaving instructions to the landlordoverheard by the barmaidthat the case was to be sent on next day to professor braddock of gartley bolton hinted that he might leave the hotel early and would probably precede the case to its destination so as to advise professor braddocknecessarily anxiousof its safe arrival before retiring he paid his bill and deposited in the landlords hand a small sum of money so that the case might be sent across stream to brefort thence to be taken in a lorry to the pyramids there was no sign said the barmaid and the landlord that bolton contemplated suicide or that he feared sudden death his whole demeanor was cheerful and he expressed himself exceedingly glad to be in england once more at eleven on the ensuing morning a persistent knocking and a subsequent opening of the door of boltons bedroom proved that he was not in the room although the tumbled condition of the bedclothes proved that he had taken some rest no one in the hotel thought anything of boltons absence since he had hinted at an early departure although the chambermaid considered it strange that no one had seen him leave the hotel the landlord obeyed boltons instructions and sent the case in charge of a trustworthy man to brefort across the river there a lorry was procured and the case was taken to gartley where it arrived at three in the afternoon it was then that professor braddock in opening the case discovered the body of his illfated assistant rigid in death and with a red window cord tightly bound round the throat of the corpse at once said the newspapers the professor sent for the police and later insisted that the smartest scotland yard detectives should come down to elucidate the mystery at present both police and detectives were engaged in searching for a needle in a haystack and so far had met with no success such was the tale set forth in the local and london and provincial journals widely as it was discussed and many as were the theories offered no one could fathom the mystery but all agreed that the failure of the police to find a clue was inexplicable it was difficult enough to understand how the assassin could have murdered bolton and opened the packing case and removed the mummy to replace it by the body of his victim in a house filled with at least half a dozen people but it was yet more difficult to guess how the criminal had escaped with so noticeable an object as the mummy bandaged with emeraldhued woollen stuff woven from the hair of peruvian llamas if the culprit was one who thieved and murdered for gain he could scarcely sell the mummy without being arrested since all england was ringing with the news of its disappearance if a scientist impelled to robbery by an archaeological mania he could not possibly keep possession of the mummy without someone learning that he possessed it meanwhile the thief and his plunder had vanished as completely as if the earth had swallowed both great was the wonder at the cleverness of the criminal and many were the solutions offered to account for the disappearance one enterprising weekly paper improving on the limerick craze offered a furnished house and three pounds a week for life to the fortunate person who could solve the mystery as yet no one had won the prize but it was early days yet and at least five thousand amateur detectives tried to work out the problem naturally hope was sorry for the untimely death of bolton whom he had known as an amiable and clever young man but he was also annoyed that his loan of the money to braddock should have been so to speak nullified by the loss of the mummy the professor was perfectly furious at his double loss of assistant and embalmed corpse and was only prevented from offering a reward for the discovery of the thief and assassin by the painful fact that he had no money he hinted to archie that a reward should be offered but that young man backed by lucy declined to throw away good money after bad braddock took this refusal so ill that hope felt perfectly convinced he would try and wriggle out of his promise to permit the marriage and persuade lucy to engage herself to sir frank random should the baronet be willing to offer a reward and hope was also certain that braddock a singularly obstinate man would never rest until he once more had the mummy in his possession that the murderer of sidney bolton should be hanged was quite a minor consideration with the professor meanwhile widow anne had insisted on the dead body being taken to her cottage and braddock with the consent of inspector date willingly agreed as he did not wish a newly dead corpse to remain under his roof therefore the remains of the unfortunate young man were taken to his humble home and here the body was inspected by the jury when the inquest took place in the coffeeroom of the warrior inn immediately opposite mrs boltons abode there was a large crowd round the inn as people had come from far and wide to hear the verdict of the jury and gartley for the first and only time in its existence presented the aspect of an august bank holiday the coroneran elderly doctor with a short temper caused by the unrealized ambition of a country practitioneropened the proceedings by a snappy speech in which he set forth the details of the crime in the same bold fashion in which they had been published by the newspapers a plan of the sailors rest was then placed before the jury and the coroner drew the attention of the twelve good and lawful men to the fact that the bedroom occupied by deceased was on the ground floor with a window looking out on to the river merely a stonethrow away so you will see gentlemen said the coroner that the difficulty of the assassin in leaving the hotel with his plunder was not so great as has been imagined he had merely to open the window in the quiet hours of the night when no one was about and pass the mummy through to his accomplice who probably waited without it is also probable that a boat was waiting by the bank of the river and the mummy having been placed in this the assassin and his friend could row away into the unknown without the slightest chance of discovery inspector datea tall thin upright man with an iron jaw and a severe expressiondrew the coroners attention to the fact that there was no evidence to show that the assassin had an accomplice what you have stated sir may have occurred rasped date in a military voice but we cannot prove the truth of your assumption since the evidence at our disposal is merely circumstantial i never suggested that it was anything else snapped the coroner you waste time in traversing my statements say what you have to say mr inspector and produce your witnessesif you have any there are no witnesses who can swear to the identity of the murderer said inspector date coldly and determined not to be ruffled by the apparent antagonism of the coroner the criminal has vanished and no one can guess his name or occupation or even the reason which led him to slay the deceased coroner the reason is plain he wanted the mummy inspector why should he want the mummy coroner that is what we wish to find out inspector exactly sir we wish to learn the reason why the murderer strangled the deceased coroner we know that reason what we wish to know is why the murderer stole the mummy and i would point out to you mr inspector that as yet we do not even know the sex of the assassin it might be a woman who murdered the deceased professor braddock who was seated near the door of the coffeeroom being even more irascible than usual rose to contradict there isnt a scrap of evidence to show that the murderer was a woman coroner you are out of order sir and i would point out that as yet inspector date has produced no witnesses date glared he and the coroner were old enemies and always sparred when they met it seemed likely that the peppery little professor would join in the quarrel and that there would be a duel of three but date not wishing for an adverse report in the newspapers as to his conduct of the case contented himself with the glare aforesaid and after a short speech called braddock the professor looking more like a cross cherub than ever gave his evidence tartly it seemed ridiculous to his prejudiced mind that all this fuss should be made over boltons body when the mummy was still missing however as the discovery of the criminal would assuredly lead to the regaining of that precious peruvian relic he curbed his wrath and answered the coroners questions in a fairly amiable fashion and after all braddock had very little to tell he had so he stated seen an advertisement in a newspaper that a mummy swathed in green bandages was to be sold in malta and had sent his assistant to buy it and bring it home this was done and what happened after the mummy left the tramp steamer was known to everyone through the medium of the press with which grumbled the professor i do not agree what do you mean by that asked the coroner sharply i mean sir snapped braddock equally sharply that the publicity given by the newspapers to these details will probably place the assassin on his guard why not on her guard persisted the coroner wilfully rubbish rubbish rubbish my mummy wasnt stolen by a woman what the devil would a woman want with my mummy be more respectful professor then talk sense doctor and the two glared at one another after a moment or two the situation was adjusted in silence and the coroner asked a few questions pertinent to the matter in hand had the deceased any enemies no sir he hadnt not being famous enough or rich enough or clever enough to excite the hatred of mankind he was simply an intelligent young man who worked excellently when supervised by me his mother is a washerwoman in this village and the lad brought washing to my house noting that he was intelligent and was anxious to rise above his station i engaged him as my assistant and trained him to do my work archaeological work yes i dont wash whatever boltons mother may do dont ask silly questions be more respectful said the coroner again and grew red have you any idea as to the name of anyone who desired to obtain possession of this mummy i daresay dozens of scientists in my line of business would have liked to get the corpse of inca caxas such as and he reeled out a list of celebrated men nonsense growled the coroner famous men like those you mention would not murder even for the sake of obtaining this mummy i never said that they would retorted braddock but you wanted to hear who would like to have the mummy and i have told you the coroner waived the question was there any jewelry on the mummy likely to attract a thief he asked how the devil should i know fumed the professor i never unpacked the mummy i never even saw it any jewelry buried with inca caxas would be bound up in the bandages so far as i know those bandages were never unwound you can throw no light on the subject no i cant bolton went to get the mummy and brought it home i understood that he would personally bring his precious charge to my house but he didnt why i dont know when the professor stepped down still fuming at what he considered were the unnecessary questions of the coroner the young doctor who had examined the corpse was called robinson deposed that deceased had been strangled by means of a red window cord and that from the condition of the body he would judge death had taken place some twelve hours more or less before the opening of the packing case by braddock that was at three oclock on thursday afternoon so in witnesss opinion the crime was committed between two and three on the previous morning but i cant be absolutely certain as to the precise hour added witness at any rate poor bolton was strangled after midnight and before three oclock that is a wide margin grumbled the coroner jealous of his brotherpractitioner were there any other wounds on the body no you can see for yourself if you have inspected the corpse the coroner thus reproved glared and widow anne appeared after robinson retired she stated with many sobs that her son had no enemies and was a good kind young man she also related her dream but this was flouted by the coroner who did not believe in the occult however the narration of her premonition was listened to with deep interest by those in the court widow anne concluded her evidence by asking how she was to live now that her boy sid was dead the coroner professed himself unable to answer this question and dismissed her samuel quass the landlord of the sailors rest was next called he proved to be a big burly redhaired redwhiskered man who looked like a sailor and indeed a few questions elicited the information that he was a retired seacaptain he gave his evidence gruffly but honestly and although he kept so shady a publichouse seemed straightforward enough he told much the same tale as had appeared in the newspapers in the hotel on that night there was only himself his wife and two children and the staff of servants bolton retired to bed saying that he might start early for gartley and paid one pound to get the case taken across to river and placed on a lorry as bolton had vanished next morning quass obeyed instructions with the result which everyone knew he also stated that he did not know the case contained a mummy what did you think it contained asked the coroner quickly clothes and curios from foreign parts said the witness coolly did mr bolton tell you so he told me nothing about the case growled the witness but he chatted a lot about malta which i know well having put into that port frequent when a sailor did he hint at any rows taking place at malta no he didnt did he say that he had enemies no he didnt did he strike you as a man who was in fear of death no he didnt said the witness for the third time he seemed happy enough i never thought for one moment that he was dead until i heard how his body had been found in the packing case the coroner asked all manner of questions and so did inspector date but all attempts to incriminate quass were vain he was bluff and straightforward and toldso far as could be judgedeverything he knew there was nothing for it but to dismiss him and eliza flight was called as the last witness she also proved to be the most important as she knew several things which she had not told to her master or to the reporters or even to the police on being asked why she had kept silence she said that her desire was to obtain any reward that might be offered but as she had heard that there would be no reward she was willing to tell what she knew it was an important piece of evidence the girl stated that bolton had retired to bed at eight on the ground floor and the bedroom had a windowas marked in the planwhich looked on to the river a stonethrow distant at nine or a trifle later witness went out to have a few words with her lover in the darkness she saw that the window was open and that bolton was talking to an old woman muffled in a shawl she could not see the womans face nor judge of her stature as she was stooping down to listen to bolton witness did not take much notice as she was in a hurry to see her lover when she returned past the window at ten oclock it was closed and the light was extinguished so she thought that mr bolton was asleep but to tell the truth said eliza flight i never thought anything of the matter at all it was only after the murder that i saw how important it was i should remember everything and you have yes sir said the girl honestly enough i have told you everything that happened on that night next morning she hesitated well what about next morning mr bolton had locked his door i know that because a few minutes after eight on the night before not knowing he had retired i tried to enter the room and make ready the bed for the night he sang out through the doorwhich was locked for i tried itthat he was in bed that was a lie also as after nine i saw him talking to the woman at the window you previously said an old woman said the coroner referring to his notes how do you know she was old i cant say if she was old or young said the witness candidly its only a manner of speaking she had a dark shawl over her head and a dark dress i couldnt say if she was old or young fair or dark stout or lean tall or short the night was dark the coroner referred to the plan there is a gaslamp near the window of the bedroom did you not see her in that light oh yes sir but just for a moment i took very little notice had i known that the gentleman was to be murdered i should have taken a great deal of notice well about this locked door it was locked overnight sir but when i went next morning it was not locked i knocked and knocked but could get no answer as it was eleven i thought the gentleman was sleeping very long so i tried to open the door it was not locked as i saybut added witness with emphasis the window was snibbed and the blind was down that is natural enough said the coroner mr bolton after his interview with the woman would of course snib the window and pull down the blind when he went away next morning he would unlock the door begging your pardon sir but as we know he didnt go away next morning being in the packing case nailed down the coroner could have kicked himself for the very natural mistake he had made for he saw a derisive grin on the faces around him and particularly on that of inspector date then the assassin must have gone out by the door he said weakly then i dont know how he got out cried eliza flight for i was up at six and the front and back doors of the hotel were locked and after six i was about in passages and rooms doing my work and master and missus and others were all over the place how could the murderer walk out sir without some of us seeing him perhaps you did and took no notice oh sir if a stranger was around we should all have taken notice this concluded the evidence which was meagre enough widow anne was indeed recalled to see if miss flight could identify her as the woman who had been talking to bolton but witness failed to recognize her and the widow herself proved by means of three friends that she had been imbibing gin at home on the night and at the hour in question also there was no evidence to connect this unknown woman with the murder and no soundaccording to the unanimous testimony of the inmates of the sailors resthad been heard in the bedroom of bolton yet as the coroner observed there must have been some knocking and hammering and ripping going on but of this nothing could be proved and although several witnesses were examined again not one could throw light on the mystery under these circumstances the jury could only bring in a verdict of wilful murder against some person or persons unknown which was done and it may be mentioned that the cord with which bolton had been strangled was identified by the landlord and the chambermaid as belonging to the blind of the bedroom window well said hope when the inquest was over so nothing can be proved against anyone what is to be done next ill tell you after i have seen random said the professor curtly chapter vii the captain of the diver the day after the inquest sidney boltons body was buried in gartley churchyard owing to the nature of the death and the publicity given to the murder by the press a great concourse of people assembled to witness the interment and there was an impressive silence when the corpse was committed to the grave afterwards as was natural much discussion followed on the verdict at the inquest it was the common opinion that the jury could have brought in no other verdict considering the nature of the evidence supplied but many people declared that captain hervey of the diver should have been called if the deceased had enemies said these wiseacres it was probable that he would have talked about them to the skipper but they forgot that the witnesses called at the inquest including the mother of the dead man had insisted that bolton had no enemies so it is difficult to see what they expected captain hervey to say after the funeral the journals made but few remarks about the mystery every now and then it was hinted that a clue had been found and that the police would sooner or later track down the criminal but all this loose chatter came to nothing and as the days went by the publicin london at all eventslost interest in the case the enterprising weekly paper that had offered the furnished house and the life income to the person who found the assassin received an intimation from the government that such a lottery could not be allowed the paper therefore returned to limericks and the amateur detectives like so many othellos found their occupation gone then a political crisis took place in the far east and the fickle public relegated the murder of bolton to the list of undiscovered crimes even the scotland yard detectives failing to find a clue lost interest in the matter and it seemed as though the mystery of boltons death would not be solved until the day of judgment in the village however people still continued to be keenly interested since bolton was one of themselves and moreover widow anne kept up a perpetual outcry about her murdered boy she had lost the small weekly sum which sidney had allowed her out of his wages so the neighbors the gentry of the surrounding country and the officers at the fort sent her ample washing to do widow anne in a few weeks had quite a large business considering the size of the village and philosophically observed to a neighbor that it was an ill wind which blew no one any good adding also that sidney was more good to her dead than alive but even in gartley the villagers grew weary of discussing a mystery which could never be solved and so the case became rarely talked about in these days of bustle and worry and competition it is wonderful how people forget even important events if a blue sun arose to lighten the world instead of a yellow one after nine days of wonder man would settle down quite comfortably to a cerulean existence such is the wonderful adaptability of humanity professor braddock was less forgetful as he always bore in mind the loss of his mummy and constantly thought of schemes whereby he could trap the assassin of his late secretary not that he cared for the dead in any way save from a strictly business point of view but the capture of the criminal meant the restitution of the mummy andas braddock told everyone with whom he came in contacthe was determined to regain possession of his treasure he went himself to the sailors rest and drove the landlord and his servants wild by asking tart questions and storming when a satisfactory answer could not be supplied quass was glad when he saw the plump back of the cross little man who so pertinaciously followed what everyone else had abandoned life was too short grumbled quass to be bothered in that way the wooing of archie and lucy went on smoothly and the professor showed no sign of wishing to break the engagement but hope as he confided to lucy was somewhat worried as his pauper uncle on an insufficient borrowed capital had begun to speculate in south african mines and it was probable that he would lose all his money in that case hope fancied he would be once more called upon to make good the avuncular loss and so the marriage would have to be postponed but it so happened that the pauper uncle made some lucky speculative shots and acquired money which he promptly reinvested in new mines of the wildcat description still for the moment all was well and the lovers had a few halcyon days of peace and happiness then came a bolt from the blue in the person of captain hervey who called a fortnight after the funeral to see the professor the skipper was a tall slim man lean as a fasting friar and hard as nails with closely clipped red hair mustache of the same aggressive hue and an american goatee he spoke with a yankee accent and in a truculent manner sufficiently annoying to the fiery professor when he met braddock in the museum the two became enemies at the first glance and because both were badtempered and obstinate took an instant dislike to one another like did not draw to like in this instance what do you want to see me about asked braddock crossly he had been summoned by cockatoo from the perusal of a new papyrus to see his visitor and consequently was not in the best of tempers ive jes blew in fur a trifle of chinmusic replied hervey with an emphatic usa accent im busy get out was the uncomplimentary reply hervey took a chair and stretching his lengthy legs produced a black cheroot as long and lean as himself if you were in the states professor id draw a bead on you for that style of lingo im not taking any see and he lighted up youre the captain of the diver thats so i was that is now ive shifted to a dandy windjammer of sorts that can run rings round the old barky i surmise im off for the south seas pearlfishing in three months ill take that kanaka along with me if ylike professor and he cast a side glance at cockatoo who was squatting on his hams as usual polishing a blue enameled jar from a theban tomb i require the services of the man said braddock stiffly as to you sir youve been paid for your business in connection with boltons passage and the shipment of my mummy so there is no more to be said heaps more heaps you bet remarked the man of the sea placidly and controlling a temper which in less civilized parts would have led him to wipe the floor with the plump scientist my owners were paid fur that racket not me no sir so ive paddled into this port to see if i can rake in a few dollars on my own ive no dollars to give youin charity that is huh an who asked charity you baldheaded jellybag braddock grew scarlet with fury if you speak to me like that you ruffian ill throw you out whatyou yes me and the professor stood on tiptoe like the bantam he was you make me smile and likewise tired murmured hervey admiring the little mans pluck see here professor touching that mummy my mummy my green mummy what about it braddock rose to the fly thrown by this skilful angler thats so what will you shell out if i pass along that corpse ah the professor again stood on tiptoe gasping and purple in the face he almost squeaked in the extremity of his anger i knew it knew what demanded the skipper genuinely surprised i knew that you had stolen my mummy yes you neednt deny it bolton like the silly fool he was told you how valuable the mummy was and you strangled the poor devil to get my property go slow said the captain in no wise perturbed by this accusation i would have you remember that at the inquest it was stated that the window was locked and the door was open how then could i waltz into that blamed hotel and arrange for a funeral sides i guess shooting is morn my line than garrotting i leave that to the east coast yellowstomachs braddock sat down and wiped his face he saw plainly enough that he had not a leg to stand on as hervey was plainly innocent sides went on the skipper chewing his cheroot i guess if id wanted that old corpse of yours id have yanked bolton overside and set down the accident to bad weather better fur me to loot the case aboard than to make a fool of myself ashore no sir hh dont run is own perticler private circus in that blamed way hh who the devil is hh me you bet hiram hervey citizen of the usa nantucket neighborhood for home life and see dont you get mhair riz or ill scalp you cant scalp me chuckled braddock passing his hand over a very bald head see here what do you want name a price and ill float round to get back your verdant corpse i thought you were going to the south seas in three months pearlfishing lots of time i reckon to run this old circus i want you to finance have you any suspicions no sept i dont believe in that window business what do you mean braddock sat upright well drawled the yankee ysee i interviewed the gal as told that perticler lie in court eliza flight was it a lie she told well not exactly the window was snibbed but that was done after the chap who sent your pal to kingdom come had got out do you mean to say that the window was locked from the outside asked braddock and then when hervey nodded he exclaimed impossible narry an impossibility you bet the chap who engineered the circus was allfired smart the snib was an old one and he yanked a piece of string round it and passed the string through the crack between the upper and lower sash of the window when outside he pulled and the snib slid into place but he left the string on the ground outside i picked it up nex day and guessed the racket hed been on i tried the same business and brought off the deal it sounds wonderful and yet impossible cried braddock rubbing his bald head and walking excitedly to and fro see here ill come along with you and see how its done you bet you wont unless you shell out see herehervey leaned forwardfrom that window business its plain that no one inside the shanty corpsed your pal the chap as did it entered and left by the window and made tracks with that old corp you want now you pass along five hundred poundsthats english currency i reckonand ill smell round for the robber and where do you think i can obtain five hundred pounds asked the professor very dryly well i guess if that blamed corpse is worth it youll be willing to trade ydont live in this shanty for nothing my good friend i have enough to live on and obtain this house at a small rent on account of its isolation but i can no more find the sum of five hundred pounds than fly hervey rose and straightened his legs then i guess id best be getting back to pierside one moment sir did anything happen on the voyagedid bolton say anything likely to lead you to suppose that he was in danger of being robbed and murdered no said the skipper musingly and pulling his goatee he told me that he had secured the old corpse and was bringing it home to you i didnt talk much to bolton he wasnt my style have you any idea who killed him no i aint then how do you propose to find the criminal who has the mummy you give me five hundred pounds and see said hervey coolly i havent got the money then i reckon you dont get the corpse so long and the skipper strolled towards the door braddock followed him you have a clue no ive got nothing not even that five hundred pounds you make such a fuss over its a wasted day with hh i surmise wait he scribbled on a card and flung it across the room thats my pierside address if you should change your blamed mind the professor picked up the card the sailors rest what are you stopping there then when hervey nodded he cried violently why i believe you have a clue and stop at the hotel to follow it up maybe i do and maybe i dont retorted the captain opening the door with a jerk anyhow i dont hunt for that corpse without the dollars when hiram hervey departed the professor raged up and down the room so violently that cockatoo was cowed by his anger apparently this american skipper knew of something which might lead to the discovery of the assassin and incidentally to the restoration of the green mummy to its rightful owner but he would not make a move unless he was paid five hundred pounds and braddock did not know where to procure that amount having long since made himself acquainted with hopes financial condition he knew well that there was no chance of getting a second check in that quarter of course there was random whom he had heard casually had returned from his yachting cruise and was now back again at the fort but random was in love with lucy and would probably only give or lend the money on condition that the professor helped him with his wooing in that case since lucy was engaged to hope there would be some difficulty in altering present conditions but having arrived at this point of his somewhat angry meditations braddock sent cockatoo with a message to his stepdaughter saying that he wished to see her ill see if she really loves hope thought the professor rubbing his plump hands if she doesnt there may be a chance of her throwing him over to become lady random then i can get the money and indeed soliloquized the professor virtuously i must point out to her that it is wrong of her to make a poor marriage when she can gain a wealthy husband i will only be doing my duty by my dear dead wife by preventing her wedding poverty but girls are so obstinate and lucy is a thorough girl his amiable anxiety on behalf of miss kendal was only cut short by the entrance of the young lady herself professor braddock then showed his hand too plainly by evincing a strong wish to conciliate her in every way he procured her a seat he asked after her health he told her that she was growing prettier every day and in all ways behaved so unlike his usual self that lucy became alarmed and thought that he had been drinking why have you sent for me she asked anxious to come to the point aha braddock put his venerable head on one side like a roguish bird and smiled in an infantine manner i have good news for you about the mummy she demanded innocently no about flesh and blood which you prefer sir frank random has arrived back at the fort there i know that was miss kendals unexpected reply his yacht came to pierside on the same afternoon as the diver arrived oh indeed said the professor struck by the coincidence and with a stare how do you know archie met sir frank the other day and learned as much what braddock struck a tragic attitude do you mean to say that those two young men speak to one another yes why not they are friends oh braddock became roguish again i fancied they were lovers of a certain young lady who is in this room by this time lucy was beginning to guess what her stepfather was aiming at and grew correspondingly angry archie is my sole lover now she remarked stiffly sir frank knows that we are engaged and is quite ready to be the friend of us both and he calls that love idiot cried the professor much disgusted but i would point out to you lucyand i do so because of my deep affection for you dear childthat sir frank is wealthy so is archiein my love nonsense nonsense that is mere foolish romance he has no money you should not say that archie had money to the extent of one thousand pounds which he gave you one thousand pounds a mere nothing consider lucy that if you marry random you will have a title miss kendal whose patience was getting exhausted stamped a very neat boot i dont know why you talk in this way father i wish to see you happy then your wish is granted you do see me happy but i wont be happy long if you keep bothering me to marry a man i dont care two straws about i am going to be mrs hope so there my dear child said the professor who always became paternal when most obstinate i have reason to believe that the green mummy can be discovered and poor sidneys death avenged if a reward of five hundred pounds is offered if hope can give me that money he will not i shall not allow him to he has lost too much already in that case i must apply to sir frank random well apply she snapped being decidedly angry its none of my business i dont want to hear anything about it it is your business miss cried braddock growing angry in his turn and becoming very pink you know that only by getting you to marry random can i procure the money oh said lucy coldly so this is why you sent for me now father i have had enough of this you gave your consent to archie being engaged to me in exchange for one thousand pounds as i love him i shall abide by the word you gave if i had not loved him i should have refused to marry him you understand i understand that i have a very obstinate girl to deal with you shall marry as i choose i shall do nothing of the sort you have no right to dictate my choice of a husband no right when i am your father you are not my father merely my stepfathermerely a relation by marriage i am of age i can do as i like and intend to but lucy implored braddock changing his tune think i have thought i marry archie but he is poor and random is rich i dont care i love archie and i dont love frank would you have me lose the mummy for ever yes i would if my misery is to be the price of its restoration why should i sell myself to a man i care nothing about just because you want a musty fusty old corpse now i am going lucy walked to the door i shant listen to another word and if you bother me again i shall marry archie at once and leave the house i can make you leave it in any case you ungrateful girl bellowed braddock who was purple with rage never having a very good temper at the best of times look what i have done for you miss kendal could have pointed out that her stepfather had done nothing save attend to himself but she disdained such an argument and without another word opened the door and walked out almost immediately afterwards cockatoo entered much to the relief of the professor who relieved his feelings by kicking the unfortunate kanaka then he sat down again to consider ways and means of obtaining the necessary mummy and still more necessary money chapter viii the baronet sir frank random was an amiable young gentleman withas the saying goesall his goods in the shop window fairhaired and tall with a wellknit athletic figure a polished manner and a manoftheworld air he strictly resembled the romantic officer of bow bells family herald young ladies journal fiction but the romance was all in his wellgroomed looks as he was as commonplace a saxon as could be met with in a days march fond of sport attentive to his duties as artillery captain and devoted to what is romantically known as the fair sex he sauntered easily through life very well contented with himself and with his agreeable surroundings he read fiction when he did read and those weekly papers devoted to sport troubled his head very little about politics save when they had to do with a possible german invasion and was always ready to do any one a good turn his brotherofficers declared that he was not half a bad sort which was high praise from the usually reticent service man his capacity may be accurately gauged by the fact that he did not possess a single enemy and that every one spoke well of him a mortal who possesses no quality likely to be envied by those around him is certain to belong to the rank and file of humanity but these unconsidered units of mankind can always console themselves with the undoubted fact that mediocrity is invariably happy such a man as random would never set the thames on fire and certainly he had no ambition to perform that astounding feat he was fond of his profession and intended to remain in the army as long as he could he desired to marry and beget a family and retire when set free from soldiering to his country seat and there perform blamelessly the congenial role of a village squire until called upon to join the respectable corpses in the random vault not that he was a saint or ever could be one neither black nor white he was simply gray being an ordinary mixture of good and bad as theology has provided no hereafter for gray people it is hard to imagine where the bulk of humanity will go but doubts on this point never troubled random he went to church kept his mouth shut and his pores open and vaguely believed that it would be all right somehow a very comfortable if superficial philosophy indeed it can easily be guessed that randoms somewhat colorless personality would never attract lucy kendal since the hues of her own character were deeper for this reason she was drawn to hope who possessed that aggressive artistic temperament where good and bad are in violent contrast random took opinions from books or from other people and his mind like a lookingglass reflected whatever came along but hope possessed opinions of his own both right and wrong and held to these in the face of all verbal opposition he could argue and did argue when random simply agreed lucy had similar idiosyncrasies inherited from a clever father so it was just as well that she preferred archie to frank had the latter young gentleman married her he would have dwindled to lady randoms husband and would have found too late that he had domesticated a kind of imitation george eliot when he congratulated archie on his engagement somewhat ruefully he little thought what an escape he had had but professor braddock who did not belong to the gray tribe knew nothing of this as his egyptological studies did not permit him time to argue on such commonplace matters he therefore failed in advance when he set out to persuade random into renewing his suit as the fiery little man afterwards expressed himself i might as well have talked to a mollusc for random politely declined to be used as an instrument to forward the professors ambition at the cost of miss kendals unhappiness the interview took place in sir franks quarters at the fort on the day after hervey had called to propose a search for the corpse and it was during this interview that braddock learned something which both startled and annoyed him random at three oclock had just changed into mufti when the professor was announced by his servant braddock determined to give his host no chance of denying himself followed close on the mans heels and was in the room almost before sir frank had read the card it was a bare room sparsely furnished according to the war offices idea of comfort and although the baronet had added a few more civilized necessities it still looked somewhat dismal braddock who liked comfort shook hands carelessly with his host and cast a disapproving eye on his surroundings dog kennel dog kennel grumbled the polite professor bare desolation like a damned dungeon you might as well live in the sahara it would certainly be warmer replied random who knew the scientists snappy ways very well take a chair sir hard as bricks confound it hand me over a cushion there thats better no i never drink between meals thank you smoke hang it random you should know by this time that i dislike making a chimney of my throat there there dont fuss take a seat and listen to what i have to say its important poke the fire please its cold random placidly did as he was told and then lighted a cigar as he sat down quietly i am sorry to hear of your trouble sir trouble trouble what particular trouble the death of your assistant oh yes silly young ass to get killed lost my mummy too theres trouble if you like the green mummy random looked into the fire yes i have heard of the green mummy i should think you have snapped braddock warming his plump hands every pennyaliner has been talking about it when did you return on the same day that that steamer with the mummy on board arrived was randoms odd reply the professor stared suspiciously i dont see why you should date your movements by my mummy he retorted well i had a reason in doing so what reason the mummy what about itdo you know where it is braddock started to his feet and looked eagerly at the calm face of his host no i wish i did how much did you pay for it professor whats that to you snapped the other resuming his seat nothing at all but it is a great deal to don pedro de gayangos and who the deuce is he some spanish egyptologist i dont think he is an egyptologist sir he must be if he wants my mummy you forget professor that the green mummy comes from peru who denied that it did sir you are illogicalinfernally so the little man rose and straddled on the hearthrug with his back to the fire and his hands under his coattails now sir he said glaring at the young man like a schoolmasterwhat the deuce are you talking about out with it no evasion oh hang it professor dont jump down my throat spurs and all said random rather annoyed by this dictatorial tone i never wear spurs go on sir and dont argue sir frank could not help laughing although he knew that it was useless to induce braddock to be civil not that the professor meant to be rude especially as he desired to conciliate random but long years of fighting with other scientists and of having his own scientific way had turned him into a kind of schoolmaster and every one knows that they are the most domineering of the human race its a long story said the baronet with a shrug and a smile story story what story that which i am about to tell you and then random began hurriedly so as to prevent further arguments of an unprofitable kind i was at genoa with my yacht and there stopped on shore at the casa bianca what place is that an hotel i there met with a certain don pedro de gayangos and his daughter donna inez he was a gentleman from lima and had come to europe in search of the green mummy braddock stared and what did this confounded spaniard want with my green mummy he demanded indignantly how did he know of its existencewhat reason had he to try and obtain it answer sir i shall let don pedro answer himself said random dryly he arrives in a couple of days and intends to take rooms at the warrior inn along with his daughter then you can question him professor i question you snapped braddock angrily and i am answering to the best of my ability don pedro told me nothing beyond the fact that he wanted the mummy and had come to europe to get it in some way he learned that it was in malta and was for sale quite so quite so rasped the professor he saw the advertisement in the newspapers as i did and wanted to buy it over my head oh he wanted to buy it right enough and wired to malta said random but in reply he received a letter stating that it had been sold to you and was being taken to england on the diver i followed the diver in my yacht and arrived at pierside an hour after she did ah braddock glared i begin to see light this infernal spaniard was on board and wanted my mummy he knew that bolton had taken it to the sailors rest and went there to kill the poor lad and get my nothing of the sort interrupted sir frank impatiently don pedro remained behind in genoa intending to write and ask if you would sell him the mummy i wrote and told him of the murder of your assistant and related all that had happened he wired to me that he was coming to england at once asas i told you he will be in gartley in a couple of days that is the whole story it is a sufficiently strange one grumbled braddock frowning what does he want with my mummy i cannot tell you but if you will sell sell sell sell vociferated braddock furiously don pedro will give you a good price finished random calmly i havent got the mummy said the professor sitting down and wiping his pink head and if i had i certainly would not sell however ill hear what this gentleman has to say when he arrives perhaps he can throw some light on the mystery of this crime i am perfectly certain that he cannot sir don pedroas i saidwas left behind in genoa humph said the professor unconvinced he could easily employ a third party random rose looking and feeling annoyed i assure you that don pedro is a gentleman and a man of honor he would not stoop to there there braddock waved his hands sit down sit down you shouldnt say such things professor i say what i desire to say retorted the old gentleman tartly but we can dismiss the subject for the time being i am only too glad to do so said random who was ruffled out of his usual calm by the veiled accusation which braddock had brought against his foreign friend and to get to a more agreeable subject tell me how miss kendal is keeping she is ill very ill said the professor solemnly ill why hope whom i met the other day said that she was feeling very well and very happy so hope thinks because he has forced her into an engagement random started to his feet forced her nonsense it isnt nonsense and dont dare to speak like that to me sir i repeat that lucypoor childis breaking her heart for you the young man stared and then broke into a hearty laugh pardon me sir but that is impossible it isnt confound you said braddock who did not like being laughed at i know women you dont know your daughter stepdaughter you mean ah perhaps the more distant relationship accounts for your ignorance of her character said random dryly you are quite wrong i was in love with miss kendal and asked her to be my wife before i went on leave she refused me saying that she loved hope and because of her refusal i took my broken heart to monte carlo where i lost much more money than i had any right to lose your broken heart seems to have mended quickly said braddock who was trying to suppress his wrath at this instance of lucys duplicity for so he considered it oh pooh its only my way of speaking laughed the young man if my heart had been really broken i should not have mentioned the fact then you did not love lucy and you dared to play fast and loose with her affections raged braddock stamping you are quite wrong said sir frank sharply i did love miss kendal or i should certainly not have asked her to be my wife but when she told me that she loved another man i stood aside as any fellow would you should have insisted on on nothing sir i am not the man to force a woman to give me a heart which belongs to another person i am very glad that miss kendal is engaged to hope as he is a capital fellow and will make her a better husband than i ever could have made her besides random shrugged his shoulders one nail drives another out humph that means you love another i am not bound to tell you my private affairs professor quite so quite so but inez is a pretty and romantic name i dont know what you are talking about sir said random stiffly braddock chuckled having read the truth in the flush which had crept over randoms tanned face i ask your pardon he said elaborately i am an old man and i was your fathers friend you must not mind if i have been a trifle inquisitive say no more sir that is all right i dont agree with you random things are not all right and never will be until my mummy is discovered now you can help me in what way asked the other uneasily with money understand my boy added the professor in a genial way which he knew well how to assume i should have preferred lucy becoming your wife however since she prefers hope theres no more to be said on that score i therefore will not make the offer i came here to make an offer sir yes i fancied that you loved lucy and were brokenhearted by the news of her engagement to hope i therefore intended to ask you to give me or rather lend me five hundred pounds on condition that i helped you to stop professor said random coloring i should never have bought miss kendal as my wife on those terms of course of course andas i saythere is no more to be said i shall therefore agree to lucys engagement to hopebraddock carefully omitted to say that he had already agreed and had been paid one thousand pounds to agreeand will congratulate you when you lead donna inez to the altar i never said anything about donna inez professor braddock of course not modern reticence however i can see through a brick wall as well as most people i understand so let us drop the subject my boy and this five hundred pounds i cannot lend it to you professor the fact is i lost heaps of coin at monte carlo and am not in a position to very good let us shelve that also said braddock with apparent heartiness although he was really very angry at his failure i am sorry though as i wish to get back the mummy and to revenge poor sidney boltons death how can the five hundred do that asked random with interest well drawled the professor with his eyes on the young mans attentive face captain hervey of the diver came to me yesterday and proposed to search for the assassin and his plunder on condition that i paid him five hundred pounds i am as you know very poor for a scientist and so i wished to borrow the five hundred from you on condition that lucy we wont talk of that again said random hurriedly but do you mean to say that this captain hervey knows of anything likely to solve this mystery he says that he does not and merely proposes to search from what i have seen of the man i should think that he had all the capacities of a good bloodhound and would certainly succeed but he will not move a step without money five hundred pounds murmured random thoughtfully while the professor watched him closely i can tell you how to obtain it how in what way don pedro seems to be rich and he wants the mummy said the baronet so when he comes here ask him to certainly not certainly not raged braddock clapping on his hat in a fury how dare you make such a proposition to me random if this don pedro offers the reward and hervey finds the mummy he will simply hand it over to your friend he can scarcely do that since you have bought the mummy but don pedro is willing to purchase it from you humph braddock moved to the door thinking i shall reserve my decision until this man arrives good day and he departed random did not attempt to detain him as he was somewhat weary of the professors vagaries he knew very well that braddock would call on don pedro when he came to the warrior inn and join forces with him in searching for the lost goods and the train of thought initiated by the professors visit led random to a certain drawer whence he took the photograph of a splendidlooking beauty to this he pressed his lips i wonder if your father will give you to me in exchange for that mummy he thought and kissed the pictured face again chapter ix mrs jashers luck some weeks had now elapsed since the death and burial of sidney bolton and the excitement had simmered down to a gentle speculation as to who had killed him this question was discussed in a halfhearted manner round the winter fires of gartley but gradually people were ceasing to interest themselves in a crime the mystery of which would apparently never be solved life went on in the village and at the pyramids much in the same way save that the professor attended along with cockatoo to his museum and did not engage another assistant archie and lucy were perfectly happy as they looked forward to being married in the spring and braddock showed no desire to interfere with their engagement they knew of course that he had called upon sir frank but were ignorant of what had taken place random himself called at the pyramids to congratulate miss kendal on her engagement and seemed so very pleased that she was going to marry the man of her choice that womanlike she grew rather annoyed as the baronet had been her lover she thought that he should wear the willow for her sake but random showed no disposition to do so therefore lucy shrewdly guessed that his broken heart had been mended by another woman the professor could have confirmed the truth of this from the hints which random had given him but he said nothing about his interview with the young man nor did he mention that a spanish gentleman from peru was seeking for the famous green mummy considerably vexed that random should be so cheerful lucy cast round to learn the truth she could scarcely ask the baronet himself and archie professed himself unable to explain miss kendal did not dream of crossexamining braddock as it never entered her mind that the dryasdust scientist would know anything it then occurred to this inquisitive young lady that mrs jasher might be aware of randoms secret which made him so cheerful sir frank was a great friend of the plump widow and frequently went to take afternoon tea at her small house which was situated no great distance from the fort in fact mrs jasher entertained the officers largely as she was hospitable by nature and liked to have presentable men about her for flirting purposes with goodlooking youth she assumed the maternal air and in the role of a clever woman of the world professed to be the adviser of one and all in this way she became quite a favorite and her little parlorshe liked the old english wordwas usually well filled at the hour of afternoon tea twice already lucy had called on mrs jasher after the commotion caused by the crime as she wished to speak to her about the same but on each occasion the widow proved to be absent in london however the third visit proved to be more lucky for mrs jasher was at home and expressed herself happy to see the girl so good of you to come and see me in my little wooden hut said the widow kissing her guest and mrs jashers cottage really was a little wooden hut being what was left of an oldfashioned farmhouse built before the stone age it lay on the verge of the marshes in an isolated position and was placed in the middle of a square garden protected from the winter floods by a low stone wall solidly built but of no great height the road to the fort ran past the front part of the garden but behind the marshes spread towards the embankment which cut off the view of the thames the situation was not an ideal one nor was the cottage but money was scarce with mrs jasher and she had obtained the whole place at a surprisingly small rental the house and grounds were dry enough in summer but decidedly damp in winter therefore the widow went to a flat in london as a rule for the season of fogs but this winter she had made up her mindso she told lucyto remain in her own little castle and brave the watery humors of the marshes i can always keep fires burning in every room said mrs jasher when she had removed her guests hat and had settled her for a confidential talk on the sofa and after all my dear there is no place like home the room was small and mrs jasher was small so she suited her surroundings excellently also the widow had the good taste to furnish it sparsely instead of crowding it with furniture but what furniture there was could not be improved upon there were chippendale chairs a louis quinze table a sheridan cabinet and a satinwood desk handpainted which was said to have been the property of the unhappy marie antoinette oilpaintings adorned the rosetinted walls chiefly landscapes although one or two were portraits also there were watercolored pictures framed and signed caricatures many plates of old china and ricepaper adornments from canton the room was essentially feminine being filled with indian stuffs with silver oddments with flowers and with other trifles the walls the carpet the hangings and the upholstery of the armchairs were all of a rosy hue so that mrs jasher looked as young as dame holda in the venusberg a very pretty room and a very charming hostess was the verdict of the young gentlemen from the fort who came here to flirt when they were not serving their country mrs jasher in a tearose teagown for afternoon teashe always liked to be in keepingrang for that beverage dear to the feminine heart and lighted a roseshaded lamp when a glow as of dawn spread through the dainty room she settled lucy on the sofa near the fire and drew up an armchair on the other side of the hearthrug outside it was cold and foggy but the rosehued curtains shut out all that was disagreeable in the weather and in the absence of male society the two women talked more or less confidentially lucy did not dislike mrs jasher even though she fancied that the lively widow was planning to become the mistress of the pyramids well my dear girl said mrs jasher shading her face from the fire with a large fan and how is your dear father after his late terrible experiences he is perfectly well and rather cross replied lucy smiling cross of course he has lost that wretched mummy and poor sidney bolton oh i dont think he cares for poor sidneys death beyond the fact that he misses his services but the mummy cost nine hundred pounds and father is much annoyed especially as peruvian mummies are somewhat hard to obtain you see mrs jasher father wishes to see the difference between the peruvian and egyptian modes of embalming ugh how gruesome mrs jasher shuddered but has anything been discovered likely to show who killed this poor lad no the whole thing is a mystery mrs jasher looked into the fire over the top of the fan i have read the papers she said slowly and have gathered what i could from what the reporters explained but i intend to call on the professor and hear all that evidence which did not get into the papers i think that everything has been made public the police have no clue to the murderer why do you want to know mrs jasher made a movement of surprise why i am the professors friend of course my dear and naturally i want to help him to solve this mystery there is no chance so far as i can see of it ever being solved said lucy its very sweet of you of course but were i you i should not talk about it to my father why asked mrs jasher quickly because he thinks of nothing else and both archie and i are trying to get him off the subject the mummy is lost and poor sidney is buried there is no more to be said still if a reward was offered my father is too poor to offer a reward and the government will not do so and as people will not work without money why lucy completed her sentence with a shrug i might offer a reward if the dear professor will let me said the widow unexpectedly you but i thought that you were poor as we are i was and i am not very rich now all the same i have come in for some thousands of pounds i congratulate you a legacy yes you remember how i told you about my brother who was a pekin merchant he is dead oh i am so sorry my dear what is the use of being sorry i never cry over spilt milk or assume a virtue which i have not my brother and i were almost strangers as we lived apart for so many years however he came home to die at brighton and a few weeks agojust after this murder took place in facti was summoned to his deathbed he lingered on until last week and died in my arms he left me nearly all his money so i will be able to help the professor i dont see why you should said lucy wondering why mrs jasher did not wear mourning for the dead oh yes you do see remarked the widow raising her eyes and rubbing her plump hands together i want to marry your father lucy did not express astonishment as she had understood this for a long time i guessed as much and what do you say miss kendal shrugged her shoulders if my stepfather she emphasized the wordif my stepfather consents why should i mind i am going to marry archie and no doubt the professor will be lonely then you do not disapprove of me as a mother my dear mrs jasher said lucy coldly there is no relationship between me and my stepfather beyond the fact that he married my mother therefore you can never be my mother were i stopping on at the pyramids that question might arise but as i become mrs hope in six months we can be friendsnothing more i am quite content with that said mrs jasher in a businesslike way after all i am no sentimentalist but i am glad that you do not mind my marrying the professor as i dont want you to prevent the match my dear lucy laughed i assure you that i have no influence with my father mrs jasher he will marry you if he thinks fit and without consulting me but added the girl with emphasis i do not see what you gain in becoming mrs braddock i may become lady braddock said the widow dryly then in answer to the open astonishment on lucys face she hastened to remark do you mean to say that you dont know your father is heir to a baronetcy oh i know that rejoined miss kendal the professors brother sir donald braddock is an old man and unmarried if he dies without heirs as it seems likely the professor will certainly take the title well then there you are cried mrs jasher in her liveliest tone i want to give my legacy for the title and preside over a scientific salon in london i understand but you will never get my father to live in london wait until i marry him said the little woman shrewdly ill make a man of him i know of course that mummies and sepulchral ornaments and those sort of horrid things are dull but the professor will become sir julian braddock and that is enough for me i dont love him of course as love between two elderly people is absurd but i shall make him a good wife and with my money he can take his proper position in the scientific world which he doesnt occupy at present i would rather he had been artistic as science is so dull however i am getting on in years and wish to have some amusement before i die so i must take what i can get what do you say i am quite agreeable as when i leave someone must look after my father else he will be shamefully robbed by everyone in household matters we are good friends so why not you as well as another you are a dear girl said mrs jasher with a sigh of relief and kissed lucy fondly i am sure we shall get on excellently at a distance the artistic world doesnt touch on the scientific you know and you forget mrs jasher that my father wishes to go to egypt to explore this mysterious tomb mrs jasher nodded yes i promised when i came in for my brothers money to help the professor to fit out his expedition but it seems to me that the money will be better spent in offering a reward so that the mummy can be found well said lucy laughing you can give the professor his choice before marriage not after he needs to be managed like all men you will not find him easy to manage said lucy dryly he is a very obstinate man and quite feminine in his persistency hm i recognize that he is a difficult character and between you and me dear i should not marry him but for the title it sounds rather like an adventuress talking in this way but after all if he makes me lady braddock i can give him enough money to let him realize his desire of getting the mummy back its six of one and half a dozen of the other and ill be good to him you need not fear i am quite sure that good or bad the professor will have his own way it is not his happiness i am thinking of so much as yours really here is the tea put the table near the fire jane between miss kendal and myself thank you the muffins on the fender thank you no there is nothing more close the door when you go out the tea equippage having been arranged mrs jasher poured out a cup of souchong and handed it to her guest resuming the subject of her proposed marriage meanwhile i dont see why you should be anxious about me dear i am quite able to look after myself and the professor seems to be kindhearted enough oh he is kindhearted when he gets his own way give him his hobby and he will never bother you but he wont live in london and he will not consent to this salon you wish to institute why not it means fame to him i shall gather round me all the scientists of london and make my house a centre of interest the professor can stop in his laboratory if he likes as his wife i can do all that is necessary well my dearmrs jasher took a cup of teawe need not talk the subject threadbare you do not disapprove of my marriage with your stepfather so you can leave the rest to me if you can give me a hint of how to proceed to bring about this marriage of course i am not above taking it lucy glanced at the teagown as you will have to tell the professor that your brother is dead to account for possessing the money she said pointedly i should advise you to go into mourning professor braddock will be shocked otherwise dear me what a tender heart he must have said mrs jasher flippantly my brother was very little to me poor man so he cannot be anything to the professor however i shall adopt your advice and after all black suits me very well thereshe swept her hands across the teatablethat is settled now about yourself archie and i marry in the springtime and your other admirer who has come back sir frank random said lucy coloring of course he called to see me a day or so ago and seems less brokenhearted than he should be lucy nodded and colored still deeper i suppose some other woman has consoled him of course catch a modern man wearing the willow for any girl however dear are you angry oh no no oh yes yes i think said the widow laughing else you are no woman my dear i know i should be angry to see a man get over his rejection so rapidly who is she asked lucy abruptly donna inez de gayangos a spaniard i believe soa colonial spaniard at leastfrom lima her father don pedro de gayangos met sir frank in genoa by chance well demanded lucy impatiently mrs jasher shrugged her plump shoulders well my dear cant you put two and two together of course sir frank fell in love with this darkhued angel darkhued and i am lighthaired what a compliment perhaps sir frank wanted a change he played on white and lost and therefore stakes his money on black to win thats the result of having been at monte carlo besides this young lady is rich i understand and sir frankso he told melost much more money at monte carlo than he could afford well you dont look pleased lucy roused herself from a fit of abstraction oh yes i am pleased of course i suppose as any woman would i felt rather hurt for the moment in being forgotten so soon but after all i cant blame sir frank for consoling himself if i am married first he shall dance at my wedding if he is married first i shall dance at his and you shall both dance at mine said mrs jasher why there is quite an epidemic of matrimony well donna inez arrives here with her father in a day or so they stop at the warrior inn i believe that horrid place oh it is clean and respectable besides sir frank can hardly ask them to stop in the fort and i have no room in this bandbox of mine however the two of themdonna inez and frank i meancan come here and flirt so can you and archie if you like i fear four people in this room would not do laughed lucy rising to take her leave well i hope sir frank will marry this lady and that you will become mrs braddock only one thing i should like to know and that is why was the mummy stolen it was not valuable save to a scientist by that argument a scientist must be the murderer and thief said mrs jasher however we shall see meanwhile live every moment of loves golden hours they never return that is good advice i shall take it and my leave said lucy and departed in a very happy frame of mind chapter x the don and his daughter professor braddock was usually the most methodical of men and timed his life by the clock and the almanac he rose at seven summer and winter to partake of a hearty breakfast which served him until dinner came at five thirty braddock dined at this unusual hoursave when there was companyas he did not eat any luncheon and scorned the very idea of afternoon tea two meals a day he maintained was enough for any man who led a sedentary life as too much food was apt to clog the wheels of the intellect he usually worked in his museumif the indulgence of his hobby could be called workfrom nine until four after which hour he took a short walk in the garden or through the village on finishing his dinner he would glance over some scientific publication or perhaps by way of recreation play a game or two of patience but at seven he invariably retired into his own rooms to renew work retirement to bed took place at midnight so it can be guessed that the professor got through an enormous quantity of work during the year a more methodical man or a more industrious man did not exist but on occasions even this enthusiast wearied of his hobby and of the years routine a longing to see brother scientists of his own way of thinking would seize him and he would abruptly depart for london to occupy quiet lodgings and indulge in intercourse with his fellowmen braddock rarely gave early intimation of his urban nostalgia at breakfast he would suddenly announce that the fit took him to go to london and he would drive to jessum along with cockatoo to catch the ten oclock train to london sometimes he sent the kanaka back at other times he would take him to town but whether cockatoo remained or departed the museum was always locked up lest it should be profaned by the servants of the house as a matter of fact braddock need not have been afraid for lucyknowing her stepfathers whims and violent tempertook care that the sanctity of the place should remain inviolate sometimes the professor came back in a couple of days at times his absence would extend to a week and on two or three occasions he remained absent for a fortnight but whenever he returned he said very little about his doings to lucy perhaps deeming that dry scientific details would not appeal to a lively young lady as soon as he was established in his museum again life at the pyramids would resume its usual routine until braddock again felt the want of a change the wonder was considering the nature of his work and the closeness of his application that he did not more often indulge in these bohemian wanderings lucy therefore was not astonished when on the morning after her visit to mrs jasher the professor announced in his usual abrupt way that he intended to go to london but would leave cockatoo in charge of his precious collection she was somewhat disturbed however as wishing to forward the widows matrimonial aims she had invited her to dinner for the ensuing night this she told her stepfather and rather to her surprise he expressed himself sorry that he could not remain mrs jasher said braddock hastily drinking his coffee is a very sensible woman who knows when to be silent she is also a good housekeeper i believe hinted miss kendal demurely eh what well why do you say that snapped braddock sharply lucy fenced mrs jasher admires you father braddock grunted but did not seem displeased since even a scientist possessing the usual vanity of the male is not inaccessible to flattery did mrs jasher tell you this he inquired smiling complacently not in so many words still i am a woman and can guess how much another woman leaves unsaid lucy paused then added significantly i do not think that she is so very old and you must admit that she is wonderfully well preserved like a mummy remarked the professor absently then pushed back his chair to add briskly what does all this mean you minx i know that the woman is all right so far as a woman can be but her confounded age and her looks and her unexpressed admiration what are these to an old man like myself father said lucy earnestly when i marry archie i shall in all probability leave gartley for london i knowi know bless me child do you think that i have not thought of that if you were only wise which you are not you would marry random and remain at the fort sir frank has other fish to fry father and even if i did remain at the fort as his wife i still could not look after you humph i am beginning to see what you are driving at but i cant forget your mother my dear she was a good wife to me still said lucy coaxingly and becoming more and more the champion of mrs jasher you cannot manage this large house by yourself i do not like to leave you in the hands of servants when i marry mrs jasher is very domesticated and and would make a good housekeeper no no i dont want to give you another mother child there is no danger of that even if i did not marry rejoined lucy stiffly a girl can have only one mother and a man apparently can have two wives said braddock with dry humor humphhe pinched his plump chinits not a bad idea but of course i cant fall in love at my age i dont think that mrs jasher asks for impossibilities the professor rose briskly ill think over it said he meanwhile i am going to london when will you be back father i cant say dont ask silly questions i dislike being bound to time i may be a week and i may be only a few days things can go on here as usual but if hope comes to see you ask mrs jasher in to play chaperon lucy consented to this suggestion and braddock went away to prepare for his departure to get him off the premises was like launching a ship as the entire household was at his swift heels packing boxes strapping rugs cutting sandwiches helping him on with his overcoat and assisting him into the trap which had been hastily sent for to the warrior inn all the time braddock talked and scolded and gave directions and left instructions until every one was quite bewildered lucy and the servants all sighed with relief when they saw the trap disappear round the end of the road in the direction of jessum in addition to being a famous archaeologist the professor was assuredly a great nuisance to those who had to do with his whims and fancies for the next two or three days lucy enjoyed herself in a quiet way with archie in spite of the lateness of the season the weather was still fine and the artist took the opportunity of the pale sunshine to sketch a great deal of the marsh scenery lucy attended him as a rule when he went abroad and sometimes mrs jasher voluble and merry would come along with them to play the part of chaperon but the girl noticed that mrs jashers merriment was forced at times and in the searching morning light she appeared to be quite old wrinkles showed themselves on her plump face and weary lines appeared round her mouth also she was absentminded while the lovers chattered and when spoken to would return to the present moment with a start as the widow was now well off as regards money and as her scheme to marry braddock was well on the way to successfor lucy had duly reported the professors attitudeit was difficult to understand why mrs jasher should look so worried one day lucy spoke to her on the subject random had strolled across the marshes to look at hope sketch and the two men chatted together while miss kendal led the little widow to one side there is nothing the matter i hope said lucy gently no why do you say that asked mrs jasher flushing you have been looking worried for the last few days i have a few troubles sighed the widowtroubles connected with the estate of my late brother the lawyers are very disagreeable and make all sorts of difficulties to swell their costs then strangely enough i am beginning to feel my brothers death more than i thought i should have done you see that i am in mourning dear after what you said the other day i felt that it was wrong for me not to wear mourning of course my poor brother and i were almost strangers all the same as he has left me money and was my only relative i think it right to show some grief i am a lonely woman my dear when my father comes back you will no longer be lonely said lucy i hope not i feel that i want a man to look after me i told you that i desired to marry the professor for his possible title and in order to form a salon and have some amusement and power but also i want a companion for my old age there is no denying added mrs jasher with another sigh that i am growing old in spite of all the care i take i am grateful for your friendship dear at one time i thought that you did not like me oh i think we get on very well together said lucy somewhat evasively for she did not want to say that she would make the widow an intimate friend and as you know i am quite pleased that you should marry my stepfather so pleasant to think that you look at my ambition in that light said mrs jasher patting the girls arm when does the professor return i cannot say he refused to fix a date but he usually remains away for a fortnight i expect him back in that time but he may come much earlier he will come back when the fancy takes him i shall alter all that when we are married muttered mrs jasher with a frown he must be taught to be less selfish i fear you will never improve him in that respect said lucy dryly and rejoined the gentlemen in time to hear random mention the name of don pedro de gayangos what is that sir frank she asked random turned toward her with his pleasant smile my spanish friend whom i met at genoa is coming here tomorrow with his daughter questioned mrs jasher roguishly of course replied the young soldier coloring donna inez is quite devoted to her father and never leaves him she will one day i expect said hope innocently for his eyes were on his sketch and not on randoms face when the husband of her choice comes along perhaps he has come along already tittered mrs jasher significantly lucy took pity on randoms confusion where will they stay at the warrior inn i have engaged the best rooms in the place i fancy they will be comfortable there as mrs humber the landlady is a good housekeeper and an excellent cook and i dont think don pedro is hard to please a spaniard you say remarked archie idly does he speak english admirablyso does the daughter but why does a spaniard come to so outoftheway a place asked mrs jasher after a pause i thought i told you the other day when we spoke of the matter answered sir frank with surprise don pedro has come here to interview professor braddock about that missing mummy hope looked up sharply what does he know about the mummy nothing so far as i know save that he came to europe with the intention of purchasing it and found himself forestalled by professor braddock don pedro told me no more than that humph murmured hope to himself don pedro will be disappointed when he learns that the mummy is missing random did not catch the words and was about to ask him what he had said when two tall figures conducted by a shorter one were seen moving on the white road which led to the fort strangers said mrs jasher putting up her lorgnette which she used for effect although she had remarkably keen sight how do you know asked lucy carelessly my dear look how oddly the man is dressed i cant tell at this distance said lucy and if you can mrs jasher i really do not see why you require glasses mrs jasher laughed at the compliment to her sight and colored through her rouge at the reproof to her vanity meanwhile the smaller figure which was that of a village lad leading a tall gentleman and a slender lady pointed toward the group round hopes easel shortly the boy ran back up to the village road and the gentleman came along the pathway with the lady random who had been looking at them intently suddenly started having at length recognized them don pedro and his daughter he said in an astonished voice and sprang forward to welcome the unexpected visitors now my dear whispered the widow in lucys ear we shall see the kind of woman sir frank prefers to you well as sir frank has seen the kind of man i prefer to him retorted lucy that makes us quite equal i am glad these newcomers talk english said hope who had risen to his feet i know nothing of spanish they are not spanish but peruvian said mrs jasher the language is the same more or less confound it here is random bringing them here i wish he would take them to the fort theres no more work for the next hour i suppose and hope rather annoyed began to pack his artistic traps on a nearer view don pedro proved to be a tall lean dry man not unlike dores conception of don quixote he must have had indian blood in his veins judging from his very dark eyes his stiff lank hair worn somewhat long and his high cheekbones also although he was arrayed in puritanic black his barbaric love of color betrayed itself in a red tie and in a scarlet handkerchief which was twisted loosely round a soft slouch hat it was the hat and the brilliant red of tie and handkerchief which had caught mrs jashers eye at so great a distance and which had led her to pronounce the man a stranger for mrs jasher well knew that no englishman would affect such vivid tints all the same in spite of this eccentricity don pedro looked a thorough castilian gentleman and bowed gravely when presented to the ladies by random mrs jasher miss kendal permit me to present don pedro de gayangos i am charmed said the peruvian bowing hat in hand and in turn allow me ladies to introduce my daughter donna inez de gayangos archie was also presented to the don and to the young lady after which lucy and mrs jasher while not appearing to look made a thorough examination of the lady with whom random was in love no doubt donna inez was making an examination on her own account and with the cleverness of the sex the three women while chatting affably learned all that there was to be learned from the outward appearance of each other in three minutes miss kendal could not deny but what donna inez was very beautiful and frankly admittedinwardly of courseher own inferiority she was merely pretty whereas the peruvian lady was truly handsome and quite majestic in appearance yet about donna inez there was the same indefinite barbaric look as characterized her father her face was lovely dark and proud in expression but there was an aloofness about it which puzzled the english girl donna inez might have belonged to a race populating another planet of the solar system she had large black melting eyes a straight greek nose and perfect mouth a wellrounded chin and magnificent hair dark and glossy as the wing of the raven which was arranged in the latest parisian style of coiffure also her gownas the two women guessed in an instantwas from paris she was perfectly gloved and booted and even if she betrayed somehow a barbaric taste for color in the dull ruddy hue of her dress which was subdued with black braid yet she looked quite a wellbred woman all the same her whole appearance gave an observant onlooker the idea that she would be more at home in a scanty robe and glittering with rudely wrought ornaments of gold perhaps peru where she came from suggested the comparison but lucys thoughts flew back to an account of the virgins of the sun which the professor had once described it occurred to her perhaps wrongly that in donna inez she beheld one who in former days would have been the bride of some gorgeous inca i fear you will find england dull after the sunshine of lima said lucy having ended a swift examination donna inez shivered a trifle and glanced around at the gray misty air through which the pale sunshine struggled with difficulty i certainly prefer the tropics to this she said in musical english but my father has come down here on business and until it is concluded we shall remain in this place then we must make things as bright as possible for you said mrs jasher cheerfully and desperately anxious to learn more of the newcomers you must come to see me donna inezyonder is my cottage thank you madame you are very good meanwhile don pedro was talking to the two young men yes i did arrive here earlier than i expected he was remarking but i have to return to lima shortly and i wish to get my business with professor braddock finished as speedily as possible i am sorry said lucy politely but my father is absent and when will he return miss kendal i can scarcely sayin a week or a fortnight don pedro made a gesture of annoyance it is a pity as i am so very pressed for time still i must remain until the professor returns i am so anxious to hear if the mummy has been found it is not found yet said hope quickly and never will be don pedro looked at him quietly it must be found said he i have come all the way from lima to obtain it when you hear my story you will not be surprised at my desire to regain the mummy regain it echoed hope and random in one breath don pedro nodded the mummy was stolen from my father he said chapter xi the manuscript it was certainly strange how constantly the subject of the missing mummy came uppermost since it had disappeared and since the man who had brought it to england was dead it might have been thought that nothing more would be said about the matter but professor braddock harped incessantly on his losswhich was perhaps naturaland widow anne also talked a great deal as to the possibility of the mummy being found as she hoped to learn by that means the name of the assassin who had strangled her poor boy now don pedro de gayangos appeared with the strange information that the weird relic of peruvian civilization had been stolen from his father apparently fate was not inclined to let the matter of the lost mummy drop and was working round to a denouement which would possibly include the solution of the mystery of sidney boltons death yet on the face of it there appeared to be no chance of the truth becoming known of course when don pedro announced that the mummy had formerly belonged to his father every one was anxious to hear how it had been stolen the gayangos family were established in lima and the embalmed body of inca caxas had been purchased from a gentleman residing in malta how then had it crossed the water and how had don pedro learned its whereabouts only to arrive too late to secure his missing property mrs jasher was especially anxious to learn these things and explained her reasons to lucy you see my dear she said to the girl on the day after don pedros arrival in gartley if we learn the past of that horrid mummy we may gain a clue to the person who desired possession of the nasty thing and so may hunt down this terrible criminal once he is found the mummy may be secured again and should i be able to return it to your father out of gratitude he would certainly marry me you seem to think that the assassin is a man said lucy dryly yet you forget that the person who talked to sidney through the window of the sailors rest was a woman an old woman emphasized mrs jasher briskly quite so lucy contradicted eliza flight did not say if the woman was old or young but merely stated that she wore a dark dress and a dark shawl over her head still this mysterious woman was connected in some way with the murder else she would not have been speaking to sidney i dont follow you my dear you talk as though poor mr bolton expected to be murdered for my part i hold by the verdict of wilful murder against some person or persons unknown the truth is to be found if anywhere in the past of the mummy we can discover nothing about that you forget what don pedro said my dear remarked mrs jasher hastily that the mummy had been stolen from his father let us hear what he has to say and we may find a clue i am anxious that the professor should regain the green mummy for reasons which you know of and now my hear can you come to dinner tonight well i dont know miss kendal hesitated archie said that he would look in this evening i shall ask mr hope also my love don pedro is coming and his daughter likewise needless to say sir frank will follow the young lady we shall be a party of six and after dinner we must induce don pedro to relate the story of how the mummy was stolen he may not be inclined oh i think so replied mrs jasher quickly he wants to get the mummy back again and if we discuss the subject we may see some chance of securing it but don pedro will not wish it to be restored to my father mrs jasher shrugged her plump shoulders your father and don pedro can arrange that themselves all i desire is that the mummy should be found undoubtedly it belongs by purchase to the professor but as it has been stolen this peruvian gentleman may claim it well i shall come and archie also assented lucy who was beginning to be interested in the matter the affair is somewhat romantic criminal my dear criminal said mrs jasher rising to take her leave it is not a matter i care to mix myself up with stillshe laughedyou know why i am doing so if i had to take all this trouble to gain a husband observed lucy somewhat acidly i should remain single all my life if you were as lonely as i am retorted the plump widow you would do your best to secure a man toy look after you i should prefer a young and handsomer husbandsuch as sir frank random for instance but as beggars cannot be choosers i must content myself with old age a famous scientist and the chance of a possible title now mind dear tonight at sevennot a minute later and she bustled away to prepare for the reception of her guests it seemed to lucy that mrs jasher was taking a great deal of trouble to become mrs braddock especially as the professors brother might live for many a long day yet in which case the widow would not gain the title she coveted for years however the girl rather sympathized with mrs jasher who was a companionable soul and fond of society circumstances condemned her to a somewhat lonely life in an isolated cottage in a rather dull neighborhood so it was little to be wondered at that she should strive to move heaven and earthas she was doingin the hope of escaping from her solitude besides although miss kendal did not wish to make a close companion of the widow yet she did not dislike her and moreover thought that she would make professor braddock a very presentable wife thinking thus lucy was quite willing to forward mrs jashers plans by inducing don pedro to tell all he knew about this missing mummy thus it came about that six people assembled in the tiny pink parlor of mrs jasher at the hour of seven oclock it required dexterous management to seat the whole company in the dining room which was only a trifle larger than the parlor however mrs jasher contrived to place them round her hospitable board in a fairly comfortable fashion and once seated the dinner was so good that no one felt the drawbacks of scanty elbow room the widow as hostess was placed at the head of the table don pedro as the eldest of the men at the foot and sir frank with donna inez faced archie and lucy kendal jane who was well instructed in waiting by her mistress attended to her duties admirably acting both as footman and butler lucy indeed had offered mrs jasher the services of cockatoo to hand round the wine but the widow with a pretty shudder had declined that dreadful creature with his yellow mop of hair gives me the shivers she declared considering the isolation of the district and the narrow limits of mrs jashers income the meal was truly admirable being well cooked and well served while the table was arrayed like an altar for the reception of the various dishes whatever mrs jasher might be as an adventuress she certainly proved herself to be a capital housekeeper and lucy foresaw that if she did become mrs braddock the professor would fare sumptuously for the rest of his scientific life when the meal was ended the widow produced a box of superfine cigars and another of cigarettes after which she left the gentlemen to sip their wine and took her two young friends to chatter chiffons in the tiny parlor and it said much for mrs jashers methodical ways that considering the limited space everything wentas the saying goeslike clockwork likewise the widow had proved herself a wonderful hostess as she kept the ball of conversation rolling briskly and induced a spirit of fraternity uncommon in an ordinary dinner party during the meal mrs jasher had kept off the subject of the mummy which was the excuse for the entertainment but when the gentlemen strolled into the parlor feeling well fed and happy she hinted at don pedros quest as the night was cold and the peruvian gentleman came from the tropics he was established in a well padded armchair close to the seacoal fire and with her own fair hands mrs jasher gave him a cup of fragrant coffee which was rendered still more agreeable to the palate by the introduction of a vanilla bean with this and with a good cigarfor the ladies gave the gentlemen permission to smokedon pedro felt very happy and easy and complimented mrs jasher warmly on her capability of making her fellowcreatures comfortable it is altogether comfortable madame said don pedro rising to make a courtly bow in fact so agreeable was the foreigner that mrs jasher dreamed for one swift moment of throwing over the dryasdust scientist to become a spanish lady of lima you flatter me don pedro she said waving a wholly unnecessary fan out of compliment to her guests spanish extraction indeed i am very glad that you are pleased with my poor little house pardon madame but no house can be poor when it is a casket to contain such a jewel there said lucy somewhat satirically to the young men while mrs jasher blushed and bridled what englishman could turn such a compliment it reminds one of georgian times we are more sober now than my fathers were then said hope smiling and i am sure if random thought for a few minutes he could produce something pretty go on random my brain is not equal to the strain after dinner said sir frank as for donna inez she did not speak but sat smiling quietly in her corner of the room looking remarkably handsome as a young girl lucy was pretty and mrs jasher was a comely widow but neither one had the majestic looks of the spanish lady she smiled a veritable queen amidst the gimcrack ornaments of mrs jashers parlor and sir frank who was fathoms deep in love could not keep his eyes off her face for a few minutes the conversation was frivolous quite the shakespeare and musical glasses kind of speech then mrs jasher who had no idea that her good dinner should be wasted in charming nothings introduced the subject of the mummy by a reference to professor braddock it was characteristic of her cleverness that she did not address don pedro but pointed her speech at lucy kendal i do hope your father will return with that mummy she observed after a dexterous allusion to the late tragedy i dont think he has gone to look for it replied miss kendal indifferently but surely he desired to get it back after paying nearly one thousand pounds for it said mrs jasher with wellfeigned astonishment oh of course but he would scarcely look for it in london has professor braddock gone to search for the mummy asked don pedro no answered lucy he is visiting the british museum to make some researches in the egyptian department when do you expect him back please lucy shrugged her shoulders i cant say don pedro my father comes and goes as the whim takes him the spanish gentleman looked thoughtfully into the fire i shall be glad to see the professor when he returns he said in his excellent slowsounding english my concern about this mummy is deep dear me remarked mrs jasher shielding her fair cheek with the unnecessary fan and venturing on a joke is the mummy a relative yes madame replied don pedro gravely and unexpectedly at this every one very naturally looked astonishedthat is all save donna inez who still preserved her fixed smile mrs jasher took a mental note of the same and decided that the young lady was not very intelligent meanwhile don pedro continued his speech after a glance round the circle i have the blood of the royal inca race in my veins he said with pride ha murmured the widow to herself then that accounts for your love of color which is so unenglish then she raised her voice tell us all about it don pedro she entreated we are usually so dull here that a romantic story excites us dreadfully i do not know that it is very romantic said don pedro with a polite smile and if you will not find it dull oh no said archie who was as anxious as mrs jasher to hear what was to be said about the mummy come sir we are all attention don pedro bowed again and again swept the circle with his deepset eyes the inca caxas he remarked was one of the decadent rulers of ancient peru at the conquest by the spaniards inca atahuallpa was murdered by pizarro as you probably know inca toparca succeeded him as a puppet king he died also and it was suspected that he was slain by a native chief called challcuchima then manco succeeded and is looked upon by historians as the last inca of peru but he was not this is news indeed said random lazily and who was the last inca the man who is now the green mummy inca caxas ventured lucy timidly don pedro looked at her sharply how do you come to know the name you mentioned it just now but before that i heard my father mention it said lucy who was surprised at the sharpness of his tone and where did the professor learn the name asked don pedro anxiously lucy shook her head i cannot say but go on with the story she continued with the naive curiosity of a child yes do pleaded mrs jasher who was listening with all her ears the peruvian meditated for a few minutes then slipped his hand into the pocket of his coat and brought out a discolored parchment scrawled and scribbled with oddlooking letters in purple ink somewhat faded did you ever see this before he asked lucy or any manuscript like it no she answered bending forward to examine the parchment carefully don pedro again swept an inquiring eye round the circle but everyone denied having seen the manuscript what is it asked sir frank curiously don pedro restored the manuscript to his pocket it is an account of the embalming of inca caxas written by his son who was my ancestor then you are descended from this inca said mrs jasher eagerly i am had i my rights i should rule peru as it is i am a poor gentleman with very little money that added don pedro with emphasis is why i wish to recover the mummy of my great ancestor is it then so valuable asked archie suddenly he was thinking of some reason why the mummy should have been stolen well in itself it is of no great value save to an archaeologist was don pedros reply but i had better tell you the story of how it was stolen from my father go on go on cried mrs jasher this is most interesting don pedro plunged into his story without further preamble inca caxas held his state amidst the solitudes of the andes away from the cruel men who had conquered his country he died and was buried this manuscripthe touched his pocketwas written by his son and details the ceremonies the place of sepulchre and also gives a list of the jewels with which the mummy was buried jewels murmured hope under his breath i thought as much the son of inca caxas married a spanish lady and made peace with the spaniards he came to live at cuzco and brought with him for some purpose which the manuscript does not disclose the mummy of his father but the manuscript was lost for years and although my familythe de gayangosesbecame poor no member of it knew that concealed in the corpse of inca caxas were two large emeralds of immense value the mummy of our royal ancestor was treated as a sacred thing and venerated accordingly afterwards my family came to live at lima and i still dwell in the old house but how was the mummy stolen from you asked random curiously i am coming to that said don pedro frowning at the interruption i was not in lima at the time but i had met the man who stole the precious mummy was he a spaniard no answered don pedro slowly he was an english sailor called vasa vasa is a swedish name observed hope critically this man said that he was english and certainly spoke like an englishman so far as i a foreigner can tell at that time when i was a young man civil war raged in peru my fathers house was sacked and this vasa who had been received hospitably by my father when he was shipwrecked at callao stole the mummy of inca caxas my father died of grief and charged me to get the mummy back when peace was restored to my unhappy country i tried to recover the venerated body of my ancestor but all search proved vain as vasa had disappeared and it was supposed that for some reason he had taken the embalmed body out of the country it was when the mummy was lost that i unexpectedly came across the manuscript which detailed the funeral ceremonies of inca caxas and on learning about the two emeralds i was naturally more anxious than ever to discover the mummy and retrieve my fallen fortunes by means of the jewels but as i said all search proved vain and i afterward married thinking to settle down on what fortune remained to me i did live quietly in lima for years until my wife died then with my daughter i came to europe on a visit to search for the mummy questioned archie eagerly no sir i had given up all hope of finding that but chance placed a clue in my hands at genoa i came across a newspaper which stated that a mummy in a green caseand a peruvian mummy at thatwas for sale at malta i immediately made inquiries thinking that this was the longlost body of inca caxas but it so happened that i was too late as already the mummy had been sold to professor braddock and had been taken to england on board the diver by mr bolton chance which had pointed out the whereabouts of the mummy also brought me at genoa into relations with sir frank randomdon pedro bowed his head to the baronetand as it appeared that he knew professor braddock i thankfully accepted his offer to introduce me hence i am here but only to hear that the mummy is again lost that is all and the peruvian gentleman dramatically waved his arm a strange story said archie who was the first to speak and it certainly solves at least one part of the mystery what is that demanded mrs jasher quickly it shows that the mummy was stolen on account of the emeralds pardon me but that is impossible sir said don pedro drawing up his lean figure no one but myself knew that the mummy held two emeralds in its dead hands and i learned that only a few years ago from the manuscript which i had the honor of showing you there is that objection assuredly replied hope with composure yet i can hardly believe that any man would risk his neck to steal so remarkable a mummy which he would have a difficulty in disposing of but did this assassin know of the emeralds he would venture much to gain them since jewels can be disposed of with comparative ease and cannot easily be traced all the same said random looking up i do not see how the assassin could have learned that the jewels were wrapped in the bandages humph said hope glancing at de gayangos perhaps there is more than one copy of this manuscript you speak of not to my knowledge the sailor vasa might have copied it no don pedro shook his head it is written in latin since a spanish priest taught the son of inca caxas who wrote it that language i do not think that vasa knew latin also if vasa had copied the manuscript he would have stripped the mummy to procure the jewels now in the newspaper advertisement it stated that the bandages of the mummy were intact as also was the verdant case no said don pedro decisively i am quite of opinion that vasa and indeed everyone else was ignorant of this manuscript it seems to me suggested mrs jasher that it would be best to find this sailor that remarked de gayangos is impossible it is twenty years since he disappeared with the mummy let us drop the subject until professor braddock returns to discuss it with me and this was accordingly done chapter xii a discovery three days went by and professor braddock still remained absent in london although an occasional letter to lucy requested such and such an article from the museum to be forwarded sometimes by post and on other occasions by cockatoo who traveled up to town especially the kanaka always returned with the news that his master was looking well but brought no word of the professors return lucy was not surprised as she was accustomed to braddocks vagaries meanwhile don pedro comfortably established at the warrior inn wandered about gartley in his dignified way taking very little interest in the village but a great deal in the pyramids as the professor was absent lucy could not ask him to dinner but she did invite him and donna inez to afternoon tea don pedro was anxious to peep into the museum but cockatoo absolutely refused to let him enter saying that his master had forbidden anyone to view the collection during his absence and in this refusal cockatoo was supported by miss kendal who had a wholesome dread of her stepfathers rage should he return and find that a stranger had been making free of his sacred apartments the peruvian gentleman expressed himself extremely disappointed so much so indeed that lucy fancied he believed braddock had the green mummy hidden in the museum in spite of the reported loss from the sailors rest failing to get permission to range through the rooms of the pyramids don pedro paid occasional visits to pierside and questioned the police regarding the bolton murder from inspector date he learned nothing of any importance and indeed that officer expressed his belief that not until the day of judgment would the truth become known it then occurred to de gayangos to explore the neighborhood of the sailors rest and to examine that publichouse himself he saw the famous window through which the mysterious woman had talked to the deceased and noted that it looked across a stony narrow path to the waters edge wherefrom a rugged jetty ran out into the stream for some little distance nothing would have been easier reflected don pedro than for the assassin to enter by the window and having accomplished his deed to leave in the same way bearing the case containing the mummy a few steps would carry the man and his burden to a waiting boat and once the craft slipped into the mists on the river all trace would be lost as had truly happened in this way the peruvian gentleman believed the murder and the theft had been accomplished but even supposing things had happened as he surmised still he was as far as ever from unraveling the mystery while don pedro searched for his royal ancestors corpse and incidentally for the thief and murderer his daughter was being wooed by sir frank random heaven only knows what he saw in heras lucy observed to young hopefor the girl had not a word to say for herself she was undeniably handsome and dressed with great taste save for stray hints of barbaric delight in color doubtless inherited from her inca ancestors all the same she appeared to be devoid of small talk or great talk or any talk whatsoever she sat and smiled and looked like a handsome picture but after her appearance had satisfied the eye she left much to be desired yet sir frank approved of her stately quietness and seemed anxious to make her his wife lucy in spite of the fact that he had so speedily got over her refusal to marry him was anxious that he should be happy with donna inez whom he appeared to love and afforded him every opportunity of meeting the lady so that he might prosecute his wooing all the same she wondered that he should desire to marry an iceberg and donna inez with her silent tongue and cold smiles was little else however as frank random was the chief party concerned in the lovemakingfor donna inez was merely passivethere was no more to be said sometimes hope came to dine at the pyramids and on these occasions mrs jasher was present in her character of chaperon as miss kendal was helping the widow to marry professor braddock she in her turn did her best to speed archies wooing certainly the young couple were engaged and there was no understanding to be brought about nevertheless mrs jasher was a useful article of furniture to be in the room when they were together for gartley like all english villages was filled with scandalmongers who would have talked had hope and lucy not employed mrs jasher as gooseberry sometimes donna inez came with the widow while her father was hunting for the mummy in pierside and then sir frank random would be sure to put in an appearance to woo his dulcinea in admiring silence mrs jasher declared that the two must have made love by telepathy for they rarely exchanged a word but this was all the better as archie and lucy chattered a great deal and two pair of magpiesmrs jasher declaredwould have been too much for her nerves she made a very good chaperon as she allowed the young people to act as they pleased only sanctioning the meetings by her elderly presence one evening mrs jasher was due to dinner and hope had already arrived no one else was expected as don pedro had taken his daughter to the theatre at pierside and sir frank had gone to london in connection with his military duties it was a bitterly cold night and already a fall of snow had hinted that there was to be a real english christmas of the genuine kind lucy had prepared an excellent dinner for three and archie had brought a set of new patience cards for mrs jasher who was fond of the game while the widow played the lovers hoped to make love undisturbed and looked forward to a happy evening but there was one drawback for although the dinner hour was supposed to be eight oclock and it was now thirty minutes past mrs jasher had not arrived lucy was dismayed what can be keeping her she asked archie to which that young gentleman replied that he did not know and what was more he did not care miss kendal very properly rebuked this sentiment you ought to care archie for you know that if mrs jasher does not come to dinner you will have to go away why should i he inquired sulkily people will talk let them i dont care neither do i you stupid boy but my father will care and if people talk he will be very angry my dear lucy and archie put his arm round her waist to say this i dont see why you should be afraid of the professor he is only your stepfather and you arent so very fond of him as to mind what he says besides we can marry soon and then he can go hang but i dont want him to go hang she replied laughing after all the professor has always been kind to me and as a stepfather has behaved very well when he could easily have made himself disagreeable another thing is that he can be very bad tempered when he likes and if i let people talk about uswhich they will do if they get a chancehe will behave so coldly to me that i shall have a disagreeable time as we cant marry for ever so long i dont want to be uncomfortable we can marry whenever you like said hope unexpectedly what with your income so unsettled it is not unsettled yes it is you will help that horrid spendthrift uncle of yours and until he and his family are solvent i dont see how we can be sure of our money we are sure of it now dearest uncle simon has turned up trumps after all and so have his investments what do you mean exactly i mean that yesterday i received a letter from him saying that he was now rich and would pay back all i had lent him i went up to london today and had an interview the result of that is that i am some thousands to the good that uncle simon is well off for the rest of his life and will require no more assistance and that my three hundred a year is quite clear for ever and ever and ever then we can marry cried miss kendal with a gasp of delight whenever you choosenext week if you like in january thenjust after christmas well go on a trip to italy and return to take a flat in london oh archie i am sorry i thought so badly of your uncle he has behaved very well and what a mercy it is that he will require no more assistance you are sure he will not if he does he wont get it said hope candidly while i was a bachelor i could assist him but when i am married i must look after myself and my wife he gave lucy a hug its all right now dear and uncle simon has behaved excellentlyfar better than i expected we shall go to italy for the honeymoon and need not hurry back until wewell say until we quarrel in that case we shall live in italy for the rest of our lives said lucy with twinkling eyes but we must come back in a year and take a studio in chelsea why not in gartley remember the professor will be lonely no he wont mrs jasher as i told you intends to marry him he might not wish to marry her that doesnt matter rejoined lucy with the cleverness of a woman she can manage to bring the marriage about besides i want to break with the old life here and begin quite a new one with you when i am your wife and mrs jasher is my stepfathers everything will be capitally arranged well i hope so said archie heartily for i want you all to myself and have no desire to share you with anyone else but i say he glanced at his watch it is getting towards nine oclock and i am desperately hungry cant we go to dinner not until mrs jasher arrives said lucy primly oh bother hope being quite exasperated with hunger would have launched out into a speech condemning the widows unpunctuality when in the hall below the drawingroom was heard the sound of the door opening and closing without doubt this was mrs jasher arriving at last and lucy ran out of the room and down the stairs to welcome her in her eagerness to get archie seated at the dinner table the young man lingered by the open door of the drawingroom ready to welcome the widow when he heard lucy utter an exclamation of surprise and became aware that she was ascending the stairs along with professor braddock at once he reflected there would be trouble since he was in the house with lucy and lacked the necessary chaperon which braddocks primitive anglosaxon instincts insisted upon i did not know you were returning tonight lucy was saying when she reentered the drawingroom with her stepfather i arrived by the six oclock train explained the professor unwinding a large red scarf from his neck and struggling out of his overcoat with the assistance of his daughter ha hope good evening where have you been since asked lucy throwing the professors coat and wraps on to a chair with mrs jasher said braddock warming his plump hands at the fire so you must blame me that she is not here to preside at dinner as the chaperon of you young people lucy and her lover glanced at one another in surprise this light and airy tone was a new one for the professor to take instead of being angry he seemed to be unusually gay and looked at them in quite a jocular manner for a dryasdust scientist we waited dinner for her father ventured lucy timidly then i am ready to eat it announced braddock i am extremely hungry my dear i cant live on love you know live on love lucy stared and archie laughed quietly oh yes you may smile and look astonished went on the professor goodhumoredly but science does not destroy the primeval instincts entirely lucy my dear he took her hand and patted it while in london and in lodgings it was borne in upon me forcibly how lonely i was and how lonely i would be when you married our young friend yonder i had intended to come down tomorrow but tonight such was my feeling of loneliness that i considered favorably your idea that i should find a second helpmate in mrs jasher i have always had a profound admiration for that lady and soon the spur of the moment as i may sayi decided to come down this evening and propose oh lucy clapped her hands very well satisfied with the unexpected news and have you mrs jasher said the professor gravely did me the honor to promise to become my wife this evening she will become your wife this evening said archie smiling braddock with one of those odd twists of humor which were characteristic of him became irascible confound it sir dont i speak english he snapped with his eyes glaring rebuke she promised this evening to become mrs braddock we shall marryso we have arrangedin the springtime which is the natural pairing season for human beings as well as for birds and i am glad to say that mrs jasher takes a deep interest in archaeology and what is more she is a splendid housekeeper said lucy the temporary anger of the professor vanished he drew his stepdaughter towards him and kissed her on the cheek i believe that i have to thank you for putting the idea into my head said he and alsoif mrs jasher is to be believedfor aiding her to see the mutual advantage it would be to both of us to marry ha he released lucy and rubbed his hands let us go to dinner i am very glad said miss kendal heartily so am i so am i replied braddock nodding as you very truly observed my child the house would have gone to rack and ruin without a woman to look after my interests well he took the arms of the two young people i really think that we must have a bottle of champagne on the strength of it shortly the trio were seated at the table and braddock explained that mrs jasher being overcome by his proposal had not been able to face the ordeal of congratulations but she will come tomorrow said he as cockatoo filled three glasses indeed i shall congratulate her tonight said lucy obstinately as soon as dinner is over i shall go with archie to her house and tell her how pleased i am it is very cold for you to be out lucy dear urged archie anxiously oh i can wrap up warmly she answered strange to say the professor made no objection to the excursion although hope quite expected such a stickler for etiquette to refuse permission to his stepdaughter but braddock seemed rather pleased than otherwise his proposal of marriage seemed to have put him into excellent humor and he raised his glass with a chuckle i drink to your happiness my dear lucy and to that of mrs jashers and i drink to archies and to yours father she replied i am glad that you will not be lonely when we are married archie and i wish to become one in january yes said hope finishing his champagne my income is now all right as my uncle has paid up very good very good i make no objection said braddock placidly i will give you a handsome wedding present lucy for you may have heard that my future wife has money left to her by her brother who was lately a merchant in pekin she is heart and hand with me in our proposed expedition to egypt will you go there for the honeymoon sir asked hope not exactly for the honeymoon since we are to be married in spring and my expedition to the tomb of queen tahoser cannot start until the late autumn but mrs braddock will come with me that is only just since it will be her money which will furnish the sinews of war well everything is arranged very well said lucy i marry archie you father make mrs jasher your wife and i suspect sir frank will marry donna inez ha said braddock with a start the daughter of de gayangos who has come here for the missing mummy mrs jasher told me somewhat of that my dear but i shall see don pedro myself tomorrow meanwhile let us eat and drink i must go down to the museum and you we shall go to congratulate mrs jasher said lucy so it was arranged and shortly professor braddock retired into his sanctum along with the devoted cockatoo who displayed lively joy on beholding his master once more lucy after being carefully wrapped up by archie set out with that young man to congratulate the brideelect it was just halfpast nine when they started out the night was frosty and the stars twinkled like jewels in a cloudless sky of dark blue the moon shone with hard brilliance on the ground which was powdered with a light fall of snow as the young people walked briskly through the village their footsteps rang on the frosty earth and they scrunched the snow in their quick tread the warrior inn was still open as it was not late and lights shone from the windows of the various cottages when the two following the road through the marshes emerged from the village they saw the great mass of the fort bulking blackly against the clear sky the glittering stream of the thames and the marshes outlined in delicate white the fairy world of snow and moonlight appealed to archies artistic sense and lucy approving of the same they did not hurry to arrive at their destination but shortly they saw the squarely fenced acre of ground near the embankment wherein mrs jashers humble abode was placed light shone through the pink curtains of the drawingroom showing that the widow had not yet retired in a few minutes the lovers were at the gate and promptly entered it was then that one of those odd things happened which would argue that some people are possessed of a sixth sense archie closed the gate after him and glancing right and left walked up the snowy path with lucy to the right was a leafless arbor also powdered with snow and against the white bulked a dark form something like a coffin hope out of curiosity went up to it what the deuce is this he asked himself then raised his voice in loud surprise lucy lucy come here what is it she asked running up lookhe pointed to the oddly shaped casethe green mummy chapter xiii more mystery neither lucy nor archie hope had ever seen the mummy but they knew the appearance which it would present as professor braddock with the enthusiasm of an archaeologist had often described the same to them it appeared according to braddock that on purchasing the precious corpse in malta his dead assistant had written home a full description of the treasure trove consequently being advised beforehand hope had no difficulty in recognizing the oddly shaped case which was made somewhat in the egyptian form on the impulse of the moment he had proclaimed this to be the longlost mummy and when a closer examination by the light of a lucifer match revealed the green hue of the coffin wood he knew that he was right but what was the mummy in its ancient case doing in mrs jashers arbor that was the mute question which the two young people asked themselves and each other as they stood in the chilly moonlight staring at the grotesque thing the mummy had disappeared from the sailors rest at pierside some weeks ago and now unexpectedly appeared in a lonely garden surrounded by marshes how it had been brought there or why it should have been brought there or who had brought it to such an unlikely place were questions hard to answer however the most obvious thing to do was to question mrs jasher since the uncanny object was lying within a stonethrow of her home lucy after a rapid word or two went to ring the bell and summon the lady while archie stood by the arbor wondering how the mummy came to be there in the same way george iii had wondered how the apples got into the dumplings far and wide spread the marshes flatly towards the shore of the river on one side but on the other sloping up to gartley village which twinkled with many lights on the rising ground some distance away the fort rose black and menacing in the moonlight and the mighty stream of the thames glittered like polished steel as it flowed seaward as there were only a few leafless trees dotted about the marshy ground and as that same ground lightly sprinkled with powdery snow revealed every moving object for quite a mile or so hope could not conceive how the mummy case which seemed heavy could have been brought into the silent garden without its bearers being seen it was not late and soldiers were still returning through gartley to the fort then again some noise must have been caused by so bulky an object being thrust through the narrow wicket and mrs jasher inhabiting a wooden house which was a very seashell for sound might have heard footsteps and voices if those who had brought the mummy hereand there was more than one from the size of the casecould be discovered then the mystery of sidney boltons death would be solved very speedily it was at this moment of his reflections that lucy returned to the arbor leading mrs jasher who was attired in a teagown and who looked bewildered what are you talking about my dear she said as lucy led her towards the arbor i declare i was ever so much astonished when jane told me that you wished to speak to me i was just writing a letter to the lawyer who has my poor brothers property in hand announcing my engagement to the professor mr hope you here also well im sure lucy grew impatient at all this babble did you not hear what i said mrs jasher she cried irritably cant you use your eyes look the green mummy is in your arbor thegreenmummyinmyarbor repeated mrs jasher like a child learning words of one syllable and staring at the black object before which the three were standing as you see said archie abruptly how did it come here he spoke harshly of course it was absurd to accuse mrs jasher of knowing anything about the matter since she had been writing letters still the fact remained that a mummy which had been thieved from a murdered man was in her arbor and naturally she was called upon to explain some suspicion in his tone struck the little woman and she turned on him with indignation how did it come here she repeated now how can i tell you silly boy i have been writing to my lawyer about my engagement to mr braddock i daresay he has told you yes chimed in miss kendal and we came here to congratulate you only to find the mummy is that the horrid thing mrs jasher stared with all her eyes and timidly touched the hard greenstained wood its the casethe mummy is inside but i thought that the professor opened the case to find the body of poor sidney bolton argued mrs jasher that was a packing case in which thisarchie struck the oldworld coffinwas stored but this is the corpse of inca caxas about which don pedro told us the other night how does it come to be hidden in your garden hidden mrs jasher repeated the word with a laugh there is not much hiding about it why every one can see it from the path and from the door of your house remarked hope significantly did you not see it when you took leave of braddock no snapped the widow if i had i should certainly have come to look also professor braddock who is so anxious to recover it would not have allowed it to remain here then the case was not here when the professor left you tonight no he left me at eight oclock to go home to dinner when did he arrive here questioned hope quickly at seven i am sure of the time for i was just sitting down to my supper he was here an hour but he said nothing when he entered of any mummy being in the arbor nor when he left me at the door and i came to say goodbye to himdid either of us see this object to be sure added mrs jasher meditatively we did not look particularly in the direction of this arbor i scarcely see how any one entering or leaving the garden could fail to see it especially as the snow reflects the moonlight so brightly mrs jasher shivered and taking the skirt of her teagown flung it over her carefully attired head it is very cold she remarked irritably dont you think we had better return to the house and talk there what said archie grimly and leave the mummy to be carried away as mysteriously as it has been brought no mrs jasher that mummy represents one thousand pounds of my money i understood that the professor bought it himself so he did but i supplied the purchase money therefore i do not intend that this should be lost sight of again lucy my dear you run home again and tell your father what we have found he had better bring men to take it to his museum when it is there mrs jasher can then explain how it came to be in her garden without a word lucy set off walking quickly anxious to fulfill her mission and gladden the heart of her stepfather with the amazing news archie and mrs jasher were left alone and the former lighted a cigarette while he tapped the mummy case and examined it as closely as the pale gleam of the moonlight permitted mrs jasher made no move to enter the house much as she had complained of the cold but perhaps she found the flimsy skirt of the teagown sufficient protection it seems to me mr hope said she very tartly that you suspect my having a hand in this and she tapped the mummy coffin also pardon me observed hope very politely but i suspect nothing because i have no grounds upon which to base my suspicions but certainly it is odd that this missing mummy should be found in your garden you will admit that much i admit nothing of the sort she rejoined coolly only myself and jane live in the cottage and you dont expect that two delicate women could move this huge thing she tapped the case again moreover had i found the mummy i should have taken it to the pyramids at once so as to give professor braddock some pleasure it will certainly be an acceptable wedding present said archie sarcastically pardon me said mrs jasher in her turn but i have nothing to do with it as a present or otherwise how the thing came into my arbor i really cannot say as i told you professor braddock made no remark about it when he came and when he left although i was at the door i did not notice anything in this arbor indeed i cannot say if i ever looked in this direction archie mused and glanced at his watch the professor told lucy that he came by the six train you say that he was here at seven yes and he left at eight what is the time now ten oclock or a few minutes after therefore since neither you nor braddock saw the mummy i take it that the case was brought here by some unknown people between eight oclock and a quarter to ten about which time i arrived here with lucy mrs jasher nodded you put the matter very clearly she observed dryly you have mistaken your vocation mr hope and should have been a criminal lawyer i should turn detective were i you why asked archie with a start you might ascertain my movements on the night when the crime was committed snapped the little widow a woman muffled in a shawl in much the same way as my head is now muffled in my skirt talked to bolton through the bedroom window of the sailors rest you know hope expostulated my dear lady how you run on i assure you that i would as soon suspect lucy as you thank you said the widow very dryly and very tartly i merely wish to point out went on archie in a conciliatory tone that as the mummy in its caseas appears probablewas brought into your garden between the hours of eight and ten less fifteen minutes that you may have heard the voices or footsteps of those who carried it here i heard nothing said mrs jasher turning towards the path i had my supper and played a game or two of patience and then wrote letters as i told you before and i am not going to stand in the cold answering silly questions mr hope if you wish to talk you must come inside hope shook his head and lighted a fresh cigarette i stand guard over this mummy until its rightful owner comes said he determinedly ho rejoined mrs jasher scornfully she was now at the door i understood that you bought the mummy and therefore were its owner well i only hope youll find those emeralds don pedro talked about and with a light laugh she entered the cottage archie looked after her in a puzzled way there was no reason to suspect mrs jasher so far as he saw even though a woman had been seen talking to bolton on the night of the crime and yet why should the widow refer to the emeralds which were of such immense value according to don pedro hope glanced at the case and shook the primitive coffin anxious for the moment to open it and ascertain if the jewels were still clutched grimly in the mummys dead hands but the coffin was fastened tightly down with wooden pegs and could only be opened with extreme care and difficulty also as hope reflected even did he manage to open this receptacle of the dead he still could not ascertain if the emeralds were safe since they would be hidden under innumerable swathings of greendyed llama wool he therefore let the matter rest there and staring at the river wondered how the mummy had been brought to the garden in the marshes hope recollected that experts had decided the mode in which the mummy had been removed from the pierside publichouse it had been passed through the window according to inspector date and others and when taken across the narrow path which bordered the river had been placed in a waiting boat after that it had vanished until it had reappeared in this arbor but if taken by water once it could have been taken by water again there was a rude jetty behind the embankment which hope could easily see from where he stood in all probability the mummy had been landed there and carried to the garden while mrs jasher was busy with her supper and her game of cards and her letters also the path from the shore to the house was very lonely and if any care had been exercised which was probable no one from the fort road or from the village street could have seen the stealthy conspirators bringing their weird burden so far hope felt that he could argue excellently but who had brought the mummy to the garden and why had it been brought there these questions he could not answer so easily and indeed not at all while thus meditating he heard far away in the frosty air a puffing and blowing and panting like an impatient motorcar before he could guess what this was braddock appeared simply racing along the marshy causeway followed closely by cockatoo and at some distance away by lucy the little scientist rushed through the gate which he flung open with a noise fit to wake the dead and lunged forward to fall with outstretched arms upon the green case there he remained still puffing and blowing and looked as though he were hugging a huge green beetle cockatoo who being lean and hard kept his breath more easily stood respectfully by waiting for his master to give orders and lucy came in quietly by the gate smiling at her fathers enthusiasm at the same moment mrs jasher well wrapped up in a coat of sables emerged from the cottage i heard you coming professor she called out hurrying down the path i should think the whole fort heard the professor coming said hope glancing at the dark mass the soldiers must think it is an invasion but braddock paid no heed to this jocularity or even to mrs jasher to whom he had been so lately engaged all his soul was in the mummy case and as soon as he recovered his breath he loudly proclaimed his joy at this miraculous recovery of the precious article mine mine he roared and his words ran violently through the frosty air be calm sir advised hopebe calm calm calm bellowed braddock struggling to a standing position oh confound you sir how can i be calm when i find what i have lost you have a mean groveling soul hope not the soaring spirit of a collector there is no need to be rude to archie father corrected lucy sharply rude rude i am never rude but this mummy braddock peered closely at it and rapped the wood to assure himself it was no phantom yes it is my mummy the mummy of inca caxas now i shall learn how the peruvians embalmed their royal dead mine mine mine he crooned like a mother over a child caressing the coffin then suddenly drew himself upright and fixed mrs jasher with an indignant eye so it was you madam who stole my mummy he declared venomously and i thought of making you my wife oh what an escape i have had shame woman shame mrs jasher stared then her face grew redder than the rouge on her cheeks and she stamped furiously in the neat louis quinze slippers in which she had in judiciously come out how dare you say what you have said she cried her voice shrill and hard with anger mr hope has been saying the same thing are you both mad i never set eyes on the horrid thing in my life and only tonight you told me that you loved yes yes i said many foolish things i dont doubt madam but that is not the question my mummy my mummy he rapped the wood furiouslyhow does my mummy come to be here i dont know said mrs jasher still furious and i dont care dont care dont care when i look forward to your helping me in my lifework as my wife i shall never be your wife cried the widow stamping again i wouldnt be your wife for a thousand or a million pounds marry your mummy you horrid redfaced crabbed little hush hush whispered lucy taking the angry woman round the waist you must make allowances for my father he is so excited over his good fortune that he i shall not make allowance interrupted mrs jasher angrily he practically accuses me of stealing the mummy if i did that i must have murdered poor sidney bolton no no cried the professor wiping his red face i never hinted at such a thing but the mummy is in your garden what of that i dont know how it came there mr hope surely you do not support professor braddock in his preposterous accusation i bring no accusation stuttered the professor neither do i mrs jasher you are excited now go in and sleep and tomorrow you will talk reasonably this brilliant speech was from hope and wrought mrs jasher into a royal rage well she gasped he asks me to be calm as it i wasnt the very calmest person here i declare oh i shall be ill lucy she seized the girls hand and dragged her towards the cottage come in and give me red lavender i shall be in bed for days and days and days oh what brutes men can be but listen you two horrors she indicated braddock and hope as she pushed open the door if you dare to say a word against me ill have an action for libel against you oh dear me how very ill i feel lucy darling help me oh help me andandohohoh she flopped down on the threshold of her home with a cry archie archie shes fainted hope rushed forward and raised the stout little woman in his arms jane attracted by the clamor appeared on the scene and between the three of them they managed to get mrs jasher placed on the sofa of the pink drawingroom she certainly was in a dead faint so hope left her to the administrations of lucy and the servant and walked out again into the garden closing the cottage door after him he found the heartless professor quite oblivious to mrs jashers sufferings so taken up was he with the newly found mummy cockatoo had been sent for a handcart and while he was absent braddock expatiated on the perfections of this relic of peruvian civilization will you sell it to don pedro asked hope after i have done with it not before snapped braddock hovering round his treasure i shall want a percentage on my bargain also archie thought privately that if braddock unswathed the mummy he would find the emeralds and would probably stick to them so that his expedition to egypt might be financed it that case don pedro would no longer wish to buy the corpse of his ancestor but while he debated as to the advisability of telling the professor of the existence of the emeralds cockatoo returned with the handcart you have lost mrs jasher said hope while he assisted the professor to hoist the mummy on to the cart never mind never mind braddock patted the coffin i have found something much more to my mind something ever so much better ha ha chapter xiv the unexpected happens in spite of newspapers and letters and tapemachines and telegrams and such like aids to the speedy diffusion of news the same travels quicker in villages than in cities word of mouth can spread gossip with marvelous rapidity in sparsely inhabited communities since it is obvious that in such places every person knows the otheras the saying goesinside out in every english village walls have ears and windows have eyes so that every cottage is a hotbed of scandal and what is known to one is within the hour known to the others even the sphinx could not have preserved her secret long in such a locality gartley could keep up its reputation in this respect along with the best therefore it was little to be wondered at that early next morning every one knew that professor braddock had found his longlost mummy in mrs jashers garden and had removed the same to the pyramids without unnecessary delay it was not particularly late when the handcart with its uncanny burden had passed along the sole street of the place and several men had emerged from the warrior inn ostensibly to offer help but really to know what the eccentric master of the great house was doing braddock brusquely rejected these offers but the oddly shaped mummy case stained green having been seen it needed little wit for those who had caught a sight of it to put two and two together especially as the weird object had been described at the inquest and had been talked over ever since in every cottage and as the cart had been seen coming out of the widows garden it naturally occurred to the villagers that mrs jasher had been concealing the mummy shortly the rumor spread that she had also murdered bolton for unless she had done so she certainlyaccording to village logiccould not have been possessed of the spoil finally as mrs jashers doors and windows were small and the mummy was rather bulky it was natural to presume that she had hidden it in the garden report said she had buried it and had dug it up just in time to be pounced upon by its rightful owner from which it can be seen that gossip is not invariably accurate however this may be the news of professor braddocks good fortune shortly came to don pedros ears through the medium of the landlady as she revealed what she had heard in the morning the peruvian gentleman was spared a sleepless night but as soon as he learned the truthwhich was surprising enough in its unexpectednesshe hastily finished his breakfast and hurried to the pyramids as yet he had not intended to see braddock so promptly or at least not until he had made further inquiries at pierside but the news that braddock possessed the royal ancestor of the de gayangoses brought him immediately into the museum he greeted the professor in his usual grave and dignified manner and no one would have guessed from his inherent calmness that the unexpected news of braddocks arrival and the still more unexpected information about the green mummy had surprised him beyond measure being somewhat superstitious it also occurred to don pedro that the coincidence meant good fortune to him in the recovery of his longlost ancestor braddock already knowing a great deal about don pedro from lucy and archie hope was only too pleased to see the peruvian hoping to find in him a kindred spirit as yet the professor was not aware of the contents of the ancient latin manuscript which revealed the fact of the hidden emeralds since hope had decided to leave it to the peruvian to impart the information archie knew very well that don pedroas he had plainly statedwished to purchase the mummy and it was only right that braddock should know what he was selling but hope forgot one important fact perhaps from the careless way in which don pedro had told his storynamely that the professor in a second degree was a receiver of stolen goods therefore it was more than probable that the peruvian would claim the mummy as his own property still in that event he would have to prove his claim and that would not be easy the plump little professor had not yet unsealed the case and when don pedro entered he was standing before it rubbing his fat hands with a gloating expression in his face however as cockatoo had brought in the peruvians card braddock expected his visitor and wheeled to face him how are you sir said he extending his hand i am glad to see you as i hear that you know all about this mummy of inca caxas well i do answered de gayangos sitting down in the chair which his host pushed forward but may i ask who told you that this mummy was that of the last inca braddock pinched his plump chin and replied readily enough certainly don pedro i wished to learn the difference in embalming between the egyptians and the ancient peruvians and looked about for a south american corpse unexpectedly i saw in several european newspapers and in two english journals that a green peruvian mummy was for sale at malta for one thousand pounds i sent my assistant sidney bolton to buy it and he managed to get it coffin and all for nine hundred while in malta and before he started back in the diver with the mummy he wrote me an account of the transaction the sellerwho was the son of a maltese collectortold bolton that his father had picked up the mummy in paris some twenty and more years ago it came from lima some thirty years back i believe and according to the collector in paris was the corpse of inca caxas that is the whole story don pedro nodded gravely was there a latin manuscript delivered along with the mummy he asked braddocks eyes opened widely no sir the mummy came thirty years ago from lima to paris it passed twenty years back into the possession of the maltese collector and his son sold it to me a few months ago i never heard of any manuscript then mr hope did not repeat to you what i told him the other night the professor sat down and his mouth grew obstinate mr hope related some story you told him and others about this mummy having been stolen from you from my father corrected the unsmiling peruvian keeping a careful eye on his host that is really the case inca caxas is or was my ancestor and this manuscriptdon pedro produced the same from his inner pocketdetails the funeral ceremonies very interesting most interesting fussed braddock stretching out his hand may i see it you read latin observed don pedro surrendering the manuscript braddock raised his eyebrows of course he said simply every welleducated man reads latin or should do so wait sir until i glance through this document one moment said don pedro as the professor began to literally devour the discolored page you know from hope i have no doubt how i chance upon my own property in europe braddock still with his eyes on the manuscript mumbled your own property quite so quite so you admit that then you will no doubt restore the mummy to me by this time the drift of don pedros observations entirely reached the understanding of the scientist and he dropped the document he was reading to leap to his feet restore the mummy to you he gasped why it is mine pardon me said the peruvian still gravely but very decisively you admitted that it belonged to me braddocks face deepened to a fine purple i didnt know what i was saying he protested how could i say it was your property when i have bought it for nine hundred pounds it was stolen from me that has got to be proved said braddock caustically don pedro rose looking more like don quixote than ever i have the honor to give you my word and yes yes that is all right i cast no imputation on your honor i should think not said the other coldly but strongly all the same you can scarcely expect me to part with so valuable an object braddock waved his hand towards the case without strict inquiry into the circumstances and again sir even if you succeed in proving your ownership i am not inclined to restore the mummy to you for nothing but it is stolen property you are keeping from me i know nothing about that i have only your bare word that it is so don pedro all i know is that i paid nine hundred pounds for the mummy and that it cost the best part of another hundred to bring it to england what i have i keep like your country said the peruvian sarcastically precisely replied the professor suavely every englishman has a bulldog tenacity of purpose brag is a good dog don pedro but holdfast is a better one then i understand said the peruvian stretching out his hand to pick up the fallen manuscript that you will keep the mummy certainly said braddock coolly since i have paid for it also i shall keep the jewels which the manuscript tells mefrom the glance i obtained of itwere buried with it the sole jewels buried are two large emeralds which the mummy holds in its hands explained don pedro restoring the manuscript to his pocket and i wish for them so that i may get money to restore the fortunes of my family no no no said braddock forcibly i have bought the mummy and the jewels with it they will sell to supply me with money to fit out my expedition to the tomb of queen tahoser i shall dispute your claim cried de gayangos losing his calmness braddock waved his hand with supreme content i can give you the address of my lawyers he retorted any steps you choose to take will only result in loss and from what you hint i should not think that you had much money to spend on litigation don pedro bit his lip and saw that it was indeed a more difficult task than he had anticipated to make braddock yield up his prize if you were in lima he muttered speaking spanish in his excitement you would then learn that i speak truly i do not doubt your truth answered the professor in the same language de gayangos wheeled and faced his host much surprised you speak my tongue senor he demanded braddock nodded i have been in spain and i have been in peru he answered dryly therefore i know classical spanish and its colonial dialects as to being in lima i was there and i do not wish to go there again as i had quite enough of those uncivilized parts thirty years ago when the country was much disturbed after your civil war you were in lima thirty years ago echoed don pedro then you were there when vasa stole this mummy i dont know who stole it or even if it was stolen said the professor obstinately and i dont know the name of vasa ah now i remember young hope did say something about the swedish sailor who you said stole the mummy vasa did and brought it to europe to sellprobably to that man in paris who afterwards sold it to your malteses collector no doubt rejoined braddock calmly but what has all this to do with me don pedro i want my mummy raged the other and looked dangerous then you wont get it retorted braddock adopting a pugnacious attitude and quite composed this mummy has caused one death don pedro and from your looks i should think you would like it to cause another will you not be honest ill knock your head off if you bring my honesty into question cried the professor standing on tiptoe like a bantam the best thing to do will be to take the matter into court then the law can decide and i have little doubt but what it will decide in my favor the englishman and the peruvian glared at one another and cockatoo who was crouching on the floor glanced from one angry face to another he guessed that the white men were quarreling and perhaps would come to blows it was at this moment that a knock came to the door and a minute later archie entered braddock glanced at him and took a sudden resolution as he stepped forward hope you are just in time he declared don pedro states that the mummy belongs to him and i assert that i have bought it we shall make you umpire he wants it i want it what is to be done the mummy is my own flesh and blood mr hope said don pedro precious little of either about it said braddock contemptuously archie twisted a chair round and straddled his long legs across it with his arms resting on its back his quick brain had rapidly comprehended the situation and being acquainted with both sides of the question it was not difficult to come to a decision if it was hard that don pedro should lose his ancestors mummy it was equally hard that braddockor rather himselfshould lose the purchase money seeing that it had been paid in good faith to the seller in malta for a presumably righteously acquired object on these premises the young solon proceeded to deliver judgment i understand said he judiciously that don pedro had the mummy stolen from him thirty years ago and that you professor bought it under the impression that the maltese owner had a right to possess it yes snapped braddock and i daresay the maltese owner thought so too since he bought it from that collector in paris hope nodded and if vasa sold it to the man in paris said he calmly he certainly would not tell the purchaser that he had looted the mummy in lima and the poor man would not know that he was receiving stolen goods is that right don pedro yes sir said the peruvian who had recovered his temper and his gravity but i declare solemnly that the mummy was stolen from my father and should belong to me no one disputes that said archie cheerfully but it ought to belong to the professor also since he has bought it now as it cant possibly belong to two people we must split the difference you professor must sell back the mummy to don pedro for the price you paid for it and then don pedro you must recompense professor braddock for his loss i have not much money said don pedro gravely still i am willing to do as you say i dont know that i am protested braddock noisily there are the two emeralds which are of immense value as don pedro says and they belong to me since the mummy is my property professor said archie solemnly you must do right even if you lose by it i believe the story of senor de gayangos and the mummy with its jewels belongs to him besides you only wish to see the way in which the inca race embalmed their dead well then unpack the mummy here in the presence of don pedro when you have satisfied your curiosity and when senor de gayangos signs a check for one thousand pounds he can take away the corpse you have had so much trouble over it that i wonder your are not anxious to see the last of it but the emeralds would sell for much money and would defray the expenses of my expedition into egypt to search for that queens tomb i understood from lucy that mrs jasher intended to finance that expedition when she became your wife humph muttered braddock stroking his fat chin i said a few foolish things to her last night when i was heated up she may not forgive me hope a woman will forgive anything to the man she loves said archie braddock was no fool and could not help casting a glance at his tubby figure which was reflected in a near mirror it seemed incredible that mrs jasher could love him for his looks and the fact that he might some day be a baronet did not strike him at the moment as a consideration however he foresaw trouble and expense should don pedro go to law as he seemed determined to do taking all things into consideration braddock thought that archies judgment was a good one and yielded well he said after reflection let us agree i shall open the case and examine the mummy which after all is the reason why i bought it when i have satisfied myself as to the difference between the modes of embalming don pedro can give me a check and take away the mummy i only hope that he will have less trouble with it than i have had and so speaking braddock signing to cockatoo to bring all the necessary tools laid hands on the case i am content said don pedro briefly and seated himself in a chair beside the young daniel who had delivered judgment hope offered to assist the professor to open the case but was dismissed with an abrupt refusal though i am glad you are present to see the mummy unpacked said braddock laboring at the lid of the case for if the emeralds are missing don pedro might accuse me of stealing them why should the emeralds be missing asked hope quickly braddock shrugged his shoulders sidney bolton was killed said he in a low voice and it was not likely that any one would commit a murder for the sake of this mummy and then leave it stranded in mrs jashers garden i have my doubts about the safety of the emeralds else i would not have consented to sell the thing back again with this honest speech the professor vigorously attacked the lid of the case and inserted a steel instrument into the cracks to prize up the covering the lid was closed with wooden pegs in an antique but perfectly safe manner and apparently had not been opened since the dead inca had been laid to rest therein hundreds of years ago among the andean mountains don pedro winced at this desecration of the dead but as he had given his consent there was nothing left to do but to grin and bear it in a wonderfully short space of time considering the neatness of the workmanship and the holding power of the wooden pegs the lid was removed then the four onlookers saw that the mummy had been tampered with swathed in greenstained llama wool it lay rigid in its case but the swathings had been cut the hands protruded and the emeralds were gonetorn rudely from the hard grip of the dead chapter xv an accusation both don pedro and professor braddock were amazed and angry at the disappearance of the jewels but hope did not express much surprise considering the facts of the murder it was just what he expected although it must be confessed that he was wise after the event i refer you to your own words immediately before the case was opened professor he remarked after the first surprise had subsided words words snapped braddock who was anything but pleased what words of mine do you mean hope you said that it was not likely that any one would commit a murder for the sake of the mummy only and then leave it stranded in mrs jashers garden also you declared that you had your doubts about the safety of the emeralds else you would not have consented to sell the mummy again to its rightful owner the professor nodded quite so quite so and what i say i hold to he retorted especially as i have proved myself a true prophet you can both see for yourselves he waved his hand towards the rifled case that poor sidney must have been killed for the sake of the emeralds the question is who killed him the person who knew about the jewels said don pedro promptly of course but who did know i was ignorant until you told me about the manuscript and you hope he searched archies face do you intend to accuse me questioned the young man with a slight laugh i assure you professor that i was ignorant of what had been buried with the corpse until don pedro related his story the other night to myself and random and the ladies braddock turned impatiently to de gayangos as he did not approve of archies apparent flippancy does any one else know of the contents of this manuscript he demanded irritably don pedro nursed his chin and looked musingly on the ground it is just possible that vasa may vasa vasa oh yes the sailor who stole the mummy thirty years ago from your father in lima pooh pooh pooh you tell me that this manuscript is written in latin and evidently in monkish latin at that which is of the worst your sailor could not read it and would not know the value of the manuscript if he had he would have carried it off senor said the peruvian politely i have an idea that my father made a translation of this manuscript or at all events a copy but i understood put in hope still astride of his chair that you did not find the original manuscript until your father died that is quite true sir assented the other readily but i did not tell you everything the other night my father it was who found the manuscript at cuzco and although i cannot state authoritatively yet i believe i am correct in saying that he had a copy made but whether the copy was merely a transcript or actually a translation i cannot tell i think it was the former as if vasa reading a translation had learned of the jewels he undoubtedly would have stolen them before selling this mummy to the parisian collector perhaps he did said braddock pointing to the rifled corpse you see that the emeralds are missing your assistants assassin stole them insisted don pedro coldly we cannot be sure of that retorted the professor although i admit that no man would jeopardize his neck for the sake of a corpse archie looked surprised but an enthusiast such as you are professor might risk so much for once in his life braddock made a goodhumored reply no sir not even for this mummy would i place myself in the power of the law and i do not think that any other scientist would either we savants may not be worldly but we are not fools however the fact remains that the jewels are gone and whether they were stolen by vasa thirty years ago or by poor sidneys assassin the other day i dont know and what is more i dont care i shall examine the mummy further and in a couple of days don pedro can bring me a check for one thousand and remove his ancestor no no cried the peruvian hurriedly since the emeralds are missing i am not in a position to pay you one thousand english pounds sir i want to take back the body of inca caxas to lima as one must show respect to ones ancestors but the fact is i cannot pay the money you said that you could shouted the exasperated professor in his bullying way i admit it senor but i had hoped to do so when i sold the emeralds whichas you can seeare not available therefore the body of my royal ancestor must remain here until i can procure the money and it may be that sir frank random will help me in this matter he wouldnt help me snapped braddock so why should he help you don pedro looking more dignified than ever drew himself up to his tall height sir frank he said in a stately way has done me the honor of seeking to be my soninlaw as my daughter loves him i am willing to permit the marriage but now that i have learned the emeralds are lost i shall not consent until sir frank buys the mummy from you professor it is only right that my daughters hand should redeem her regal forefather from purely scientific surroundings and that she should take the mummy back to be buried in lima at the same time sir i must say that i am the rightful owner of the dead and that you should surrender the mummy to me free of charge what and lose a thousand pounds cried braddock furiously no sir i shall do nothing of the sort you only wanted the mummy for the sake of the jewels and now that they are lost you do not care what becomes of your confounded ancestor and you the professor would have gone on still more furiously but that hope seeing don pedro was growing angry at the insult chimed in let me throw oil on the troubled waters he said smoothly don pedro is not able to redeem the mummy until the emeralds are found as such is the case we must find the emeralds and enable him to do what is necessary and how are we to find the jewels asked braddock crossly by finding the assassin how is that to be done asked de gayangos gloomily i have been doing my best at pierside but i cannot find a single clue vasa is not to be found vasa exclaimed archie and the professor both profoundly astonished don pedro raised his eyebrows certainly vasa if anyone must have killed your assistant since he alone could have known that the jewels were buried with inca caxas but my dear sir argued hope goodnaturedly if vasa stole the manuscript whether translated or not he certainly must have learned the truth long long ago since thirty years have elapsed in that event he must have stolen the jewels as professor braddock remarked lately before he sold the mummy to the parisian collector that may be so said don pedro obstinately while the professor muttered his approval but we cannot be certain on that point no onei agree with the professor in thiswould have risked his neck to steal a mere mummy therefore the motive for the committal of the crime must have been the emeralds only vasa knew of their existence outside myself and my dead father he therefore must be the assassin i shall hunt for him and when i find him i shall have him arrested but you cant possibly recognize the man after thirty years argued braddock disbelievingly i have a royal memory for faces said don pedro imperturbably and in the past i saw much of vasa he was then a young sailor of twenty humph muttered braddock he is now fifty and must have changed in thirty years youll never recognize him oh i think so said the peruvian smoothly his eyes were peculiarly blue and full of light also he had a scar on the right temple from a blow which he received in a street riot in which i also was concerned finally gentlemen vasa loved a peon girl on my fathers estate and she induced him to have the sun encircled by a serpenta peruvian symboltattooed on his left wrist with all these marks and with my memory for faces which never yet has failed me i have no doubt but what i shall recognize the man and then and then i shall have him arrested hope shrugged his square shoulders he had not much belief in don pedros boasted royal memory and did not think that he would recognize a young sailor of twenty in what would certainly be a grizzled old salt of fifty years however it was possible that the man might be right in his surmise since vasa alone could have known about the emeralds the only doubt was whether he would have waited for thirty years before looting the mummy archie said nothing of these thoughts as they would only serve to prolong an unprofitable discussion but he made one suggestion your best plan he said suggestively is to write a description of vasawho by the way has probably changed his nameand hand it to the police with the promise of a reward if he is found i am very poor senor surely the professor here i can offer nothing said braddock quickly as i am quite as poor as you are if not more so sir frank might help he added sarcastically i shall not ask said don pedro loftily if sir frank chooses to become my soninlaw by purchasing back my royal ancestor to which you have no right i am willing that it should be so but poor as i am i shall offer a reward myself since the honor of the de gayangoses is involved in this matter what reward do you suggest mr hope five hundred pounds said the professor quickly too much said hope sharplyfar too much make the reward one hundred pounds don pedro that is enough to tempt many a man the peruvian bowed and noted down the amount i shall go at once to pierside and see inspector date who had to do with the inquest he remarked meanwhile professor please do not desecrate my royal ancestors body more than you can help i shall certainly not search for any more emeralds retorted braddock dryly now clear out both of you and leave me to examine the mummy cockatoo show these gentlemen out and let no one else in don pedro returned to the warrior hotel to inform his daughter of what had taken place with the intention of going in the afternoon to pierside meanwhile he wrote out a full description of vasa making an allowance for the lapse of years and explaining the scar and the symbol on the left wrist hope also sought lucy and related the latest development of the case the girl was not surprised as she likewise believed that the assassin had desired more than the mummy when he murdered sidney bolton mrs jasher did not know about the emeralds she asked suddenly no replied archie much surprised surely you do not suspect her of having a hand in the devilment certainly not was the prompt answer only i cannot understand how the mummy came to be in her garden it was brought up from the river i expect but why to mrs jashers garden hope shook his head i cannot tell that the whole thing is a mystery and seems likely to remain so it seems to me said the girl after a pause that it would be best for my father to return this mummy to don pedro and have done with it since it seems to bring bad luck then he can marry mrs jasher and go to egypt on her fortune to seek for this tomb i doubt very much if mrs jasher will marry the professor now after what he said last night nonsense my father was in a rage and said what first came into his mind i daresay she is angry however i shall see her this afternoon and put matters right you are very anxious that the professor should marry the lady i am replied lucy seriously as i want to leave my father comfortably settled when i marry you the sooner he makes mrs jasher his wife the readier will he be to let me go and i want to marry you as soon as i possibly can i am tired of gartley and of this present life of course to this speech archie could make only one answer and as that took the form of kissing it was entirely satisfactory to miss kendal then they discussed the future and also the proposed engagement of sir frank random to the peruvian lady but both left the subject of the mummy alone as they were quite weary of the matter and neither could suggest a solution of the mystery meanwhile professor braddock had passed a very pleasant hour in examining the swathings of the mummy but his pleasure was destined to be cut short sooner than he desired as captain hiram hervey unexpectedly arrived although cockatooas he had been instructeddid his best to keep him out the sailor forced his way in and heralded his appearance by throwing the kanaka headforemost into the museum what does this mean demanded the fiery professor while cockatoo with an angry expression struggled to his feet and hervey smoking his inevitable cheroot stood on the thresholdhow dare you treat my property in this careless way guess your property should behave itself then said the captain in careless tones and sauntered into the room dy think im goin to be chucked out by a measly nigger andgreat scottthis latter exclamation was extorted by the sight of the mummy braddock motioned to the still angry cockatoo to move aside and then nodded triumphantly you didnt expect to see that did you he asked hervey came to anchor on a chair and turned the cheroot in his mouth with an odd look at the mummy when will he be hanged braddock stared when will who be hanged the man as stole that thing we havent found him yet braddock informed him swiftly then how in creation did you annex the corpse the professor sat down and explained the lean long mariner listened quietly only nodding at intervals he did not seem to be surprised when he heard that the corpse of the head inca had been found in mrs jashers garden especially when braddock explained the whereabouts of the property wal he drawled that dont make my hair stand on end i guess the garden was on his way and he used it for a cemetery what are you talking about demanded the perplexed scientist about the man who strangled your help and yanked away the corpse but i dont know who he is nobody knows go slow i do you braddock started and flung himself across the room to seize hervey by the lapels of his reefer coat you know tell me who he is so that i can get the emeralds emeralds hervey removed braddocks plump hands and stared greedily dont you know no of course you dont but two emeralds were buried with the mummy and they have been stolen who by no doubt by the assassin who murdered poor sidney hervey spat on the floor and his weatherbeaten face took on an expression of profound regret i guess im a fool of the best why asked braddock again puzzled to think said hervey addressing the mummy that you were on board my boat and i never looted you what braddock stamped would you have committed theft theft be hanged was the reply it aint thieving to loot the dead i guess a corpse hasnt got any use for jewels you bet id have gummed straightways onto that mummy when i brought it from malta in the old diver had i known it was a jewelers shop of sorts huh two emeralds and i never knew i could kick myself you are a blackguard gasped the astonished professor oh shucks was the elegant retort give it a rest im no worse than that dandy gentleman who added murder to stealing anyhow ah braddock bounded off his chair like an indiarubber ball you said that you knew who had committed the murder wal drawled hervey again i do and i dont that is i suspect but i cant swear to the business before a judge who killed bolton asked the professor furiously tell me at once not me unless its made worth my while it will be by don pedro that yellowstomach whats he got to do with it i have just told you the mummy belongs to him he came to europe to find it he wants the emeralds and intends to offer a reward of one hundred pounds for the discovery of the assassin hervey arose briskly im right on the job said he sauntering to the door ill go to that old inn of yours where you say the dons stopping and look him up guess ill trade but who killed bolton asked braddock running to the door and gripping hervey by his coat the mariner looked down on the anxious face of the plump little man with a grim smile i can tell you said he as you cant figure out the business unless im on the racket no sir im the white boy in thin circus the professor shook the lean sailor in his anxiety who is he that almighty aristocrat that came on board my ship when i lay in the thames on the very afternoon i arrived with bolton who do you mean demanded braddock more and more perplexed sir frank random what did he kill bolton and steal my mummy and hide it in that garden on his way to the fort i guess he did the professor sat down and closed his eyes with horror when he opened them again hervey was gone chapter xvi the manuscript again but the professor was not going to let captain hervey escape without giving him full information before the yankee skipper could reach the front door braddock was at his heels gasping and blowing like a grampus come back come back tell me all i reckon not rejoined the mariner removing braddocks grip you aint the one to give the money ill go to the don or to inspector date of pierside but sir frank must be innocent insisted braddock hes got to prove it was the dry response let me go no you must tell me on what grounds oh the devil take you said hervey hastily and sat down on one of the hall chairs its this way since you wont let me skip until i tell you this almighty aristocrat came to pierside on the same afternoon as i cast anchor while bolton was on board he looked in to have a yarn of sorts what about now how in creation should i know snapped the skipper i wasnt on hand as id enough to do with unloading cargo but his lordship went with bolton to the stateroom and they talked for half an hour when they came out i saw that his lordship had his hair riz and heard him saying things to bolton what sort of things well for one he said youll repent of this and then again your life isnt safe while you keep it meaning the mummy i reckon thats so unless i am mistaken said hervey serenely why didnt you go to the police with this information me not much why i saw no way of making dollars and then again i did not think of putting things together until i found that his lorship meaning sir frank interpolated the professor frowning im talking queens or kings or republican lingo i guess and i do mean his lorship said the skipper drylyuntil i found that his lorship had been in the publichouse where the crime was committed the sailors rest when did he go there in the evening after his talk with bolton and after a rowas they both seemed to have their hair offhe skipped over the side and went back to his yacht which wasnt far away bolton took his blamed mummy ashore and got fixed at the sailors rest i gathered afterwards from the second mate of the diver which aint my ship now that his lorship came into the hotel and had a drink afterwards my second mate saw him talking to bolton through the window in the same place as the woman talked questioned the professor thats so only it was later in the evening that the woman came along to give chinmusic through the window i am bound to say added the captain generously that no one i can place my hand on saw his lorship loafing about the hotel after dark but what of that he may have laid his plans and arranged for the corpse to be found later in that blamed packing case is this all your evidence its enough i guess not to procure a warrant why a man in the states would be electrocuted on half the evidence i daresay retorted the little man with contempt but we are in a land where justice of the purest prevails all your evidence is circumstantial it proves nothing the captain was considerably nettled i calculate that it proves sir frank wanted the mummy else why did he come on board my ship to see your infernal assistant the words he used showed that he was warning bolton how hed do for him and then he talked through the window and was in the publichouse which aint a place for an almighty aristocrat to shelter in i guess hes the man wanted by the police why added hervey warming to his tale hed a slapup yacht laying near the blamed hotel and could easily ship the corpse after slipping it through the window when he got tired of it and looted the emeralds he took it by boat below the fort to mrs jashers garden and left it there so as to pull the wool over the eyes of the police its as clear as mud to me you search his lorships shanty and youll find the emeralds it is strange muttered braddock unwillingly strange but not true said a voice from the head of the stairs and young hope came down leisurely with a pale face but a very determined air random is absolutely innocent how do you know demanded the skipper contemptuously because he is an english gentleman and my very good friend huh i guess that defense wont save him from being lynched meanwhile braddock was looking irritably at archie youve been listening to a private conversation sir how dare you listen if you hold private conversations at the top of your voices in the hall you must be expected to be listened to said archie coolly i plead guilty and i am not sorry when did you come in time to hear all that captain hervey has explained i was chatting with lucy and had just left her when i heard your loud voices has lucy heard anything no she is busy in her room but ill tell her hope turned to mount the stairs she likes random and will no more believe him guilty than i do at this present moment stop cried braddock flying forward to pull hope back as he placed his foot on the first stair tell lucy nothing just now we must go to the fort youand i to see random hervey you come also and then you can accuse sir frank to his face if he dares to do it said archie who looked and felt indignant oh ill accuse him right enough when the time comes said hervey in his coolest manner but the time isnt now savy i am going to see the don first and make sure of this reward faugh cried hope with disgust bloodmoney what of that ifs a man is a murderer he should be lynched my friend sir frank random is no murderer hes got to prove that as i said before rejoined the yankee in a calm way and strolled to the door solong gents both ill light out for the warrior inn and play my cards and i may tell you he added pausing at the door which he opened that i havent got that blamed windjammer so need money to hold out until another steamer comes along one hundred pounds english currency will just fill the bill so now you know the lay im on solong and he walked quietly out of the house leaving archie and braddock looking at one another with pale faces the assurance of hervey surprised and horrified them still they could not believe that sir frank random had been guilty of so brutal a crime for one thing said hope after a pause random did not know where the emeralds were to be found or even that they existed i understood that he did know said braddock reluctantly in my hearing and in your own you heard don pedro state that he had related the story of the manuscript to random you forget that i learned about the emeralds at the same time said hope quietly yet this yankee skipper does not accuse me the knowledge of the emeralds came to randoms ears and to mine long after the crime was committed to have a motive for killing bolton and stealing the emeralds random would have had to know when he arrived in england and why should he have not known asked the professor biting his lip vexedly i dont want to accuse random or even to doubt him as he is a very good fellow even though he refused to assist me with money when i desired a reward to be offered all the same he met don pedro in genoa and it is just possible that the man told him of the jewels buried with the mummy archie shook his head i doubt that said he thoughtfully random was as astonished as the rest of us when don pedro told his arabian night story however the point can be easily settled by sending for random i daresay he is at the fort i shall send cockatoo for him at once said the professor quickly and walked into the museum to instruct the kanaka archie remained where he was and seated himself on a chair with folded arms and knitted brows it was incredible that an english gentleman with a stainless name and such a wellknown soldier should commit so terrible a crime and the matter of herveys accusation was complicated by the factof which hervey was ignorantthat don pedro was willing that random should become his soninlaw hope wondered what the fiery proud peruvian would say when he heard his friend denounced his reflections on this point were cut short by the return of the professor who appeared at the door of the museum dismissing cockatoo when the kanaka took his departure braddock beckoned to the young man there is no reason why we should talk in the hall and let the whole house know of this new difficulty he said in a testy manner come in here hope entered and looked with illconcealed repugnance at the uncanny shape of the green mummy which was lying on a long table he examined the portions where the swathings had been cut with some sharp instrument to reveal the dry bony hands which formerly had held the costly jewels the face was invisible and covered with a mask of dull beaten gold formerly the eyes had been jeweled but these last were now absent he pointed out the mask to the professor who was hovering over the weird dead with a large magnifyingglass it is strange said hope earnestly that the mask of gold was not stolen also since it is so valuable unless melted down the mask could be traced said braddock after a pause the jewels according to don pedro are of immense value and so could have been got rid of easily random was satisfied with those dont talk of him in that way as though his guilt was certain said hope wincing well you must admit that the evidence against him is strong but purely circumstantial circumstantial evidence has hanged many an innocent man before now humph said braddock uneasily i hope it wont hang our friend however we shall hear what he has to say i have sent cockatoo to the fort to bring him here at once if random is absent cockatoo is to leave a note in his room on the writingtable would it not have been better to have told cockatoo to give the note to randoms servant i think not responded braddock dryly randoms servant is certainly one of the most stupid men in the entire army he would probably forget to give him the note and as it is important that we should see random at once it is better that he should find it placed personally on his writingtable by cockatoo upon whom i can depend archie abandoned the argument as it really mattered very little he took up another line of conversation i expect if the criminal tries to dispose of the emeralds he will be caught said he such large jewels are too noticeable to escape comment humph it depends upon the cleverness of the thief said the professor who was more taken up with the mummy than with the conversation he might have the jewels cut into smaller stones or he might go to india and dispose of them to some rajah who would certainly say nothing i dont know how criminals act myself as i have never studied their methods but i hope that the clue you mention will be hit upon if only for randoms sake i dont believe for one moment that random is in danger said archie and if he is i shall turn detective myself i wish you joy replied braddock bending over the mummy look hope at the wonderful color of this wool there are some arts we have lost completelydyeing of this surprising beauty is one humph mused the archaeologist i wonder why this particular mummy is dyed green or rather why it is wrapped in green bandages yellow was the royal color of the ancient peruvian monarchs vicuna wool dyed yellow what do you think hope it is strange archie shrugged his shoulders i can say nothing because i know nothing he said sharply all i do know is that i wish this precious mummy had never been brought here it has caused trouble ever since its arrival well said braddock surveying the dead with some disfavor i must say that i shall be glad to see the last of it myself i know now all that i wanted to know humph i wonder if don pedro will allow me to strip the mummy of course it is mine not his i shall unswathe it entirely and braddock was about to lay sacrilegious hands on the dead when cockatoo entered breathlessly he had been so quick that he must have run to the fort and back again i knock at door said the kanaka delivering his message and i hear no voice i go in and find no one so i put the letter on the table i come down and ask and a soldier tells me sir his master is coming back in half an hour you should have waited said braddock waving cockatoo aside come along with me to the fort hope but random will come here as soon as he returns very likely but i cant wait i am anxious to hear what he has to say in his defense come cockatoo my coat my hat my gloves stir yourself you scoundrel archie was not unwilling to go since he was anxious also to hear what random would say to the absurd accusation brought against him by the yankee in a few minutes the two men were walking smartly down the road through the village the professor striving to keep up with hopes longer legs by trotting as hard as he could halfway down the village they met a trap and in it captain hervey being driven to the jessum railway station have you seen don pedro asked the professor stopping the vehicle i reckon not answered hervey stolidly hes gone into pierside to see the police im off there also you had better come with us said archie sternlywe are going to see sir frank random give him my respects said the skipper coldbloodedly and say that hes worth one hundred pounds to me he waved his hand and the trap moved away but he looked back with a wry smile say ill square the matter for double the money and command of his yacht braddock and archie looked after the trap in disgust what a scoundrel the man is said the professor pettishly hed sell his father for what he could get it shows how much his word is to be depended upon i expect this accusation of random is a putup job i hope so for randoms sake said braddock trotting briskly along in a short time they arrived at the fort and were informed that sir frank had not yet returned but was expected back every moment in the meanwhile as braddock and hope were both extremely well known they were shown into randoms quarters which were on the first floor when the soldierservant retired and the door was closed hope seated himself near the window while braddock trotted round looking into things its a dog kennel said the professor i told random that perhaps we should have waited him in the mess suggested archie no no no we couldnt talk there with a lot of silly young fools hanging about i told random that i would never enter the mess so he invited me to come always to his quarters he was in love with lucy then chuckled the professor and nothing was too good for me not even the dog kennel said hope dryly for the professors chatter was so rude as to be quite annoying pooh pooh pooh random doesnt mind a joke you hope have no sense of humor your name is scotch also i believe you are a caledonian i am nothing of the sort i was born on this side of the border you might have been born at the north pole for all i care said the little man politely i dont like artists they are usually silly i wish lucy had married a man of science now dont talk rubbish i know what you are going to say well said archie humoring him what am i going to say this nonplussed the irritable savant hum hum hum i dont know and dont care pouf how hot this room is what a number of books of travel random has braddock was now at the bookcase which consisted of shelves swung by cords against the wall random travels a great deal archie reminded him quite so quite so wastes his money on that silly yacht but he hasnt traveled in south america i expect hes going there come here hope and see the many many books about peru and chili and brazil there must be a dozen and all library books too archie sauntered towards the shelves i expect random is getting up the subject of south america so as to talk to donna inez probably probably snapped braddock pulling several of the books out of place why there isnt aah dear me what a catastrophe he might well say so for in his desire to examine the books they all tipped off the shelves and lay in a disorderly heap on the floor hope began to pick them up and replace them and so did the author of the mischief among the books were several papers scribbled with notes and braddock bundled these all in a heap shortly he caught sight of the writing on one hullo latin said he and read a line or two oh he gasped hope hope the manuscript of don pedro impossible archie rose and stared at the discolored paper sorry to have kept you said random entering at this moment you villain shouted braddock furiously so you are guilty after all chapter xvii circumstantial evidence random was so taken aback by the fierce accusation of the professor that he stood suddenly still at the door and did not advance into the room yet he did not look so much afraid as puzzled whatever braddock might have thought hope from the expression on the young soldiers face was more than ever satisfied of his innocence what are you talking about professor asked random genuinely surprised you know well enough retorted the professor upon my word i dont said the other walking into the room and unbuckling his sword i find you here with the contents of my bookcase on the floor and you promptly accuse me of being guilty of what i should like to know perhaps you can tell me hope there is no need for hope to tell you sir you are perfectly well aware of your own villainy random frowned i allow a certain amount of latitude to my guests professor he said with marked dignity but for a man of your age and position you go too far be more explicit allow me to speak intervened archie anticipating braddock random the professor has just had a visit from captain hiram hervey who was the skipper of the diver he accuses you of having murdered bolton what the baronet started back looking thunderstruck wait a moment i have not finished yet hervey accuses you of this murder of stealing the mummy of gaining possession of the emeralds and of placing the rifled corpse in mrs jashers garden so that she might be accused of committing the crime exactly cried braddock seeing that his host remained silent from sheer surprise hope has stated the case very clearly now sir your defense defense defense random found his tongue at last and spoke indignantly i have no defense to make ah then you acknowledge your guilt i acknowledge nothing the accusation is too preposterous for any denial to be necessary do you believe this of me he looked from one to the other i dont said archie quickly there is some mistake thank you hope and you professor braddock fidgeted about the room i dont know what to think he said at length hervey spoke very decisively oh indeed returned random dryly and walking to the door he locked it in that case i must ask you for an explanation and neither of you shall leave this room until one is given your proofs here is one of them snapped braddock throwing the manuscript on the table where did you get this random took up the discolored paper with a bewildered air i never set eyes on this before he said much puzzled what is it a copy of the manuscript mentioned by don pedro which describes the two emeralds buried with the mummy of inca caxas i see random understood all in a moment so you say that i knew of the emeralds from this and so murdered bolton to obtain them pardon me said braddock with elaborate politeness hervey says that you murdered my poor assistant and although my discovery of this manuscript proves that you must have known about the jewels i say nothing i wait to hear your defense thats very good of you remarked sir frank ironically so it seems that i am in the dock perhaps the counsel for the prosecution will state the evidence against me and he looked again from one to the other archie shook the baronet by the hand very warmly my dear fellow he declared decidedly i dont believe one word of the evidence in that case there must be a flaw in it retorted random but did not seem to be unmoved by hopes generous action sit down professor it appears that you are against me until i hear your defense said the old man obstinately i cannot make any until i hear your evidence go on i am waiting and sir frank flung himself into a chair where he sat calmly his eyes steadily fixed on the professors face where did you get that manuscript asked braddock sharply i got it nowhere this is the first time i have seen it yet it was hidden amongst your books then i cant say how it got there were you looking for it no certainly not to pass the time while waiting i examined your library and in pulling out a book your case being a swing one overbalanced and shot its contents on to the floor amongst the papers which fell with the books i caught a glimpse of the manuscript and noting that it was written in latin i picked it up surprised to think that a frivolous young man such as you are should study a dead language a few words showed me that the manuscript was a copy of the one referred to by don pedro one moment said archie who had been thinking perhaps this is the original manuscript which de gayangos has given to you random it is good of you to afford me a loophole of escape said sir frank leaning back with folded arms but de gayangos gave me nothing i saw the manuscript in his hands when he showed it to us all at mrs jashers but whether this is the original or a copy i cant say don pedro certainly did not give it to me has don pedro been in your quarters asked hope thoughtfully no he has only visited me in the mess and even if don pedro did come in herefor i guess what is in your mindi really do not see why he should slip a manuscript which he values highly amongst my books then you really never saw this before said braddock indicating the paper on the table and impressed by randoms earnestness how often do you want me to deny it retorted the young man impatiently perhaps you will state on what grounds i am accused braddock nodded and cleared his throat captain hervey declared that your yacht arrived at pierside almost at the same time as his steamer quite right when don pedro received a wire from malta stating that the mummy had been sold to you and that it was being shipped to london on the diver i got up steam at once and chased the tramp to that port as the tramp was slow and my boat was fast i arrived on the same day and almost at the same hour even though herveys boat had the start of mine why were you anxious to follow the diver asked hope don pedro wished to get back the mummy and asked me to follow as i was in love with donna inez and still am i was only too willing to oblige him braddock nodded again hervey says that you went on board the diver and had an interview with bolton that is perfectly true and my visit was paid for the same reason as i followed the steamer to londonthat is i acted on behalf of don pedro i wished to ascertain for certain that the mummy was on board and having done so from bolton i urged him to induce you to give back the same free of charge to de gayangos from whom it had been stolen he refused as he declared that he intended to deliver it to you i knew i could always trust bolton said the professor enthusiastically it would have been better for you to have come to me random i daresay but i wished as i told you to make certain that the mummy was on board that was the real reason for my visit but being in boltons company i naturally told him that don pedro claimed the mummy as his property and warned him that if you or he kept the same that there would be trouble did you use threats asked hope remembering what he had overheard no certainly not yes you did cried braddock quickly hervey declares that you told bolton that he would repent of keeping the mummy and that his life would not be safe while he held it to the surprise of both visitors random admitted using these serious threats without a moments hesitation don pedro told me that many indians both in lima and cuzco who look upon him as the lawful descendant of the last inca are anxiously expecting the return of the royal mummy he also stated that when the indians knew who held the mummy they would send one of themselves to get it back if hedon pedro that isdid not fetch it to get back the mummy don pedro declared that these indians would not stop short of murder hence my warning to bolton oh archie jumped up with widely opened eyes then perhaps this solves the problem bolton was murdered by some peruvian indian random shook his head gravely again you offer me a loophole of escape my dear fellow he said sententiously but that theory will not hold water at present the indians in lima and cuzco do not know that the mummy has been found don pedro only chanced upon the paper which announced the sale by accident and had no time to communicate with his barbaric friends in south america failing to get the mummy from you professor he would have returned to peru and then would have told who possessed the corpse of inca caxas leaving the indians to deal with the matter in that case my warning to bolton would be necessary but at the time i told him it was not necessary however bolton remained true to you professor and declined to surrender the mummy i therefore wired to don pedro at genoa that the mummy was on board the diver and was being sent to gartley i also advised him to come to me here in order to be introduced to you the rest you know there was a moments silence then archie to test if random was willing to admit everythingas an innocent man certainly wouldasked significantly did you see bolton again after your interview on board ship it was then that the baronet proved his good faith oh yes he said easily and without hesitation i was walking about pierside later and passing along that waterside alley near the sailors rest i saw a window on the ground floor open and bolton looking out across the river i stopped and asked him when he proposed to take the mummy to gartley and if it was on shore he admitted that it was in the hotel but declined to say when he would send it on to you professor when he closed the window i afterwards went into the hotel and had a drink in order to ask casually when mr bolton intended to leave i gatherednot directly of course but in a roundabout waythat he had arranged to go next morning and to send on his luggage then i left and went to london in the course of time i returned here and learned of the murder and the disappearance of the corpse of inca caxas and now random stood up having admitted all this perhaps you will believe me to be innocent you have no idea who murdered bolton and placed his body in the packing case asked braddock manifestly disappointed no no more than i have any idea of the person who placed the mummy case and its contents in mrs jashers garden oh you know that said archie quickly yes the news was all over the village this morning i could hardly help knowing it and i believe that the mummy has been taken to your house professor it has admitted braddock dryly i took it myself from mrs jashers arbor in a handcart with the assistance of cockatoo but when i made an examination this morning in the presence of hope and don pedro i found that the swathings of the body had been ripped up and that the emeralds mentioned in that manuscript had been stolen strange said random with a frown and by whom no doubt by the assassin of sidney bolton probably random kicked a mat straight with his foot at any rate the theft of the emeralds shows that it was not any indian who killed bolton none of them would rifle so sacred a corpse besides whichas you saythe indians in peru do not know that the mummy has reappeared after thirty years seclusion chimed in hope rising well and what is to be done now for answer sir frank picked up the manuscript which still remained on the table i shall see don pedro about this he said quietly and ascertain if it is the original or a copy braddock rose slowly and stared at the paper do you know latin he asked no rejoined random knowing what the savant meant i learned it of course but i have forgotten much i might translate a word or two but certainly not the hedgepriest latin in which this is written he looked carefully at the manuscript as he spoke but who could have placed it in your room questioned archie we cannot learn that until we see don pedro if this is the original manuscript which we saw the other night we may learn how it passed from the possession of de gayangos to my bookcase if it is a copy then we must learn if possible who owned it don pedro said that a transcript or a translation had been made mentioned hope evidently a transcript said braddock glaring at the paper in randoms hand but how could that find its way from lima to this place it might have been packed up with the mummy suggested archie no contradicted random decisively in that event the man in malta from whom the mummy was bought would have discovered the emeralds and would have taken them perhaps he did we have nothing to show that boltons assassin committed the crime for the sake of the jewels he must have done so cried the professor irritably else there is no motive for the commission of the crime but i think myself that we must start at the other end to find a clue when we discover who placed the mummy in mrs jashers garden that will not be easy murmured hope thoughtfully though of course the same must have been brought by river let us go down to the embankment and see if there are any signs of a boat having been brought there last night and he moved to the door random i cannot leave the fort as i am on duty replied the officer putting the manuscript away in a drawer and locking the same but this evening i shall see don pedro and in the meanwhile i shall endeavor to learn from my servant who visited me lately while i was absent the manuscript must have been brought here by someone but i trust he added as he escorted his two visitors to the door that you now acquit me of yes yes yes cried braddock hastily cutting him short and shaking his hand i apologize for my suspicions now i maintain that you are innocent and i never believed you to be guilty cried hope heartily thank you both said random simply and having closed the door he returned to a chair near the fire to smoke a pipe and meditate over his future movements an enemy hath done this said random referring to the concealment of the manuscript but he could think of no one who desired to harm him in any way chapter xviii recognition lucy and mrs jasher were having a confidential conversation in the small pink drawingroom true to her promise miss kendal had come to readjust matters between the fiery little professor and the widow but it was not an easy task as mrs jasher was righteously indignant at the rash words used to her as if i knew anything about the matter she repeated again and again in angry tones why my dear he as good as told me i had murdered lucy did not let her finish there there she said speaking as she would have done to a fretful child you know what my father is it seems to me that i am just beginning to learn said the widow bitterly and knowing how ready he is to believe ill of me i think it is better we should part for ever but youll never be lady braddock even if i married him i am not sure that i should be since i learn that his brother is singularly healthy and comes of a longlived family and it will not be pleasant to live with your father when he has such a temper that was only because he was excited think of your salon and of the position you wish to hold in london ah well said mrs jasher visibly softening there is something to be said there after all one can never find a man who is perfection and a very amiable man is usually a fool one cant expect a rose to be without thorns but really my dear she surveyed lucy with mild surprise you appear to be very anxious that i should marry your father i want to see my father made comfortable before i marry archie said the girl with a blush of course my father is quite a child in household affairs and needs everything done for him archiei am glad to sayis now in a position to marry me in the spring i want you to be married about the same time and then you can live in gartley and no my dear said mrs jasher firmly if i marry your father he wishes us to go at once to egypt in search of this tomb i know that he wants you to help with the money left to you by your late brother but surely you will not go up the nile yourself no certainly not said the widow promptly i shall remain in cairo while the professor goes on his excursion into ethiopia i know that cairo is a very charming place and that i shall be able to enjoy myself there then you have decided to forgive my father for his rash words i must sighed mrs jasher i am so tired of being an unprotected widow without a recognized position in the world even with my brothers moneynot that it is so very muchi shall still be looked upon askance if i go into society but as mrs braddock or lady braddock no one will dare to say a word against me yes my dear if your father comes and asks my pardon he shall have it we women are so weak ended the widow virtuously as if she was not making a virtue of necessity things being thus settled the two talked on amiably for some time and discussed the chances of random marrying donna inez both acknowledged that the peruvian lady was handsome enough but had not a word to say for herself while thus chattering professor braddock trotted into the room looking brisk and bright from his stroll in the cold frosty air gifted as he was with scientific assurance the little man was not at all taken aback by the cold reception of mrs jasher but rubbed his hands cheerfully ah there you are selina said he looking like a brighteyed robin i hope you are feeling well how can you expect me to feel well after what you said remarked mrs jasher reproachfully and anxious to make a virtue of forgiveness oh i beg pardon i beg pardon surely selina you are not going to make a fuss over a trifle like that i did not give you permission to call me selina quite so but as we are to be married i may as well get used to your christian name my dear i am not so sure that we will be married said mrs jasher stiffly oh but we must cried braddock in dismay i am depending upon your money to finance my expedition to queen tahosers tomb i see observed the widow coldly while lucy sat quietly by and allowed the elder woman to conduct the campaign you want me for my money there is no love in the question my dear as soon as i have the timesay during our voyage to cairo whence we start inland up the nile for ethiopiai shall make love whenever you like and confound it selina i admire you no endto use a slang phrase you are a fine woman and a sensible woman and i am afraid that you are throwing yourself away on a snuffy old man like myself oh no no pray do not say that cried mrs jasher visibly moved by this flattery you will make a very good husband if you will only strive to govern your temper temper temper bless the womani mean you selinai have the very best temper in the world however you shall govern it and myself also if you like come he took her hand let us be friends and fix the wedding day mrs jasher did not withdraw her hand then you do not believe that i have anything to do with this terrible murder she asked playfully no no i was heated last night i spoke rashly and hastily forgive and forget selina you are innocentquite innocent in spite of the mummy being in your confounded garden after all the evidence is stronger against random than against you perhaps he put it there its on his way to the fort you see never mind he has exonerated himself and no doubt when confronted with hervey will be able to silence that blackguard and i am quite sure that hervey is a blackguard ended braddock rubbing his bald head the two ladies looked at one another in amazement not knowing what to say they were ignorant of the theft of the emeralds and of the accusation of sir frank by the yankee skipper but with his usual absentmindedness braddock had forgotten all about that and sat in his chair rubbing his head quite pink and rattling on cheerfully i went down with hope to the embankment he continued but neither of us could see any sign of a boat theres the rude short jetty of course and if a boat came a boat could go away without leaving any trace perhaps that is so however we must wait until we see don pedro and hervey again and then lucy broke in desperately what are you talking about father why do you bring in sir franks name in that way what do you expect me to say retorted the little man after all the manuscript was found in his room and the emeralds are gone i saw that for myself as did hope and don pedro in whose presence i opened the mummy case mrs jasher rose in her astonishment are the emeralds gone she gasped yes yes yes cried braddock irritably am i not telling you so i almost believe in herveys accusation of random and yet the boy exonerated himself very forciblyvery forcibly indeed will you explain all that has happened father said lucy who was becoming more and more perplexed by this rambling chatter we are quite in the dark so am i so is hope so is every one chuckled braddock ah yes of course you were not present when these events took place what eventswhat events demanded mrs jasher now quite exasperated i am about to tell you snapped her future husband and related all that had taken place since the arrival of captain hervey in the museum at the pyramids the women listened with interest and with growing astonishment only interrupting the narrator with a simultaneous exclamation of indignation when they heard that sir frank was accused it is utterly and wholly absurd cried lucy angrily sir frank is the soul of honor so i think my dear chimed in mrs jasher and what does he say to braddock interrupted i am about to tell you if you will stop talking he cried crossly that is so like a woman she asks for an explanation and then prevents the man from giving it random offers a very good defense i am bound to say and he detailed what sir frank had said when the history was finished lucy rose to go i shall see archie at once she said moving hastily towards the door what for demanded her father benignly lucy turned this thing cant go on she declared resolutely mrs jasher was accused by you father only in a heated moment cried the professor excusing himself never mind she was accused retorted lucy stubbornly and now this sailor accuses sir frank who knows who will be charged next with committing the crime i shall ask archie to take the matter up and hunt down the real criminal until the guilty person is found i foresee that we shall never have a moments peace i quite agree with you said mrs jasher earnestly for my own sake i wish the matter of this mystery to be cleared up why dont you help me she added turning to braddock who listened placidly i am helping said braddock quietly i intend to set cockatoo on the trail at once he shall take up his abode in the sailors rest on some pretext and no doubt will be able to find a clue what cried the widow incredulously a savage like that cockatoo is much cleverer than the average white man said braddock dryly especially in following a trail he if any one will learn the truth i would much rather trust the kanaka than young hope nonsense cried lucy standing up for her lover archie is the one to discover the assassin ill see him at once and you father i my dear said the professor calmly shall remain here and make my peace with the future mrs braddock you have made it already said the widow graciously and extended her hand which the professor kissed unexpectedly and then sat back in his chair looking quite abashed at his outburst of gallantry seeing that everything was going well lucy left the elderly couple to continue their courting and hurried to archies lodgings in the village however he happened to be out and his landlady did not know when he would return rather annoyed by this since she greatly desired to unbosom herself miss kendal walked disconsolately towards the pyramids on the way she was stopped by widow anne looking more dismal and funereal than ever and garrulous with copious draughts of gin not that she was intoxicated but her tongue was loose and she wept freely for no apparent reason according to herself she had stopped lucy to demand back from mr hope through the girl certain articles of attire which had been borrowed for artistic purposes these consisting of a shawl and a skirt and a bodice were of extraordinary value and mrs bolton wanted them back or their equivalent in value she mentioned that she would prefer the sum of five pounds why do you not ask mr hope yourself said lucy who was too impatient to bear with the old creatures maunderings if you gave him the things he will no doubt return them if they arent spiled with paint wailed widow anne he told my sid as he wanted them for a model to wear while being painted sid asked me and i gave em to sid and sid he passed em along to your good gentleman there was a skirt as good as new and a body of the dress trimmest beautiful and a tartan shawl as i got from my mother but no the old woman corrected herself it was a dark shawl with red spots and ask mr hope ask mr hope cried miss kendal impatiently i know nothing about the things and she tore her dress from widow annes detaining hand to hurry home mrs bolton wailed aloud at this desertion and took her way to hopes lodgings where she declared her determination to remain until the artist restored her apparel lucy for the moment thought little of this interview but on reflection she thought it strange that archie should borrow clothes from mrs bolton through sidney not that there was anything strange in archies procuring such garments since he may have wanted them to clothe a model with but he could easily have got such things from his landlady or if from widow anne could have borrowed them direct without appealing to sidney why then had the dead man acted as an intermediate party this question was hard to answer yet lucy greatly wished for a reply since she suddenly remembered how a woman in a dark dress and with a dark shawl over her head had been seen by eliza flight the housemaid of the sailors rest talking to bolton through the window were the garments borrowed as a disguise and did the person who had borrowed them desire that it should be supposed that widow anne was talking to her son there was a chill hand clutching lucys heart as she went home for the words of mrs bolton seemed indirectly to implicate hope in the mystery she determined to ask him about the matter straight out when he came in that night to pay his usual visit at dinner the professor was in excellent spirits and actually became so human as to compliment lucy on her housekeeping he also mentioned that he hoped mrs jasher would cater as excellently over coffee he informed his stepdaughter that he had entirely won the widows heart by abasing himself at her feet and withdrawing the accusation they had arranged to be married in may one or two weeks after lucy became mrs hope in the autumn they would start for egypt and would remain abroad for a year or more in fact said the professor setting down his cup and preparing to take his departure everything is now settled excellently i marry mrs jasher you my dear marry hope and and sir frank marries donna inez finished lucy quickly that said braddock stiffly entirely depends upon what de gayangos says to this accusation of herveys sir frank is innocent i hope so and i believe so but he will have to prove his innocence i shall do my best and i have sent round to don pedro to come here we can then talk it over can archie and i come in also asked miss kendal anxiously somewhat to her surprise the professor yielded a ready assent by all means my dear the more witnesses we have the better it will be we must do all in our powers to bring this matter to a successful issue so things were arranged and when archie came up to the drawingroom lucy informed him that braddock was in the museum with don pedro telling all that had happened hope was glad to hear that lucy had secured the professors consent that they should be present for the mystery of boltons terrible death was piquing him and he dearly desired to learn the truth as a matter of fact although he was unaware of it he was suffering from an attack of detective fever and wished to solve the mystery he therefore went gladly into the museum with his sweetheart oddly enoughas lucy recollected when it was too late to speakshe quite forgot to relate what widow anne had said about the borrowed clothes don pedro looking more stiff and dignified than ever was in the museum with braddock the two men were seated in comfortable chairs and cockatoo some distance away was polishing with a cloth the green mummy case of the fatal object which had brought about all the trouble lucy had half expected to see donna inez but de gayangos explained that he had left her writing letters to lima in the warrior inn when miss kendal and hope were seated the peruvian expressed himself much surprised at the charge which had been brought against sir frank if i can speak of such things in the presence of a lady he remarked bowing his head to lucy oh yes she answered eagerly i have heard all about the charge and i am glad that you are here don pedro for i wish to say that i do not believe there is a word of truth in the accusation nor do i asserted the peruvian decisively i agreei agree cried braddock beaming and you hope i never believed it even before i heard randoms defense said archie with a dry smile did you not see captain hervey yourself sir he added turning to don pedro he started for pierside to look you up i have not seen him said de gayangos in his stately way and i am very sorry as i desire to examine him about the accusation he had dared to bring against my very good friend sir frank random i wish he were here at this very minute so that i could tell him what i think of the charge just as don pedro spoke the unexpected happened as though some genie had obeyed his commands as though transported into the room by magic the american skipper appeared not through the floor but by the door a female domestic admitted him and announced his name then fled to avoid the anger of her master seeing she had violated the sacred precincts of the museum captain hervey amused by the surprise visible on every face sauntered forward hat on head and cheroot in mouth as usual but when he saw lucy he removed both with a politeness scarcely to be expected from so rude and ready and rough a mariner i beg pardon for coming here uninvited said hervey awkwardly but ive been chasing the don all over pierside and through this village they told me at the police office that youhe spoke to de gayangos had doubled on your trail so here i am for a little private conversation the peruvian looked gravely at herveys face which was clearly revealed in the powerful light of the many lamps with which the museum was filled and rose to bow i am glad to see you sir he said politely and with a still more searching glance with the permission of our host i shall ask you to take a chair and he turned to braddock certainly certainly said the professor fussily cockatoo pardon allow me said de gayangos and brought forward a chair still keeping his eyes on the skipper who was rather confused by the courtesy will you be seated senor then we can talk hervey sat down quietly close to the peruvian who then leaned forward to address him you will have a cigarette he asked offering a silver case thanks no ill smoke a cheroot if the lady dont mind not at all replied lucy who along with archie and the professor was puzzled by don pedros manner please smoke in taking back the case don pedro allowed it to drop as he made no motion of picking it up hervey although annoyed with himself for his politeness towards a yellowstomach as he called de gayangos was compelled to stretch for it as he handed it back to don pedro the peruvians eyes lighted up and he nodded gravely thank you vasa said de gayangos and hervey changing color leaped from his seat as though touched by a spearpoint chapter xix nearer the truth for a few moments there was silence lucy and archie sat still as they were too much surprised by don pedros recognition of captain hervey as the swedish sailor vasa to move or speak but the professor did not seem to be greatly astonished and the sole sound which broke the stillness was his sardonic chuckle perhaps the little man had progressed beyond the point of being surprised at anything or like molieres hero was only surprised at finding virtue in unexpected places as for the peruvian and the skipper they were both on their feet eyeing one another like two fighting dogs hervey was the first to find his very useful tongue i guess youve got the bulge on me said he trying to outstare the peruvian for which nationality from long voyaging on the south american coast he entertained the most profound contempt but in de gayangos he found a foeman worthy of his steel i think not said don pedro quietly and facing the pseudoamerican bravely i never forget faces and yours is a noticeable one when you first spoke i fancied that i remembered your voice all that business with the chair was to get close to you so that i could see the scar on your right temple it is still there i notice also i dropped my cigarette case and forced you to pick it up so that when you stretched your arm i might see what mark was on your left wrist it is a serpent encircling the sun which lola farjados induced you to have tattooed when you were in lima thirty years ago your eyes are blue and full of light and as you were twenty when i knew you the lapse of years has made you fiftyyour present age shucks said hervey coolly and sat down to smoke don pedro turned to archie and braddock mr hope professor he remarked if you remember the description i gave of gustav vasa i appeal to you to see if it does not exactly fit this man it does said archie unhesitatingly although i cannot see the tattooed left wrist to which you refer hervey still smoking made no offer to show the symbol but braddock unexpectedly came to the assistance of don pedro the man is vasa right enough he remarked abruptly whether he is swedish or american i cannot say but he is the same man i met when i was in lima thirty years ago after the war hervey slowly turned his blue eyes on the scientist with a twinkle in their depths so you recognized me he observed with his yankee drawl i recognized you at the moment i hired you to take the diver to malta to bring back that mummy retorted braddock but it didnt suit my book to let on didnt you recognize me wal no said hervey his drawl more pronounced than ever i havent got the memory for faces that you and the don here seem to possess huh he wheeled his chair and faced braddock squarely id have thought you wiser not to back up the don sir braddocks little eyes sparkled i am not afraid of you said he with great contempt i never did anything for which you could get money out of me for captain hervey or gustav vasa or whatever your name might be you were always a mighty spry man assented the skipper coolly but spry men i take it make mistakes from being too almighty smart braddock shrugged his shoulders and don pedro intervened this is all beside the point he remarked angrily captain hervey do you deny that you are gustav vasa in the face of this evidence hervey drew up the left sleeve of his reefer jacket and showed on his bared wrist the symbol of the sun and the encircling serpent is that enough he drawled or do you want to look at this and he turned his head to reveal his scarred right temple then you admit that you are vasa wal drawled the captain again thats one of my names i guess though i havent used it since i traded that blamed mummy in paris thirty years ago theres nothing like owning up are you not swedish asked lucy timidly i am a citizen of the world i guess replied hervey with great politeness for him and america suits me for headquarters as well as any other nation i might be swedish or danish or a dago for choice vasa may be my name or hervey or anything you like but i guess im a man all through and a thief cried don pedro who had resumed his seat but was keeping quiet with difficulty not of those emeralds rejoined the skipper coolly lord to think of the chance i missed thirty years ago i could have looted them and again the other day but i never knewi never knew cried hervey regretfully with his vividly blue eyes on the mummy i could jes kick myself gentlemen when i think of the miss then you didnt steal the manuscript along with the emeralds wal i did cried hervey turning to archie who had spoken but it was in a furren lingo to which i didnt catch on if id known id have learned about those blamed emeralds what did you do with the copy of the manuscript you stole asked don pedro sharply i know there was a copy as my father told me so i have the original myself but the transcriptand not a translation as i fanciedappeared in sir frank randoms room today hidden behind some books hervey made no move but smoked steadily with his eyes on the carpet however archie who was observing keenly saw that he was more startled than he would admit the explanation had taken him by surprise explain cried the peruvian sharply hervey looked up and fixed a pair of very evil eyes on the don see here he remarked if the lady wasnt present id show you that i take no orders from any yellowthat is from any lowdown don lucy my dear leave us said braddock rising much excited we must have this matter sifted to the bottom and if hervey can explain better in your absence i think you should go although miss kendal was very anxious to hear all that was to be heard she saw the advisability of taking this advice especially as hope gave her arm a meaning nudge ill go she said meekly and was escorted by her lover to the door there she paused tell me all that takes place she whispered and when archie nodded she vanished promptly the young man closed the door and returned to his seat in time to hear don pedro reiterate his request for an explanation and spose i cant oblige said the skipper now more at his ease since the lady was out of the room then i shall have you arrested was the quick reply for what for the theft of my mummy hervey laughed raucously i guess the law cant worry me about that after thirty years and in a lowdown country like peru your government has shifted fifty times since i looted the corpse this was quite true and there was absolutely no chance of the skipper being brought to book don pedro looked rather disconsolate and his gaze dropped under the glare of herveys eyes which seemed unfair seeing that the don was as good as the captain was evil you cant expect me to condone the theft he muttered i reckon i dont expect anything retorted hervey coolly i looted the corpse i dont deny and after my father had treated you like a son said don pedro bitterly you were homeless and friendless and my father took you in only to find that you robbed him of his most precious possession the skipper had the grace to blush and shifted uneasily in his chair you cant say truer than that he grumbled averting his eyes i guess im a bad lot all through but a friend of mine wanted the corpse and offered me a heap of dollars to see the business through do you mean to say that some one asked you to steal it no put in braddock unexpectedly for i was the friend you don pedro swung round in great astonishment but the professor faced him with all the consciousness of innocence yes he remarked quietly as i told you i was in peru thirty years ago i was then hunting for specimens of inca mummies vasathis man now called herveytold me that he could obtain a splendid specimen of a mummy and i arranged to give him one hundred pounds to procure what i wanted but i swear to you de gayangos continued the little man earnestly that i did not know he proposed to steal the mummy from you you knew it was the green mummy asked don pedro sharply no i only knew that it was a mummy did vasa get it for you i guess not said the gentleman who confessed to that name the professor went to cuzco and got into trouble i was carried off to the mountains by some indians interpolated the professor and only escaped after a years captivity i did not mind that as it gave me the opportunity of studying a decaying civilization but when i returned a free man to lima i found that vasa had left the country with the mummy thats so assented hervey waving his hand i got a berth as second mate on a windjammer sailing to europe and as the country wasnt healthy for me since id looted the green mummy i took it abroad and yanked it to paris where i sold it for a couple of hundred pounds with that i changed my name and had a high old time i never heard of the blamed thing again until the professor here turned up with mr bolton at pierside asking me to bring it in the diver from malta it was what youd call a coincidence i reckon added hervey lazily but i did cry small when i heard the professor here had paid nine hundred for a thing id let slip for two hundred had i known of those infernal emeralds id have ripped open the case on board and would have recouped myself but i knew nothing and bolton never told me how could he asked braddock quietly when he did not know that any jewels were buried with the dead i did not know either and i have explained why i wanted the mummy but it never struck me until i hear what you say now that this mummy he nodded towards the green case was the one which you had stolen at lima from de gayangos but you must do me the justice captain hervey to tell don pedro that i never countenanced the theft no you were square enough i guess the sin is on my own blessed shoulders and i dont ask it to be shifted what did you do with the copy of the manuscript asked don pedro hervey ruminated i cant think he mused i found a screed of latin along with the mummy when i looted it from your lima house but it dropped out of my mind as to what became of it maybe i passed it along to the paris man and he sold it along with the corpse to the maltese gent but i tell you this copy was found in sir franks room insisted de gayangos how did it come to be there captain hervey rose and took a turn up and down the room when cockatoo came in his way he calmly kicked him aside what do you think mr hope he asked coming to a full stop before archie while cockatoo crept away with a very dark scowl i dont know what to think replied that young gentleman promptly save that sir frank is my very good friend and that i take his word that he knows nothing of how the manuscript came to be hidden in his bookcase huh said hervey scornfully and took another turn up and down the room in silence i surmise that your friend isnt a white man hope leaped to his feet thats a lie he said distinctly id have shot you for that down chili way snapped the skipper possibly retorted the artist dryly but i happen to be handy with my revolver also i say again that you lie random is not the man to commit so foul a crime then how did the manuscript get into his room questioned hervey he is trying to learn and when he does will come here to let us all know captain hervey but i ask you on what grounds you accuse him oh i know all you said today added hope scornfully waving his hand but you cant prove that random got the manuscript if its in his room as you acknowledge i can said hervey speaking in a much more cultivated tone see here as i said before that copy must have been passed along with the corpse to the maltese man well then the professor here bought the corpse and with it the manuscript no contradicted the little man prodigiously excited bolton wrote to me full particulars of the mummy but said nothing about any manuscript well he wouldnt replied hervey calmly seeing that hed know latin he did know latin admitted braddock uneasily i taught him myself but do you mean to say that he got that manuscript and read it and intended to keep the fact of the emeralds secret hervey nodded three times and twisted his cheroot in his mouth how else can you figure the business out he demanded quietly and with his eyes fixed on the excited professor bolton must have got that manuscript as i cant remember what i did with it save pass it along with the corpse heas you admitdoesnt tell you about it when he writes well then i reckon he calculated getting this corpse to england and intended to steal the emeralds when safely ashore but he could have done that on the boat said archie quickly i guess not with me about said hervey coolly id have spotted his game and would have howled for shares you dare to say that demanded de gayangos fiercely keep your hair on i dare to say anything that comes up my darned back you bet im not going to knuckle down to a yellowstomach out flew don pedros long arm and hervey slammed against the wall he slipped his hand around to his hip pocket with an ugly smile but before he could use the revolver he produced hope dashed up his arm and the ball went through the ceiling lucy cried the young man knowing that the drawingroom was overhead and in a moment was out of the door racing up the stairs at top speed some sense of shame seemed to overpower hervey as he thought that he might have shot the girl and he replaced the revolver in his pocket with a shrug i climb down and apologize he said to don pedro who bowed gravely hang you sir you might have shot my daughter cried braddock the drawingroom where she is sitting is right overhead and as he spoke the door opened and lucy came in on archies arm she was pale with fright but had sustained no damage it seemed that the revolver bullet had passed through the floor some distance away from where she was sitting i offer my humble apologies miss said the cowed hervey ill break your neck you ruffian growled hope who looked and was dangerous how dare you shoot here and its all right interposed lucy not wishing for further trouble i am all safe but i shall remain here for the rest of your interview captain hervey as i am sure you will not shoot again in the presence of a lady no miss muttered the captain and when again invited by the angry professor to speak resumed his discourse in low tones wal as i was saying he remarked sitting down with a dogged look bolton intended to clear with the emeralds but i guess sir frank got ahead of him and packed him in that blamed case while he annexed the emeralds he then took the manuscript which he looted from boltons corpse and hid it among his books as you say while he left the blamed mummy in the garden of the old lady you talked about i guess thats what i say its all theory said don pedro in vexed tones and there isnt a word of truth in it said lucy indignantly standing up for frank random it aint for me to contradict you miss said hervey who was still humble but i ask you if what i say aint true how did that copy of the manuscript come to be in that aristocrats room there was no reply made to this and although every one present save hervey believed in randoms innocence no one could explain the reply came after some further conversation by the appearance of the soldier himself in mess kit he walked unexpectedly into the room with donna inez on his arm and at once apologized to de gayangos i called to see you at the inn sir he said and as you were not there i brought your daughter along with me to explain about the manuscript ah yes we talk of that now how did it come into your room sir random pointed to hervey that rascal placed it there he said firmly chapter xx the letter at this second insult archie quite expected to see the skipper again draw his revolver and shoot he therefore jumped up rapidly to once more avert disaster but perhaps the fiery american was awed by the presence of a second ladysince men of the adventurous type are often shy when the fair sex is at handfor he meekly sat where he was and did not even contradict don pedro shook hands with sir frank and then hervey smiled blandly i see you dont believe in my theory said he scoffingly what theory is that asked random hastily hervey declares that you murdered bolton stole the manuscript from him and concealed it in your room said archie succinctly i cant suggest any other reason for its presence in the room observed the american with a grim smile if im wrong perhaps this almighty aristocrat will correct me random was about to do so and with some pardonable heat when he was anticipated by donna inez it has been mentioned before that this young lady was of the silent order usually she simply ornamented any company in which she found herself without troubling to entertain with her tongue but the accusation against the baronet whom she apparently loved changed her into a voluble virago brushing aside the little professor who stood in her way she launched herself forward and spoke at length hervey cowering in the chair thus met with an antagonist against whom he had no armor he could not use force she dominated him with her eye and when he ventured to open his mouth his few feeble words were speedily drowned by the torrent of speech which flowed from the lips of the peruvian lady every one was as astonished by this outburst as though a dog had spoken that the hitherto silent donna inez de gayangos should speak thus freely and with such power was quite as great a miracle youare a dog and a liar said donna inez with great distinctness and speaking english excellently what you say against sir frank is madness and foolish talk in genoa my father did not speak of the manuscript nor did i who tell you this how then could sir frank kill this poor man when he had no reason to slay him for the emeralds faltered hervey weakly for the emeralds echoed the lady scornfully sir frank is rich he does not need to steal to have much money he is a gentleman who does not murder as you have done hervey started to his feet dismayed but defiant and saw that he was ringed with unfriendly faces as i have done why i am donna inez interrupted you are a murderer i truly believe that youyes that you she pointed a scornful finger at him killed this poor man who was bringing the mummy to the professor if you were in my own country i should have you lashed like the dog you are pig of a yankee vile scum of the that will do inez said de gayangos imperiously we wish to make this gentleman tell the truth and this is not the way to go about the matter gentleman echoed the angry peruvian he is none truth there is no truth in him the pig of pigs and then her english failing she took refuge in spanish which is a fairly comprehensive language for swearing in a polite way the words fairly poured from her mouth and she looked as fierce as bellona the goddess of war archie listening to her words and watching her beautiful face distorted out of all loveliness secretly congratulated himself upon the fact that he was not her prospective bridegroom he wondered how sir frank who was a mild goodtempered man himself could dare to make such a fiery female lady random perhaps the young man thought himself that she was going a trifle too far for he touched her nervously on the arm at once the anger of donna inez died down and she submitted to be led to a chair whispering as she went it was for your sake my angel that i was angry she said and then relapsed into silence watching all future proceedings with flashing eyes but compressed mouth wal muttered hervey with his invariable drawl now that the lady has eased her mind i should like to know why this aristocrat says i placed that manuscript in his room you shall know and at once said random promptly did you not call to see me a day or so ago i did sir i wished to tell you what i had discovered so that you might pay me to shut my mouth if you felt so inclined i asked where your room was sir and walked right in since your flunky was not at the door quite so you were in my room for a few minutes say five interpolated the american imperturbably and then came down you met my servant who told you that i would not be back for five or six hours thats just as you state sir i was sorry to miss you but my time being valuable i had to get back to pierside failing you i later came to see the professor here and told him what i had discovered you merely discovered a mares nest said random contemptuously but this is not the point i believe that you and you only could have hidden that manuscript among my books intending that it should be discovered so that i might be implicated in this crime did your flunky tell you that much inquired hervey coolly my servant told me nothing save that you had been in my room where you had no right to be then said the american quietly and decisively i cant see sir how you can place the ticket on me you accuse me so why should i not accuse you retorted random because you are guilty and i aint snapped the american you join issue you join issue murmured braddock rubbing his hands random took no notice of the interruption i have heard from mr hope and professor braddock of the grounds upon which you base your accusation and i have explained to them how i came to be on board your ship and both in and out of the sailors rest and the explanation is quite satisfactory said hope smartly i agree donna inez nodded with very bright eyes sir frank has explained to me also he knew nothing of the manuscript and you sir said don pedro quietly to captain hervey apparently did since you stole it along with the mummy from lima i confess the theft but i didnt know what the manuscript contained said the skipper dryly or i reckon you wouldnt have to ask who stole the emeralds no sir i should have looted them i believe you did and murdered bolton cried random hotly shucks retorted hervey rising with a shrug if i had wished to get rid of bolton id have yanked him overboard and then would have written accident in my blamed logbook braddock looked at don pedro and archie at sir frank what the skipper said was plausible enough no man would have been such a fool as to have murdered bolton ashore when he could have done so without suspicion on board the tramp moreover hervey spoke with genuine regret since he had missed the emeralds and assuredly would not have hesitated to steal them even at the cost of boltons life had he known of their whereabouts so far he had made a good defense and seeing the impression produced he strolled to the door there he halted if you gents want to lynch me he said leisurely ill be found at the sailors rest for the next week then im going as skipper of the firefly steamer port o london to algiers you can send the sheriff along whenever you choose but i mean to have my picnic first and tomorrow im going to inspector date with my yarn then i guess that almighty aristocrat wilt find himself in quod wait a moment cried braddock running to the door let me talk to you and arrange what is best to be done if you will he proceeded no further for without vouchsafing him a reply hervey now quite master of the situation passed through the door and the professor hastily followed him those who remained looked at one another scarcely knowing what to say or how to act they will arrest thee my angel cried donna inez clasping randoms arm let them retorted the young man defiantly they can prove nothing with all my heart and soul i believe hervey to be the guilty person hope what do you sayand you miss kendal hervey has certainly made an excellent defense said archie cautiously he wouldnt have been such a fool as to murder bolton ashore when he could have done it so easily when on the narrow seas i agree with you there said random quickly but if he is innocent if he did not bring the manuscript into my room who did i wonder if widow anne herself is guilty said lucy in a musing tone all present turned and looked at the girl who is widow anne asked don pedro with a puzzled air she is the mother of sidney bolton the man who was murdered said hope quickly my dear lucy why do you say that lucy paused before replying and then answered the question by asking another one did you ask sidney to get you some clothes from his mother to clothe a model never in my life said hope promptly and as lucy saw truly well i accidentally met mrs bolton today and she insisted that her son had borrowed from her a dark shawl and a dark dress for you that is not true said hope hotly why should the woman tell such a lie well said lucy slowly it struck me that the woman who spoke with sidney through the sailors rest window might be widow anne herself and that she has invented this story of the clothes being lent to account for their being worn should she be discovered its certainly odd she should speak like this said random thoughtfully but you forget miss kendal that she proved an alibi what of that cried don pedro hurriedly alibis can be manufactured it will be best to see this woman and question her suggested donna inez archie nodded i shall do so tomorrow by the way does she ever come to your room in the fort random oh yes she is my laundress you know and at times brings back the clothes herself my servant is usually in though i see what you mean that she might have received the manuscript from bolton and have left it in my room yes i think that said archie slowly i should not be at all surprised to learn that a portion of herveys theory is correct bolton may have found the manuscript packed up in the mummy amongst the graveclothes in fact if he read itas he would and could seeing that he was an excellent latin scholar thanks to professor braddocks traininghe might have formed a design to steal the emeralds when he was in the sailors rest then someone saved him the trouble and packed him off to gartley instead of the mummy but why should widow anne leave the manuscript in my room argued random cant you see bolton knew that you wanted the mummy for don pedro and was aware how you hadso to speakused threats in the presence of witnesses since you spoke out aloud on the deck only to warn bolton against the indians pleaded random exactly but your words were capable of being twisted as hervey has twisted them well if widow anne really went to see her sonand from the lie about the borrowed clothes it looks like ithe may have given her the manuscript so as to throw the blame on you the murder no no said archie testily bolton did not expect to be murdered but i really believe that he intended to fly with the emeralds and hoped that when the manuscript was found in your room you would be accused the idea was suggested to him i believe by your visit to the diver what do you think miss kendal asked random nervously i fancy that it is possible sir frank turned to the peruvian don pedro he said proudly you have heard what hervey says do you believe that i am guilty for answer de gayangos took his daughters hand and placed it in that of the young soldier that will show you what i think he said gravely thank you sir said random moved and shook his future fatherinlaw heartily by the hand while donna inez throwing all restraint to the winds kissed her lover exultingly on the check in the midst of this scene professor braddock returned looking very pleased i have induced hervey to hold his tongue for a few days until we can look into this matter he said rubbing his hands that is if you think it wise all of you otherwise i am quite willing to go myself tomorrow and tell the police no said archie rapidly let us thresh out the matter ourselves we will save sir franks name from a police court slur at all events i do not think there is any chance of sir frank being arrested said don pedro politely the evidence is insufficient and at the worst he can provide an alibi i am not so sure of that said random anxiously i went to london certainly but i did not go to any place where i am known however he added cheerfully i daresay ill be able to defend myself still the fact remains that we are no nearer to learning who killed bolton than we were i am sending cockatoo to pierside tomorrow to stop at the sailors rest for a time said braddock quickly he will watch hervey and if there is anything suspicious about his movements we shall soon know and i turn amateur detective tomorrow and question widow anne said hope after which remark he had to explain matters to braddock who had been out of the room when mrs boltons strange request had been discussed meanwhile donna inez had been whispering to her lover and pointing to the mummy don pedro followed her thoughts and guessed what she was saying random proved the truth of his guess by turning to him do you really want to take back the mummy to peru sir he asked quietly certainly inca caxas was my forefather i do not wish to leave him in this place his body must be restored to its tomb all the indians who look upon me as their present inca expect me to bring the body back although added de gayangos gravely i did not come to europe to look for the mummy as you know then i shall buy the mummy said random impetuously professor will you sell it to me now that i have examined it thoroughly i shall be delighted said the little man say for two thousand pounds not at all interposed don pedro you mean one thousand of course he does said lucy quickly and the check must be paid to archie sir frank to me to me cried braddock indignantly i insist the money belongs to archie said lucy obstinately you have seen what you desired to see father and as archie only lent you the money it is only fair that he should have it again oh let the professor have it said hope goodnaturedly no no no random laughed i shall make the check payable to you miss kendal and you can give it to whomsoever you choose he said and now as everything has been settled so far i suggest that we should retire come to my rooms at the inn said don pedro opening the door i have much to say to you good night professor tomorrow let us go to pierside and see if we cannot get at the truth and tomorrow cried random i shall send the check sir when the company departed lucy had another wrangle with her father about the check as archie had gone away she could speak freely and pointed out that he was enjoying her mothers income and was about to marry mrs jasher who was rich therefore argued lucy you certainly do not want to keep poor archies money he paid me that sum on condition that i consented to the wedding he did nothing of the sort she cried indignantly i am not going to be bought and sold in this manner archie lent you the money and it must be returned dont force me to think you selfish father the upshot of the argument was that lucy got her own way and the professor rather unwillingly agreed to part with the mummy and restore the thousand pounds but he regretted doing so as he wished to get all the money he could to go towards his proposed egyptian expedition and mrs jashers fortune as he assured his stepdaughter was not so large as might be thought however lucy overruled him and retired to bed congratulating herself that she would soon be able to marry hope she was beginning to grow a trifle weary of the professors selfish nature and wondered how her mother had put up with it for so long next day braddock did not go with don pedro to pierside as he was very busy in his museum the peruvian went alone and archie after a mornings work at his easel sought out widow anne to ask questions lucy and donna inez paid an afternoon visit to mrs jasher and found her in bed as she had caught a mild sort of influenza they expected to find sir frank here but it seemed that he had not called thinking that he was detained by military business the girls thought nothing more of his absence although donna inez was somewhat downcast but random was detained in his quarters by a letter which had arrived by the midday host and which surprised him not a little the postmark was london and the writing evidently a disguised hand was almost illegible in its crudeness the contents ran as follows and it will be noticed that there is neither date nor address and that it is written in the third person if sir frank random wants his character to be cleared and all suspicion of murder to be removed from him he can be completely exonerated by the writer if he will pay the same five thousand pounds if sir frank random is willing to do this let him appoint a meetingplace in london and the writer will send a messenger to receive the money and to hand over the proofs which will clear sir frank random if sir frank random plays the writer false or communicates with the police proofs will be forthcoming which will prove him to be guilty of sidney boltons death and which will bring him to the scaffold without any chance of escape a couple of lines in the agony column of the daily telegraph signed artillery and appointing a meetingplace will suffice but beware of treachery chapter xxi a story of the past mrs jashers influenza proved to be very mild indeed when donna inez de gayangos and lucy paid a visit to her on the afternoon of the day succeeding the explanations in the museum she was certainly in bed and explained that she had been there since the professors visit on the previous day lucy was surprised at this as she had left mrs jasher perfectly well and braddock had not mentioned any ailment of the widow but influenza as mrs jasher observed was very rapid in its action and she was always susceptible to disease from the fact that in jamaica she had suffered from malaria still she was feeling better and intended to rise from her bed on that evening if only to lie on the couch in the pink drawingroom having thus detailed her reasons for being ill the widow asked for news as no prohibition had been placed upon lucy with regard to herveys visit and as mrs jasher would be one of the family when she married the professor miss kendal had no hesitation in reporting all that had taken place the narrative excited mrs jasher and she frequently interrupted with expressions of wonder even donna inez grew eloquent and told the widow how she had defended sir frank against the american skipper what a dreadfully wicked man said mrs jasher when in possession of all the facts i really believe that he did kill poor sidney no said lucy decisively i dont think that he would have murdered him on board had he intended the crime as he could have done so with more safety he is as innocent as sir frank and no one dare say a word against him cried donna inez with flashing eyes he has a good defender my dear said the widow patting the girls hand i love him said donna inez as if that explained everything and perhaps it did so far as she was concerned mrs jasher smiled indulgently then turned for further information to lucy can it be possible she said that widow anne is guilty oh i dont think so she would not murder her own son especially when she was so very fond of him archie told me just before we came here that he had called to see her she still insists that sidney borrowed the clothes saying that archie wanted them what do you make of that my dear well said miss kendal pondering either widow anne herself was the woman who talked to sidney through the sailors rest window and has invented this story to save herself or sidney did get the clothes and intended to use them as a disguise when he fled with the emeralds in that case said mrs jasher the woman who talked through the window still remains a problem again if sidney bolton intended to steal the emeralds he could have done so in malta or on board the boat no said lucy decisively the mummy was taken directly from the sellers house to the boat and perhaps sidney did not find the manuscript until he looked at the mummy then captain hervey kept an eye on sidney so that he could not open the mummy to steal the emeralds still according to your own showing sidney looked at the actual mummyhe opened the mummy case that is else he could not have got the manuscript lucy nodded i think so but of course we cannot be sure but the packing case in which the mummy was stowed was placed in the hold of the steamer and if sidney had wished to steal the emeralds he could not have done so without exciting captain herveys suspicions then let us say that sidney robbed the mummy when in the sailors rest and took the clothes he borrowed from his mother in order to fly in disguise but what of the woman lucy shook her head i cannot tell we may learn more later don pedro has gone to pierside to search and my father says that he will send cockatoo there also to search well sighed mrs jasher wearily i hope that all this trouble will come to an end that green mummy has proved most unlucky leave me now dear girls as i feel somewhat tired goodbye said lucy kissing her i hope that you will be better this evening dont get up unless you feel quite able oh i shall take my ease in the drawingroom i thought you always called it the parlor laughed the girl ah mrs jasher smiled you see i am practicing against the time when i shall be mistress of the pyramids you cant call that large room there a parlor and she laughed weakly altogether mrs jasher impressed both lucy and donna inez with the fact that she was very weak and scarcely able as she put it to draw one leg after the other both the girls would have been surprised to see what a hearty meal mrs jasher made that evening when she was up and dressed perhaps she felt that her strength needed keeping up but she certainly partook largely of the delicate dinner provided by jane who was a most excellent cook after dinner mrs jasher lay on a pink couch in the pink parlor by a splendid fire for the night was cold and raw with a promise of rain the widow had a small table at her elbow on which stood a cup of coffee and a glass of liquor the rosecolored curtains were drawn the roseshaded lamps were lighted and the whole interior of the cottage looked very comfortable indeed mrs jasher in a crocusyellow teagown trimmed with rich black lace reclined on her couch like cleopatra in her barge in the pink light she looked very well preserved although her face wore an anxious expression this was due to the fact that the mail had come in and the three letters brought by the postman had to do with creditors mrs jasher was always trying to make both ends meet and had a hard struggle to keep her head above water certainly since she had inherited the money of her brother the pekin merchant she need not have looked so worried but she did and made no disguise of it seeing that she was quite alone after a time she went to her desk and took out a bundle of bills and some other letters also an account book and a bank book over these she pored for quite an hour the clock struck nine before she looked up from this unpleasant task and she found her financial position anything but satisfactory with a weary sigh she rose and stared at herself in the mirror over the fireplace frowning as she did so unless i can marry the professor at once i dont know what will happen to me she mused gloomily i have managed very well so far but things are coming to a crisis these devils she alluded to her creditors will not keep off much longer and then the crash will come i shall have to leave gartley as poor as when i came and there will be nothing left but the old nightmare life of despair and horror i am getting older every day and this is my last chance of getting married i must force the professor to have a speedy marriage i must i must and she began to pace the tiny room in a frenzy of terror and wellfounded alarm as she was trying to calm herself and succeeding very badly jane entered the room with a card it proved to be that of sir frank random it is rather a late hour for a visit said mrs jasher to the servant however i feel so bored that perhaps he will cheer me up ask him to come in when jane left she stood still for a moment or so trying to think why the young man had called at so untoward an hour but when his footsteps were heard approaching the door she swept the books and the bills and the letters into the desk and locked it quickly when random appeared at the door she was just leaving the desk to greet him and no one would have taken the smiling plump wellpreserved woman for the creature who lately had looked so haggard and careworn i am glad to see you sir frank said mrs jasher nodding in a familiar manner sit down in this very comfortable chair and jane shall bring you some coffee and kummel no thank you said random in his usual stiff way but very politely i have just left the mess where i had a good dinner mrs jasher nodded and sank again on the couch which was opposite the chair which she had selected for her visitor i see you are in mess kit she said gayly quite a glorified creature to appear in my poor little parlor why are you not with donna inez i have heard all about your engagement from lucy she was here today with senorita de gayangos so i believe said random still stiffly but you see i was anxious to come and see you ah said mrs jasher equably you heard that i was ill yes i have been in bed ever since yesterday afternoon until a couple of hours ago but i am now better my dinner has done me good pass me that fan please the fire is so hot sir frank did as he was told and she held the feather fan between her face and the fire while he stared at her wondering what to say dont you find this atmosphere very stuffy he remarked at length it would be a good thing to have the windows open mrs jasher shrieked my dear boy are you mad i have a touch of the influenza and an open window would bring about my death why this room is delightfully comfortable there is such a strong perfume about it sniffed random pointedly i should think you knew that scent by this time sir frank i use no other and never have done smell and she passed a flimsy handkerchief of lace random took the handkerchief and placed it to his nostrils as he did so a strange expression of triumph crept into his eyes i think you told me once that it was a chinese perfume he said returning the handkerchief mrs jasher nodded well pleased i get it from a friend of my late husband who is in the british embassy at pekin no one uses it but me but surely some other person uses it not in england and i do not know why you should say so it is a specialty of mine why she added playfully if you met me in the dark you should know me by this scent can you swear that no one else has ever used this perfume asked random mrs jasher lifted her penciled eyebrows i do not know why you should ask me to swear she said quietly but i assure you that i keep this perfume which comes from china to myself not even lucy kendal has it although she greatly desired some we women are selfish in some things my dear man its a most delicious perfume yes said sir frank staring at her and very strong what do you mean by that nothing only i should think that such a perfume would be good for the cold you contracted by going to london last night mrs jasher turned suddenly pale under her rouge and her hand clenched the fan so tightly as to break the handle i have not been to london for quite a month she faltered what a strange remark a true one said the baronet fumbling in the pocket of his jacket you went to london last night by the seven oclock train to post this and he held out the anonymous letter the widow now quite pale and looking years older sat up on the couch with a painful effort which suggested old age i dont understand she said trying to speak calmly i was not in london and i did not post any letter if you came here to insult me there can be no insult in asking a few questions said random throwing aside his stiffness and speaking decisively i received this letter which bears a london postmark by the midday post the handwriting is disguised and there is neither address nor signature nor date you manufactured your communication very cleverly mrs jasher but you forgot that the chinese perfume might betray you the perfume the perfume mrs jasher gasped and saw in a moment how the late conversation had led her to fall into a trap the letter retains traces of the perfume you use went on the baronet relentlessly i have a remarkably keen sense of smell and as scent is a most powerful aid to memory i speedily recollected that you used this especial perfume you told me a few moments ago that no one else used it and so you have proved the truth of my statement that this letterhe tapped itis written by you its a liea mistake stuttered mrs jasher now at bay and looking dangerous her society veneer was stripped off and the adventuress pure and simple came to the surface indignant at the way in which she had deceived everyone and having much at stake random did not spare her it is not a mistake he insisted neither is it a lie when i became aware that you must have written the letter i drove at once to jessum to see if you had gone to london as you had posted it there i learned from the station master and from a porter that you went to town by the seven oclock train and returned by the midnight mrs jasher leaped to her feet they could not recognize me i wore then she stopped confused at having so plainly betrayed herself you wore a veil all the same mrs jasher you are too well known hereabouts for anyone to fail to recognize you besides your remark just now proves that i am right you wrote this blackmailing letter and i demand an explanation i have none to give muttered the woman fiercely and fighting every inch if you refuse to explain to me you shall to the police said sir frank rising and making for the door mrs jasher flung herself forward and clung to him for gods sake dont then you will explain you will tell me tell you what who murdered sidney bolton i do not know i swear i do not know she cried feverishly that is ridiculous said random coldly you say in this letter that you can hang me or save me as you know that i am innocent you must be aware who is guilty its all bluff i know nothing said mrs jasher releasing his arm and throwing herself on the couch i only wished to get money five thousand poundseh rather a large order sneered random replacing the letter in his pocket you would not ask that sum for nothing you must be aware of the truth i suspected many people mrs jasher but never you the woman rose and flung out her arms no she said in a deep voice and fighting like a rat in a corner i tricked you all down here sir frank i will tell you the truth about the murder i know nothing of that about myself random shrugged his shoulders ill hear about yourself first he said i can learn details concerning the murder later go on i know nothing of the murder or of the theft of the emeralds yet you hid the mummy in this house and afterwards placed it in your arbor to be found by the professor for some reason i know nothing about that either muttered mrs jasher doggedly and with very white lips that letter you have traced to me is all bluff then you admit having written it yes she said sullenly you know too much and it is useless for me to deny the truth in the face of the evidence you bring against me i would fight though she added raising her head like a snake its crest if i was not sick and tired of fighting fighting yes against trouble and worry and money difficulties and creditors oh she struck her breast what do you know of life you rich easygoing man i have been in the depths and not through my own fault i had a bad mother a bad husband i was dragged in the mire by those who should have helped me to rise i have starved for days i have wept for years in all gods earth there is no more miserable a creature than i am kindly talk without so much melodrama said random cruelly ah mrs jasher sat down and locked her hands together you dont believe me i daresay you dont understand for life real life is a sealed book to you it is useless for me to appeal to your sympathy for you are so very ignorant let us stick to facts what do you wish to know who killed sidney bolton who has the emeralds i cant tell you listen with my past life you have nothing to do i will commence from the time i came down here i had just lost my husband and i managed to scrape together a few hundred poundsoh quite in a respectable way i assure you she added scoffingly on seeing her listener wince i came here to try and live quietly and if possible to secure a rich husband i knew that the fort was here and thought that i might marry an officer however the professors position attracted me and i decided to marry him i am engaged and but for your cleverness in tracing that letter i should be mrs braddock within a very short time i have exhausted all my money i am deeply in debt i cannot hold out longer but the money you inherited that is all bluff also i never had a brother i inherit no money i know nothing of pekin save that a friend of mine sends that scent to me as a yearly christmas present i am an adventuress but perhaps not so bad as you think me lucy and donna inez have heard no wickedness from my lips i have always been a good woman in one sensea moral woman that isand i did wish to marry the professor and live a happy life seeing that i was at the end of my resources and that professor braddock expected a legacy with me before marriage i looked round to see how i could get the money i heard that you were accused by captain hervey and so last night i wrote that letter and posted it in london thinking that you would yield to save yourself from arrest random laughed cynically you must have thought me weak he muttered i did said mrs jasher frankly to tell you the truth i thought that you were a fool but by tracing that letter and withstanding my demand you have proved yourself to be more clever than i took you to be well that is all i know nothing of the murder my letter is sheer bluff to extort from you five thousand pounds had you paid i should have passed it off to the professor as the money left to me by my brother but now now said random rising to go i shall tell what you have told me to the professor and and hand me over to the police said mrs jasher shrugging her plump shoulders well i expected that yet i fancied for old times sake that you might have been more lenient we were never anything but acquaintances mrs jasher said random coldly so i fail to see why you should expect mercy after the way in which you have behaved you expect to blackmail me and yet go free i must punish you somehow so i shall tell professor braddock as you certainly cannot marry him but i shall not hand you over to the police you wont mrs jasher stared scarcely able to believe her ears no give me a day to think over matters and i shall arrange what to do with you i think there is some good in you mrs jasher and so i shall see if i cant assist you in the meantime i shall have your cottage watched so that you may not run away in that case you may as well hand me over to the police she said bitterly not at all rejoined random coolly i can trust my servant who is stupid but honest and is devoted to me ill see that everything is kept quiet but if you attempt to run away i shall have you arrested for blackmail you understand yes you are treating me very well she gasped when shall i see you tomorrow evening i must talk the matter over with braddock tomorrow i shall arrange what to do and probably i shall give you a chance of leading a new life in some other part of the world what do you say i accept indeed there is nothing else left for me to do that is an ungrateful speech said random severely i daresay however we can talk of gratitude tomorrow meanwhile please leave me sir frank went to the door and there paused remember he said distinctly that your cottage is being watched try to escape and i shall have you arrested mrs jasher groaned and buried her face in the sofa cushion chapter xxii a wedding present mrs jasher had thought random exceedingly clever in acting as he had done to trap her she would have thought him still more clever had she known that he trusted to the power of suggestion to prevent her from trying to escape sir frank had not the slightest intention of setting his soldierservant to watch as such was not the duty for which such servants are hired but having impressed firmly on the adventuresss mind that he would act in this way he departed quite certain that the woman would not attempt to run away although no one was watching the cottage mrs jasher believing what had been told her would think that sharp eyes were on her doors and windows day and night and would firmly believe that if she tried to get away she would be captured forthwith by the pierside police or perhaps by the village constable like an eastern enchanter the baronet had placed a spell on the cottage and it acted admirably mrs jasher although longing to escape and hide herself remained where she was cowed by a spy who did not exist the next day random went to the pyramids as soon as his duties permitted and saw the professor to the prospective bridegroom he explained all that had happened and displayed the anonymous letter with an account of how he had proved mrs jasher to be the writer braddocks hair could not stand on end as he had none but he lost his temper completely and raged up and down the museum in a way which frightened cockatoo out of his barbaric wits when more quiet he sat down to discuss the matter and promptly demanded that mrs jasher should be handed over to the police but he might have guessed that sir frank would refuse to follow this extreme advice she has acted badly i admit said the young man all the same i think she is a better woman than you may think professor think think think shouted the fiery little man getting up once more to trot up and down like an infuriated poodle i think she is a bad woman a wicked woman to deceive me into thinking her rich and but surely professor you wished to marry her also for love nothing of the sort sir nothing of the sort i leave love and suchlike trash to those like yourself and hope who have nothing else to think about but a marriage without love pooh pooh pooh dont argue with me random love is all moonshine i did not love my first wifelucys motherand yet we were very happy had i made mrs jasher my second we should have got on excellently provided the money was forthcoming for my egyptian expedition what am i to do now i ask you random even the thousand pounds you pay for the mummy goes back to that infernal hope because of lucys silly ideas i have nothingabsolutely nothing and that tomb is amongst those ethiopian hills i swear waiting to be opened oh what a chance i have missedwhat a chance but i shall see mrs jasher myself she knows about this murder she declares that she does not dont tell me dont tell me vociferated the professor she would not have written that letter had she known nothing that was bluff i explained all that bluff be hanged cried braddock only he used a more vigorous word i do not believe that she would have dared to act on such a slight foundation i shall see her myself this very afternoon and force her to confess in one way or another i shall find the assassin and make him disgorge those emeralds under the penalty of being hanged then i can sell them and finance my egyptian expedition but you forget professor that the emeralds when found belong to don pedro they dont rasped the little man turning purple with rage i refuse to let him have them i bought the mummy and the contents of the mummy including those emeralds they are mine no said random sharply i buy the mummy from you so they pass into my possession and belong to de gayangos i shall give them to him youll have to find them first said braddock savagely and as to the mummy you shant have it i decline to sell it so there if you dont said random very distinctly don pedro will bring an action against you and captain hervey will be called as a witness to prove that the mummy was stolen don pedro hasnt the money said braddock triumphantly he cant pay lawyers fees but i can rejoined the young man very dryly as i am going to marry donna inez it is only just that i should help my future fatherinlaw in every way he has a romantic feeling about this relic of poor humanity and wishes to take it back to peru he shall do so and what about mewhat about me well said random speaking slowly with the intention of still further irritating the little man whose selfishness annoyed him if i were you i should marry mrs jasher and settle down quietly in this house to live on what income you have braddock turned purple again and spluttered how dare you make a proposition like that to me sir he bellowed you ask me to marry this low woman this adventuress thisthisthis words failed him of course random had no intention of advising such a marriage although he did not think so badly of mrs jasher as did the professor but the little man was so venomous that the young man took a delight in stirring him up using the widows name as a red rag to this particular bull i do not think mrs jasher is a bad woman he remarked what what what after what she has done blackmail blackmail blackmail that is bad i admit but she has failed to get what she wanted and after all you indirectly are the cause of her writing that blackmailing letter i ami am how dare you you see she wanted to get five thousand out of me as her dowry yes and told me lies about her damned brother who was a pekin merchant when after all he never existed oh i dont defend that said random coolly mrs jasher has behaved badly on the whole still professor i think there is good in her as i said before she evidently had bad parents and a bad husband but so far as i can gather she is not an immoral woman the poor wretch only came here to try and drag herself out of the mire if she had married you i feel sure that she would have made you a most excellent wife the professor was in such a rage that he suddenly became calm of course you talk absolute rubbish he said caustically had i my way this woman would be whipped at a carts tail for the shameful way in which she has deceived us all however i shall see her today and make her confess who murdered bolton don pedro will be greatly obliged if you do he wants those emeralds so do i and if i get them i shall keep them snapped braddock and if you havent anything more to say you can leave me im busy as there was nothing more to be done with the choleric little man sir frank took the hint and departed he went forthwith to the warrior inn to see don pedro and also donna inez but it so happened that the girl had gone to the pyramids on a visit to miss kendal and random was sorry that he had missed her however it was just as well as he could now talk freely to de gayangos to him he related the whole story of mrs jasher and discovered that the peruvian also as braddock had done insisted that mrs jasher knew the truth she would not have written that letter if she did not know it said don pedro then you think that she should be arrested no we can deal with this matter ourselves at present she is quite safe as she certainly will not leave her cottage seeing that she thinks it is being watched let us permit braddock to interview her and see what he can learn then we can discuss the matter and come to a decision random nodded absently i wonder if mrs jasher was the woman who talked to bolton through the window he remarked it is not impossible although that does not explain why bolton borrowed a female disguise from this mother mrs jasher might have worn it that would argue some understanding between bolton and mrs jasher and a knowledge of the manuscript before bolton left for malta we know that he could only have seen the manuscript for the first time at malta it was evidently stowed away in the swathings of the mummy by my father who forgot all about it when he gave me the original hervey forgot also i wonder if that is true i am certain it is said don pedro emphatically for if hervey or vasa or whatever you like to call him had found that manuscript and had got it translated he certainly would have opened the mummy and have secured the emeralds no sir frank i believe that his theory is partly true bolton intended to run away with the emeralds and send the empty mummy to professor braddock for if you remember he arranged that the landlord of the sailors rest should forward the case next morning even if he happened to be away bolton intended to be awaywith the emeralds then you do not believe that hervey placed the manuscript in my room he declared most emphatically that he did not said don pedro when at pierside yesterday i went to the sailors rest and saw him he told braddock only the other day that he had lost his chance of a sailing vessel and as yet had not got another one but when he returned to pierside he found a letter waiting himso he told megiving him command of a four thousand ton tramp steamer called the firefly he is to sail at oncetomorrow i believe then what is he going to do about this murder business he can do nothing at present as if he remains in pierside he will lose his new command tomorrow he drops down stream but meantime he intends to write out the whole story of the theft of the mummy i have promised to give him fifty pounds for doing so as i want to get back the mummy free of charge from braddock i think braddock will stick to the mummy in any event said random grimly not when hervey writes out his evidence he will not have it completed by the time he sails as he is very busy but he has promised to send off a boat to the jetty near the fort tomorrow evening when he is dropping down stream i shall be there with fifty pounds in gold supposing he fails to stop or send the boat then he will not get his fifty pounds retorted don pedro the man is a rascal and deserves prison rather than reward but since the mummy was stolen by him thirty years back he alone can prove my ownership but why take all this trouble argued the baronet i can buy the mummy from braddock no said don pedro i have a right to my own property random lingered until late in the afternoon and until darkness fell as he was anxious to see donna inez but she did not appear until late meanwhile archie hope put in an appearance having come to see don pedro with an account of his interview with widow anne before coming to the inn he had called on professor braddock and from him had heard all about the wickedness of mrs jasher his surprise was very great i should not have believed it he declared poor woman ah said random rather pleased you are more merciful than the professor hope he calls her a bad woman humph i dont think that braddock is so good that he can afford to throw a stone said archie rather sourly mrs jasher has not behaved well but i should like to hear her complete story before judging there must be a lot of good in her or lucy who has been with her a great deal would have found her out long ago i go by a womans judgment of a woman but mrs jasher must have been anxious to marry she was as professor braddock knows said random quickly i am not thinking of that so much as of what widow anne told me oh said don pedro looking up from where he was seated so you have seen that old woman what does she say about the clothes she sticks to her story sidney she declares borrowed the clothes to give to me for a model now i never asked bolton to do this so i fancy the disguise must have been intended for himself or for mrs jasher but what had mrs jasher to do with him demanded random sharply well its odd replied hope slowly but mrs bolton declares that her son was in love with mrs jasher and when he returned from malta intended to marry her impossible cried sir frank she engaged herself to braddock but only after boltons death remember don pedro nodded that is true but what you say mr hope proves the truth of herveys theory in what way mrs jasher as we know from what random told us wanted money she would not marry a man who was poor bolton was poor but of course the emeralds would make him wealthy as they are of immense value probably he intended to steal them in order to marry this woman this implicates mrs jasher in the crime yes assented sir frank nodding but as bolton did not know that the emeralds existed before he bought the mummy in malta i do not see why he should borrow a disguise beforehand for mrs jasher to meet him at the sailors rest the thing is easily settled said hope impatiently let us both go to mrs jashers this evening and insist upon the truth being told if she confesses about her secret engagement to sidney bolton she may admit that the clothes were borrowed for her and she may admit also that she placed the manuscript in my room said sir frank after a pause hervey did not place it there but it is just possible that mrs jasher having got it from bolton when she talked to him through the window may have done so nonsense said hope with vigorous commonsense mrs jasher would be spotted in a moment if she had gone to your quarters she had to pass the sentry remember then again we have not yet proved that she was the woman in mrs boltons clothes who spoke through the window that can all be settled if we speak to her this evening very good random glanced at his watch i must get back don pedro will you tell inez that i shall come in this evening we can then talk further about these matters hope i shall stop here as i wish to consult don pedro random nodded and took a reluctant departure he dearly wished as an engaged lover should to remain on the chance that donna inez might return but duty called him and he was forced to obey the night was very dark although it was not particularly late but there was no rain and random walked rapidly through the village and down the road to the fort he caught a glimpse of the lights of mrs jashers cottage twinkling in the distance and smiled grimly as he thought of the invisible spell he had placed thereon no doubt mrs jasher was shivering in her louis quinze shoes at the idea of being watched but then she deserved that much punishment at least as random truly thought when entering the fort the sentry saluted as usual and random was about to pass when the man stepped forward holding out a brown paper package please sir i found this in my sentry box he said saluting sir frank took the packet who placed it there and why do you give it to me he demanded in surprise please sir its directed to you sir and i dont know who put it in my box sir i was on duty sir and i spose someone must have dropped it on the floor of the box sir when i was at the other end of my beat sir it was as dark as this sir and i saw nothing and heard nothing when i come back sir i stepped into the box out of the rain and felt it with my feet i struck a light sir and found it was for you sir frank slipped the package into his pocket and went away after a grim word or so to the sentry advising him to be more on the alert he was puzzled to think who had left the packet in the sentry box and curious to know what it contained as soon as he got to his own room he cut the string which bound loosely the brown paper then in the lamplight there rolled out from the carelesslytied parcel a glorious seagreen emerald of great size radiating light like a sun a scrap of white paper lay in the brown wrapping on it was written a wedding gift for sir frank random chapter xxiii just in time of all the surprises in connection with the tragedy of the green mummy this was surely the greatest sidney bolton had undoubtedly been murdered for the sake of the emeralds and the assassin had escaped with the spoil for which he had sold his soul yet here was one of the jewels returned anonymously to random who could pass on the same to its rightful owner in the midst of his amazement sir frank could not help chuckling when he thought how enraged professor braddock would be at don pedros good fortune at the eleventh hour as it were the peruvian had got back his own or at least a portion of his own placing the emerald in his drawer random gave orders to his servant that the sentry when off duty should be brought before him just as random finished dressing for messand he dressed very early so as to devote his entire attention to solving this new problemthe soldier who had been on guard appeared but he could tell nothing more than he had already related when doing sentrygo immediately outside the gate of the fort the packet had been slipped into the box while the man was at the far end of his beat it was quite dark when this was done and the soldier confessed that he had not heard a sound much less had he seen anyone the person who had brought the glorious gem had watched his opportunity and softfooted as a cat had stolen forward in the darkness to drop the precious parcel on the floor of the sentry box there the man had found it by the feel of his feet when he stepped in some time later to escape a shower but what time had elapsed from the placing of the parcel to its discovery by the sentry it was impossible to say it must however as random calculated have been within the hour since before then it would not have been dark enough to hide the approach of the person whether male or female who carried a kings ransom in the brown paper parcel at first random was inclined to place the sentry under arrest for having failed so much in his duty as to allow anyone to approach so near the fort but as he had already reprimanded the man and moreover wished to keep the fact of the recovered jewel quiet he simply dismissed him when alone he sat down before the fire wondering who could have dared so very greatly and for what reason the emerald had been handed to him if it had been sent to don pedro or even to professor braddock it would have been much more reasonable it first occurred to him that mrs jasher out of gratitude for the way in which he had treated her had sent him the jewel remembering his former experience he smelt the parcel but could detect no sign of the famous chinese scent which had proved a clue to the letter of course the direction on the packet and the inscribed slip of paper were in feigned handwriting so he could gather nothing from that still he did not think that mrs jasher had sent the emerald she was desperately hard up and if she had become possessed of the gem by murderpresuming her to have been the woman who talked to bolton through the windowshe assuredly would have sold it to supply her own needs certainly if guilty she would still possess the other emerald of equal value but undoubtedly had she risked her neck to gain a fortune she would have kept the entire plunder which was likely to cost her so dear no whomsoever it was who had repented at the eleventh hour mrs jasher was not the person perhaps widow anne was the woman who had talked through the window and who had restored the emerald but that was impossible since mrs bolton habitually took more liquor than was good for her and would not have the nerve to deliver the jewel much less commit the crime the more especially as the victim was her own son of course she might have found out sidneys scheme to run away with the jewels and so would have claimed her share but if she had been in pierside on that eveningand her presence in gartley had been sworn to by three or four croniesshe would have guessed who had strangled her boy if so not all the jewels in the world would have prevented her denouncing the criminal with all her faultsand they were manymrs bolton was a good mother and looked upon sidney as the pride and joy of her somewhat dissipated life mrs bolton was certainly as innocent as mrs jasher there remained hervey random laughed aloud when the name came into his puzzled head that buccaneer was the last person to surrender his plunder or to feel compunction in committing a crime once the skipper got his grip on two jewels worth endless money he would never let them gonot even one of them arguing thus it seemed that hervey was out of the running and random could think of no one else in this dilemma he remembered that two heads were better than one and before going into dinner he sent a note to archie hope asking him to come to the fort as speedily as possible sir frank was somewhat dull at dinner on that evening and scarcely responded to the joking remarks of his brother officers these jocularly put his preoccupation down to love for it was an open secret that the baronet admired the fair peruvian although no one as yet knew that random was legally engaged with don pedros consent the young man goodhumoredly stood all the chaff hurled at him but seized the opportunity to slip away to his quarters as soon as coffee came on the table and the smoking began it was nine oclock before he returned to his room and here he found hope waiting for him impatiently i see you have been dining at the pyramids said random seeing that hope was in evening dress archie nodded yes i dont put on this kit to have my humble chop at my lodgings but the professor asked me to dinner to talk over matters what does he say asked random looking for the cigarette box oh he is very angry with mrs jasher and considers that she has swindled him he called to see her this afternoon andso he sayshad a stormy interview with her i dont wonder at that if he speaks as he generally does said the other grimly and pushing along the cigarettes there you are the whisky and soda are on yonder table make yourself comfortable and tell me what the professor intends to do well said archie turning half round from the side table where he was pouring out the whisky he had already started action by sending cockatoo to live at the sailors rest and spy on hervey what rubbish hervey is going away tomorrow in the firefly bound for algiers nothing is to be learned from him so i told the professor said hope returning to the armchair near the fire and i mentioned that don pedro had induced the skipper to write out a full account of the theft of the mummy from lima thirty years ago i also said that the signed paper would be handed in at the gartley jetty when the firefly came down stream tomorrow night humph and what did braddock say to that nothing much he merely stated that whatever hervey said toward proving the ownership of your future fatherinlaw that he intended to stick to the embalmed corpse of inca caxas and also that he intended to claim the emeralds when they turned up random rose and went to the drawer of his desk i am afraid he has lost one emerald at all events he said unlocking the drawer whats that said hope sharply why did youoh gosh he jumped up with an amazed look as random held up the magnificent gem from which streamed vividly green flames in the mellow lamplight oh gosh gasped the artist again where the devil did you get that i sent for you to tell you said sir frank giving the jewel into his friends hand and coming back to his seat it was found in the sentry box hope stared at the great jewel and then at the soldier what do you mean by that he demanded how the dickens could it be found in a sentry box you must be making a mistake not a bit of it it was found on the floor of the box by the sentry as i tell you and i have sent to consult with you as to how the deuce it got there hervey muttered archie fascinated by the gem random shrugged his square shoulders catch that yankee shylock returning anything he got his grip on even as a wedding present a wedding present said hope more at sea than ever if you dont mind giving me details old chap my head would buzz less i rather think that it will buzz more said random dryly and producing the brown paper in which the gem had been wrapped and the inscribed paper found within he related all that had happened archie listened quietly and did not interrupt but the puzzled look on his face grew more pronounced well ended random seeing that no remark was made when he had finished what do you think lord knows ill go out of my mind if these sort of things come along i am a simple sort of chap and have no use for mysteries which beat all the detective stories i have ever read that sort of thing is all very well in fiction but in real lifehumph what are you going to do give back the emerald to don pedro of course though it is given to you for a wedding present and then thenrandom stared into the firei dont know i asked you in to assist me willingly but how random pondered for a few moments who sent that emerald to me do you think he asked looking squarely at the artist hope meditatively turned the jewel in his long fingers why not ask mrs jasher he suggested suddenly no sir frank shook his head i fancied it might be her but it cannot be if she is guiltyas she must be should she have sent the emeraldshe would not part with her plunder when she is so hard up i am beginning to believe hope that what she said was true about the letter how do you mean exactly that the letter was mere bluff and that she really knows nothing about the crime by the way did braddock learn anything not a thing he merely said that the two of them fought i expect braddock stormed and mrs jasher retorted both of them have too much tonguemusic to come to any understanding by the wayto echo your own phraseyou had better put away this gem or i shall be strangling you myself in order to gain possession of it the mere sight of that gorgeous color tempts me beyond my strength random laughed and locked the jewel in his drawer hope suggested that with such a flimsy lock it was unsafe but the baronet shook his head it is safer here than in a womans jewel case he asserted no one looks to my drawer and certainly no one would expect to find a crown jewel of this description in my quarters well he came back to his seat slipping his keys into his trouser pocket the whole thing puzzles me why not do as i suggest and go to mrs jasher in any case you are going there tonight are you not yes i want to decide what to do about the woman i had intended to go alone but as you are here you may as well come also i shall be delighted what do you intend to do help her said random briefly she doesnt deserve it replied hope lighting a fresh cigarette does anyone ever deserve anything asked sir frank cynically what does miss kendal think of the business i suppose braddock told her he has too long a tongue to keep anything to himself he told her at dinner when i was present lucy is quite on your side she says that she had known mrs jasher for months and that there is good in her although i am bound to say that lucy was a trifle shocked does she want mrs jasher to marry her father now her stepfather corrected archie immediately no that is out of the question but she would like mrs jasher to be helped out of her difficulties and have a fair start it was only by the greatest diplomacy that i prevented lucy going to see the wretched woman this evening why did you prevent her archie colored i daresay i am a trifle prudish he replied but after what has happened i do not wish lucy to associate with mrs jasher do you blame me no i dont all the same i dont think that mrs jasher is an immoral woman by any means perhaps not but we neednt discuss her character as we know precious little of her past and she no doubt told you the story that best suited herself i think it will be best to make her tell all she knows this evening and then send her away with a sum of money in her pocket to begin a new life i shall help her certainly said random with his eyes on the fire but cant say exactly how it is my opinion that the poor wretch is more sinned against than sinning you are a soldier with a conscience random the other laughed why shouldnt a soldier have a conscience do you take your idea of officers from the lady novelist who makes us out to be all idle idiots not exactly all the same many a man would not take the trouble to behave as you are doing to this unlucky woman any man who was a man whether soldier or civilian would help such a poor creature and i believe hope that you will help her also the artist leaped to his feet impulsively of course im with you right along as hervey would say but first before deciding what we shall do to set mrs jasher on her legs again let us hear what she has to say she can say nothing more than she has said remonstrated random i dont believe that replied hope reaching for his overcoat you may choose to believe that the letter was the outcome of bluff but i really and truly think that mrs jasher is in the know what is more i believe that bolton got her those clothes and that she was the woman who talked to himwent there to see how the little scheme was progressing if i thought that said random coldly i would not help mrs jasher oh yes you would the greater the sinner the more need she or he has of help you know my dear fellow but get your coat on and let us toddle i dont suppose we need pistols sir frank laughed as aided by the artist he struggled into his military greatcoat i dont suppose that mrs jasher will be dangerous he remarked well get what we can out of her and then arrange what is best to be done to recoup her fallen fortunes then she can go where she chooses and we canas the french sayreturn to our muttons i think donna inez and lucy would be annoyed to hear themselves called muttons laughed archie and the two men left the room the night was darker than ever and a fine rain was falling incessantly when they left the dimly lighted archway of the fort through the smaller gate set in the larger one they stepped into midnight blackness such as must have been spread over the land of egypt in accordance with the primitive customs of gartley inhabitants one of them at least should have been furnished with a lantern as it was no easy task to pick a clean way through the mudhowever archie knowing the surroundings better even than random led the way and they walked slowly through the iron gate on the hard high road which led to the fort immediately beyond this they turned towards the narrow cinder path which led through the marshes to mrs jashers cottage and toiled on cautiously through the misty rain which fell continuously the fog was drifting up from the mouth of the river and was growing so thick that they could not see the somewhat feeble lights of the cottage however archies instincts led him aright and they blundered finally upon the wooden gate here they paused in shocked surprise for a womans scream rang out wildly and suddenly what in heavens name is that asked hope aghast we must find out breathed random and raced through the white cottonwool of the fog up the path as he reached the veranda the door opened and a woman came running out screaming but other screams inside the cottage still continued what is the matter cried random seizing the woman she proved to be jane oh sir my mistress is being murdered hope plunged past her into the corridor not waiting to hear more the cries had died down to a low moaning and he dashed into the pink parlor to find it in smoky darkness striking a match he held it above his head it showed mrs jasher prone on the floor and a dark figure smashing its way through the flimsy window there was a snarl and the figure vanished as the match went out chapter xxiv a confession jane was still being held by sir frank at the floor and was still screaming fully convinced that her captor was a burglar in spite of having recognized him by his voice random was so exasperated by her stupidity that he shook her what is the matter you fool he demanded dont you know that i am a friend yes sir gasped jane fetching her breath again after the shaking but go for the police my mistress is being murdered mr hope is looking after that and the screams have ceased who was with your mistress i dont know sir sobbed the servant i didnt know anyone had called and then i heard the screaming i looked into the parlor to see what was the matter but the lamp had been thrown over and had gone out and there was a dreadful struggle going on in the darkness so i screamed and ran out and then iohoh jane showed symptoms of renewed hysteria and clutched random tightly as a man came cautiously round the corner are you there random asked hopes voice its so infernally dark and foggy that i have missed him missed who the man who was trying to murder mrs jasher he got her down when i entered and struck a match then he dashed through the window before i could catch him or even recognize him hes vanished in the mist its no use looking for him anyhow said random peering into the dense blackness which was thick with damp we had better see after mrs jasher whom have you got there janewho seems to have lost her head its a mercy i havent lost my life sir with burglars and murderers all about the place sobbed the girl dropping on to the veranda random promptly hauled her to her feet go and get a candle and keep calm if you can he said in an abrupt military voice this is no time to play the fool his sharpness had great effect on the girl and she became much more her usual self hope lighted another match and the trio proceeded through the passage towards the kitchen where jane had left a lamp burning seizing this from its bracket sir frank retraced his way along the passage to the pink parlor followed closely by hope and timorously by jane a dreadful scene presented itself the dainty little room was literally smashed to pieces as though a gigantic bull had been wallowing therein the lamp lay on the floor surrounded by several extinguished candles it was a mercy that all the lights had been put out when overturned else the gimcrack cottage would have been long since in a blaze chairs and tables and screens were also overturned and the one window had its rosehued curtains torn down and its glass broken showing only too clearly the way in which the murderer had escaped and that the man who had attacked mrs jasher was a murderer could be seen from the stream of blood that ran slowly from mrs jashers breast apparently she had been stabbed in the lungs for the wound was on the right side there she lay poor woman in her tawdry finery crumpled up battered and bruised dead amongst the ruins of her home jane immediately began to scream again stop her hope cried random who was kneeling by the body and feeling the heart mrs jasher is not dead hold your noise woman and go for a doctor this was to jane who prevented from screaming took to whimpering i had better go said hope quickly and ill go to the fort and alarm the men perhaps they may catch the man can you describe him of course not said archie indignantly i only caught a glimpse of him by the feeble light of a lucifer match then he leaped through the window and i after him i made a grab at him but lost him in the mist i dont know in the least what he is like then how can anyone arrest him snapped random raising mrs jashers head give what alarm you like but race for robinson up the village we must save this poor womans life if only to learn who killed her but she isnt dead yetshe isnt dead yet wailed jane clapping her hands while hope knowing the value of time promptly ran out of the house to get further assistance she soon will be said sir frank whose temper was not of the best at so critical a moment in dealing with a fool go and bring me brandy at once and afterwards linen and hot water we must do our best to staunch this wound and revive her for the next quarter of an hour the man and the woman labored hard to save mrs jashers life random bound up the wound in a rough and ready fashion and jane fed the pale lips of her mistress with sips of brandy mrs jasher gradually became more alive and a faint sigh escaped from her lips as her wounded bosom rose and fell with recovered breath when sir frank was in hopes that she would speak she suddenly relapsed again into a comatose state luckily at that moment archie returned with young dr robinson at his heels and also was followed by painter the village constable who had luckily been picked up in the fog robinson whistled as he looked at the insensible woman shes had a narrow squeak he muttered lifting the body with the assistance of random will she recover questioned hope anxiously i cant tell you yet answered the doctor and with sir frank he carried the heavy body of the widow into her bedroom how did it happen that is my business said painter who had followed and who was now filled with importance you look after the body sir and ill question these gentlemen and the servant servant yourself such sauce muttered jane with an angry toss of her cap at the daring young policeman i know nothing i left my mistress in the parlor writing letters and never heard anyone come in the bell didnt sound anyhow the first thing i knew that anything was wrong was on hearing the screams when i looked into the parlor the candles and the lamp were out and there was a struggle going on in the dark then i cried out very naturally im sure and ran straight into the arms of these gentlemen as soon as i could get the front door open after delivering this address jane was called away to assist the doctor in the bedroom and along with archie and random the constable repaired to the pink parlor to hear what they had to say of course they could tell him even less than jane had told and archie protested that he was quite unable to describe the man who had dashed out of the window ah said painter sapiently he got out there but how did he enter no doubt by the door said random sharply we dont know that sir jane says she did not hear the bell mrs jasher might have let the man in whomsoever he was secretly why should she sir ah now you are asking more than i can tell you only mrs jasher can explain and it seems to me that she will die meanwhile in some mysterious way the news of the crime had spread through the village and although it was growing latefor it was past ten oclocka dozen or so of villagers came along also there arrived a number of soldiers under a smart sergeant and to him sir frank explained what had happened in the fainthearted wayfor the mist was now like cottonwoolthe military and the civilians hunted through the marshes round the cottage hoping to come across the assassin hiding in a ditch needless to say they found no one and nothing for it was worse than looking for a needle in a bundle of hay the man had come out of the mist and after executing the deed had vanished into the mist and there was not the very slightest chance of finding him gradually as it drew towards midnight the soldiers went back to the fort and the villagers to their homes but along with the doctor and the constable hope and his military friend stopped on they were determined to get at the root of the mystery and when mrs jasher became sensible she would be able to reveal the truth its all of a piece with the sending of the emerald said random to the artist and that is connected as we know with the death of bolton do you think that this man who has struck down mrs jasher is the same one who strangled sidney bolton i should think so perhaps mrs jasher sent the emerald after all and this man killed her out of revenge but how would he know that she had the emerald god knows she may have been his accomplice archie knit his brows who the devil can this mysterious person be i can only reply as you have done my friend god knows well i am certain that god will not let him escape this time this will bring gartley once more into notoriety went on hope by the way i saw one of the servants from the pyramids here i hope the fool wont go home and frighten lucys life out of her go to the pyramids and see her suggested sir frank mrs jasher is still unconscious and will be for hours the doctor tells me it is too late to go to the pyramids random if they know of this new tragedy there ill bet they are not in bed hope nodded all the same ill remain here until mrs jasher can speak he said and sat smoking with random in the diningroom as the most comfortable room in the house constable painter camped so to speak in the drawingroom keeping guard over the scene of the crime and had placed the chinese screen against the broken window to keep out the cold in the bedroom jane and dr robinson looked after the dying woman and dying she was according to the young physician for he did not think she would live much longer round the lonely cottage the seamist drifted white and thick and the darkness deepened untilas the saying goesit could have been cut with a knife never was there so eerie and weary and sinister a vigil towards four oclock hope fell into a doze while resting in an armchair but he was suddenly aroused from this by an exclamation from sir frank who had remained wide awake smoking cigar after cigar in a moment the artist was on his feet alert and quickbrained what is it random made for the diningroom door rapidly i thought i heard painter call out he declared and hastily sought the parlor followed by hope the room was empty but the screen before the broken window had been thrown down and they could see painters bulky form immediately outside what the deuce is the matter demanded random entering did you call out painter i fancied i heard something the constable came in again i did call out sir he confessed i was half asleep in that chair when i suddenly became wide awake and believed i saw a face looking at me round the corner of the screen i jumped up calling for you sir and upset the screen well well demanded sir frank impatiently and seeing that the man hesitated i saw no one sir all the same i had an idea and i have still that a man came through the window and peered at me from behind the screen the man who attacked mrs jasher i cant say sir but there was someone at any rate hes gone again if he really did come and there is no chance of finding him its like peasoup outside hope and random simultaneously stepped through the window but could not see an inch before them so thick was the seafog and so dense was the darkness returning they replaced the screen and telling painter to be more on the alert went back shivering to the fire in the diningroom when they were seated again archie put a question do you think that policeman was dreaming he asked meditatively no replied random sharply i believe that the man who assaulted mrs jasher is hanging about and ventured back into the room relying on the fog as a means of escape should he be spotted but the man wouldnt be such a fool as to return into danger not unless he wanted something very badly said random significantly hope let the cigarette he was lighting fall what do you mean i may be wrong of course but it is my impression that there is something in the parlor which this man wants and for which he tried to murder mrs jasher we interrupted him and he was forced to flee hidden in the fog he is lurking about to see if he cant obtain what he has risked his neck to secure what can it be murmured archie struck by the feasibility of this theory perhaps the second emerald remarked sir frank grimly what you dont think that i dont think anything i am too tired to think at all however painter will keep his eyes open and in the morning we can search the room the man has been in the house twice to get what he wanted he wont risk another attempt now that he is aware we are on the alert im going to try and get forty winks you keep watch as you have had your sleep hope was quite agreeable but just as random composed himself to uneasy slumber jane haggard and redeyed came hastily into the diningroom if you please gentlemen the doctor wants you to come and see mistress she is sensible and the two waited to hear no more but went hastily but softly into the room wherein lay the dying woman robinson sat by the bedside holding his patients hand and feeling her pulse he placed his finger on his lips as the men entered gently and at the same moment mrs jashers voice weak from exhaustion sounded through the room which was dimly illuminated by one candle the newcomers halted in obedience to robinsons signal who is there asked mrs jasher weakly for in spite of the care exercised she had evidently heard the footsteps mr hope and sir frank random whispered the doctor speaking into the dying womans ear they came in time to save you in time to see me die she murmured and i cant die unless i tell the truth i am glad random is there he is a kindhearted boy and treated me better than he need have done iohsome brandybrandy robinson gave her some in a spoon now lie quietly and do not attempt to speak he commanded you need all your strength i doto tell that which i wish to tell gasped mrs jasher trying to raise herself sir frank sir frank her voice sounded hoarse and weak yes mrs jasher said the young man coming softly to the bedside she thrust out a weak hand and clutched him you must be my fatherconfessor and hear all you got the emerald what random recoiled in astonishment did you yes i sent it to you as a wedding present i was sorry and i was afraid and ii she paused again gasping the doctor intervened and gave her more brandy you must not talk he insisted severely or i shall turn sir frank and mr hope out of the room no no give me more brandymoremore and when the doctor placed a tumbler to her lips she drank so greedily that he had to take the glass away lest she should do herself harm but the ardent spirit put new life into her and with a superhuman effort she suddenly reared herself in the bed come here hopecome here random she said in a much stronger voice i have much to tell you yes i took the emerald after dark and threw it into the sentry box when the man wasnt looking i escaped your spy random and i escaped the notice of the sentry i walked like a cat and like a cat i can see in the dark i am glad you have got the emerald where did you get it asked random quietly thats a long story i dont know that i have the strength to tell it i have written it out you have written it out said hope quickly and drawing near yes jane thought that i was writing letters but i was writing out the whole story of the murder you were good to me random you dear boy and on the impulse of the moment i took the emerald to you i was sorry when i got back but it was too late then to repent as i did not dare to go near the fort again your spy who watched might have discovered me the second time i then thought that i would write out the story of the murder so as to exonerate myself then you are not guilty of boltons death asked sir frank puzzled for her confession was somewhat incoherent no i did not strangle him but i know who did i have written it all down i was just finishing when i heard the tapping at the window i let him in and he tried to get the confession for i told him what i had done who did you tell asked hope much excited mrs jasher took no notice the confession is lying on my deskall the sheets of paper are loose i had no time to bind them together for he came in he wanted the emerald and the confession i told him that i had given the emerald to you random and that i had confessed all in writing then he went mad and flew at me with a dreadful knife he knocked over the candles and the lamp everything went out and all was darkness and i lay crying for help with that devil stabbingstabbingah who in heavens name is the man demanded random standing up in his eagerness but mrs jasher had fallen back in a faint and robinson was again supplying her with brandy you had better leave the room you two he said or i cant be answerable for her life i must stay and learn the truth said random determinedly and you hope go into the parlor and find that confession it is on the desk as she said all loose sheets no doubt it was the confession which the man she refers to tried to secure when he came back the second time he may make another attempt or painter may go to sleep hurry hurry archie needed no second telling as he realized what hung on the securing of the confession he stole swiftly out of the room closing the door after him faint as was the sound mrs jasher heard it and opened her eyes do not go random she said faintly i have yet much to say although the confession will tell you all i am half sorry i wrote it outat least i wasand perhaps should have burnt it had i not met with this accident accident echoed sir frank scornfully murder you mean the sinister word galvanized the dying woman in sudden strong life and she reared herself again on the bed murder yes it is murder she cried loudly he killed sidney bolton to get the emeralds and he killed me to make me close my mouth who stabbed you speak speak cried random anxiously cockatoo he is guilty of my death and boltons and she fell back dead chapter xxv the mills of god in the cold gray hours of the morning hope and his friend left the cottage wherein such a tragedy had taken place the dead woman was lying stiff and white on her bed under a winding sheet which had already been strewn with manyhued chrysanthemums taken from the pink parlor by the weeping jane the wretched woman who had led so stormy and unhappy a life had at least one sincere mourner for she had always been kind to the servant who formed her entire domestic staff and jane would not hear a word said against the dead not that anyone did say anything for random and hope kept the contents of the confession to themselves there would be time enough for mrs jashers reputation to be smirched when those same contents were made public when the poor woman died random left the doctor and the servant to look after the corpse and went into the parlor here he met hope with the confession in his hand luckily painter was not in the room at the moment else he would have prevented the artist from taking away the same hopeas directed by mrs jasherhad found the confession written on many sheets lying on the desk it broke off abruptly towards the end and was not signed apparently at this point mrs jasher had been interruptedas she had saidby the tapping of cockatoo at the window probably she had admitted him at once and on her refusal to give him the emerald and on her confessing what she had written he had overturned the lights for the purpose of murdering her only too well had the kanaka succeeded in his wickedness archie slipped the confession into his pocket before the policeman returned and then left the cottage with random and the doctor since nothing else could now be done it was between seven and eight and the chilly dawn was breaking but the seamist still lay heavily over the marshes as though it were the winding sheet of the dead robinson went to his own house to get his trap and drive into jessum there to catch the train and ferry to pierside it was necessary that inspector date should be informed of this new tragedy without delay and as constable painter was engaged in watching the cottage there was no messenger available but dr robinson random indeed offered to send a soldier or to afford robinson the use of the fort telephone but the doctor preferred to see date personally so as to detail exactly what had happened perhaps the young medical man had an eye to becoming better known for the improvement of his practice but he certainly seemed anxious to take a prominent part in the proceedings connected with the murder of mrs jasher when robinson parted from them random and hope went to the lodgings of the latter so as to read over the confession and learn exactly to what extent mrs jasher had been mixed up in the tragedy of the green mummy she had declared herself innocent even on her deathbed and so far as the two could judge at this point she certainly had not actually strangled sidney bolton but it might beand it appeared to be more than probablethat she was an accessory after the fact but this they could learn from the confession and they sat in hopes quiet little sittingroom in which the fire had been just lighted by the artists landlady with the scattered sheets neatly ranged before them perhaps you would like a cup of coffee or a whisky and soda suggested archie before starting to read i should assented random who looked weary and pale the events of the night have somewhat knocked me up coffee for choicenice black strong hot coffee hope nodded and went to order the same when he returned he sat down after closing the door carefully and proceeded to read but before he could speak random raised his hand let us chat until the coffee comes in he said then we shall not be interrupted when reading all right said hope have a cigar no thanks i have been smoking all the night i shall sit here by the fire and wait for the coffee you look chippy yourself and small wonder said archie wearily we little thought when we left the fort last night what a time we were going to have fancy mrs jasher having sent you the emerald after all yes she repented as she said and yet i dare sayas she also saidshe was sorry that she acted on her impulse if she had not been stabbed by that damned cockatoo she would no doubt have destroyed that confession i expect she wrote that also on the impulse of the moment she confessed as much said hope leaning his head on his hand and staring into the fire she must have been cognizant of the truth all along i wonder if she was an accessory before or after the fact what i wonder said random after a moments thought is what braddock has to do with the matter hope raised his head in surprise why nothing mrs jasher did not say a word against braddock i know that all the same cockatoo was completely under the thumb of the professor and probably was instructed by him to strangle bolton that is impossible cried the artist much agitated think of what you are saying random what a terrible thing it would be for lucy if the professor were guilty in such a way as you suggest really i fail to see that miss kendal is no relation to braddock save by marriage his iniquities have nothing to do with her or with you but its impossible i tell you random throughout the whole of this case braddock has acted in a perfectly innocent way thats just it said sir frank caustically he has acted in spite of his pretended grief for the loss of the emeralds i should not be surprised to learn from that he nodded towards the confession on the table that he was in possession of the missing gem cockatoo had no reason to steal the emeralds himself setting aside the fact that he probably would not know their value being but a semicivilized savage he acted under orders from his master and although cockatoo strangled bolton the professor is really the author and the gainer and the moving spirit you would make braddock an accessory before the fact yes and mrs jasher an accessory after the fact cockatoo is the link as the actual criminal who joins the two in a guilty partnership no wonder braddock intended to make that woman his wife even though he did not love her for she knew a jolly sight too much for his peace of mind this is horrible murmured hope desperately but it is mere theory we cannot be sure until we read the confession well be sure soon then for here comes the coffee this last remark random made when a timid knock came to the door and a moment later the landlady entered with a tray bearing cups saucers and a jug of steaming coffee she was a meek reticent woman who entered and departed in dismal silence and in a few moments the two young men were quite alone with the door closed they drank a cup of coffee each and then hope proceeded to read the confession the story told by mrs jasher commenced with a short account of her early life it appeared that her father was a ruined gentleman and a gambler and that her mother had been an actress she was dragged up in a bohemian sort of way until she attained a marriageable age when her mother who seemed to have been both wicked and hardhearted forced her to marry a comparatively wealthy man called jasher the elderly husbandfor jasher was not youngtreated his wife very badly and infected with the spirit of gambling by her father lost all his money mrs jasher then went with him to america and performed on the stage in order to keep the home together she had one child but it died much to her grief yet also much to her relief as she was so miserable and poor mrs jasher gave a scanty account of sordid years of trouble and trial of failure and sorrow she and her husband roamed all over america and then went to australia and new zealand where they lived a wretched existence for many years finally the husband died of strong drink at an advanced age leaving mrs jasher a somewhat elderly widow the poor woman again took to the stage and tried to earn her bread but was unsuccessful afterwards she lectured then she kept a boarding establishment and finally went out as a nurse in every way it would seem she tried to keep her head above water and roamed the world like a bird of passage finding rest nowhere for the sole of her foot yet throughout her story both the young men could see that she had always aspired to a quiet and decent respectable existence and that only force of circumstances had flung her into the whirlpool of life as i said remarked random at this stage the miserable creature was more sinned against than sinning her moral sense seemed to have become blunted however said archie doubtfully and small wonder amidst such surroundings but it seems to me that she was much better under the circumstances than many another woman would have been go on in melbourne mrs jasher made a lucky speculation in mines which brought her one thousand pounds with this she came to england and resolved to make a bid for respectability chance led her into the neighborhood of gartley and thinking that if she set up her tent in this locality she might manage to marry an officer from the fortsince amidst such dismal surroundings a young man might be the more easily fascinated by a woman of the worldshe took the cottage amidst the marshes at a small rent here she hoped to eke out what money she had lefta few hundredsuntil the coveted marriage should take place afterwards she met professor braddock and determined to marry him as a man more easy to manage she was successful in enlisting lucy on her side and until the green mummy brought its bad luck to the pyramids everything went capitally it was in connection with the name of bolton that the first mention was made of the green mummy sidney was a clever young man although very lowly born and having been taken up by professor braddock as an assistant could hope some day to make a position braddock was educating him although he paid him very little in the way of wages sidney fell in love with mrs jasher and in some wayshe did not mention howgained her confidence perhaps the lonely woman was glad to have a sympathetic friend at all events she told her past history to sidney and mentioned that she desired to marry braddock but sidney insisted that she should marry him and promised to make enough money to satisfy her that he was a good match setting aside his humble birth for which mrs jasher cared nothing it was then that sidney related what he had discovered braddock when in peru many years before had tried to get mummies for some scientific reason when herveythen known as vasapromised to procure him the mummy of the last inca braddock was extremely pleased hervey stole the mummy and also the copy of the manuscript which was written in latin he sent this latter to braddockwho was then at cuzcoas an earnest of his success in procuring the mummy and when the professor returned to lima the mummy was to be handed to him unfortunately braddock was carried into captivity for one year and when he escaped vasa had disappeared with the mummy as the professor had deciphered the latin manuscript he knew of the emeralds and for years had been hunting for the mummysure to be recognized from its peculiar green colorin order to get the jewels and thus secure money for his egyptian expedition all through it seems the professor was actuated by purely scientific enthusiasm as in the abstract he cared very little for hard cash bolton told mrs jasher that braddock explained how much he desired to get the mummy but he did not mention about the jewels for a long time sidney was under the impression that his master merely wanted the mummy to see the difference between the egyptian and peruvian modes of embalming then one day sidney chanced on the latin manuscript and learned that braddocks real reason for getting the mummy was to procure the emeralds which were held in the grip of the dead sidney kept this knowledge to himself and braddock never guessed that his assistant knew the truth then unexpectedly braddock stumbled across the advertisement describing the green mummy for sale in malta from the color he made sure that it was that of inca caxas and so moved heaven and earth to get money to buy it at length he did from archie hope on condition that he consented to the marriage of his stepdaughter with the young man thinking that sidney was ignorant of the jewels he sent him to bring the mummy home sidney told mrs jasher that he would try and steal the jewels in malta or on board the tramp steamer failing that he would delay the delivery of the mummy to braddock on some excuse and rob it at pierside to make sure of escaping he borrowed a disguise from his mother alleging that hope wanted the same to clothe a model sidney intended to take these clothes with him and after stealing the jewels to escape disguised as an old woman as he was slender and cleanshaven and a capital actor he could easily manage this then he arranged that mrs jasher should join him in paris and they would sell the emeralds and go to america there to marry and live happily ever afterwards like a fairy tale unfortunately for the success of this plan mrs jasher thought that the professor would make a more distinguished husband so she betrayed all that sidney had arranged what a beastly thing to do interrupted random disgusted it is not as if she wanted to help braddock i think less of mrs jasher than ever i did she might have remembered that there is honor amongst thieves well she is dead poor soul said hope with a sigh god knows that if she sinned she has paid cruelly for her sin after which remark as sir frank was silent he resumed his reading braddock was furious when he learned of his assistants projected trickery and he determined to circumvent him he agreed to marry mrs jasher as if he had not done so she could have warned sidney and he could have escaped with both the mummy and the jewels by conniving with hervey the professor could not risk that as remembering hervey as gustav vasa he was aware how clever and reckless he was whether braddock ever intended to marry the widow in the end it is hard to say but he certainly pretended to consent to the engagement which was mainly brought about by lucy then came the details of the murder so far as mrs jasher knew one eveningin fact on the evening when the crime was committedthe woman was walking in her garden late in the moonlight she saw braddock and cockatoo go down along the cinderpath to the jetty near the fort wondering what they were doing she waited up and heard and saw themfor it was still moonlightcome back long after midnight the next day she heard of the murder and guessed that the professor and his slavefor cockatoo was little elsehad rowed up to pierside in a boat and there had strangled sidney and stolen the mummy she saw braddock and accused him the professor had then opened the case and had pretended astonishment when discovering the corpse of the man whom cockatoo had strangled as he knew perfectly well braddock at first denied having been to pierside but mrs jasher insisted that she would tell the police so he was forced to make a clean breast of it to the woman now for it said random settling himself to hear details of the crime for he had often wondered how it had been executed braddock read archie from the confession for mrs jasher did not trouble herself with a polite prefixbraddock explained that when he received a letter from sidney stating that he would have to remain with the mummy for a night in pierside he guessed that his treacherous assistant intended to effect the robbery it seems that sidney by mistake had left behind the disguise in which he intended to escape aware of this through memrs jasher referred to herselfhe made cockatoo assume the dress and row up the river to the sailors rest the kanaka easily could be mistaken for a woman as he also like sidney was slender and smoothchinned also he wore the shawl over his head to disguise his mop of frizzy hair as much as possible and for the purpose of concealing his tattooed face in the darknessit was after nine oclockhe spoke to sidney through the window as he had seen him there earlier when searching for him cockatoo said that sidney was much afraid when he heard that his purpose had been discovered by the professor he offered a share of the plunder to the kanaka and cockatoo agreed saying he would come back late and that sidney was to admit him into the bedroom so that they could open the mummy and steal the jewels sidney quite believed that cockatoo was heart and soul with him especially as the cunning kanaka swore that he was weary of his masters tyranny it was when cockatoo was talking thus that he was seen by eliza flight who mistook himvery naturallyfor a woman cockatoo then returned by boat to the gartley jetty and told his master afterwards the professor at a much later hour went down to the jetty and was rowed up to pierside by the kanaka that was when mrs jasher saw them said random much interested yes said archie and then if you remember she watched for the return of the couple it was nearly midnight when the boat was brought alongside the sloping stone bank of the alley which ran past the sailors rest no one was about at that hour not even a policeman and there was no light in sidney boltons window braddock was much agitated as he thought that sidney had already escaped he waited in the boat and sent cockatoo to knock at the window then a light appeared and the window was silently opened the kanaka slipped in and remained there for some ten minutes after closing the window when he returned the light was extinguished he whispered to his master that sidney had opened the packing case and the mummy coffin and had ripped the swathings to get the jewels when sidney would not hand over the jewels to the kanaka as the latter wanted him to cockatoo already prepared with the window cord which he had silently taken from the blind sprang upon the unfortunate assistant and strangled him cockatoo told this to his horrified master and wanted him to come back to hide the corpse in the packing case braddock refused and then cockatoo told him that he would throw the jewelswhich he had taken from sidneys bodyinto the river the position of master and servant was reversed and braddock was forced to obey the professor slipped silently ashore and into the room the two men relighted the candle and pulled down the blind they then placed the corpse of sidney in the packing case and screwed the same down in silence when this was completed they were about to carry the mummy in its coffinthe lid of which they had replacedto the boat when they heard distant footsteps probably those of a policeman on his beat at once they extinguished the candle andas braddock told mrs jasherhe for one sat trembling in the dark but the policemanif the footsteps were those of a policemanpassed up another street and the two were safe without relighting the candle they silently slipped the mummy through the window cockatoo within and braddock without the case and its contents were not heavy and it was not difficult for the two men to take it to the boat when it was safely bestowed cockatoowho was as cunning as the devil according to his master returned to the bedroom and unlocked the door he afterwards passed a string through the joining of the upper and lower windows and managed to shut the snib afterwards he came to the boat and rowed it back to gartley on the way cockatoo told his master that sidney had left instructions that the packing case should be taken next morning to the pyramids so there was nothing to fear the mummy was hidden in a hole under the jetty and covered with grass why didnt they take it up to the house asked random on hearing this that would have been dangerous said hope looking up from the manuscript seeing that the mummy was supposed to have been stolen by the murderer it was easier to hide it amongst the grasses under the jetty as no one ever goes there wellhe turned over a few pagesthat is practically all the rest is after events i want to hear them said random taking another cup of coffee hope ran his eyes swiftly over the remaining portion of the paper and gave further details rapidly to his friend you know all that happened he said the professors pretended surprise when he found the corpse he had himself helped to pack and yes yes but why was the mummy placed in mrs jashers garden that was braddocks idea he fancied that the mummy might be found under the jetty and that inconvenient inquiries might be made also he wished if possible to implicate mrs jasher so as to keep her from telling to the police what he had told her he and cockatoo went down to the river one night and removed the mummy to the arbor silently afterwards he pretended to be astonished when i found it i must say he acted his part very well said hope reflectively even to accusing mrs jasher that was a bold stroke of genius a very dangerous one not at all he swore to mrs jasher that if she said anything he would tell the police that she had taken the clothes provided by sidney from the pyramids and had gone to speak through the window in order to fly with sidney and the emeralds as the fact of the mummy being found in mrs jashers garden would lend color to the lie she was obliged to hold her tongue and after all as she says she didnt mind since she was engaged to the professor and possessed at least one of the emeralds ah the one she passed along to me how did she get that hope referred again to the manuscript she insisted that braddock should give it to her as a pledge of good faith he had to do it or risk her splitting that was why he placed the mummy in her garden so as to bring her into the matter and render it more difficult for her to speak what of the other emerald braddock took that to amsterdam when he went to london that timeif you remember when don pedro arrived braddock sold the emerald for three thousand pounds and it is now on its way to an indian rajah i fear don pedro will never set eyes on that again where is the money he banked it in a feigned name in amsterdam and intended to account for it when he married mrs jasher by saying it was left to her by that mythical pekin merchant brother of hers savvy yes what an infernal little villain and i expect he sent cockatoo down last night for the other emerald that is not related in the manuscript said archie laying down the last sheet and taking up his coffee the confession ends abruptlyat the time cockatoo tapped at the window i expect but she said when dying that the kanaka asked for the second emerald if she had not sent it to you in a fit of weakness i expect she would have passed it along i cant make out added archie musingly why mrs jasher confessed when everything was so safe well said random nursing his chin and staring into the fire she made a mistake in trying to blackmail me though why she did so i cant tell seeing she had the whiphand of braddock perhaps she wanted the five thousand to spend herself knowing that the professors plunder would be wasted on his confounded expedition at any rate she gave herself away by the blackmail and i expect she grew frightened if the house had been searchedand it might have been searched by the police had i arrested her for blackmail the emerald would have been found and she would have been incriminated she therefore got rid of it cleverly by passing it along to me as a wedding gift then she again grew afraid and wrote out this confession to exonerate herself but it doesnt insisted hope she makes herself out plainly as an accessory after the fact a woman doesnt understand these legal niceties she wrote that out to clear herself in case she was arrested for the blackmail and perhaps in case braddock refused to help heras he certainly did if you remember he was hard on her confessed archie slowly being such a villain himself said random grimly however cockatoo arrived unluckily on the scene and when he found she had parted with the emerald and had written out the truth he stabbed her if we hadnt come just in the nick of time he would have annexed that confession and the truth would never have become known no one ended random rising and stretching himself would connect braddock or cockatoo with the death of mrs jasher or with the death of sidney bolton either said hope also rising and putting on his cap what an actor the man is where are you going demanded sir frank yawning to the pyramids i want to see how lucy is will you tell her about that confession not until later i shall give this to inspector date when he arrives the professor has made his bed so he must lie on it when i marry lucy ill take her away from this damned place marry her at once then advised random while the professor is doing time and while cockatoo is being hanged meanwhile i think you had better put on your overcoat unless you want to walk through the village in crumpled evening dress like a dissipated undergraduate archie laughed in spite of his weariness and assumed his greatcoat at the same moment as random slipped into his the two young men walked out into the village and up to the pyramids for random wished to see braddock before returning to the fort they found the door of the great house open and the servants in the hall what is all this demanded hope entering why are you here and not at work where is your master hes run away said the cook in a shrill voice lord knows why sir archie archie lucy came running out of the museum palefaced and white my father has gone away with cockatoo and the green mummy what does it mean and just when poor mrs jasher is murdered too hush darling come in and ill explain said hope gently chapter xxvi the appointment poor lucy kendal was terribly grieved and shocked when the full account of her stepfathers iniquity was revealed to her archie tried to break the news as delicately as possible but no words could soften the sordid story lucy at first could not believe it possible that a man whom she had known for so long and to whom she was related would behave in such a base way to convince her hope was forced to let her read the account in mrs jashers handwriting when acquainted with the contents the poor girls first desire was to have the matter hushed up and she implored her lover with tears to suppress the damning document that is impossible said hope firmly and if you think again my dear you will not repeat such a request it is absolutely necessary that this should be placed in the hands of the police and that the truth should become as widely known as possible unless the matter is settled once and for all someone else may be accused of this murder but the disgrace wept lucy hiding her face on her lovers shoulder he slipped his arm round her waist my darling the disgrace exists whether it be public or private after all the professor is no relation no but everyone knows that i am his stepdaughter everyone echoed archie with an assumed lightness my dear everyone in this instance only means the handful of people who live in this outoftheway village your name will not appear in the papers and even if by chance it does you will soon be changing it for mine i think the best thing that can be done is for you to come with me to london next week and marry me then we can go to the south of france for the rest of the winter until you recover when we return and set up house in londonsay in a yearthe whole affair will be forgotten but how can you bear to marry me when you know that i come of such a bad stock wept lucy a trifle more comforted my dear must i remind you again that you are no relation to professor braddock you have not a drop of his wicked blood in your veins and even if you had i should still marry you it is you i love and you i marry so there is no more to be said come darling say that you will become my wife next week but the professor archie smiled grimly he found it difficult to forgive braddock for the disgrace he had brought on the girl i dont think well ever be troubled again with the professor he said after a pause he has bolted into the unknown with that infernal kanaka but why did he fly archie because he knew that the game was up mrs jasher wrote out this confession and told cockatoo when he entered the room to get the emerald that she had written it to save his master the kanaka stabbed the wretched woman and had random and i not arrived he would have secured the confession i really believe he came back again out of the mist in the small hours of the morning to steal it but when he found that all was vain he returned here and told the professor that the story of the murder had been written out therefore there was nothing left to braddock but to fly although added hope with an afterthought i cant imagine why those two fugitives should drag that confounded mummy with them but why should the professor fly asked lucy again according to what mrs jasher writes he did not strangle poor sidney no and i will do him the justice to say that he had no idea of having his assistant murdered it was cockatoos savage blood which came out in the deed and maybe it can be explained by the kanakas devotion to the professor it was the same way in the murder of mrs jasher by killing bolton the kanaka hoped to save the emeralds for braddock in stabbing mrs jasher he hoped to save the professors life oh archie will they hang my father hope winced call him your stepfather he said quickly no dear i do not think he will be hanged but as an accessory after the fact he will certainly be condemned to a long term of imprisonment cockatoo however assuredly will be hanged and a good job too he is only a savage and as such is dangerous in a civilized community i wonder where they have gone did anyone hear them going no said lucy unhesitatingly cook came up this morning to my room and said that my fatheri mean my stepfatherhad gone away with cockatoo and with the green mummy i dont know why she should have said that as the professor often went away unexpectedly perhaps she heard rumors in the village and put two and two together i cannot tell some instinct must have told her but i daresay braddock and his accomplice fled under cover of the mist and in the small hours of the morning they must have known that the confession would bring the officers of the law to this house i hope they will escape murmured lucy well i am not sure said hope hesitatingly of course i should like to avoid a scandal for your sake and yet it is only right that the two of them should be punished remember lucy dear how braddock has acted all along in deceiving us he knew all and yet not one of us suspected him while archie was thus comforting the poor girl gartley village was in an uproar everyone was talking about this new crime and everyone was wondering who had stabbed the unlucky woman as yet the confession of mrs jasher had not been placed in the hands of the police and everyone was ignorant that cockatoo was the criminal who had escaped in the fog inspector date speedily arrived with his myrmidons on the scene and made the cottage his headquarters later in the day hope having taken a cold bath to freshen himself up came with the confession this he gave to the officer and explained the whole story of the previous night date was more than astonished he was astounded he read the confession and made notes then he sent for sir frank random and examined him in the same strict way as he had examined the artist jane was also questioned widow anne was put in the witness box so as to report about the clothes and in every way date gathered material for another inquest at the former one he had only been able to place scanty evidence before the jury and the verdict had been unsatisfactory to the public but on this occasion seeing that the witnesses he could bring forward would solve the mystery of the first death as well as the second inspector date exulted greatly he saw himself promoted and his salary raised and his name praised in the papers as a zealous and clever officer by the time the inquest came to be held the inspector had talked himself into believing that the whole mystery had been solved by himself but before that time came another event happened which astonished everyone and which made the final phase of the green mummy crime even more sensational than it had been and heaven knows that from beginning to end there had been no lack of melodrama of the most lurid description don pedro de gayangos was exceedingly amazed at the unexpected turn which the case had taken that he should have been trying to solve a deep mystery for so long and that the solution all the time had been in the hands of the professor startled him exceedingly he admitted that he had never liked braddock but explained that he had not expected to hear that the fiery little scientist was such a scoundrel but as don pedro confessed it was an ill wind which blew him some good when the upshot of the whole mysterious tragic business was the restoration of at least one emerald sir frank brought the gem to him on the afternoon of the day succeeding mrs jashers death and while the whole village was buzzing with excitement it was random who gave all details to donna inez and her father leading from one revelation to another until he capped the whole extraordinary story by producing the splendid gem mine mine said don pedro his dark eyes glittering thanks be to the virgin and the saints and he bowed his head to make the sign of the cross devoutly on his breast donna inez clapped her hands and her eyes flashed for like every woman she had a profound love for jewels oh how lovely frank it must be worth no end of money professor braddock sold the other to some indian rajah in amsterdamthrough an agent i presume for three thousand pounds i shall get more than that said don pedro quickly the professor sold his jewel in a hurry and had no time to bargain but sooner or later i shall get five thousand pounds for this he held the gem in the sunlight where it glowed like an emerald sun why it is worthy of a kings crown i fear you will never get the other gem said random regretfully i believe that it is on its way to india if mrs jasher can be trusted never mind i shall be content with this one senor i have simple tastes and this will do much to restore the fortunes of my family when i go back with this and the green mummy all those indians who know of my descent from the ancient incas will be delighted and will pay me fresh reverence but you forget said random frowning the green mummy has been taken away by professor braddock they cannot have gone far with it said donna inez shrugging i dont know so much about that dearest said sir frank apparently since they handled it at the time of the murder it is easier carried about than one would think and then they fled last night or rather in the small hours of this morning under cover of a dense fog it is clear enough now said de gayangos peering through the window where a pale winter sun shone in a clear steelhued sky they are bound to be caught in the long run do you wish them to be caught asked random abruptly not the professor for miss lucys sake i hope he will escape but i trust that the savage who killed these two unfortunate people will be brought to the gallows so do i said random well don pedro it seems to me that your task in gartley is ended all you have to do is to wait for the inquest and see mrs jasher buried poor soul then you can go to london and remain there until after christmas but why should i remain in london asked the peruvian surprised random glanced at donna inez who blushed you forget that you have given your consent to my marriage with ah yes don pedro smiled gravely i return with the jewel to lima but i leave my other jewel behind never mind said the girl kissing her father when frank and i are married we will come to callao in his yacht our yacht said random smiling our yacht repeated donna inez and then you will see father that i have become a real english lady but dont entirely forget that you are a peruvian said don pedro playfully and a descendant of inca caxas added donna inez then she flirted her fan which she was rarely without and laughed in her english lovers face dont forget senor that you marry a princess i marry the most charming girl in the world he replied catching her in his arms rather to the scandal of de gayangos who had stiff spanish notions regarding the etiquette of engaged couples there is one thing you must do for me senor he said quietly before we leave this most unhappy case of murder and theft for ever what is that asked sir frank turning with inez in his arms tonight at eight oclock captain herveythe sailor gustav vasa if you prefer the namesteams down the river in his new boat the firefly i received a note from himhe displayed a letterstating that he will pass the jetty of gartley at that hour and will burn a blue light if i fire a pistol he will send off a boat with a full account of the theft of the mummy of inca caxas written by himself then i will hand his messenger fifty gold sovereigns which i have here added don pedro pointing to a canvas bag on the table and we will return i wish you to go with me senor and also i wish your friend mr hope to come do you anticipate treachery from captain hervey asked random i should not be surprised if he tried to trick me in some way and i wish you and your friend to stand by me were this man alone i would go alone but he will have a boats crew with him it is best to be safe i agree with you said random quickly hope and i will come and we will take revolvers with us it doesnt do to trust this blackguard ho ho i wonder if he knows of the professors flight no considering the terms upon which the professor stood with hervey i should think he would be the last person he would trust i wonder what has become of the man more people than don pedro wondered as to the whereabouts of braddock and his servant for everyone was inquiring and hunting the marshes round the cottage were explored the great house itself was searched as well as many cottages in the village and inquiries were made at all the local stations but all in vain braddock and cockatoo along with the cumbersome mummy in its case had vanished as completely as though the earth had swallowed them up inspector dates idea was that the pair had taken the mummy to gartley pier after the search made by the soldiers and there had launched the boat which cockatoojudging from his visit to piersideapparently kept hidden in some nook it was probable said date the two had rowed down the river and had managed to get on board some outwardbound tramp they could easily furbish up some story and as braddock doubtless had money could easily buy a passage for a large sum the tramp being outwardbound her captain and crew would know nothing of the crime and even if the fugitives were suspected they would be shipped out of england if the bribe was sufficiently large so it was apparent that inspector date had not much opinion of trampsteamer skippers however as the day wore on to night nothing was heard of braddock or cockatoo or the mummy and when night came the village was filled with local reporters and with london journalists asking questions the warrior inn did a great trade in drink and beds and meals and the rustics reaped quite a harvest in answering questions about mrs jasher and the professor and the weirdlooking kanaka some reporters dared to invade the pyramids where lucy was weeping in sorrow and shame but archie reinforced by two policemen sent to his aid by date soon sent them to the right about hope would have liked to remain with lucy all the evening but at halfpast seven he was forced to meet don pedro and random outside the fort in order to go to gartley jetty chapter xxvii by the river as the hunt for the fugitives had continued all day everyone police villagers and soldiers were weary and disheartened consequently when the three men met near the fort there seemed to be few people about this was just as well as they would have been followed to the jetty and obviously it was best to keep the strange meeting with captain hervey as secret as possible however don pedro had taken inspector date into his confidence as it was impossible to get past the cottage of the late mrs jasher in which the officer had taken up his quarters without being discovered date was quite willing that the trio should go but stipulated that he should come also he had heard all about captain hervey in connection with the mummy and thought that he would like to ask that sailor a few leading questions and if i see fit i shall detain him until the inquest is over said date which was mere bluff as the inspector had no warrant to stop the firefly or arrest her skipper the three men therefore were joined by date when they came along the cinder path abreast of the cottage and the quartette proceeded further immediately walking amongst the bents and grasses to the rude old wooden jetty near which hervey intended to stop his ship the night was quite clear of fog strange to say considering the late seamist but a strong wind had been blowing all day and the fogwreaths were entirely dispersed a full moon rode amongst a galaxy of stars which twinkled like diamonds the air was frosty and their feet scrunched the earth and grasses and coarse herbage under foot as they made rapidly for the embankment when they reached the top they could see the jetty clearly almost below their feet and in the distance the glittering lights of pierside vague forms of vessels at anchor loomed on the water and there was a stream of light where the moon made a pathway of silver after a casual glance the three men proceeded down the slope to the jetty three of them at least had revolvers since hervey was an ill man to tackle but probably date who was too dense to consider consequences was unarmed neither did don pedro think it necessary to tell the officer that he and his two companions were prepared to shoot if necessary inspector date being a prosy englishman would not have understood such lawless doings in his own sober lawabiding country when they reached the jetty don pedro glanced at his watch illuminating the dial by puffing his cigar to a ruddy glow it was just after eight oclock and even as he looked an exclamation from date made him raise his head the inspector was pointing outstream to a large vessel which had steamed inshore as far as was safe probably hervey was watching for them through a nightglass for a blue light suddenly flared on the bridge don pedro according to his promise fired a pistol and it was then that date learned that his companions were armed what the devil did you do that for he inquired angrily it will bring my constables down on us i do not mind since you can control them said de gayangos coolly i had to give the signal and we all have revolvers said random quickly hervey is not a very safe man to tackle inspector do you expect a fight said date while they all watched a boat being lowered if so you might have told me and i should have brought a revolver also not that i think it is needed the sight of my uniform will be enough to show this man that i have the law behind me i dont think that will matter to hervey said archie dryly so much as i have seen of him suggests to me that he is a singularly lawless man date laughed goodhumoredly it seems to me gentlemen that you have brought me on a filibustering expedition he said and seemed to enjoy the novel situation date had been wrapped up in the cottonwool of civilization for a long time but his primitive instincts rose to the surface now that he had to face a probable roughandtumble fight but i dont expect there will be any scrap he said regretfully my uniform will settle the matter it certainly seemed to annoy captain hervey considerably for as the boat approached the shore and the moonlight revealed a distinctly official overcoat he gave an order the man stopped rowing and the boat rocked gently some distance from the jetty youve got a high old crowd with you don pedro sang out hervey in great displeasure is that angel in the military togs with the brass buttons the almighty aristocrat no i am here cried out random laughing at the description which he recognized my friend hope is with me and inspector date i suppose you have heard what has happened yes ive taken it all in said hervey sourly i guess the news is all over pierside well its none of my picnic i reckon so chuck that gold over here don pedro and ill send along the writing no said don pedro prompted by date you must come ashore i guess not said hervey vigorously you want to run me in for that theft of thirty years ago laughed de gayangos nonsense come along you are quite safe shant take your damned word for it growled hervey but if those two gents can swear that theres no trickery ill come i can depend on the word of an english aristocrat anyhow come along you are quite safe said sir frank and hope echoed his words thus being made certain hervey gave an order and the boat was rowed right up to the beach immediately below the jetty the four men were about to descend but hervey seemed anxious to avoid giving them trouble hold on gents said he leaping ashore ill come up longside date ever suspicious thought it queer that the skipper should behave so politely as he had gathered that hervey was not usually a considerate man also he saw that when the captain was climbing the bank the boat in charge of a mateas the inspector judged from his brassbound uniformbacked water to the end of the jetty where it swung against one of the shellencrusted piles hervey finally reached the jetty level but refused to come on to the same he beckoned to don pedro and his companions to walk forward to the ground upon which he was standing also he seemed exceedingly anxious to take time over the transaction as even after he had handed the scroll of writing to the peruvian and had received the gold in exchange he engaged in quarrelsome conversation pretending that he doubted if de gayangos had brought the exact sum he opened the canvas bag and insisted on counting the money don pedro naturally lost his temper at this insult and swore in spanish upon which hervey responded with such volubility that anyone could see he was a pastmaster in castilian swearing the row was considerable especially as random and hope were laughing at the quarrel they thought that hervey was the worse for drink but dateclever for once in his lifedid not think so it appeared to him that the boat had gone to the end of the jetty for some reason connected with the same reason which induced the skipper to spin out the time of the meeting by indulging in an unnecessary quarrel the skipper also kept his eyes about him and insisted that the four men should keep together at the head of the pier i daresay youre trying to play low down on me he said with a scowl after satisfying himself that the money was correct but ive got my shooter so have i cried don pedro indignantly and slipped his hand round to his hip pocket and if you talk any further so insulting i shall oh you bet two can play at that game cried hervey and ripped out his own weapon before the spaniard could produce his derringer hands up or i shoot but he had reckoned without his host while covering de gayangos he overlooked the fact that random and hope were close at hand the next moment and while don pedro flung up his hands the ruffian was covered by two revolvers in the hands of two very capable men great scott cried hervey lowering his weapon only my fun gents here you get back this was to inspector date who had been keeping his ears and eyes open and who was now racing for the end of the jetty peering over he uttered a loud cry i thought soi thought so heres the nigger and the mummy hervey uttered a curse and plunging past the trio careless of the leveled weapons ran down to the end of the jetty and throwing his arms round date leaped with him into the sea they fell just beside the boat as random saw when he reached the spot a confused volley of curses arose as the boat pushed out from the encrusted pile the mate thrusting with a boathook hervey and date were in the water but as the boat shot into the moonlight randomand now hope and de gayangos who had come upsaw a long green form in amongst the sailors also very plainly cockatoo with his great mop of yellow hair shoot shoot yelled date who was struggling with the skipper in the shallow water near shore dont let them escape hope ran up the jetty and fired three shots in the air certain that the firing would attract the attention of the four or five constables on guard at the cottage which was no very great distance away random sent a bullet into the midst of the boatload and immediately the mate fired also the bullet whistled past his head and crazy with rage he felt inclined to jump in amongst the ruffians and have a handtohand fight but de gayangos stopped him in a voice shrill with anger already the shouts and noise of the approaching policemen could be heard cockatoo gripped the green mummy case desperately while the sailors tried to row towards the ship then de gayangos gave a shout and leaped as the boat swung past the jetty he landed right on cockatoo and although a cloud drifted across the moon random heard the shots coming rapidly from his revolver meanwhile hervey got away from date as the constables came pounding down the jetty and on to the beach chuck the mummy and nigger overboard and make for the ship he yelled swimming with long strokes towards the boat this order was quite to the sailors minds as they had not reckoned on such a fight half a dozen willing hands clutched both cockatoo and the case and in spite of the kanakas cries both were hurled overboard as the case swung overside de gayangos balancing himself at the end of the boat fired at cockatoo the shot missed the kanaka and pierced the mummy case then from it came a piercing yell of agony and rage great god shouted hope who was watching the battle i believe braddock is in that damned thing the next moment de gayangos was swung overboard also and the sailors were lifting hervey into the boat it nearly upset but he managed to get in and the craft rowed for the vessel which was again showing a flaring blue light random sent a shot after the boat and then with the policemen ran down to help de gayangos who was struggling in the water he managed to pull him out and when he had him safe and breathless on shore he saw that the boat was nearing the ship and that date torn and wet and disheveled with three policemen was up to his waist in water struggling to bring ashore cockatoo and the mummy case to which he clung like a limpet hope ran down to give a hand and in a few minutes they had the kanaka ashore fighting like the demon he was random and de gayangos joined the breathless group and cockatoo was held in the grasp of two strong menwho required all their strength to hold himwhile date warned by hopes cry of what was in the case tore at the lid it was but lightly fastened and soon came off then those present saw in the moonlight the dead face of professor braddock who had been shot through the heart as they looked at the sight cockatoo broke from those who held him and throwing himself on his master howled and wept as though his heart would break at the same moment there came a derisive whistle from the firefly and they saw the great tramp steamer slowly moving down stream increasing her speed with almost every revolution of the screw braddock had been captured but hervey had escaped at the inquest on the professor and on the body of mrs jasher it was proved that cockatoo had warned his master that the game was up and had suggested that braddock should escape by hiding in the mummy case the corpse of inca caxas was placed in an empty egyptian sarcophagusin which it was afterwards foundand braddock assisted by his faithful kanaka wheeled the case down to the old jetty here in a nook where cockatoo had formerly kept the boat the professor concealed himself all that night and all next day cockatoo having got rid of his boat long since lest it might be used in evidence against him and his master ran through the dense mist and the long night up to pierside where he saw captain hervey and bribed him with a promise of one thousand pounds to save his master hervey having assured himself that the money was safe since it was banked in a feigned name in amsterdam agreed and arranged to ship the professor in the mummy case thus it was that hervey kept the four men talking up the jetty as he knew that cockatoo with his own sailors was shipping the professor in the mummy case underneath and well out of sight cockatoo had come down stream with the firefly and in this way had not been discovered throughout that long day the miserable braddock had crouched like a toad in its hole trembling at every sound of pursuit as he knew that the whole of the village was looking for him but cockatoo had hidden him well in the case in the lid of which holes had been bored he had brandy to drink and food to eat and he knew that he could depend upon the kanaka had date not been suspicious the ruse might have been successful but to save himself hervey had to sacrifice the wretched professor which he did without the slightest hesitation then came the unlucky shot from the revolver of de gayangos which had ended braddocks wicked life it was fate at the inquest a verdict of wilful murder was brought against the kanaka but a verdict of justifiable homicide was given in favor of the peruvian thus cockatoo was hanged for the double murder and don pedro went free he remained long enough in london to see his daughter married to the man of her choice and then returned to lima of course the affair caused more than a nine days wonder and the newspapers were filled with accounts of the murder and the projected escape but lucy was saved from all this publicity as in the first place her name was kept out of print as much as possible and in the second archie promptly married her and within a fortnight of her stepfathers death took her to the south of france and afterwards to italy what with his own money and the money she inherited from her motherin which braddock had a life interestthe young couple had nearly a thousand a year six months later sir frank came into the small san remo where mr and mrs hope lived with his wife on his arm lady random looked singularly charming and was assuredly more conversational this was the first time the two sets of lovers had met since the tragedy and now each girl had married the man she loved therefore there was great joy my yacht is over at monte carlo said random and i am going with inez to south america she wants to see her father yes i do said lady random and we want you to come also lucyyou and your dear husband archie and his wife looked at one another but declined unanimously we would rather stay here in san remo said mrs hope becoming slightly pale dont think me unkind inez but i could not bear to go to peru it is associated too much in my own mind with that terrible green mummy oh don pedro has taken that back to the andes explained sir frank and it is now reposing in the sepulchre in which it was placed hundreds of years ago by the indians faithful to inca caxas inez and i are going up to a kind of forbidden city where don pedro reigns as inca and i expect we shall have a jolly time i hear there is some big game shooting there what about your soldiering asked hope rather surprised at this extended tour being arranged oh my husband has left the army pouted inez his duties kept him away from me nearly all the day and i grew weary of being left alone so you see mrs hope laughed random gayly that i have had to succumb to my fireside tyrant we shall go and see this fairy city and then return to my home in oxfordshire there inez will settle down as a real english wife and ill turn a country squire so after all our troubles peace will come and as you will not come to my country said lady random to her hostess you cannot refuse to visit frank and myself at the grange we have had so much trouble together that we cannot lose sight of each other no said lucy kissing her we will come to oxfordshire so it was arranged and the next day mr and mrs hope went over to monte carlo to see the last of sir frank and his wife they stood on the heights watching the pretty little steamer making for south america archie noticed that his wifes face was somewhat sad are you sorry we did not go sweetheart no she replied placing her arm within his own i only want to be with you that is all right he patted her hand now that we have sold all the furniture in the pyramids and have got rid of the lease there will be nothing to remind you of the green mummy yet i cant help thinking of my unfortunate stepfather and of poor mrs jasher and of sidney bolton oh archie little as we can afford it i am glad that we allow mrs bolton a small sum a year after all it was through my stepfather that her son met with his death i dont quite agree with you dear cockatoos innate savagery was the cause as professor braddock did not intend or desire murder but there dear do not think any more about these dismal things dream of the time when i shall be the president of the royal academy and you my lady i am your lady now but added lucy perhaps from an association of ideas of color and the academy i shall hate green for the rest of my life thats unlucky considering it is natures color my dear in a year or two this tragedy or rather the three tragedies will seem like a dream i wont listen to another word now the green mummy has passed out of our lives and has taken its bad luck with it amen so be it said lucy hope and the happy couple went home leaving all their sorrows behind them while the smoke of the steamer faded on the horizon
