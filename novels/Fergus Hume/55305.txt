the adjective the man beatrice the man give me a real man and i ask for nothing better but the genuine male is so difficult to find nowadays really then you have been more successful than the majority how sarcastic how unfriendly i did look for sympathy beatrice embraced her companion affectionately you have it dinah i give all sympathy and all good wishes to yourself and jerry may you be very happy as mr and mrs snow oh we shall we shall jerry would make an undertaker happy undertakers generally arewhen business is good oh you are quite too uptodate in your talk beatrice hedge that is strange seeing how i live in a dull country garden like a snail or a cabbage like a wild rose dear at least vivian would say so mr paslow says more than he means responded beatrice blushing redder than the flower mentioned and i dare say jerry does also no dear jerry hasnt sufficient imagination he ought to have being a journalist those are the very people who never imagine anything they find their facts on every hedge is that an unworthy pun on my name certainly not miss hedge said the other with dignity jerry shant find anything on you or in you save a friend else i shall be horribly jealous as to vivian he would murder his future brotherinlaw if he caught him admiring you and i dont want to begin my married life with a corpse naturally you wisely prefer the marriage service to the burial ditto my clever dinah im not clever and i really dont know how to answer your sharp speeches seeing that i am a plain country girl not plainoh not plain jerry doesnt think so im sure its very sweet and flattering of jerry but hes mercifully colourblind and shortsighted i am plain with a pug nose drab hair freckles and teenyweeny eyes you are the reverse beatrice being all that is lovelyquite a gem dont tell my father that i am any sort of jewel remarked beatrice dryly else he will want to sell me at an impossible price dinah laughed but did not reply her somewhat flighty brain could not concentrate itself sufficiently to grasp the subtle conversation of miss hedge so she threw herself back on the mossy stone seat and stared between halfclosed eyelids at the garden this was necessary for the july sunshine blazed down on a mass of colour such as is rarely seen in soberhued england the garden might have been that of eden as delineated by martin or dor from the tropical exuberance of flower and leaf but the buildings scattered about this pleasance were scarcely of the primitive type which adam and his spouse would have inhabited rather were they expressions of a late and luxurious civilisation and again they could scarcely be called buildings in the accepted sense of the word as they had been constructed to run on iron rails at the tail of a locomotive to be plain seven railway carriages with their wheels removed did duty for dwellings and very odd they looked amidst surroundings alien to their original purpose a brixton villa would scarcely have seemed more out of place in the desert of sahara placed in an irregular circle like druidical stones the whitepainted woodwork of these derelicts was streaked fantastically with creepers which spreading even over the arched roofs seemed to bind them to the soil titania and her fastidious elves might have danced on the smooth central sward in the middle of which appeared a chipped sundial upheld by three stone ladies unclothed battered and unashamed at the back of these ingeniously contrived huts bloomed flowers in profusion tall and gaudy hollyhocks vividly scarlet geraniums lilies of holy whiteness and thousandsas it truly seemedof manyhued poppies the wide beds whence these blossoms sprang stretched back to a girdle of lofty trees and were aglow with the brilliant flowers of the nasturtium the trees which shut in this sylvan paradise from the crooked lane rose from a tangled jungle of coarse grasses nettles darnels and oozy weedy plants whose succulence betrayed the presence of a small pond gorgeous with waterlilies paths led through the miniature forest winding in and out and round about so as to make the most of the small space and the whole was bounded by a high brick wall mellow and crumbling but secure for all that seeing it was topped with iron spikes and bits of broken bottles one heavy wooden gate at present bolted and barred admitted the outside world from the lane into this garden of alcinous almost the entire population of the weald knew of this edenthat is by hearsayfor no one entered the jealous gate unless he or she came to do business with the eccentric character who had created the domain jarvis alpenny was a miser hence the presence of disused rail carriages which saved him the trouble and cost of building a house in the campso the place was calledhe had dwelt for fifty years and he was as much a recluse as a man well could be who made his income by usury it seemed odd and was odd that a moneylender should not only dwell in but carry on his peculiarly urban profession in so rural a locality as the weald of sussex nevertheless alpenny did as large a business as though he had occupied some grimy office in the heart of london indeed he really made more money as the very seclusion of the place attracted many needy people who wished to borrow money secretly as the local railway station was but three miles distant these secretive clients came very easily to this rustic temple of mammon any one could stay in brighton without arousing the curiosity of friends and it was surely natural to make excursions into the bowels of the land jarvis alpenny showed a considerable knowledge of human nature in thus isolating his habitation for the more difficult people find it to obtain what they want the more do they value that which they obtain alpenny called beatrice his daughter he would have spoken more correctly had he called her his stepdaughter for that she was and apart from the difference in the name no one would have believed that the wizen yellowfaced sharpfeatured miser was the father of so beautiful a girl she dwelt in the camp like an imprisoned princess and no dragon could have guarded her more fiercely than did durban the sole servant and factotum of the settlement as it might truly be called alpenny himself might have passed for the wicked magician who held the aforesaid princess spellbound in his enchanted domain but as the fairy prince always discovers beauty however closely confined so had beatrice hedge been discovered by vivian paslow he was a poor country gentleman who dwelt in a twomiles distant grange and his only sister confessing to the biblical name of dinah was the decidedly plain girl who had just whispered to beatrice how she had become engaged on the previous day to gerald snow that gerald was the son of a somewhat needy vicar and possessed an objectionable mother made no difference to dinah who was very much in love and very voluble on the subject of course resumed miss paslow after a pause in the conversation i and jerry will be horribly poor vivian has no money and i have less mr snow the vicar has only a fifthrate living and mrs snow is a screw like your father dinah beatrice winced and coloured at these plain words well mr alpenny is a screw and only your stepfather after all as to mrs snowoh my graciouswith expressive pantomimeim glad jerry and i wont have to depend upon her for food whenever the poor famished darling comes to convent grange i simply rush to make him a glass of egg and milk in case he tumbles off his chair that may be emotion caused by the sight of you dinah how nasty how untrue no i did the tumbling when he proposed yesterday he proposed so beautifully that i think he must have been reading up i was in the parlour and jerry came in he looked at me like that and i looked at him in this way and afterwards here dinah who was at the silly boring stage of love told the wonderful story for the fifth time ending with the original remark that for quite three hours after jerry left her jerrys kisses were warm on her maiden lips why didnt you bring mr snow in dinah asked beatrice who had listened most patiently to these rhapsodies oh my dear fanning a red and freckled face with a flimsy handkerchief hes much better in the lane minding the horses you see he will make me blush with his looks and smiles and handsqueezings when he thinks that no one is lookingwhich they usually are finished miss paslow ungrammatically and you came over to tell me that is sweet of you well i did and i didnt dear to be perfectly candid you see jerry and i were going for a ride this morning just to see if we entirely understood how serious marriage is but vivian is such a prig he isnt contradicted beatrice indignantly oh yes he is insisted dinah obstinately he doesnt think it quite the thing that i and jerry should be too much aloneas though we could make love in company he wouldnt like it himself though he did insist on my coming here with him and rode in the middle so as to part jerry and me so poor dear darling jerry is holding the horses in the lane while vivian is doing business with your father in there and miss paslow pointed a gloved finger at a distant railway carriage which was so bolted and barred and locked and clamped that it looked like a small dungeon a grave expression appeared on the face of beatrice do you know what kind of business mr paslow is seeing my father about oh my dear as though your fatherwhich he isntever did any sort of business save lend money to people who havent got any as im sure we paslows havent weve got birth and blood and a genuine grange with a ghost and vivian has good looks even if i havent in spite of jerrys nonsense but there isnt a sixpence between us how mrs lilly manages to feed us i really dont know unless she steals the food our ancestors had the paslow money and spent it the mean pigsjust as though our days werent more expensive than their days with their feathers and lace and port wine then mr paslow is borrowing money remarked beatrice when she could get in a word which was not easy mr paslowhow cold you are beatrice when you know vivian worships the ground you tread on though he doesnt say much borrowing money do you say i expect he is although he never tells me his business so different to jerry who lets me know every time he has a rise in his salary on the morning planet which isnt often i think the editor must be a kind of mrs snow and shewell dinah again expressed herself in pantomime it was quite useless speaking to miss paslow who was only nineteen and a featherhead besides she was too deeply in love to bother about commonplace things beatrice felt nervous to hear that vivian contemplated borrowing money as she knew how dangerous it was for anyone to become entangled in the nets of her stepfather she would have liked to question dinah still further but thinking she would get little information from so lovelorn a damsel it occurred to her that jerry snow should be brought on the scene then the lovers could chatter nonsense and beatrice could think her own thoughts which were greatly concerned with mr alpennys client the means of obliging dinah and gaining time for reflection suggested themselves when a bulky man showed himself at the door of the carriage which served as a kitchen he wore as he invariably did summer and winter a suit of white linen and on this occasion an apron to keep the steaming saucepan he held from soiling his clothes theres durban said beatrice rising and crossing over he can hold the horses and mr snow can come in dinah gave a faint squeal of delight and shook the dust from her shabby ridinghabit while beatrice explained what she wanted durban was of no great height and so extremely stout that he looked even less than he really was his lips were somewhat thick his nose was a trifle flat and his hair had that frizzy kink which betrays black blood even a casual observer could have told that durban had a considerable touch of the tarbrushwas a mulatto or perhaps one remove from a mulatto apparently he possessed the inherent goodhumour of the negro for while listening to his young mistress he smiled expansively and displayed a set of very strong white teeth nor was he young for his hair was touched at the temples with grey and his body was stout with that stoutness which comes late in life from a good digestion and an easy conscience he aped youth however for he carried himself very erect and walkedas he now did to the gatein an alert and springy manner surprising in one who could not be less than fifty years of age it seemed remarkable that so kindly a creature as the halfcaste should serve a sourfaced old usurer but in truth beatrice was his goddess and her presence alone reconciled him to an illpaid post where he was overworked and received more kicks than halfpence he would have died willingly for the girl and showed his devotion even in trifles before returning to dinah whose eyes were fixed in an hypnotic way on the gate through which her beloved would shortly pass beatrice cast an anxious glance at the dungeon which did duty as mr alpennys countinghouse the girl had never been within as jarvis was not agreeable that she should enter his bluebeard chamber for the rest he allowed her considerable freedom and she could indulge in any fancy so long as the fancy was cheap but she was forbidden to set foot in mammons shrine and whether the priest was without or within the door was kept locked it was locked now and vivian paslow was closeted with the usurer doubtless handing over to alpenny the few acres that remained to him for a sum of money at exorbitant interest that the man she loved should be a fly in the parlour of the moneylending spider annoyed beatrice not a little her attention was distracted by another squeal from dinah whose emotions were apt to be noisy jerry oh jerry sighed the damsel clasping her hands and in came mr snow walking swiftly across the grass apparently as frantic for dinah as dinah was for him at the moment neither lunatic took notice of the amused hostess my dinah my own gasped jerry devouring his dulcinea with two ardent eyes the light of which was hidden by pincenez jerry assuredly was no beauty save that his proportions were good and he dressed very smartly he possessed a brown skin which matched well with brown hair and moustache and had about him the freshness of twentytwo years which is so charming and lasts so short a time dinah with her freckles her drab hair and nose tiptilted like the petal of a flowerto mercifully quote tennysonsuited him very well in looks and then love made both of them look quite interesting although not even the alltransforming passion could render them anything but homely beside the engaged damsel beatrice tall slender darklocked and darkeyed looked like a goddess but jerry the devoted had no eye for her while dinah was present had he been paris miss paslow decidedly would have been awarded the apple not having one he stared at dinah and she at him as though they were meeting for the first time beatrice impatient of this oblivion to her presence brought them from heaven to earth i have to congratulate you mr snow she remarked mr snow echoed dinah jumping up as though a wasp had stung her you ought to be ashamed of yourself beatrice havent you known jerry foroh for ever so long for quite three years dear but you see i dont visit at the vicarage and beatrice spoke with some bitterness as jerrys mother had always been unkind to the lonely girl for reasons connected with what mrs snow regarded as her anomalous position jerry coloured and blinked behind his glasses i know what you mean miss hedge he said regretfully but dont worry call me jerry as usual what does it matter what mother thinks ah said dinah quivering with alarm what does she think of us well shejerry hesitated and finally answered the question with a solemn warningi dont think id call at the vicarage for a few days dinah sweetest sheshewell you know mother why does mrs snow object asked beatrice very directly i know oh none better almost shouted dinah no money jerry nodded with an admiring glance at her cleverness no money i thought so and mrs snow wants you to marry a millionairess jerry nodded again as though a millionairess would look at the likes of me said he with the chuckle of a nestling i wouldnt give even the plainest of them a chance cried dinah jealously you could marry anyone with the way you have jerry dear miss hedge laughed gaily show me the way you have jerry dear she mimicked whereat the young lover blushed redder than the poppies oh what rot see here girls both were all pals dinah is something more than a pal since yesterday observed beatrice pointedly oh you know what i mean well then father is pleased and would marry us himself to save fees but motheroh lord will she part us jerry demanded dinah in a small voice bashful as he was mr snow rose to the occasion and taking her in his strong arms kissed her twice thats what i think said he with the air of ajax defying the lightning well be cut off with a shilling by mother but we shall marry all the same and live on the bread and cheese and kisses provided by the morning planet thank you said miss paslow tartly i provide my own kisses no darling heart gurgled the ardent jerry i do that and was about to repeat his conduct when the ceremony was interrupted from the dungeon came the sound of a shrill voice indulging in abusive language a few moments later and the narrow door was flung violently open vivian paslow came out quietly enough and was followed by a bent driedup ape of a man who was purple with fury the contrast between the moneylender and his client was most marked alpenny was the missing link itself and vivian appeared beside him like one of a higher and more human race without taking any notice of the furious old creature he walked towards the startled beatrice and shook her by the hand goodbye miss hedge he said loudly then suddenly sank his voice to a hurried whisper meet me tonight at seven under the witches oak leave my place cried alpenny hobbling up to interrupt this leavetaking you shall not speak to her paslow took his amazed sister on his arm and crossed to the gate while jerry blinking and puzzled followed after beatrice as startled by paslows request as she was by the scene remained where she was and her stepfather chased his three visitors into the lane with opprobrious names but before he could close the gate vivian turned suddenly on the abusive old wretch i came to do you a service said he but you would not listen you came to levy blackmail you asked silence cried paslow with a gesture which reduced alpenny to a stuttering incoherent condition i never threatened you you didyou do you want your property back and vivian with a swift glance at beatrice silenced the man again if i lose my property i lose it said he sternly but the other thing i refuse to lose and remember your life is in danger alpenny spluttered my life youyou scoundrel father father pleaded beatrice approaching anxiously paslow took no notice but still looked at the angry old man with a firm and significant expression remember the black patch said he in a clear loud voice the effect was instantaneous alpenny from purple turned perfectly white from swearing volubility he was reduced to a frightened silence beatrice looked at him in amazement and sostrange to saydid vivian who had spoken the mysterious words for a moment he stared at the shaking palefaced miser who was casting terrified looks over his shoulder and then went out of the gate alpenny stood as though turned into stone until he heard the clatter of the retreating horses then he raised his head and looked wildly round the third time he muttered and beatrice was sufficiently near to notice his abject fear the third time chapter ii the hints of durban beatrice meditated in the parlourcarriage on the scene which had taken place at noon between her stepfather and paslow without vouchsafing the least explanation alpenny had crept back to his den and was there still with the door locked as usual twice and thrice did durban call him to the midday meal but he declined to come out beatrice had therefore eaten alone and was now enjoying a cup of fragrant coffee which durban had lately brought in at the moment he was washing up dishes in the kitchen to the agreeable accompaniment of a negro song which he was whistling vigorously the girl as she wished to be was entirely alone durban could not explain the reason for the quarrel and alpenny would not so beatrice was forced to search her own thoughts for a possible explanation so far she had been unsuccessful the tiny parlour was entirely white in its decorations and looked extremely cool on this hot close day the walls were hung with snowy linen the furniture was upholstered with the same and the carpet the curtains the ornaments even the cushions were all pearly white everything when examined was cheap in quality and price but the spotlessly clean look of the roomif it could be called somade up for the marked want of luxury beatrice herself wore a white muslin with creamhued ribbons therefore no discordant colour broke the arctic tone of the parlour only through the open door could be seen the brilliant tints of the flowers blazing against a background of emerald foliage the snow parlour was the name of this fantastic retreat and the vicars wife took the appellation as a personal insult rather should she have regarded it a compliment of the highest as this maidens bower was infinitely prettier than she was or ever could be since it was impossible to learn anything definite from durban or his master beatrice was striving to possess her soul in peace until seven oclock at that hour she intended to meet vivian by the witches oak and there ask him bluntly what he had said or done to make stepfather so furious having settled this in her own mind she lay back in the deep chair sipping her coffee and allowing her thoughts to wander they took her back over some fiveandtwenty years and into a life barren and uneventful enough beatrice should have been happy for like the oftquoted nation she had no history all her life beatrice had never known a mothers love according to alpenny who supplied the information grudgingly enough mrs hedge with her oneyearold baby had married him only to die within three months after the ceremony then durban had taken charge of the child since the miser for monetary and other reasons would not engage a nurse for two years the old servant had tenderly cared for the orphan and it was a great pain to him when alpenny placed the little beatrice in charge of a brighton lady called miss shallow the spinster was in reduced circumstances and apparently under alpennys thumb as regards money matters she received the child unwillingly enough although she feared to disobey a tyrant who could make things disagreeable for her but later she grew to love her charge and behaved towards the orphan with a devotion scarcely to be expected from a nature soured by misfortune for twenty years beatrice had lived with the old gentlewoman in the poky little hove house and from her had received the education and upbringing of a lady every week durban came over to see his darling and beatrice grew attached to the kind goodnatured old servant who lavished all his affection on her alpenny not anxious to be bothered and having little love for his stepdaughter whom he regarded as an encumbrance visited miss shallow more rarely and even when he did took scant notice of the tall and beautiful girl who had been instructed to call him father this she did unwillingly enough as there was always an antagonism between the cold nature of the one and the warm humanity of the other when miss shallow died the girl was illpleased to take up her abode at the camp in close association with a man she mistrusted and disliked although she could assign no tangible reason for the feeling of abhorrence which possessed her how well beatrice remembered her first sight of the place it was then but a neglected wilderness and she recoiled at the sight of such uncivilised surroundings alpenny slept in one carriage and durban in another two other carriages were used as countinghouse and kitchen while the remaining three were in a rusty ruinous state almost buried in rank grass and coarse vegetation and it was a wet day too when the girl grieving for her dear friend came to view her future home so that everything was dripping with moisture and the outlook was infinitely dreary she could have cried at the idea of living amidst such desolation but her courage was too high and her pride too great to admit of her indulging in such futile lamentation before the coldeyed usurer durban always sympathetic and watchful was quick to see her grief although she tried to conceal it and at once began to suggest interesting work so that she should have the less time to eat her heart out in the wilderness he deftly pointed out how she and he could make the place a paradise and how nature could solace the sorrow of the girl for the loss of her guardian having obtained unwilling consent from alpenny the kindhearted servant painted and repaired the ruined carriages and turning one into a dainty bedroom made the remaining two into a parlour and diningroom in some way sufficient money was extorted from alpenny to admit of cheap furnishing and beatrice more contented came to take up her abode in the strange locality she was now twentyfive and for three years had dwelt in this hermitage the garden afforded her endless delight and occupation durban was the fairy who procured the seeds and who turned up the coarse weedy ground for the planting of the same durban had dug the pond and had conducted the water thereto through cunningly contrived pipes and durban had planned the paradise with her aid the smooth lawn the beds of brilliant blossoms the pond with its magnificent waterlilies the many winding paths and the mossy nooks which afforded cool retreats on hot days were all the work of herself and durban no millionaire could have created a more delightful spot than had these two by their indefatigable industry and eye for the picturesque a portion of the wood beatrice left to nature so that its uncultured look might enhance the civilised appearance of the blossoms and the contrast was really charming but that jarvis alpenny jealously kept the gates closed the camp would have become a show place as everyone in the neighbourhood had heard of its rare floral beauties and not a few young men had heard of another beauty still more rare and desirable it was at this point that beatrice began to think of vivian and his sister who were the only friends she possessed jerry certainly might be included seeing that he was a constant visitor at convent grange and the future husband of dinah paslow but there was no one else in the parish of hurstable with whom she cared to exchange a friendly word she had met mr and mrs snow once or twice but although the vicar was willing enough to speak with so pretty a girl the vicars wife objected she was the tyrant of the place and ruled her husband her son her parishas she called itand her friends with a rod of iron but for this aggressive despotism mr snow might have called at the camp but the vicaress ordered her vicar not to waste his time in visiting a girl who rarely came to church and who occupied what the lady described as a degraded position on the several occasions upon which mrs snow had met the usurers daughter she had behaved disagreeably and had never said a kind word yet mrs snow called herself a religious woman but like many a selfstyled christian she read her own meaning into the gospel commandments and declined to obey them when they clashed with her own snobbish sordid nature beatrice hedge according to mrs snow was beyond the social pale seeing that her father was a moneylender so she paid no attention to her and many of her parishioners followed her example it is to be feared that the lady and her followers quite forgot that one of the apostles was a taxgatherer and a publican beatrice cared very little for this boycotting she was accustomed to a lonely life and indeed preferred it for she found the conversation of mrs snow and her friends extremely wearisomeas it was bound to be from its aggressive egotism and selflaudation she had books to read the garden to tend vivian to think of and sometimes could indulge in a visit to convent grange the home of the paslows dinah she liked vivian she loved and she was certain in her own mind that vivian loved her but of this strange to say she could not be sure by reason of his attitude it was a dubious attitude at times he would pay her marked attentions and frequently seemed to be on the verge of a proposal then he would draw back shun her society and turn as chilly as an arctic winter for no known reason beatrice fancied that it might be her relationship to alpenny that caused this young gentleman of old descent to draw back and then again she felt sure that he was above such a mean spirit moreoverand this might be his excusevivian was but an impoverished country squire and might hesitate to conduct a wife to the halfruinous grange had he only known how gladly beatrice would have shared his bread and cheese when sweetened by kisses surely as she often thought he would have proposed but something kept him silent and seeing how he changed from hot to cold in his wooingif it could be called soshe had too much pride to inveigle him into making a plain statement such as her heart and her ears longed to hear the position was odd and uncomfortable both the man and the woman could not mistake each others feelings yet the man who could have arranged matters on a reasonable basis refused to open his mouth and it was not the womans right to usurp the privilege of the stronger sex by breaking the ice the appointed meeting for this night puzzled her more than ever never before had she met him save at the grange or at the camp and more often than not in the presence of dinah now he asked her to talk with him in a lonely spot and under an illomened tree where it was locally reported the witches of old days had held their satanic revels in answer to his request she had nodded being taken by surprise but now she began to question the propriety of her proposed action she was a modest girl and occupied a difficult position so it was scarcely the thing to meet a young gentleman on a romantic summer night and under a romantic tree but her curiosity was extremely strong she wished to know why alpenny had grown so white and had appeared so terrified when paslow pronounced four mysterious words what was the black patch and why did it produce such an effect on the usurer who as a rule feared nothing but the loss of money vivian could explain since he had brought about the misers terror therefore did beatrice make up her mind to keep the appointment but she smiled to think what mrs snow would say did that severe lady know of the bold step she was taking some more coffee said a voice at the door and she looked up to see the smiling servant no thank you durban she replied absently and setting down the empty cup then seeing that he was about to withdraw she recalled her scattered thoughts and made him pause with a question what is the black patch asked beatrice facing round to observe the mans dark face durban spread out his hands in quite a foreign way and banished all emotion from his dark features i do not know my father appeared to be startled by the words he did missy he did do you know the reason i am not in your fathers confidence missy that is strange seeing that you have been with him for over twenty years durban for twentyfour years missy you never told me the exact time before durban the man shrugged his shoulders you never asked me missy that is true beatrice leaned back again in her chair and remembered that she and durban had talked but little about the past i should like to know about my mother she said after a pause there is nothing to know missy she married masterand died i was then about a year old yes missy i am twentyfive now and you have been with mr alpenny for fourandtwenty years so it seems durban that you first came here with my mother and remained in mr alpennys service it is so missy i remained for your sake then you were my mothers servant durbans face might have been that of a wax doll for all the expression it showed i was missy and you know all about my parents what there is to know missy which is very little you have never asked about them before why do you question me now beatrice mused i hardly know she confessed i suppose mr paslows remark about the black patch whatever that may be made me ask now mr alpenny was afraid when mr paslow spoke so you said before missy and as i replied i do not know the reason at all i am simply a servant and my friend said beatrice extending her hand durbans face lighted up with passionate devotion and his dark eyes blazed with light falling on one knee he imprinted a reverential kiss on the small white hand i love you with all my heart missy i love you as a fatheras a mother as the great god himself do i love you my dear mistress then you will help me you have but to ask and i obey said durban simply and rose to his feet with a light bound strangely out of keeping with his stout person what would you have the key of the little gate durban stared for beatrice was making a very serious request there were two gates to the camp a large one opening on to the lane and a smaller one hidden in a corner of the wall through which admittance could be gained to a narrow woodland path which arrived after devious windings at the crossroads alpennys clients usually entered from the lane but were always dismissed through theso to speaksecret path the miser kept the key of this small gate and indeed of the larger one also so that if any one had to go out or come in alpenny had to be applied to it was therefore no easy matter for durban to oblige his young mistress why do you want the key missy beatrice did not answer at once it suddenly crossed her mind that if she acknowledged bow she intended to question vivian about the black patch that durban would make some difficulty over obtaining the key after his admission that he knew nothing she had no reason to think that he would raise any objections but the thought came uninvited and she obeyed it wishing to tell the truth and yet keep durban in the dark as to her real errand she determined to go to the grange and see dinah then she could meet vivian there and could question him at her leisure miss paslow is engaged she said suddenly durban nodded and grinned to young mr snow he replied i saw well i want to go to convent grange this evening at six to see miss paslow and talk over the matter durban shook his head master is angry with mr paslow for some reason and will not let you go besides at night durban shook his head again very sagely thats just it said beatrice rising i know that my father would object therefore i wish to slip out of the small gate secretly and return about nine he will never know he will never know certainly missy but the way to convent grange is dark and lonely not on a summer night the moon is out and there will be plenty of people on the road would you like me to come missy if you will assented beatrice carelessly she would rather have gone alone but since the grange was now her goal and not the witch oak durbans presence did not matter but there is no need oh i think so there will be a storm tonight and then it will grow dark besides people may not be about and the path to convent grange is lonely i shall come also very good and the key i can get it master keeps it hanging up in the countinghouse but i can get it durban grinned and nodded and then was about to go away when he suddenly stopped and his dark face grew serious one thing tell me missy and do not be angry i could never be angry with you durban what is it do you love mr paslow missy yes replied beatrice without hesitation she knew that whatever she said to her faithful servant would never be repeated by him and does he love you this time she coloured i think soi am not sure was her faint reply as she cast down her eyes durban came a step nearer does he love any one else he asked beatrice raised her head sharply and sent a flaming glance towards the questioner what do you mean if he doesnt love you does he love any one else persisted durban beatrice twisted her hands i am sure he loves me and no one else she cried passionately i can see it in his eyesi can read it in his face yet heyet heoh she broke off unwilling to remark upon paslows strange wavering wooing to a servant even though that servant was one who would readily have died to save her a moments pain do you think he loves any one else she asked evasively no durbans eyes were fixed on her face i have no reason to think so if he loves my missy he can never be fond of other women but if he plays you false missy durbans face grew grim and darker than everyou have a dog who can bite no no said beatrice alarmedsince durban could make himself unpleasant on occasions and from the look on his face she feared for vivianhe loves me and me only i am sure of that the mans face cleared then we will go to the grange this evening and you can see him but if my stepfather hates him durban he will place some obstacle in the way should mr paslow ask me to marry him if he asks you to be his wife you shall marry him missy but my father he will say nothing are you sure when mr alpenny takes an idea into his head he will take no idea of stopping your marriage missy you shall be happy i promised him that promised who your real father said durban and departed without another word it would seem as though he were unwilling to be questioned beatrice began to think that there was some mystery connected with her parents which durban knew but which durban would not reveal chapter iii mr alpennys proposal shortly after durban resumed work beatrice received a surprise which rather pleased her this was none other than an invitation to enter the countinghouse she had always desired to do so being filled with that curiosity which led her grandmother eve to eat apples but hitherto alpenny had declined to admit her now the door of the dungeon was open and alpenny standing before it beckoned that she should come in in the bright sunshine he looked more decrepit and wicked than usual he could not have been less than eighty years of age and his spare figure was bowed with time that same time had also robbed him of every hair on his head and had even taken away eyebrows and eyelashes as the old man was clean shaven his gleaming head and hairless yellow wrinkled face looked rather repulsive nor did his dress tend to improve his appearance for it was a shepherdsplaid suit cut in the style of the early fifties when he had been young and presumably something of a dandy in spite of the antiquity of the clothes there was a suggestion of juvenility about them which matched badly with his methuselah looks like an aged ghost he beckoned in the sunshine and the whitepainted erection behind him assumed in the eyes of beatrice the look of a tomb wondering that she should be invited into mammons shrine the girl walked across the lawn in her white dress with her beautiful face shaded by a coarse straw hat she appeared the embodiment of youth and grace contrasting markedly with the senile old villain who croaked out his orders come in said alpenny testily and with the screech of a peacock as he pointed to the open door i wish to speak to you seriously beatrice ever sparing of words with crabbed age nodded and entered the countinghouse glancing comprehensively around to take in her surroundingsas a woman always doeswith a single look the space naturally was limited all the windows had been boarded up save one which opened immediately over a rather large desk of mahogany which was piled with papers the walls were hung with faded red rep in one corner stood a large greenpainted safe in another stood a pile of tin boxes which reached quite to the roof a paraffin lamp dangled by brass chains from a somewhat smoky ceiling and at the far end of the carriage in front of a dilapidated bookcase was an oil stove crudely set on a sheet of galvanised tin a ragged carpet disorderly in colour and much faded covered the floor and there were only two chairs one before the desk and another beside it probably for the use of clients the one window was barred but not covered with any curtain the others were sheathed in iron and barred strongly outside from without as has been said the carriage looked like a dungeon within its appearance suggested the home of a recluse who cared very little for the pomps and vanities of civilisation this barren room represented very fairly the bare mind of the miser who cared more for money itself than for what money could do motioning beatrice to the clients chair alpenny seated himself before his desk and from habit presumably began to fiddle with some legal looking documents apparently he had got over the shock caused by vivians strange speech and looked much the same as he always didcold unsympathetic and cunning as an old monkey in the dungeon beatrice bloomed like a rose while alpenny resembled a cold clammy toad uncanny and repulsive he began to speak almost immediately and his first words amazed the girl they were the last she expected to hear from the lips of one who had always treated her with indifference and almost with hostility have you ever thought of marriage asked the usurer examining his visitors face with two small sharp eyes chilly and grey marriage she gasped doubting if she had heard aright yes marriage young girls think of such things do they not wishing to find out what he meant beatrice fenced i have no chance of marrying father she observed regaining her composure i grant that unless you have fallen in love with jerry snow and i credit you with too much sense to think you could love a fool mr snow is to marry miss paslow announced beatrice coldly and kept her eyes on the wizen face before her oh sneered alpenny hunger wedding thirst and how do they intend to live may i ask that is their business and not ours paslow hasnt a penny to give to his giggling sister and very soon he wont have a roof over his head what do you mean by that father mean the usurer stretched out a skinny hand which resembled the claw of a bird of preys as he looked like why i mean my girl that i hold vivian paslow there and he tapped his palm still i dont understand said beatrice her blood running cold at the malignant look on his face there is no need you should rejoined her stepfather coolly he is not for you and you are not for him do you understand that it was unwise for alpenny to meddle with a maidens fancies for the girls outraged womanhood revolted i understand that you mean to be impertinent mr alpenny she said with a flaming colour mr alpenny why not father as usual because you are no father of mine and i thank god for it he gave her a vindictive look and rubbed his hands together with the croak of a hungry raven i brought you up i educated you i fed you i housed you i beatrice waved her hand impatiently i know well what you have done said she as little as you could heres gratitude and common sense mr alpenny i know nothing save that you married my mother and promised to look after me when she died i promised nothing snapped alpenny durban says that you did durban is what he always was a fool i promised nothing to your motherat all events concerning you why should i you are not my own flesh and blood anyone can tell that said beatrice disdainfully no impertinence miss i have fed and clothed you and educated you and housed you you said that before all at my own expense went on the miser imperturbably and out of the kindness of my heart this is the return you make by giving me sauce but you had better take care he went on menacingly and shaking a lean yellow finger i am not to be trifled with neither am i retorted beatrice who felt in a fighting humour i am sorry to have been a burden to you and for what you have done i thank you but i am weary of stopping here give me a small sum of money and let me go money screeched the miser touched on his tenderest point money to waste money to keep me in london until i can obtain a situation as a governess or as a companion come father she went on coaxingly you must be sick of seeing me about here and i am so tired of this life its the wickedness in your blood beatrice just like your motheroh dear me how very like your mother leave my mothers character alone said beatrice impatiently she is dead and buried she isin hurstable churchyard under a beautiful tomb i got secondhand at a bargain see how i loved her you never loved anyone in your life mr alpenny said the girl freezing again alpennys brow grew black and he looked at her with glittering eyes you are mistaken child he said quietly i have loved and lost my mother perhaps said he enigmatically and passed his hand over his bald head in a weary manner then he burst out unexpectedly i wish i had never set eyes on your mother i wish she had been dead and buried before she crossed my path she is dead so yes she is dead stone dead he snarled rising much agitated and dont think youll ever see her again if i he was about to speak further then seeing from the wondering look on the girls face that he was saying more than was wise he halted stuttered and sat down again abruptly moving the papers with trembling hands leave the past alone he said hoarsely i cant speak of it calmly it is the past that makes the future he continued drumming feverishly on the table with his fingers the past that makes the future beatrice wondered what he meant and noticed how weary and worn and nervous he seemed the man did not love her he had not treated her as he should have done and between them there was no feeling in common yet he was old and after all had sheltered her in his own grudging way so beatrice laid a light hand on his arm mr alpenny you are not young eighty and more my dear the term startled her and she began to think he must indeed be near the borders of the next world when he spoke so gently well then why dont you go to church and feed the hungry and clothe the naked remember you have to answer for what you have done some day soon alpenny rose vehemently and flung off her arm i dont ask you to teach me my duty girl he said savagely what i have done is done and was rightly done everyone betrayed me and money is the only thing that did not money is power money is love money is joy and life and hope and comfort to me no i keep my money until i die and then he cast a nervous look round only to burst out again with greater vehemence why do you talk of death i am strong i eat heartily i drink little i sleep well i shall live for many a long day yet and even if i die he snapped dont expect to benefit by my death you dont get that and he snapped his fingers within an inch of her nose i dont want your money said beatrice quietly durban will look after me still you might let me have enough to keep me while i try to find work i wont but if you die ill be a pauper without a sixpence said alpenny exultingly have i no relatives who will help me no your mother came from i know not where and where she has gone i dont exactly know she married me and then died i have kept you yesyes but if my mother was poor and came from where you knew not why did you marry her my kind heart you havent got one its in your moneychest it might be in a womans keeping which is a much worse place beatrice grew weary of this futile conversation and rose you asked me to see you she said with a fatigued air what is it you have to say oh yes he seemed to arouse himself from a fit of musing yes i have found a husband for you beatrice started he announced this startling fact as though it were the most natural thing in the world youhavefoundahusbandforme she drawled slowly yes you wont have my money and i may die he cast a look over his shoulder nervously i dont want to but i may one never knows do they you will be poor so i think it best to get you married and settled in life thank you she returned icily it is very good of you to take so much trouble and my future husband ruck major ruckmajor simon ruck a retired army officer and a handsome man of fifty very well preserved and with a fine fortune how alluring and suppose i refuse you cantyou darent he grasped her arm entreatingly dont be a fool my dear ruck is handsome and well off he is coming down on saturday to see you this is wednesday so you will have time to think over the matter you must marry himyou must i tell you and he shook her arm in his agitation beatrice removed her arm in a flaming temper must i indeed said she flashing up into righteous anger then i wont beatrice i wont i have never seen the man and i dont wish to see him you have no right to make any arrangements about my marriage without consulting me you are neither kith nor kin of mine and i am of age i deny your right to arrange my future do you wish to be left to starve i shall not starve but i would rather do so than marry a man of fifty whom i have never set eyes on if you dont marry ruck youll be a pauper sooner than you expect my girl marry him for my sake no you have done as little as you could for me you have always hated me i decline alpenny rose in his turnbeatrice had already risen to her feetand faced her in a black fury the more venomous for being quiet you shall marry him i shall not they faced one another both angry both determined both bent upon gaining the victory but if alpenny had an iron will beatrice had youth and outraged womanhood on her side and in the end his small cruel eyes fell before her flashing orbs i want you to marry ruckreally i do he whimpered piteously why because he swallowed something and told what was evidently a lie so glibly did it slip out because i should be sorry to leave you to starve i shall not starve i am well educated and can teach at the worst i can become a nursery governess or be a companion better marry major ruck no it is foolish of you to ask me if you dont marry him i shall be ruined i shall be killed nohe broke off suddenlyi dont mean that who would kill a poor old man such as i am buthis voice leaped an octaveyou must marry the husband i chose for you i chose for myself ahthe miser was shaking with rageits vivian paslow no deniali can see he is the man a penniless scoundrel who is at my mercy dont dare to speak of him like that flamed out beatrice as to marrying himhe has not asked me yet and never will if i can stop him i know how to do sooh yes i do he will not dare to go against me i can ruin him he at this moment there came a sharp rap at the door which made alpennys face turn white and his lips turn blue who is there a telegram said the voice of durban and alpenny with a smothered ejaculation of pleasure went to open the door as he did so beatrice noticed on the wall near the desk two keys one large and one small the little one she knew to be the key of the postern gate and without hesitation she took it down and slipped it into her pocket as alpenny turned round with the telegram and no very pleasant expression of countenance she felt that she would at least be able to see vivian paslow on that evening without arousing the suspicions of her stepfather it was unlikely that any one would come that night and he would not miss the key which she could get durban to replace the next day as this thought flashed into her mind she saw the face of the servant at the door he looked puzzled but probably that was because he beheld her in the sanctum of his master hitherto forbidden ground both to him and to her the next moment alpenny had closed the door and durban went away this telegram is from major ruck said alpenny he is coming down on saturday so be ready to receive him i shall leave the place if he comes you wont youll wait and see himand accept him also if you dont ill make things hot for vivian paslow this was as beatrice conceived a game of bluff so she replied boldly enough mr paslow is able to look after himself i decline to speak to major ruck whosoever he may be or even to see him saturday saturday said alpenny coldly and opened the door now you can go if you leave the camp or if you refuse ruck as your husband vivian paslow will reap the reward of his crimes and he pushed her out locking the door after her with a sharp click crimes beatrice stood in the sunlight stunned and dazed what did alpenny mean what crimes could the man she loved have committed almost before she could collect her thoughts she felt a light touch on her shoulder and turned to behold durban wasnt master in his countinghouse all this afternoon asked the servant you should know missy as the parlour is opposite yes he was she replied with an effort i never saw him come out durban wrinkled his dark brows then how did he send the telegram to which he has just now had an answer he demanded how do you know that this wire is an answer durban the reply was prepaid missy how did master do it beatrice was equally puzzled alpenny had not been away from the camp all the afternoon yet had contrived to send a telegram and prepay the reply chapter iv seen in the lightning it was truly a mystery so far as beatrice knew there were but two ways of getting out of the campby the large gate and the smaller one yet she in the parlourcarriage facing alpennys countinghouse had not seen him emerge nor had durban busy in the kitchen the door of which commanded a view of the postern beheld his master depart the telegraph office was at the railway station three miles away and there was no one in the camp save durban and his young mistress to send with a wire yet the wire had been sent and the reply had been received beatrice ventured an explanation perhaps my father sent the telegram yesterday no missy i took none and master did not leave the place no telegram has been sent from here for the last month is there a third way out durban not that i know of missy and yet what durban would have said in the way of explanation it is impossible to say for at this moment the querulous voice of alpenny was heard calling snappishly durban hastened to the door of the countinghouse and it was opened so that he could speak with his master but he was not admitted within beatrice retired to her bedroomcarriage which was near the parlour and had only been there a few minutes when durban came over with a crestfallen face we must put off going to convent grange missy said he rapidly master wishes me to go to town he is writing a letter which i have to take up at once i shall catch the six train very well durban we can wait the servant looked and hesitated but before he could speak again mr alpenny interrupted appearing at the door of his dungeon he waved a letter come at once he cried dont lose time what do you mean by chattering there durban gave beatrice a significant look and hastened away in another ten minutes he had left the camp by the great gates and was on his way to the railway station alpenny saw him off the premises and then crossed over to his stepdaughter what were you saying to durban he asked suspiciously you mean what was durban saying to me she replied quietly you can surely guess he was saying that you wished him to go to town there was no need of him to tell you my business grumbled the miser looking illtempered what are you doing this evening had he any suspicions of her intention beatrice thought not the question was put in a snarling way and simplyas she judgedto show his authority i intend to read she answered simply and perhaps i shall take a walkin the grounds she ostensibly meant better not warned the usurer looking up clouds are gathering i am sure there will be a storm very well was her indifferent reply although she wondered if he had missed the key of the smaller gate will i come and say goodnight to you as usual at ten alpenny nodded in an absent way and walked into his countinghouse with his hands behind him and his form more bent than usual beatrice watched him cross the smooth sward and then went to sit down in the parlour and meditate in some way which she could scarcely define she scented a mystery the episode of the telegram the hasty departure of durban the proposal of marriage all these things hintedas she thoughtat schemes against her peace of mind and then again the words of vivian paslow those were indeed mysterious and she was anxious to know what they meant finally the hint that alpenny had given as to vivian having committed crimes alarmed the girl she felt that alpenny was trying to inveigle paslow into some trap and from his words it was plain that he would stop at nothing to prevent the young man declaring the passion he felt for the girl also from another hint it would seem that the miser heldas indeed he had plainly statedvivian in the hollow of his hand these thoughts made beatrice very uncomfortable the more so as never before had any mystery come into her life hitherto it had been serene and uneventful one day being exactly the same as another but with the visit of vivian on that afternoon everything had changed for since he had heard those mysterious words alpenny had not been himself in some queer way he had forwarded a telegram and in a hurry he had sent durban to london which he had not done for months past undoubtedly something sinister was in the wind and beatrice shivered with a vague apprehension of dread it certainly might have been the weather which made her feel so ill at ease for the hot day had ended in an even hotter evening the air was close the sky was clouded and there was not a breath of wind to stir the leaves of the surrounding trees ever and again a flicker of lightning would leap across the skysummer lightning which portended storm and rain beatrice trying to breathe freely in the suffocating air wished that the storm would come to clear the atmosphere there was electricity in the dry air and she felt as uncomfortable as a cat which has its hair smoothed the wrong way on some such night as this must lady macbeth have received duncan and nature hinted at a repetition of the storm which took place when the guileless king was done to death in the shambles beatrice could not rest within doors she put on a hat and draped a long black cloak over her white dress attired thus she walked up and down on the dry grass trying to compose herself around gloomed the girdle of trees without even a leaf stirring the colours of the flowers were vague in the hot twilight and the white forms of the seven railway carriages stood here and there like tombs in a cemetery as she lingered near the sundial she cast a look upward at the downs which rose vast and shadowy to be defined clearly against a clear sky the foot of them was but a stonethrow away from the camp and almost it was in her mind to climb their heights in order to get a breath of fresh air here in the hollow embosomed in woods she felt stifling but up there surely a sweet fresh wind must be blowing full of moisture from the channel then the thought of a possible walk recalled her to a remembrance of her appointment she intended to keep it even though durban had gone away the key was in her pocket and she could slip out of the small gate for an hour and get back again without alpenny being any the wiser already a light gleamed from the solitary window of the dungeon as it had gleamed ever since she could remember when the darkness came on behind the discoloured blind the miser laboured at his books and counted his gains so far as she knew all his money was banked and invested and he kept no gold in the dungeon perhaps he feared robbery and it really was remarkable that seeing he was supposed to be a millionaire the camp had never been marked by the fraternity of london thieves a visit there would surely have proved successful if all the tales of alpenny were to be believed but perhaps the thieves had heard as the miser had vaguely hinted of his cleverness in keeping no specie in his retirement but be this as it may alpenny all these years had never hinted at a possible burglary after a glance at the downs and at alpennys lighted window behind which he would sit until midnight beatrice entered one of the winding paths in the little wood and took her way to the gate the large gates were locked and alpenny alone possessed the key but she could open the smaller gate and now proceeded to do so the lock was freshly oiled and the postern swung open noiselessly standing on the threshold within the camp beatrice paused for a moment some feeling seemed to hold her back into her mind flashed the sudden thought that if she went out she would leave behind her not only the camp but the old serene life it was like crossing the rubicon but with an impatient ejaculation at her own weakness she shook herself and passed out leaving the gate locked behind her then she stole through the glimmering wood fully committed to the adventure as she did so a distant growl of thunder seemed to her agitated mind like the voice of the angel thrusting her out of paradise truly she had never before felt in this strange mood by a narrow path she gained the lane and here the light was a trifle stronger although it was rapidly dying out of the hot close sky it was close upon halfpast six so beatrice knew that if she walked quickly she could arrive at the witches oak almost at the time appointed owing to the late hour of starting she had quite given up the idea of going to convent grange which was two miles away she would meet vivian as she now arranged in her own mind at the witches oak and would ask for an explanation when he gave it she could return rapidly to the camp escorted by him then slipping in she would be able to say goodnight to alpenny at ten oclock and go to bed for a moment she wondered if durban would return that night or stop in town if he came back he would be angry if he found that she had left the camp unattended and in the twilight but she would be in bed even if durban did return and then she could decide whether to tell him or not also the chances were that as he had gone to town so late he would remain there till the next morning to execute alpennys business whatever that might be passing along the lane beatrice had to run by the great gates which were locked securely in the twilight she thought she saw a small figure crouching before them but in the semidarkness could not be certain however the sight of the figure if figure it was troubled her very little probably it was that of some tramp as there were many in the weald of sussex but if the tramp was waiting at the gates in the hope of getting a crust or penny from the miser he would be woefully disappointed beatrice passing swiftly hardly gave the matter a thought but sped rapidly along under the deep shadows of the trees and along the white dusty lane between the wilted hedges dry with summer heat a quarter of a mile brought her to a side path and down this she went calmly congratulating herself that she had met neither tramp nor neighbour on the road the path wound deviously through ancient trees and at length emerged into a rather large glade in the centre of which was a pond green with duckweed over this spread the branches of the witches oak an old old tree which must have been growing in the time of the druids and which had probably played its part in their mystic rites a fitful moonlight gleamed occasionally on this as the planet showed her haggard face and under the tree beatrice saw a tall figure waiting patiently she crossed the glade in the moonlight but the clouds swept over the face of the orb as beatrice paused under the oak then again came a growl of distant thunder as if in warning i knew you would come said paslow stepping forward and for the moment it seemed as though he would take her in his arms in the darkness the cheeks of the girl flushed and she stepped lightly aside evading his clasp her heart told her to throw herself into those strong arms and be protected for ever from the coming storms of life but a sense of modesty prevented such speedy surrender when she spoke her voice was steady and cool there was no time to be lost and she began hurriedly in the middle of things yes i have come she said quickly because i want to know the meaning of the words you used to my father today i dont know what they mean confessed paslow calmly then why did you use them i received a hint to do so from whom i cant tell you that miss hedgebeatricei asked you to meet me here so that no one should interrupt our conversation if you came to the grange dinah would have prevented my speaking and now that mr alpenny is angry with me i cannot come to the camp you must forgive me for having asked you to meet me here at this hour and in so illomened a spot but i have something to say to you which must be said at once what is it her heart beat rapidly as she spoke for although she could not see his face in the darkness she guessed from the tones of his voice that he was about to say all which she desired to hear cant you guess he came a step nearer and spoke softly beatrice feeling strange as was natural considering the circumstance laughed in an embarrassed manner how can i guess because you must have seen what i meant in my eyes beatrice i want you to be my wife her heart beat loudly as though it would give vivian its answer without speech i dont understand she said abruptly surely you must have seen oh yes i saw she interrupted rapidly i saw that you loved me i also saw that you held back from asking me to marry you i had a reason he said after a pause that reason is now removed and i can ask you as i do with all my heart and soul to be my wife dearest i love you can i believe that i swear it he breathed passionately but the reason paslow hesitated it was connected with money he confessed at last your fatheror rather your stepfatherhad a mortgage on nearly the whole of my property i have lately inherited a small sum of money and went today to ask mr alpenny to arrange about paying off part of the mortgage he accused me of wishing to rob him but why when you desired to pay off the mortgage i cant say i thinkvivian hesitatedi think that he wishes to get possession of the grange and his reason i cant tell you that but the moment i offered to pay the money he burst out into a rage and said that i wanted to rob him then i warned him as to something i had heard against him in london what is that she asked in startled tones i dare not tell you just now is it connected with the black patch not that i know of and what do you know of the black patch i know nothing i heard it mentionedwhatever it isfor the first time today and by you the effect on mr alpenny was so strange that i wish to know what the black patch means i do not know myself said vivian earnestly listen my dear girl the other night i found on my desk a scrap of paper and on it was writtenor rather i should say printed for the person who wrote printed the lettersif alpenny objects say remember the black patch beatrice listened bewildered what does that mean i cant say but when driven into a corner by his language i used the very words on the scrap of paper you saw their effect it is strange said beatrice then remembering what the miser had said to her she grasped her lovers arm vivian he told me that you had committed crimes what a liar i have committed no crimes save that i have indulged in the usual follies of a young man whose parents died before they could guide him properly what does he mean i cant say but i think he wished to make me mistrust you i can guess that for i asked him today if i could marry you he refused and raged worse than ever it was then that he turned me out of his countinghouse andwell you saw what happened i suppose he wants you to marry someone else yes he told me so today major ruck who is he demanded paslow in a tone of anger i dont know major simon ruck a retired army officer with a fine fortune and who is fifty years of age and here there came a flash of blue lightning and then a loud crash of thunder afterwards the strong wind hurtled towards them bearing on its wings the drenching rain vivian was startled and caught beatrice to his breast in the darkness darling will you marry me he asked although she was scarcely mistress yet of her emotions in the storm and gloom before she could answer the pentup feelings of the day found relief in a burst of hysterical tears pulling out her handkerchief she pressed it to her eyes and at the moment felt the key entangled in the handkerchief fall out oh she gasped the key it has fallen out of my pocket ill find it and paslow dropped on to the grass now wet while the rain came down in torrents i have it he said wondering at this queer disconnected wooing and rose with the key in his hand my dear let us stand further under the tree and then we can talk no no beatrice was quite unstrung by this time i must go home at once it is late and my fathermyah who is that flash after flash of lightning blue and vivid illuminated the haunted tree as though once again the witches were holding their demoniac revels a short distance away stood a small man neither of the lovers could see his features in the fitful illumination vivian with a cry of anger ran straight towards the figure and it disappeared tales of the spectres said to haunt the tree occurred to the mind of beatrice and unstrung and not mistress of herself she left the oak and hurried across the glade the lightning was flashing incessantly and the thunder roared like artillery while the steady rain spattered through the trees tops trying to find the path which led to the lane beatrice ran on she fancied she heard the voice of paslow shouting but again pealed the thunder to drown what he said losing her headand small wonder so terrific was the stormbeatrice scrambled on through many paths and finally when there came an unusually vivid flash she sank with a cry of terror under some bushes and fainted on the streaming ground how long she remained unconscious she did not know when she did regain her senses a mighty wind was blowing through the woods bending the stoutest trees like saplings through the swaying boughs the girl could see the flicker of lightning racing across the sky and every now and then boomed sullen thunder loud and menacing with an effort she gathered her aching limbs together and staggered forward blindly through the wood she could not tell what the hour was or guess where she was going but by some miracle she managed to arrive at the lane even then she did not recognise where she was but ran blindly along in the hope of finding the camp there was no sign of vivian or of the man who had been watching them under the witches oak all around was the roaring darkness laced with vivid lightning and alive with furious rain and wind like a demented creature beatrice sped along in mud and slush kilting up her petticoats to run the faster and ever overhead screamed the storm while the wild winds tore and buffeted the tormented trees she bitterly regretted having kept the appointment she had learned little save that vivian loved her which she had known long ago and now she had lost the key paslow possessed it since he had not given it back to her before he ran after the watcher so how was she to reenter the jealouslyguarded camp alpenny would know that she had been out that she had met vivian and there would be great trouble these thoughts made the head of the girl reel as she ran along blind and breathless then came several flashes and before her unexpectedly she beheld the gate of the camp it was wide open but without thinking she ran in at once only too thankful to arrive home as she passed the posts she sprang unseeingly into the arms of a man with a cry she tore herself away and stared in a flash of lightning she saw that he was tall lean clothed in black andthe sight made her shriekover his left eye he wore a black patch then the darkness closed down and she heard him brush past into gloom running swiftly out of the gate which he closed after him she heard the click and in some way managed to scramble across the wet lawn to her own bedroomcarriage as she dropped on the threshold she saw that the light in the countinghouse was extinguished what did it all mean she asked herself and who was the tall man with the dark patch over his left eye chapter v mrs snows discovery after a few minutes lying on the threshold of her carriagebedroom with the rain beating upon her soaking dress beatrice rose with an effort and opened the door it was never locked as no one would be likely to enter the matches and a candle were on a table by the bed where she had left them and soon she had a light beside the candlestick lay a folded piece of paper and opening this she read a line or two in alpennys crabbed handwriting i find you have gone out i am going also and will not be back for three days durban will return tomorrow and look after you there was no signature but of course she recognised the calligraphy easily as it had a distinctive character of its own the contents of the note rather surprised the girl in the first place alpenny made no remark as to her having taken the key and in the second it was strange that he should depart thus unexpectedly leaving the camp absolutely unguarded even by a dog beatrice knew well enough that her stepfather frequently went away on business and at times very unexpectedly but she had never known him to take so hasty a departure however after a glance at the note she determined to go to bed being too weary to think of anything too weary even to reflect that she was alone in that lonely camp and that the gate had been open when she arrived a memory of the stranger with the black patch over his eye certainly made her lock her door and see that the windows were well fastened but when she had accomplished this for her own safety she had only sufficient strength remaining to throw off her wet clothes and get into bed and there she speedily fell into a deep and dreamless sleep while the storm raged louder than ever her last thought was a hope that vivian had reached the grange in safety when she awoke next morning it was ten as the tiny cuckoo clock on the wall told her and the sun was streaming in through the chinks of the windowshutters she still felt weary and her limbs ached a trifle but for a moment or so she could not think how she came to be so tired then the memory of all that had happened rushed in on her brain and she sprang from bed to open the door and windows in a minute the sunlight was pouring cheerfully into the bedroom and beatrice was rapidly dressed feeling hungry yet at the same time anxious and much need she had to be her stepfather knew that she had gone out and must have known that she had taken the key of the smaller gate for which he would immediately look he would certainly make himself most unpleasant and she anticipated a bad quarter of an hour when he returned also vivian might have got into trouble with the man who had watched them meet under the witches oak then again the gate of the camp had been open when she returned and a stranger had left the place hurriedly all these things were very strange and disquieting and beatrice ardently wished that durban was back so that she might speak to him and be reassured but it was probable that vivian would come to the camp that morning in order to learn if she had arrived safely then they could renew the interrupted conversation and come to an understanding the interview with paslow perplexed beatrice when she thought over it vivians talk had been disjointed and he had given her no satisfaction answering her questions in a vague manner that he should have proposed at so awkward a moment and in so awkward a manner also puzzled the girl from what she could recall of the scrappy conversation it had been like one in a nightmare and indeed the whole episode was far removed from the commonplace the meetingplace under the illomened treethe few hurried wordsthe rush of vivian towards the strange manand then her own headlong flight through the damp dark woodsthese thoughts made her very uncomfortable it was more like romance than real life and beatrice did not care for such sensational events when dressed she said her prayers and felt more composed then stepped out into the broad bright sunshine after the storm everything looked fresh and vividly green the world had a newly washed look and the air seemed to be filled with vital energy as though it were indeed the breath of life but beatrice soon saw evidence of the storms fury huge boughs were stripped from the trees round the camp the flowerbeds presented a draggled appearance and the sundial had been blown down for the rest everything looked the same at usual when she glanced at the dungeon she saw that the door was closed and the blind was down although this latter was a trifle askew beatrice could have gratified her curiosity by looking into the countinghouse through the twisted blind but she had seen sufficient of it on the previous day and felt more inclined to eat than to waste her time peering into alpennys sanctum with the idea of getting breakfast she went to the kitchen and speedily had the fire alight durban never locked the door of the kitchen carriage so there was no difficulty in entering beatrice found plenty of food in the cupboard and made herself some strong coffee and an appetising dish of bacon and eggs it was too much trouble to take the food to the diningcar so she spread a cloth on the kitchen table and made a very good meal when she had finished she washed the dishes and put them away then went out again feeling much better and all signs of fatigue disappeared from her young and elastic frame but for the evidences of the storm she would have thought the past events of the night those of a dream to pass the time beatrice swept out her bedroom and made the bed then attended to the garden every now and then she would glance at the gate expecting that vivian paslow would enter but by twelve oclock he had not come and she felt very disappointed then she began to feel alarmed what if he had met the man and had fought with him what if the man had hurt him she asked herself these questions and half determined to go over to convent grange in order to get answers but she did not wish to leave the camp until durban came back since alpenny was absent still the desire to hear and see paslow was overwhelming and she was just about to yield to her curiosity and leave the camp to look after itself when she heard the rapid vibration of the electric bell and knew that someone was at the gate in a moment she was flying across the lawn her heart beating and her colour rising vivian vivian sang her heart and she threw open the gate which was still unlocked to her surprise she beheld outside no less a person than mrs snow the vicars wife looked more amiable than usual and less grim she was not very tall and was dressed in dull slatecoloured garments very ugly and inexpensive and likely to wear well a straw hat trimmed with ribbons of the same sad hue surmounted her sharp thin face which was that of the miser species hard and sour mrs snow had never been a pretty woman and never an agreeable one and as she faced beatrice with what was meant to be a smile she looked like a disappointed spinster yet she was the wife of the vicar and the mother of jerry so she certainly should have looked more pleasant but mrs snow was a woman who took life hard and made it hard for others also if she could not enjoy herself she was determined that no one else should whatever sins the vicar had committedif anythe poor man was bitterly punished by having such a household fairy at his fireside mrs snow gasped beatrice who was immensely astonished as well she might be seeing that the vicaress had never before deigned to pay the camp a visit yes my dear miss hedge said the lady with a suavity she was far from feeling as the girls fresh beauty annoyed her you are no doubt surprised to see me but i have come to see mr alpenny as my husbands richest parishioner last nights storm has damaged the spire of our church so i have started out at once to collect subscriptions for its repair there is nothing like taking time by the forelock miss hedge my father is out said beatrice coldly and will not be back for a few days then you can ask him mrs snow may i not put you down for a trifle i have no money replied beatrice annoyed by the greed and persistence of her visitor will you come in she did not wish to invite the lady in but mrs snow showed so very plainly that she intended to enter that beatrice could do no less in silence she led the way to the snow parlour and the vicars wife was presently seated on the linencovered sofa glancing with sharp eyes round the pretty place it need hardly be said that she glanced with inward disapproval and outward praise she wanted money for the spire and therefore had to be polite but that did not withhold her from inwardly finding all the fault she could a most charming place said mrs snow still trying to make herself agreeable i am glad you think so replied beatrice wondering why her unexpected visitor was so very polite and mindful of mrs snows past behaviour the girl could not think that the vicaress was making herself thus pleasant in order to get money for the spire besides the spire had only been damaged on the previous night and it seemed strange that the woman should begin to hunt for subscriptions for its restoration already no beatrice came to the conclusion and very rightly that mrs snow had another motive in paying attention to the girl she had so severely snubbed i have intended to call ever so many times went on mrs snow not to be daunted by the frosty manner of her hostess but my husband poor man is not very well and i have to attend to a great deal of the parish work there is no need to apologise mrs snow i see very few people but those you see are really charming gushed the vicaress i of course allude to mr and miss paslow they are friends of mine and of mine also miss hedge though i will say that this engagement of my son to miss paslow does not please me i really thoughthere mrs snow cast a searching look on the girls facethat my son admired you oh no he has always been devoted to miss paslow his devotion is misplaced snapped mrs snow some of the veneer of her gracious manner wearing away i shall never consent to such a marriage you must tell that to miss paslow and to your son said beatrice coldly i have nothing to do with it wellmrs snow hesitatedi thought that you being a friend of miss paslows might point out how foolish her conduct is it is not my place to interfere said miss hedge in a frosty manner and beginning to gain an inkling as to why the vicaress had paid this unforeseen visit of course not i should never ask you to do anything disagreeable miss hedge i hope you will come and see me at the vicarage now that i have found you out i really must see more of you it is very kind of you mrs snow but i never go out my father does not wish me to so eccentric dear mr alpenny is murmured the vicaress i was in town only two weeks ago and lady watson mentioned how strange he was you know lady watson of course i never set eyes on her i dont even know the name that is strange and mrs snow really did look puzzled she knew all about you beatrice started what is there to know about me oh nothingreally and truly nothing only that mr alpenny married your mother and adopted you when she died i was not here when mrs alpenny died but i believe she is buried in our churchyard i have seen the tombstone said beatrice coldly and how does this lady watson come to know about me she was a school friend of your mothersso she said oh beatrice felt her face flush here was a chance of learning something that neither durban nor alpenny would tell her i should like to meet lady watson you shall my dear miss hedge she is coming in a few weeks to stop at the vicarage i shall be happy to see her beatrice had to swallow her pride before she could say this as mrs snow had really treated her very badly but she was anxious to learn something of her mother and to find out if she had any relatives as she was determined not to marry ruck and knew that if she did not alpenny was quite capable of turning her out of doors of course durban would always look after her but beatrice wished to be independent even of durban at the moment she never thought of vivian and his hasty proposal but it came back to her memory when mrs snow introduced his name i hear that mr paslow is thinking of moving from this place said mrs snow such a pity so old a family the paslows have been in the grange since the reign of henry viii it was originally a convent you know and the paslow of those days was presented with it by the kingso shocking wasnt it he turned out the nuns and lived in the place himself that is why it is called convent grange so miss paslow told me responded beatrice rather weary of this smalltalk and wondering why it was being manufactured but mr paslow is poor pursued mrs snow and cant keep the place up i expect hell go to the colonies or some such place so you can easily see why i dont want my son to marry his sister beatrice felt very much inclined to tell her garrulous visitor that vivian had inherited money and would probably clear off the mortgages and live in the style of his forefathers but she restrained her inclination as it was none of her business and rose to intimate that the interview was at an end but mrs snow still sat on really a lovely place convent grange she chattered although sadly out of repair haunted too they say although i dont believe in ghosts myself but i hear an indian colonel was murdered there some twentyfour years ago and his ghost is said to haunt the room he was killed in i never heard that said beatrice wondering why dinah had never imparted so comparatively modern a tragedy to her i dare say not said mrs snow tartly the paslows dont like talking about the matter i heard about it from an old shepherd who keeps sheep on the downs orchard is his name and he was the butler of mr paslows father who was alive when colonel hall was murdered i never heard of a shepherd being a butler you mean that you never heard of a butler turning a shepherd said mrs snow neither did i but i understand that the poor mans nerves were so wrecked by the sight of the dead body that the doctors of those days ordered him to take the openair cure so he became a shepherd a most superior man who murdered colonel hall no one ever found out his throat was cut and he was discovered dead in his bed i believe a casket of jewels was stolen at the time and was never found but even if the paslows didnt tell you about this i wonder your father did not dear miss hedge as he was here at the time and a visitor at the grange my stepfather never tells me anything how dull you must be he really is so eccentric lady watson knew him years and years ago and says that he is quite a gentleman he was at rugby with her husband sir reginald who is dead but he took up this moneylending business which really is not respectable besides which it is quite forbidden by the mosaic law well i must be going mrs snow rose still smiling but you really must come over to the vicarage and let me make your life more gay i shall also try and induce your fatherno stepfatherto come over i dont think youll be able to manage that said beatrice dryly and wondering what all this alarming sweetness meant my stepfather never goes out he did over twenty years ago ask him about his visit to convent grange and about colonel halls murder it caused a great sensation although the criminal was never found but who is this mrs snow stepped out into the sunshine as she spoke and pointed her slatecoloured parasol towards durban who was standing near he must have approached very softly and must have heard every word the vicaress said for the last few minutes his dark face looked unnaturally white and he cast a nervous glance at the visitor beatrice noticed nothing however and ran to him at once oh durban i am so pleased to see you father has gone away see he left this note and ill take my leave so as not to interrupt you said mrs snow graciously then you can talk to the man what a charming place she looked round severely and walked from one carriage to another your bedroom a diningroom another bedroom then she stopped at the dungeon and tried the door oh bluebeards chamber i must not look in here it is the masters countinghouse lady said durban who was close at her heels and seemed anxious for her to go how delightful a countinghouse in a dark woodjust like alice in wonderland may i look in at the window mr alpenny is from home so he cant object and before any one could stop her she was peeping through the window where the blind was askew then she gave a cry of alarm miss hedge your father is within he is lying on the floor she stood on tiptoe oh he is dead i see blood impossible cried beatrice rushing forward and pushing the meddling woman asideyes durbanoh great heavens the servant came running up and also glanced in then with an exclamation of horror he ran into the kitchen and came out with a bunch of skeleton keys both the women pale and terrified stood beside him while he fitted these into the lock none would open the door and he flung them away with a smothered oath for a moment he paused then ran into the wood mrs snow turned to beatrice your father has been murdered i shall tell the police yes do said beatrice clasping her hands i never knew when i came home last night he left a note saying that he would go away for a few days and here is the man with a log interrupted mrs snow indeed it was durban who came dragging after him a large beam with a strength of which beatrice had never thought so stout a man was capable he caught this in the middle and retiring for a few paces made a run at the door it burst open with the shock and dropping the beam durban went inside mrs snow drew beatrice back it is not for you to see she said sharply how dare you stop me said the girl angry at the liberty and pushing mrs snow away she ran forward durban tried to keep her out but she managed to gain a glimpse of a stiff figure lying on the floor under the mahogany desk oh good heavens shrieked the girl his throat has been cut so was colonel halls muttered mrs snow and stole a glance at durban which made the man turn even greyer than he already was chapter vi the inquest after eighty years halting nemesis had at last caught up with jarvis alpenny he had buried himself in seclusion he had surrounded himself with bolts and bars and other precautions but the order that his sordid career should end had come from the powers that deal with evildoers and he was as dead as a doornail and very unpleasantly he had died too for his wrinkled throat had been cut from ear to ear who had done it no one seemed to know beatrice might have supplied a clue but for reasons connected with the paslow family she held her tongue and feigned ignorance when the rural police came on the scene which they did very speedily owing to the zeal of mrs snow the sergeant of the district questioned and crossquestioned miss hedge with very little success she told him that on the previous evening she had gone for a walk in the woods round the camp but did not mention with what object there as she stated very truly she had been caught in the storm and at some unknown time had stumbled home wet and weary and so tired that she had at once slipped into bed the note from her stepfather was produced and confiscated by the sergeant the details of mrs snows curiosity leading to a discovery of a crime were given and then beatrice professed that she could tell no more the bucolic constable believed her readily enough and informed his inspector who came that miss hedge had told the truth and nothing but the truth this might have been so but she certainly had not told the whole truth else might the sergeant have added to the note left by the dead man a certain gentlemans handkerchief marked with three initialsvrp this piece of evidence beatrice had picked up so near the body that a corner of the handkerchief was soaked in the lifeblood of the miser her quick eye had seen it almost the moment she had entered the dungeon at durbans heels and when falling on her knees by the dead she had mechanically picked it up without lynxeyed mrs snow seeing the action durban would only allow the women to remain for two minutes in that place of death then he drove them out and insisted that beatrice should retire to her parlour she did so while he reclosed the door of the countinghouse and while mrs snow almost too excited to speak ran for the nearest constable who in his turn summoned his sergeant alone in the parlour beatrice still mechanically grasping the handkerchief suddenly remembered how she had found it and at once examined the corners it was with a gasp of terror that she realised to whom it belonged vrp could only stand for vivian robert paslow and heas she knew only too wellwas the enemy of the deceased could it be that vivian had killed the miser to settle the question of marriage and secure his threatened property from getting into the cruel clutches of his victim in that first moment of horror beatrice was inclined to think so then with a revulsion of feeling she recoiled with horror from so base an idea the man she loved was not a midnight assassin however much he may have hated alpenny he certainly would not have put the old man to death in so barbarous a fashion finally he had been with her under the witches oak last night and could not possibly be guilty then again on further thought it occurred to her that such an alibi could scarcely serve in this case the meeting at the haunted tree had taken place about seven oclock and had lasted so far as she could reckon from confused recollection for a quarter of an hour then had come the episode of the pursuit of the watcher by paslow her own flight through the woods the breaking of the storm and her faintingfit she might have been hours unconscious she might have been hours getting home for she had very little recollection of that mad passage through the furious wind and rain only she remembered reaching the camp between the gates and blindly falling into the arms of a lean tall man with a black patch over his left eye had that man been vivian was it truly her lover who in the intervening time had stolen to the deserted camp and using the key of the small gate which she knew he possessed had gained access to the dungeon there to commit his crime no it was impossible if she could only remember the time when she came back this was hard to do and yet it was done for chance came to her aid besides the cuckooclock which had awakened her beatrice possessed an old silver watch given to her on some fardistant birthday by durban it stood on a small stand beside the bed and she remembered that in slipping between the sheets weary and half asleep she had knocked this down between the table it stood on and the wall some instinct must have directed her to look for it at the moment she thrust the incriminating handkerchief into her pocket and ran to the bedroom carriage there she found the watchfound also that it had stopped at the hour of nine oclock it was just possible that the stoppage had occurred when she had knocked it over she certainly had wound it up as usual on the previous night and twice before when knocked off its stand it had stopped dead yes thought the girl inspecting the yellow dial it must have been stopped by the fall unlessshe shook it vigorouslyunless it has run down but a steady ticking told her that the mainspring was not yet fully unwound and she replaced the watch on its stand with a firm conviction that she had entered the bedroom at nine on the previous evening vivian had left her to follow the spy at a quarter past seven so he could easily have committed the crime so far as time and opportunity went as one hour and threequarters had been taken up by her in getting home an alibi therefore was little good in this case and on the evidence of the handkerchief he would assuredly be hanged no no no murmured beatrice with rising inflection and speaking aloud in her agitation it is untrue vivian would never commit so cowardly a deed as to kill an old man of eighty however much he may have hated him i shall hide the handkerchiefbut where the police are sure to search the place andand a sudden thought struck her ill keep it in my pocket she decided and thrust it neatly folded up to the very bottom of that receptacle later she intended to cautiously question paslow and learn if he had been to the camp on that night but the conversation would be between their two selves she would tell no one else of the handkerchief she had picked up not even durban faithful servant though he was it was at this moment and as though in response to her mental mention of his name that durban appeared he looked much shaken by the tragedy and was green with scarcely concealed fright beatrice eyed him with astonishment as she had never deemed him to be much attached to the old tyrant who had gone so violently to his long rest durban evaded her searching glance which was perhaps fortunate as the girl herself did not wish her own countenance to be too closely scrutinised ive shut it up in the countinghouse said durban his eyes on the ground and jerking his thumb over his shoulder the police will be here soon mrs snow will tell them shell be glad of the chance why did she know mythe late mr alpenny thats right missy durban raised his eyes with approval and dropped them again never call him your father he was my stepfather beatrice reminded him ahhumyes gurgled durban yes missy mrs snow knew master before you were bornat convent grange i heard her say that colonel halls throat had also been cut durban shuddered and leaned against the door yes he whispered faintly that was so missy mr alpennys throat has been cut in the same way durban half smiled but his expression was wry and twisted there is only one way to cut a throat missy ugh beatrice turned pale and threw up her hand dont it is a nasty subject missy iim sorry for the master and yet he added half to himself if ever a man deserved what he got master was that man what do you mean asked beatrice taking a step towards him master had many enemies went on durban again casting his eyes on the ground a moneylender always has then you know i know nothing snapped the man angrily and wiping his swarthy face with a duster master sent me to london last night as you knew missy i only came down by the morning train and walked here in time to find you with mrs snow what did she want beatrice smiled faintly in her turn subscriptions for the church spire which was blown down last night oh that was the excuse excuse for what durban to see you missy and learn but there durban turned away she came here to make mischief between you and master thank heaven he is dead and you will get the money mrs snow cant harm you now why should she wish to harm me durban thats a long story missy now that the master is dead i can tell it to you but first we must learn who killed i know interrupted beatrice quickly a tall man with a black patch over his left eye durban turned greener than ever how do you know that missy he asked in a strangled voice i saw him when the gates were open about nine oclock last night durban looked at her sharply then you did go for that walk missy yes i had to mr paslow wished to see me durbanshe made a step forward and clutched his arm tightlyill tell you what i dont intend to tell any one else and without giving the man time to make an observation she related the whole story of her adventure suppressing only the episode of the handkerchief this she did so as to avert any possible suspicion from vivian since durban knowing that paslow had been with her would not connect him with the crimethat is if he was stupid enough not to calculate the time and thus prove the futility of the alibi durban listened quietly enough i am glad that mr paslow will marry you missy he said at last and removed her grasp from his arm you will inherit a lot of money from the dead master it ought to be twenty thousand a year but durban mr alpenny told me very plainly that if he died i would be a pauper i dont believe it burst out the halfcaste he would not dare toto here he halted and stammered cccurse him durban she stepped back a pace in sheer amazement at the savagery of the tone dead or alive curse him cried durban his voice gathering strength from the intensity of his hate he was a scoundrelyou dont know how great a scoundrel missyhe grasped her arm in his turnyou shall have the money i swear it then marry mr paslow and go away for a few years till all blows over till what blows over asked beatrice anxiously hush durban let go her arm and controlled himself by a violent effort the police say as little as you can you know nothingi know nothing durban are you afraid of mrs snow hush the last words were scarcely out of his mouth when the two policemen who had entered the gates left open by mrs snow came up to them with important airs the sergeant was stout and short the constable lean and tall we take possession of this place miss said the stout man breathlessly in the name of the king and the law finished the lean person and anything you say will be used in evidence against you they both murmured in a breath then stared sternly at the startled girl and the greenhued halfcaste do what you like said beatrice drawing herself up neither myself nor durban know anything but began the sergeant snorting with excitement i will answer all questions at the proper time and at the proper place said miss hedge cutting the plethoric man short then she retired into her bedroom and shut the door the constables grumbled at her sharpness of speech but went to work they examined the body searched every inch of the camp made plans took notes asked innumerable questions of durban and finally insisted that beatrice should submit to an examination this she did composedly enough but said as little as she well could it was her intention to reserve an account of what she had seen for the inquest she did not even tell the inspector when he arrived to take charge of the case there was immense excitement in hurstable the quiet little sussex village had never before been defiled by a crime of this brutal kind sparsely populated as the district was a great number of agricultural labourers gathered in a remarkably short space of time their wives and children came also and the police had much difficulty in keeping them out of the precincts of the camp then by next day the news had reached brighton and crowds of touristsit being the holiday seasonpoured into the weald on foot on bicycles in motor cars and carriages and by train with them came the reporters from various newspapers london and local and the whole place buzzed like a hive at swarmingtime beatrice remained in the camp under charge of durban dinah paslow came to offer her the hospitality of convent grange but much to the surprise of beatrice the man who had proposed to her on that fatal night never made his appearance without any embarrassment dinah told her friend that vivian had gone to town as soon as he heard that alpenny was dead chapter vii the inquestcontinued beatrice was both surprised and alarmed when she heard of vivians abrupt departure without seeing her it argued that he was guilty and feared to face her yet try as she might it was impossible for her to believe him to be a murderer why didnt he come to see me she asked dinah he wanted to replied the freckled girl but then he said that he had important business to attend to connected with you and went up to town the day before yesterday i have not heard from him since and dont know when he is coming back business connected with me repeated miss hedge much perplexed i dont understand neither do i dear but dont worry vivian loves you and whatever he does will be for your benefit i do wish youd come to the grange beatrice and let mrs lilly look after youshe knows about herbs and things and you look so pale and no wonder seeing what a shock you have had i wouldnt stop in this place for anything seeing ghosts and spooksugh and dinah ended her somewhat incoherent speech with a shudder i cannot come until the inquest is over said beatrice rapidly surveying the situation and then then perhaps it depends upon mr paslow vivian you mean said dinah quickly i have no right to call him vivian replied beatrice proudly yes you have vivian told me that he had asked you to be his wife and that you had accepted dinahbeatrice looked directly at the girl did he tell you where he proposed yes under the hush miss hedge sank her voice to a whisper as she saw a bluecoated constable moving heavily round the garden and gradually drawing nearer not a word hold your tongue about that meeting but why asked the amazed dinah ill tell you later said beatrice hurriedly that is when i have seen vivian have you his address no he went away and said he would be back soon oh dear cried dinah fretfully there is such a lot of mystery about vivian and has been for ages and ages sometimes hes jolly and then hes as dismal as a sick cow i thought it was love for jerry often is the samesilly boy but i dont believe it is love concluded dinah decidedly vivian has something on his mind what do you mean something horrid i dont know what it is but i fear the worst dont be a fool dinah said beatrice impatiently for she winced at hearing her own doubts put into speech its money troubles that annoy him and probably now that mr alpenny is dead he has gone to see the executors to know how his mortgage will stand as if he couldnt ask you cried dinah rising and throwing her ridingskirt over her arm youll get the money of course it ought to be a lot beatrice for jerry who has had dealings with moneylenders says they make heaps and heaps i know nothing until the will is read go away dear and come back after poor mr alpenny is buried poor mr alpenny mocked dinah well you are forgiving beatrice he was a nasty old man and never did any good in his life he is more useful to me and jerry dead than alive dinah oh i know its horrid of me said miss paslow penitently but we must livei mean jerry and i must think about our marriage his father wont allow him any money and mrs snow is a cat our only chance of getting married and living in a tweenyweeny house with a general servant is for jerry to get a rise now if jerry writes something picturesque about this murder hell get the rise and oh go away cried beatrice for this disconnected talk grated on her overstrung nerves and dont tell even jerry that i met viviani mean mr paslowunder the witches oak i wont say anything promised dinah firmly and i suppose it was improper for you to meet vivian so late without a chaperone but you will marry vivian darling wont you she went on coaxingly he is so poor and loves you and then mr alpennys moneyi mean your moneycan set up the family again and the patience of beatrice was at an end she took dinah firmly by the arm and led her out of the gates past the sleepy policeman who blinked in the sunshine like an overfed cat go and assist jerry to write paragraphs she said sharply you are a tiresome girl its your nerves said dinah not at all annoyed by this abrupt dismissal i feel that way myself when jerry is irritating he is such a well im going theres tommy tibbs holding flybynight hi tommy bring her here goodbye darling keep your spirits up ill come and see you later you must come to the grange and beatrice closed the babbling lips with a kiss and went inside while dinah argued with tommy about the price of holding her horse for one long hour the policeman opened his eyes and looked at the tall slim young lady with approval as she went past him he thought she was a trifle too pale and she had black circles under her eyes but otherwise he approved and smiled graciously beatrice took no notice of him but went to her parlour to think over the strange conduct of vivian paslow dinah was right he certainly had something on his mind and did not seem to be a free agent something hampered him in every way he had long desired to propose to her and yet had only done so when some cause which he declined to explain had been removed again he had gone up to town on hearing of alpennys murder and without ascertaining whether she had reached home or not on that fearful night he had not even left a message and then in her pocket was his handkerchief dyed with the lifeblood of the miser these things were strange and disquieting and beatrice resolved that before reaffirming her decision to marry him he would have to explain what underhand causes were at work to make him behave so mysteriously no time was lost in holding the inquest on the body of jarvis alpenny the weather was hot and it was just as well to place the remains underground as speedily as possible a doctor was summoned from hurstable to examine the body and pronounce if possible the hour when the murder had taken place then the corpse was conveyed to the solitary inn of hurstable a few miles away and there the jury looked it over afterwards the coroner summoned them into the inn parlour and inspector grove related all that had been discovered by the police it was not much and threw no light on the authorship of the crime the deceasedso ran the official narrativewas a moneylender of great repute and that none of the best he possessed a small office in london trunk street cheapsidebut seldom went there as he preferred the quiet of the countryprobably on account of his age which was considerable nevertheless from habit apparently mr jarvis continued to do business up to the very hour of his death he died in harness as might be said for on the table whereunder he lay were letters from peoplewho need not be mentionedasking for loans of money these he was apparently considering when he was struck down i understood and i have seen said the coroner emphatically that the deceaseds throat was cut inspector jones assented but pointed out that the old man was first felled by a blow from behind as was apparent from a wound at the back of the head the assassin had evidently entered stealthily and had taken his victim by surprise the murder was very deliberate as the criminal had first stunned the old man and then had cut his throat in a most brutal and thorough fashion therefore as the inspector suggested the motive of the crime was more than mere robbery a robber having stunned his victim could have taken what he desired and escaped before mr jarvis regained consciousness but the death had taken place from the throatcutting and not from the blow on the head has anything been taken from the room asked a juryman you mean the railway carriage corrected the inspector who was pedantic in speech and particular as to facts yes the safe was opened with the keys of the deceasedprobably taken by the assassin from the dead bodyand all the papers have been taken away what do you mean exactly asked the coroner inspector jones held up his right hand i mean he declared emphatically that the safe was as bare as the palm of my hand all papers were removed the drawers were emptied and nothing was leftabsolutely nothing the assassin must have carried quite a load as the safe is a large one and probably was fairly filled it is extremely likely replied the inspector then he went on to state that the fact of the death was discovered the next morning by mrs snow the vicars wife who was paying a visit to miss hedge the police were called in and everything had been done to discover the whereabouts of the assassin but in vain villagers labourers railway officials chance folk travelling in carts and motorcars and on bicycles had been questioned but no suspicious character had been observed the assassin had stolen in upon the old man out of the night and when his detestable task had been executed he had again vanished into the night with his plunder leaving not a footprint behind by which he could be traced yet the night was rainy said the coroner sapiently and the grassy sward retorted jones runs right up to the railway carriage wherein the crime was executed i have inquired at the trunk street office and cannot learn from the confidential clerk there that mr alpenny was threatened in any way or feared for his life or property the affair is a mystery and is likely to remain so with such an ass as you at the head of affairs murmured the coroner as the inspector severely official stepped down to give place to a rosy little manwell doctor he asked aloud what do you know about this sad business dr herman knew very little save from a medical standingpoint he lived in hurstable some miles distant from the scene of the crime and drove round all the surrounding district to see his patients a constable stopped him on the day after the crime had been committed and he had been asked to examine the corpse he found that it was that of an old man the body was badly nourished but healthy enough for a man who certainly was over eighty the blow on the head would not have killed a man with such vitality old as he was death had ensued from the cutting of the throat which was neatly done said the doctor with professional approval i should think a very sharp instrument was used and a very dexterous hand had used it no bungling about that affair concluded dr herman humph said the coroner doubtfully and what does that mean do you insinuate that a doctor cut the throat and used a surgical instrument to do so i insinuate nothing of the sort said herman hotly for he did not like the sneer of the coroner it might have been a butcher who is quite as dexterous with a knife as a medical man although not quite in the same way pooh pooh were all animals doctor laughed the coroner and you are all butchers whether you are called so or not come now at what time did mr jarvis alpenny meet his death i cannot be sure of thati cannot commit myself to an exact opinion said the little doctor doubtfully i should say the crime was committed between eight and nine of the previous night but as i say i cannot be quite certain between eight and nine of the previous night wrote the coroner and called the next witness this was mrs snow who gave her evidence with much volubility she had called on miss hedge to ask for money in order to get the spire of hurstable church mended miss hedge had stated that her stepfather was from home but shewitnesshad glanced into the railway carriage which was called the countinghouse of mr alpenny there she had seen the deceaseddead lying in a pool of blood at once she gave the alarm and durban the servant burst open the door with a beam the door of the carriage was locked then oh yes assented mrs snow i tried it myself i expect the assassin killed poor mr alpenny and after robbing the safe went out with his plunder and locked the door after him he had the keys one moment said durban rising in the body of the room my master carried the keysall the keys including that of the countinghouse on a single ring the keys were in the safe and well hear you later said the coroner sharplygo on mrs snow i have nothing further to say said the vicars wife trying to convey a sympathetic look in her eyes save that i am sorry for miss hedge and i may add she continued after a moment of hesitation that colonel hall was murdered at convent grange twentyfive years ago in the same way i remember the case said the coroner who was an old resident of the neighbourhood and what do you infer that the assassin of colonel hall and the assassin of mr alpenny are one and the same said mrs snow promptly why should you connect the two asked the coroner coldly and very much puzzled colonel hall and mr alpenny had much to do with one another said mrs snow and did some business together that their two throats should be cut is a coincidence only that and nothing more mrs snow i cannot see what the old crime has to do with the new one i am sure there is some connection snapped the sour woman and then stepped down from the witnessbox with a triumphant glance in the direction of beatrice why that glance and one of such a nature was sent beatrice could not guess but then the conduct of mrs snow was perplexing her more and more durbans evidence was to the effect that he had been absent when the crime took place mr alpenny had sent him to town with a letter and he had returned the next morning to find the old man dead mrs snow had first informed him of the fact he had burst open the door with a beam as it was locked and then had discovered that mr alpennys throat was slit from ear to ear and i saw added the witness quickly that the keys of the deceased including the key of the countinghouse were on the ring which dangled from the key used to open the safe then you do not think that the assassin could have locked the door after him certainly not seeing that the key was left behind was there not another key no my master had the only key of the countinghouse it was one of a most peculiar make and there was no duplicate mr alpenny was always careful to lock up his papers and to keep the door of the countinghouse locked then there must be another way of getting into the countinghouse inspector jones rose to assure the coroner that the place had been thoroughly examined there is no way of entering the railway carriage which is called the countinghouse save by the door but if the door was locked and the key inside the assassin must have got out by another way what about the window its so small and so barred that a child could not get through it the coroner scratched his head and looked at durban you were the confidential servant of the deceased he said helplessly perhaps you can explain i can explain nothing said durban promptly and quite at his ease certainly i was mr alpennys servant but he made no confidant of me i took letters to the london office but what was in them i never knew i was cook and general servantthat is all you were often in the countinghouse i was never in the countinghouse in my life sir mr alpenny would not allow either miss hedge or myself to enter humph said the coroner again the whole mystery seems to centre round the countinghouse had mr alpenny enemies the usual sort a moneylender is bound to have said durban with a shrug people sometimes came and called him names and he told me that many borrowers objected to the high interest he charged did the deceased ever give you to understand that his life was in danger never he appeared quite happy in his own way was he expecting any one on the night he was murdered i cannot say he sent me to town with the letter and i was to come back next morningwhich added the witness pointedly i did mr alpenny did not expect to be killed no he would have taken some precautions had he thought that as he feared death after this several jurymen asked questions and the coroner crossexamined the halfcaste but he could tell nothing likely to lead to a discovery of the assassin he simply declared that he was not in his late masters confidence and knew nothing that he had gone to town on the night of the murder and had only learned of it through mrs snow the coroner and incidentally inspector jones were annoyed they had quite counted on a solution of the mystery when durban was examined but he could tell nothing and they saw no reason to doubt his evidence beatrice was called as the final witness and told very much the same story as she had related to the sergeant only on this occasion she stated the time when she had returned the coroner asked her how she knew that she had entered at nine whereupon she detailed the episode of the fallen watch i am sure that when i knocked it down it stopped at nine she said at that hour i returned why did you not go in and see mr alpenny in the first place i was worn out said the witness in the second there was no light in the window of the countinghouse and in the third i found the note left by mr alpenny which i handed to the sergeant and in the fourth place added beatrice before the coroner could make an observation which he seemed inclined to do i saw the assassin everyone was startled and a confused murmur filled the room you saw the assassin said the coroner aghast when i entered the gates of the camp at nine oclock he is a tall man with a black patch over the left eye a black patch cried mrs snow rising much excited colonel hall was also murdered by a man with a black patch i swear it chapter viii the will the words rang piercingly through a dead silence beatrice startled by persistent introduction of a bygone crime stared at the leanfaced woman who made the outcry the coroner blinked furiously and nursed his chin in his hand considering what to say and what to do finally he made up his mind to rebuke mrs snow you have given your evidence said he frowning a trifle and now you must be silent you should note what i have told you said mrs snow calmly but her bosom heaved impatiently the one crime may help the other as how asked the coroner politely because you may strike down two birds with one stone i should rather put it if what you say is true mrs snow that we may strike down one bird with two stones i understand that you say the man who murdered colonel halli remember him wellalso murdered mr alpenny you heard what miss hedge said about the black patch dr arne and you know that colonel halls throat was also cut there was some stealing also said dr arne musingly which makes the parallel more complete there was a diamond necklace stolen said mrs snow quietly at least i remember that i was not married then and mrs hall was my dear friend i never saw her said the coroner coldly and a trifle rudely all this is not to the pointmiss hedge will you go on what would you have me tell you asked the witness who had been listening eagerly to mrs snows account of the earlier crime how could you see this man seeing that the night was dark and very stormy i saw his face in a flash of lightning explained beatrice and then related the momentary meeting but she suppressed the fact that on the same night she had met vivian under the witches oak it was not pertinent to the case she thought moreover with the knowledge of whose handkerchief was in her pocket she thought it best to keep paslows name out of the matter the gates were open asked the coroner when she ended wide open mr alpenny had the key i believe yes but that key was not on the ring to which the others were attached it hung on the wall along with the key of the smaller gate put in durban then inspector jones spoke the key of the large gate said he i found in the lock the next morning where it had been left the man with the black patch closed the large gate after him as he ran out said beatrice ah then probably he opened the gate from the inside and when he met you he was too startled to take it out of the lockand the smaller keythat belonging to the little gate mr inspector it is hanging on the wall of the countinghouse now beatrice started and grasped the chair near which she stood to keep herself from falling vivian had picked up the key when she dropped it under the witches oak he must have replaced it in the countinghouse himself when he was inside he had also left the handkerchief which she had in her pocket surely he was guilty and yetand yetoh it was too terrible a word from the coroner recalled her you look pale miss hedge he remarked suspiciously and no wonder said the girl faintly the whole affair is so very terrible well well said arne relenting and believing this excuse which was feasible enough i shant keep you much longer why did you not see mr alpenny on that night i have told you the note ah yes i was about to remark on that when you spoke lastmr inspector why has not this note been put in evidence inspector jones with profuse apologies laid the note on the table i quite forgot he said looking ashamed but here it is as you will see mr alpenny says that he is going away for three days where did you find the note miss hedge beside my bed on that night i naturally thought that as the light was out in the countinghouse and the note explained that mr alpenny had gone away as he intended quite rightvery naturalhumhum when you found the bodyhe spoke to durbanwhat clothes was it dressed in mr alpenny always wore one suit and durban explained the oldfashioned dress but when i found the body it was clothed in a loose cloak which he used to wear in rough weather and a hat the hat was on the desk sir humph said dr arne thoughtfully then it would seem that he was struck down just as he was going up to town could mr alpenny have caught a train so late yes sir if he left the camp at nine oclock there was a train at halfpast ten to brighton and he could have caught a late one on the main line or he could have stopped at brighton all night he sometimes did it is nearly three miles to our local station said dr arne could an old man like mr alpenny walk that distance he often did declared durban emphatically he had a wonderful constitution had the master marvellous vitality cried dr herman from his seat and was rebuked by his enemy the coroner arne asked a few more questions and then addressed the jury he pointed out that on the evidence before them they could not arrive at any conclusion as to who was the actual murderer the man who murdered colonel hall cried mrs snow quite so said the coroner smoothly but that man escaped and was never discovered if it is the same manand certainly mrs snow it seems as though your surmise is righthe may escape again mr alpenny apparently was about to start on his journey after leaving the note for miss hedge and probably was turning over some necessary papers when he was struck down regarding the locked door i can offer no explanation nor have the police been able to find this masked man who assuredly must be the assassin the case is full of mystery and i do not see what can be done save that the jury should return an open verdict he made a few more observations but what he said was not very much to the point the jurywhat else could be donereturned a verdict of murder against a person or persons unknown with an observation to the effect that the police should hunt down the man with the black patch this last remark was rather irregular but to say the truth everyone was so puzzled over the aspect of the case that no one had any very clear idea of what to say or do however the verdictsuch as it wasresolved itself into the terms above stated and the jury betook themselves severally to their homes there to puzzle over the matter beatrice went back to the camp with durban and both felt glad that the corpse was still left in an outhouse of the hotel neither wished that gruesome relic of mortality to remain in the camp that is all right missy said durban when the two were walking along the lane towards the camp master will be buried tomorrow and we wont think of him any more ill never get the sight of that body out of my head said beatrice with a shudder durban who could have killed him i cannot say missy said the halfcaste stolidly you heard what evidence i gave yes but did you speak truly i spoke what i spoke said durban sullenly the least said the soonest mended beatrice felt a qualm of terror at the memory of the replaced key and the handkerchief in her pocket then you have some idea who killed mr alpenny no i have not missythat is i cannot lay my finger on the man then it was a man it might have been two men or three missy master had dealings with very strange and dangerous people i dont wonder he was killed and cried the halfcaste stopping to emphasise his words if i knew who killed him i would shake that mans hand durban why in heavens name becausebecausemissy he broke off abruptly let the past alone my dear young lady mr alpenny was a bad man and came to a deserved end i did not kill him you did not kill him so we had better think no more of him when he is buried you will have the money and then you can marry mr paslow and be happy i shall never marry mr paslownever never cried beatrice bitterly and lifted a wan face to the mocking blue sky but he loves you and i love him all the samedurban she broke off in her turn i want to hear all you know about mr paslow i know nothing missy said durban looking profoundly surprised he is poor but goodhearted and i like him you dont think that hehe would commit a crime asked miss hedge faintly and clinging to the servant no cried durban with great assurance what makes you think that mr alpenny said durban did not give her time to finish master would accuse any one of anything to gain his ends he said quietly he did not wish you to marry mr paslow because it was to his interest that you should marry major ruck so he said do you know this major yes said durban with some hesitation and a wicked man he is if he comes to marry you missy tell mr paslow and hell settle him i dont expect that i shall see major ruck i dont know muttered the servant doubtfully the major wont let you slip through his fingers if he can help it durban you seem to know much that you will not tell me i do know a lot but it is useless to tell you missy not even about colonel halls death durban the halfcaste turned green and winced not even about that missy he said coldly get the money marry mr paslow and go away from this place do you think mrs snow is right persisted beatrice wondering at his nervous looks did the man who killed colonel hall kill mr i dont knowi cant say interrupted durban gloomily it might have been another one of them are there then two men who wear black patches over the durban clenched his long nervous hand youll drive me mad with these questions he said fiercely and with less of his usual respect i tell you missy i know much and yet i know nothing which it would do any good for you to hear i have watched over you in the past and i shall watch over you in the future you have been surrounded by devils master was the worst but now that he is dead all danger is at an end you have the money and you can go away you speak in riddles let them remain riddles if you have any love for me said durban moodily and beatrice although anxious to hear more held her peace after all she had her own cross to bear in some way vivian was mixed up with this horrible crime he could not possibly be guilty of it in spite of the evidence moreover mrs snow said that the assassin was the same as he who had killed colonel hall which would put vivians innocence beyond a doubt in spite of her desire to obey durban to whom she owed so much beatrice had to insist on an answer to this question i wont ask you anything more she said to the sullen manand he was sullenonly this is the assassin of colonel hall the assassin of mr alpenny i think so muttered the man but i cannot be sure you must be sure for my peace of mind durban your peace of mind missy he asked surprised yes i must tell you as i know you will hold your tongue but i thinki believeno i dont but i fancy that is durbanshe caught the mans shoulders and shook him in the roadwaydid vivian paslow murder mr alpenny missy durban looked startled but his eyes sparkled no no one thousand times no what makes you think that the handkerchiefthe key and beatrice producing the handkerchief told durban the whole of what had happened and i am thankful that mrs snow did not see me pick it up she finished wait till we get to the camp missy said the old servant kindly and led her along the short distance that intervened between where they had stopped and the camp itself once there durban took her to the parlourcarriage and went away he returned with some orangeblossom water which is a good nerve tonic and made her take it when the girl was more composed he stood before her with raised finger missy he said gravely i have been and i am a good friend to you yesyes i know you are she said with a sigh the reason of my fidelity you shall know some day he went on and a good reason it is but you must ask me no more questions until i voluntarily tell you all that it is needful you should know with regard to mr paslow you can set your mind at rest he is quite innocent the handkerchief you found was left behind by him on the day he had that quarrel with mr alpenny are you sure i am absolutely certain i saw it on masters desk when i went in to get that letter which i was to take to town as to the key i got it from mr paslow himself when did you see him later on in the dayon that day when we found out the murder explained durban fluently i went outside and found that mr paslow was coming in to see if you had got home safely he told me that he possessed the key of the small gate which you had dropped and gave it to me i replaced it on the nail in the countinghouse where the inspector found it mr paslow went to london whenever he heard of the crime and at my request but why durban asked beatrice relieved to find that vivian had not been so callous or neglectful as she had thought i wanted him to see mr alpennys lawyer and look after the will said durban steadily he wanted to see you i would not allow that as you were quite worried enough but the sight of vivian would have done me good protested the poor girl faintly for she was quite worn out i can see that now said durban regretfully but i thought at the time that it was wiser to keep you quiet if i had thought that you suspected him i should have spoken before but you never mentioned his name so i deemed it best to be silent but he is perfectly innocent and when he comes back will be able to tell you where he went after he left you on that night meanwhile he is seeing after the will is there any need every need i tell you missy that even though mr alpenny is dead you are surrounded by scoundrels but if you get the moneyand master swore to me that he would leave you the fortuneyou will be absolutely safe from what durban from the wicked schemes of these people major ruck here durban checked himself and spoke softly and soothingly there there missy ask no more questions some day your foolish old silly durban will make things plain just now think only that you will be rich that you will marry mr paslow and that everything will go well with you beatrice raised her arms and dropped them with a helpless air she seemed to be more than ever surrounded by mysteries and durban who was able to explain insisted upon holding his tongue at all events her mind was set at rest regarding the honesty of vivian and she thought it best to take the old servants advice and possess her soul in patience until such time as he chose to tell her the truth whatever that might be but it was all very puzzling and her head ached with the effort to think matters out after a time durban persuaded her to lie down which she did very willingly being quite prostrate after the terrors of the past few days she fell into an uneasy doze and was awakened by the sound of a muchloved voice at once she put on her dressinggown and opened the door vivian looking weary and dispirited was talking to durban near at hand where she could overhear plainly yes he was saying beatrice gets nothing all the moneyquite twenty thousand a yearhas been left by alpenny to lady watson lady watson cried beatrice opening the door my mothers friend vivian turned away durban changed to his usual green pallor and seemed deeply agitated yes said durban your mothers friend he paused and then spat on the ground curse her said durban fiercely chapter ix lady watson beatrice stared at vivians grey drawn face bereft of youth and at durbans savage green countenance she looked spellbound a pause ensued beatrice did not know what to make of the men paslows averted looks and worn paleness durbans curse for lady watson would the fact that she did not inherit the money account for such emotions she thought not and so requested information what is it she asked looking from one to the other but she looked longest at vivian you have heard missy said durban recovering himself somewhat we have lost the money i can bear that if i lose nothing else said beatrice her eyes still on paslows grey face but that she should get it cried durban shaking impotent fists in the air after all she has done and i can do nothing to force her to be fair who would have thought the foul old thief would have squandered his gold on her silly face i could here he caught sight of the frightened looks of beatrice and let his hands fall as he walked past vivian towards the kitchen he breathed a sentence in the young mans ear she may know much said durban imperatively but not all great heaven could i tell her all do you think groaned the man beatrice caught the drift if not the exact words of these whispers and came towards vivian durban was already within the kitchen and had shut the door the two were aloneshe eager to know the worst he silent and tortured with much that he could not explain vivian vivian she continued and laid her hand on his arm he shook it off with a shudder my dear said beatrice shrinking back oh my dear and she stared with fastlocked hands not that whispered the man with dry lips you might have called me so when we stood under the witches oak but nowhe made a despairing gesturethat is all at an end do you take back your proposal of marriage asked the girl colouring i do because i must vivian looked at her hungrily as though he would have given his life to take her in his armsas was indeed the case if i did not love you so much he said hoarsely i would lie but loving you as i do i must speak the truth the whole of it she asked bitterly so much as i may tell miss hedge miss hedge i have no right to call you otherwise now said paslow sadly i told you of a bar which prevented my asking you to be my wife yes and you said that it had been removed i was wrong it is not removed i had no right to speak what is this bar i cannot tell you beatrice he caught suddenly at her hands if i could lie down and die at your dear feet i would for my heart is sick within me i have sinned and bitterly i am paying for my sin when i spoke to you under the oak i was then able to be your true lover and hoped to be your loving husband but nowhe flung away her handsthat barrier which i thought removed is still between us i am not a free agent i dare not ask you to be my wife but you have asked me and i have consented she panted red with shame and anger why are you playing with me like this why are the gods playing with both of us you mean he said with a mirthless laugh were you and i on the other side of the world we might be happyand yet even then it would be impossible i love you but you have every right to hate me i dont understand one word you are talking about said beatrice sharply and tried to resolve some sense out of his wild words is it that you committed this crime i he started back amazed beatrice i may be bad but i am not so evil as that i hated alpenny and had every reason to hate him but i never laid a finger on the poor wretch i did not kill him myself nor can i tell you who killed him ah he went on half to himself durban said something of thisabout the key of the small gatebut he explained is what he said true perfectly true i am innocent it is not the murder that is a bar to divide us i could face that out but there are other things which prevent my being a free agent have you a master then i have those about me who know too much said vivian fiercely and if anything would make me stain my hands with blood it would be the knowledge that i am the sport of thieves and vagabonds how it will all end i do not knowfor me that is but for you my best and dearesthe made a step forward but she evaded himfor you i know the end you must come to convent grange and go to the grange after what you have said she flamed out i shall not trouble you i shall go to town you can stay with dinah and with mrs lilly for a time then durban and i will see if we cannot get you some money from mrsthat is from lady watson why should she give it to me asked beatrice shrugging becausehe began then ended abruptlyi cannot tell you vivianbeatrice moved swiftly forward and laid a firm hand on his shoulderi do not understand all this mr alpenny poor wretch hinted at crimes on your part do you believe him asked vivian turning his haggard young face towards her no she said firmly i love you too well for that god bless you a tear dropped on the hand which he kissed she drew it away but you are not open with me you are not honest with me if you have troubles i have a right to share them tell me of this barrier no said vivian firmly i cannot i dare not all i can say is that the barrier may be removed in time only trust me has the barrier to do with this crime in some ways and with the death of colonel hall what do you know of that asked paslow amazed very little but mrs snow hinted that woman shell make mischief if she can dont trust her she hates you beatrice why should she i hardly know her but she knows youthat is she knows of you to explain what it all means would be to tell you much that i would rather you did not knowthat you must never know i am not a child you are the woman i love and therefore i shall not allow your mind to be tainted withwithwith what i could tell you he ended rather weakly beatrice reflected for a few minutes apparently vivian was in some trouble connected with other people possiblyas she guessedwith those scoundrels who surrounded alpenny and of whom durban had talked for some reason which she could not guess he was trying to keep from her things which were vile and evil she could not think how a young country squire could be involved in alpennys roguerieswhich it seemed he was and then hisbut she gave up trying to solve the problem on such evidence as was before her it only remained that she should use her own eyes her own intelligence and maybe sooner or later she would arrive at an understanding of things then perhaps she would be enabled to remove this barrier which stood between them strange though paslows conduct was and open to dire suspicion she still loved him and knew in her heart of hearts that she would love him until he died this being the case she made up her mind with the swiftness of a woman who is fighting for what she loves best and looked at him searchingly he was watching her with anxious eyes but shifted his gaze to the ground when she looked at him will you answer me a few questions she asked quietly if i can he replied hesitating her lip curled in spite of herself you need not be afraid i shall respect your secret whatever it isfor the present that is meanwhile perhaps you will tell me if you know who killed mr alpenny no i told you before that i did not know have you any suspicion not even a suspicion he answered frankly and he looked at her as he spoke so serenely that she believed him will you tell me about colonel halls murder i know very little about it i was a child at the time mrs lilly can tell you anything you wish to know why do you ask because from what mrs snow said i believe that the first murder of colonel hall is connected with the second murder of mr alpenny i dont believe that muttered vivian uneasily i do the murdersboth of themwere committed by the man with the black patch what do you know of that nothing save that i used the words to frighten alpenny and found them on the paper laid on my desk do you know who laid that paper there i have not the least idea the desk is near the window and that was open any one could have passed the paper through the window i asked dinah and mrs lilly but neither one of them knew how the paper came to be there if you remember continued beatrice slowly mr alpenny muttered something about it being the third time well then i truly believe that the words you used unconsciously were a warning twice he was warned and on the third warning he expected to be killed that was why i believe he arranged to go up to town when he was struck down you were used by someone as the unconscious instrument to give him the warning i might have been but that is she added coming so close to him that he felt her breath on his cheek if you really and truly are ignorant of the meaning of the words i swear that i am stammered vivian turning red then your secret has nothing to do with the black patch no i am as puzzled as you are over that well well said beatrice looking over her shouldershe had moved towards the door of her bedroom as he spokei intend to go to the grange and i do not care whether you stop there or not the worst is over now i know that you love me god knows that i do he said hurriedly and he knows that i love you she went on steadily i dont care what crimes you have committed or what stops you from again asking me to be your wife i love you and i intend to marry you beatrice she threw up her hand to keep him at his distance wait i intend to solve the mystery of these murders myself the two are connected and when i find out who killed these two men i shall be able to marry you is that not so possiblythat is you need say no more tell dinah that i shall come to the grange this evening for the present goodday and she went in and shut the door paslow stood where he was for a moment then flung himself forward to kiss the wood of the door oh my lovemy lovemy heart he murmured what a dreary weary way you have marked out for yourself but i shall follow you along the path of shadows and perhaps we two will emerge at length into the sunshine he turned away and passing the kitchen carriage knocked at the door sharply durban appeared i heard everything said the servant who was now more composed and what do you say knowing what you do know i say let missy go on it may be that god intends her to learn the truth and right matters but lady watson has the money vivian reminded him she has everything said durban bitterly she always did have everything then with an afterthought but what she really wanted she never got mr paslow and what was that never mind least said soonest mended i will tell missy nothing and you must hold your tongue also only let us guard her from danger i dont think there is danger for her durban ahhumone never knows there are thosebut no matter let her go her ways it may be that she may learn the truth and put things straight she can never put them straight for me said vivian bitterly i can do that said durban let missy go to the grange i go to london you will have news from me paslow caught his arm as he turned to go you will not i am too fond of my neck for that said durban and went into his kitchen while vivian full of sore thoughts and yet with a certain glimmer of hope now that beatrice was to take a hand in the game went home to dinah beatrice packed her boxes and got ready to go by five oclock she was hatted and cloaked and a trap was waiting at the gates to take her to convent grange along with her luggage alpenny was to be buried on the morrow but it was just as well that miss hedge should leave the camp tonight but she was not to go yet for an hour for scarcely had she reached the open gates when a small lady fashionably dressed entered and came straight towards her when durban saw her he frowned lady watson he breathed in the ear of his young mistress she seems anxious to take possession of her property said the girl bitterly and looked carefully at the woman who had supplanted her in the race for alpennys wealth lady watson lookedin the distancelike a child so small and delicate and slender did she appear but when she came close which she did with an engaging smile beatrice saw that her face was covered with innumerable fine wrinkles and that she was painted and powdered and made upas the saying isto within an inch of her life her hair was dyed a golden colour she wore a veil to hide the too obvious makeup of her face and the only young thing about her were a pair of sparkling eyes of a bright brown at one time she had beenwithout the aid of artan extremely pretty woman even nowwith the aid of artshe looked attractive and youthful providing she was looked at from a safe distance like an oilpainting her dress was ultrafashionable and she wore it with the air of a woman accustomed to spend no end of money in drapers shops her teeth were good but probably were false as was her smile beatrice a straightforward person herself took an instinctive dislike to this gushing little mass of affectation which came mincing towards her she had no wish to cultivate the acquaintance but lady watson gave her no time to express her dislike either by looks or in words my dear childmy sweet beatrice she cried in a rather shrill voice and sailing forward with eager outstretched hands how glad i am to see you at last that dreadful mr alpennyhe never would allow me to come and see you although i was your mothers dearestvery dearest and closest friend but then the poor creature is dead and he really wasnt a nice person when all is said and done mrs snow told me that you were my mothers friend replied beatrice gravely and surrendering her hands to the eager grasp i am glad to see you as i wish to talk about my mother oh lady watson started and cast a suspicious look on the grave young face then you are not glad to see me on my own account i scarcely know you lady watson ah but you will soon i am a very easy person to get on with as durban knows dear old durbanshe turned a smiling glance at the halfcaste who looked gloomily at the groundhe is as young as everit is long since we met durban very long madam said durban coldly his eyes still on the ground and beatrice saw his hands opening and shutting as though he could scarcely keep them from lady watsons throat well well we wont talk of the past just yetit is unpleasant my dear durban and she gave a pretty little shudder durban made no reply in words but raising his eyes looked at her meaningly she shuddered again this time with genuine terror and turned pale under her rouge beatrice wondered what secret there could be between the twothe fashionable lady and the poor servant still the same gloomy thing tittered lady watson passing her flimsy handkerchief across a pair of dry lips you always were you know durban the colonelbut thereas durban looked at her againwell not talk of the past but of the futureof course dear miss hedge you know that poor mr alpenny left me his money i understand so said beatrice coldly and naturally you are annoyed no before his death mr alpenny gave me to understand that he would not leave me any money you perhaps had a greater claim on him than i lady watson the other tittered and avoided durbans eyes oh dear me no the poor creaturemr alpenny you knowwas in love with me ages and ages ago long before i married sir reginald but reginald is dead and so is mr alpennyeveryone seems to dieso dreadful you know miss hedgeor rather i should say beatrice i shall call you beatrice since we are to be friends and live together live together oh havent i told you i am such a featherhead yes whenever i found that poor mr alpennyqueer creature wasnt hehad left me his money i said i would come down and ask you to be my companionmy child in fact if i may put it so you shall have everything you want i must have someone to look after the house as the servants are so tiresome and i am a lonely woman without a chick or child miss hedge is going to convent grange said durban thickly lady watson started and again turned pale that horrid place she said faintly why do you call it that asked beatrice quickly there was a horrid murder committed there ages ago i was in the house at the time and madam interposed durban sharply please do not tell miss hedge anything more she has had enough horrors for the time being lady watson looked straight at durban and he looked straight at her the situation was adjusted between them without words and although beatrice protested that she wished to hear about the earlier crime the frivolous little woman declined to say another word how can one talk of such things in the midst of such lovely scenery as you have here she cried and put up a tortoiseshell lorgnette to survey the camp quite delicious i shall make this a kind of countryhouse so odd you know with all these railway carriages dear mr alpenny he was so very queer in his tastes but ill come here with you dearest beatrice and well garden and live like milkmaidslike marie antoinette you know rural lifedelicious i am going to live at the grange lady watson but i want you to be my companion i insist lady watson spoke with some sharpness as apparently she was a lady not accustomed to be thwarted in her wishes i have arranged to live at the grange said beatrice and durban nodded his approval for a time that is afterwards i intend to go out as a governess what with that face and figure you foolish girl i wont allow it you must enter society on my moneyor rather on that poor creatures alpennys moneyand marry and i dont think you have any right to tell me what to do lady watson said beatrice annoyed by this imperious air as your mothers dearest friend i dont recognise that as an authority but if you will give me your address in town ill come and see you and talk about my dear mother i want to know everything about her i can tell you nothing said lady watson tartly that is i wont unless you come as my companion lady watson i thank you very much for your offer but i go to the grange and as i am already overdue i must leave you now goodday she held out her hand which lady watson waved aside you provoking girl i wont say goodday i am stopping with mrs snow and will come and see you at the grange give me a kiss and before beatrice could stop her lady watson kissed her warmly when the little woman drew back beatrice saw to her surprise that the bright brown eyes were filled with tears chapter x mrs lillys story the funeral was over and jarvis alpenny was buried beside the wife whomaccording to rumourhe had so cruelly neglected the excitement about his mysterious death was apparently buried with him and hurstable again became a somnolent hamlet devoid of news and intelligence in spite of every effort the police were unable to trace the man with the black patch no one seemed to know anything about him and he had vanished as completely as though the earth had swallowed him up the local and london papers made their usual crass remarks about the inactivity and uselessness of the police and save in a rare paragraph ceased to notice the matter the murder was only a nine hours wonder after all lady watson went away from the rectory without calling upon beatrice as she had promised perhaps this was because she had unpleasant recollections of convent grange or perhaps on account of a short conversation she had with durban after beatrice left the camp but whatever might be her reason she did not again ask miss hedge to become her companion nor did she call or even write with her twenty thousand a year she returned to london and left the camp in charge of durban who still continued to inhabit his old quarters sometimes he came over to see beatrice and appeared to be more devoted than ever to the girl but he said nothing about the various mysteries he had hinted at nor did beatrice inquire very closely what they might be she saw very plainly that both durban and vivian were determined that she should know as little as possiblefor what reason she could not imagineand therefore in pursuance of her determination she cast about to find some path which might lead to a discovery of the truth whatever that might be she wished to learn who had killed alpenny and thought that by examining into his past life she might be able to learn something of his enemies once she discovered who disliked him and the reason of such dislike she fancied that she might lay her hand on the assassin but there was no one to tell her of alpennys past as both durban and vivian kept silent but as according to mrs snow the murderer of colonel hall was the assassin of jarvis alpenny beatrice determined to learn all she could about the earlier crime in the hope that her discoveries in that direction might enable her to elucidate the mystery of the later murder mrs lilly was the best person to apply to for a history of colonel halls untimely fate as she had been housekeeper to the paslows for many many years beatrice during the first fortnight of her stay hinted that she would like to hear about the tragedy and mrs lilly after some hesitation promised to tell her what she knew accordingly beatrice two weeks after the burial of her stepfather was seated in the grange garden waiting for the housekeeper mrs lilly had first to attend to her work but promised that as soon as it was ended she would come out and chat as dinah had gone over to the rectory to see mrs snow beatrice was quite alone she did not count vivian as he scarcely stopped an entire day at the grange and very rarely a night some business took him constantly to london but what it might be the girl could not guess after that abrupt conversation in the camp the two said very little to one another it was a strange wooing and extremely unsatisfactory the garden of convent grange was delightful as was the house although both were somewhat dilapidated the ancient red brick mansion had beenas mrs snow had informed beatricea convent in the reign of that archiconoclast henry viii when his greedy hand was laid upon ecclesiastical property he had bestowed the convent on amyas paslow who promptly turned out the nuns to house himself and his family but there was some curse on the place and on the race for the family never prospered overmuch and when the property came to vivian paslow he was as poor as an english gentleman of long descent well can be nevertheless he still clung to the old mansion although he could have sold it at an advantageous price to an american millionaire in some wonderful way he managed to scrape enough money together to pay the interest on the mortgage to alpenny and thus had kept a roof over his head and that of dinah lately as he had told beatrice under the oak he had inherited a small sum of money from an aunt and thus things were easier with him the girl fancied that it must be business connected with the payingoff of the mortgage that took him so often to london but on this point he gave her no information the day was hot and drowsy and beatrice clothed in blackfor she paid her stepfather the compliment of wearing mourningsat on an old stone seat between two yew trees cut in the shape of peacocks before her on a slight rise rose the mellow brick walls of the grange covered with ivy a terrace ran along the front of the house and over the door was the mouldering escutcheon of the paslow family what with the queer pointed roofs the twisted stacks of chimneys the diamondpaned casements and the prim gardens the place looked particularly delightful a poet could have dreamed away his days in this rustic paradise and beatrice felt as though she were in the land of the lotoseaters but even as she slipped into vague dreams she pulled herself up and shunned the enchanted ground there was sterner work to do than dreaming before she could become the mistress of this castle of indolence and wife of its master it was necessary to lift the cloud which rested on the place to do so she would have to begin by questioning mrs lilly and impatiently awaited the arrival of that worthy soul towards noon mrs lilly appeared on the terrace and sailed down the broad gardenpath between the lines of brilliant flowers she was stout and comely with white hair and a winterapple face a very honest pleasant old woman was mrs lilly but behind the times it was her boast that she had never been away from the weald of sussex for one solitary day out of a long length of years and she had no patienceas she frequently statedwith the newfangled notions of modern life of which it may be remarked incidentally she knew no more than a child unborn beatrice looked at the housekeepers worn black silk dress at her lace cap and voluminous apron and acknowledged that mrs lilly was a picturesque figure who might have stepped out of the pages of a christmas number the very model of a pompous narrowminded honest kindly old english servant well my dear said mrs lilly who looked on the three young people as children and addressed them accordingly ive got through my work and a wonder it is seeing that polly and mollythese were the two servantsare so lazy but i have had the rooms brushed and the dinner is ordered and everything is in applepie order so here i am ready for a rest and she sat down beside beatrice with a groan remarking on the stiffness of her joints you wont have much rest with me mrs lilly laughed beatrice who knowing the old lady well for some years was quite familiar with her have you got your knitting mrs lilly was always knitting when off domestic duty oh here it is now make yourself comfortable you dear old thing and talk what about asked mrs lilly mounting her spectacles and beginning to click the needles colonel halls death oh my dear said the housekeeper with dismay do you really wish me to tell you about that horrid thing of course and you promised to do so but wouldnt you rather hear about the ghost said mrs lilly in coaxing tones thats an old family legend and ever so much nicer no colonel halls death or nothing why do you wish to know beatrice evaded this question dexterously not thinking it wise to admit mrs lilly into her confidence too largely oh mrs snow talked a lot about it at the inquest i heard about that my dear strange that your stepfather should have been murdered by a man with a black patch over his left eye you agree with mrs snow then that the same man committed the other murder queried mrs lilly musingly i can hardly say that certainly a black patch that could have been worn over an eye was found on the grass under colonel halls window the morning after his murder but the man was not seen then interrupted beatrice no only from the presence of the black patch the detective who had charge of the case thought it had been worn for the purpose of disguise there was a great stir about the matter as colonel hall was well known as a government official he came from some west indian island i believe where he was administrator or something ended mrs lilly vaguely well then tell me all from the beginning mrs snow has very little to go on if that is all about the black patch i saw mr alpennys murderer wearing it you know but neither mrs snow nor any one else saw colonel halls assassin with it on mrs lilly nodded i heard of your experience my dear you should not run about the woods at night it isnt ladylike i wonder you didnt faint with horror when you saw the man i should have had i known of this theory about colonel hall having been killed by such a man as it was i felt too wornout to be startled by anything where ignorance is bliss go on mrs lilly tell me all mrs snow does not know i think she knows a very great deal remarked the housekeeper viciously i never could bear that ladya sour badtempered woman if ever there was one she was a governess you know yes she and mrs hall were at school together and mrs hall made her a kind of companion after the murder and when mrs hall went back to the west indies mrs snowa miss duncan she was thenstopped on and married the rector who was a fool i am quite sure he has regretted ever since that he made her his wife i dont like mrs snow myself said beatrice thoughtfully and who is this lady watson who knew my mother i cannot tell you i have never set eyes on her some school friend of mrs snows i dare say mrs snow always said everybody had been to school with her i believe she told lies finished mrs lilly with great contempt tell me about mrs hall and the colonel he was a tall handsome man very kind and stately in his bearing my dear mr paslowthe father of master vivianknew him very well and asked him to stop here with mrs hall yes but mrs hall only came for one night and that was the night of the murder i dont think she got on well with her husband what was she like to look at a small dark woman very grave and sparing of words i think she had something on her mind she seemed to be very much afraid of her husband and rarely spoke to him she came down with a oneyearold baby and a nursea delicatelooking woman far gone in consumption poor soul just like my mother said beatrice she died of consumption you know mrs lilly at least mr alpenny said so i never saw your mother my dear mr alpenny married a few weeks after the murder and took mrs hedge as i understand she was called to the camp she never came out and no one ever saw her when she was buried everyone was quite amazed to hear that mr alpenny had a wifethough of course it was hinted that he had married he was deeply in love with mrs hall you know lady watson says he was deeply in love with her i dont believe the man was deeply in love with any one save himself declared mrs lilly sharply i detested him and say so even though he is dead and your father my stepfather corrected miss hedge i did not like him myself mrs lilly he was a cruel man he was and had far too much influence with the old master it was then that he got the mortgage on the grange which is such a trouble to master vivian but perhaps lady watson will not be so hard to satisfy as mr alpenny and master vivian may be able to arrange as he has inherited this little sum of money from his aunt i wish he was clear of all these difficulties ended mrs lilly with a sigh go on you have not said a thing about the murder i wonder durban did not tell you about the matter he was colonel halls servant you know beatrice started to her feet quite amazed by this intelligence do you mean to say that durban was colonel halls servant she asked didnt you hear me say so said mrs lilly tartly yes but he never explained that to me there was no need to besides durban doesnt like to speak of the murder of his master he was the colonels servant and came with him from the west indies any one can see that durban has black blood in him it is all very strange murmured the girl sitting down again well i thought so myself as durban never liked mr alpenny however when the colonel was buried and mrs hall went back to the west indies with the baby durban stopped on and when mr alpenny married mrs hedge went to serve at the camp he has been a good friend to me said beatrice ponderingly i wonder why he was a good friend to your mother also i heard i asked durban about your mothers marriage and about your real father mr hedge but he never would tell me anything it is strangestrange mused beatrice quite perplexed over this tangled story and the murder mrs lilly wasted no more time but plunged at once into the middle of the story which beatrice heard to the end without interrupting her more than was absolutely necessary colonel hall came down here to stop as i said resumed the old lady being a dear friend of my late master durban was with him and mr alpenny was in the house at the time later on mrs hall came down with the baby and the nurse and with mrs snow who was then miss duncan but that was not for a week colonel hall had a necklace of diamonds that he had brought from the west indies it was valued at ten thousand pounds and was called the obi necklace as there was some legend attached to it obi is african witchcraft said beatrice like enough said mrs lilly indifferently colonel hall had a lot to do with the black people my master mr paslow warned the colonel that he might have the necklace stolen but the colonel laughed at him it was in a green box which he kept beside his bed the box contained official papers and also the obi necklace i understand that colonel hall intended to give it to his wife but as there was some difference between them he did not give it to her but when she came down she asked him for it he refused and was sharp with her so she went to bed in tears colonel hall also retired at ten oclock the next morning he was found dead in his bed with his throat cut and the obi necklace was gone what happened then asked beatrice breathlessly the police were called in mrs hall was in a fright and grew so ill that she had to be taken up to town and put in some hospital i know that she went from one fainting fit into another and the doctor said that she would die unless she was taken out of the house so she and the baby and the nurse were bundled off to town mrs snowmiss duncan that isstopped on with durban the police could find nothing they found the black patch yes and there were rumours of a man wearing such a patch having been seen in the neighbourhood colonel hall always slept with his window open as he was mad on the subject of fresh air his bedroom was on the first floor of the west wing and the ivy offered a foothold to any one who wanted to climb up as the black patch was found on the grass below the window it was believed that the assassin climbed up the ivy and tried to steal the necklace colonel hall must have awakened but before he could give the alarm he was stunned in some way just like mr alpenny murmured beatrice when he was stunned the assassin cut the poor mans throat continued mrs lilly shuddering ugh it was a sight then the murderer went off with the necklace the police tried to trace him by that but could not do so i expect the necklace was broken up and the stones were sold separately the assassin was never caught never and it is nearly fiveandtwenty years ago so i dont expect he ever will be caught he may be now that he has committed a second crime mrs lilly laid down her knitting and removed her spectacles do you believe it is the same man the crimes are so similar that i believe it is said the girl earnestly colonel hall was stunned and then his throat was cut mr alpenny was treated in the same way colonel hall was robbed of this necklace mr alpenny was robbed also and yet added beatrice looking at mrs lilly i dont believe that in either case robbery was the motive for the crime what other motive could there be asked mrs lilly amazed revenge of some sort in both cases both the victims were stunned and so the plunder could have been easily carried off safely but in each case the assassin cut the throats of his victims that looks like revenge mrs lilly resumed her knitting and shook her head i can tell you nothing more she said after a pause orchard might know a loti always thought that he did who is orchard he was our butler at the time and afterwards went to be a shepherd on the downs yonder and mrs lilly nodded towards the high range of hills spreading fair and green in the sunlight beatrice started mrs snow said something about that she observed thoughtfully why did the man become a shepherd so odd it is oddi always thought it was odd said mrs lilly but you see the sight of the bodycolonel halls bodygave poor orchard a kind of fit and the doctor said he would have to live in the open air at all events he left the house and when we next heard of him he was a shepherd on the downs he is well known i believe and is alive still i have never seen him from that day to this but i daresay if you went up yonder and inquired you would see him he may know something more than i do i shall certainly see him said beatrice i want to learn all i can about this case before mrs lilly could reply a shadow fell on the sward before them they looked up to see a small dirty redhaired man leering at them in an affable way morning lydies said this creature im waterloo chapter xi major ruck a tramp said mrs lilly with dignified disgust however did he get in here i aint no tramp lydies said the man twisting a piece of straw in his rabbit mouth ive got a ouse in town an a box in scotlan an a yatsh at cowes i ave blimme me if i aint a gent at large and devotedhe bowed and leeredto the genteel sect beatrice looked at him with a shiver he wore a suit of clothes too large for him a dirty red wisp round his lean throat and carpet slippers bound with string to his large feet he was of no great height and his shock of red hair made him look even smaller his face was cleanshaven or rather it ought to have been for apparently it had not been touched by a razor for quite a week twisting the straw in his mouth and a ragged cricketing cap in his hairy hands he straddled with his short legs and leered impudently it was the animal eyes of the man that made beatrice shiver they were green and shallow like those of a bird and the expression in them was evil in the extreme the creature evidently had been steeped in iniquity from his cradle and the foulness of his presence marred the perfect beauty of that still garden sleeping in the sunshine so clean and wholesome what do you want asked miss hedge sharply and shortly i wos jest atellin y said waterlooas he called himselfand his voice rasped like a file i wants tsee mr paslow he is in town snapped mrs lilly surveying the creature with still deeper disgust have you a message for him waterloo laid a warty finger on one side of his pug nose and winked in a horribly familiar manner thets tellins said he grinning an not evin to th sect im so fond of does i give myself away oh no not at all by no means you dear things go away cried beatrice putting her handkerchief to her nose for the atmosphere was tainted by the presence of the man if you dont ill call durban this was a happy inspiration as she knew that durban was on the premises the mans eyes flashed still more wickedly ho yuss by all means miss call im and youll see wot youll see he spat out the straw and produced a black pipe which he stuck in his mouth i kin wyte youll be ducked in the horsepond you beast said mrs lilly growing red with anger ill hand you over to the police and durban durban called out beatrice who caught a glimpse of the servant round the corner of the terrace and at once he came running down the steps who is this man durban how dare you come here said durban advancing threateningly on the small man who cringed and whined you were told not to come here at least a dozen times lor whimpered the little man now subdued and servile wot a fuss you do meke mr durban sir i come fur mr paslow i does send him away durban cried beatrice with great disgust durban lifted one finger and at once the tramp went slinking away like a dog with its tail between its legs and like a dog he halted at the hedge which divided the drive from the garden and showed his teeth in an evil snarl beatrice could see the flash of white and could guess that he was snapping like a mad cur who on earth is that she asked durban when the man finally disappeared behind the hedge durban looked pale and wiped his face with a shaking hand hes a creature who did some dirty work for the late master for mr paslow demanded mrs lilly who always spoke of vivians father in that way for mr alpenny explained durban becoming more himself he is an old scoundrel of nearly sixty years of age he doesnt look it said beatrice strange as it may seem to you missy waterloo has his vanity he wears a wig and his teeth are false but he is old and wicked and has been no end of times in prison mr alpenny employed him to do some business in the slums and he was several times down at the camp i think hes a thief i never saw him before durban and youll never see him again missy said the old servant emphatically mr alpenny as i told you had to do with a lot of rogues and vagabonds as many a moneylender has but that sort of thing is all done with waterloo will never trouble you again i am glad of that said the girl who was quite pale his presence seemed to taint the air what a horrible man why does he want to see mr vivian asked mrs lilly sharply durban wheeled quickly he wants to see mr paslow does he hm i wonder why that is i am quite sure you can explain said beatrice who was piqued at being always kept in the dark durban cast a look of pain on her but replied quietly enough perhaps i do missy mr paslow as i told you had something to do with my late masters business i never knew that said beatrice remembering what alpenny had hinted about vivians crimes ridiculous cried mrs lilly bristling master vivian is a gentleman and would not meddle with your alpennys and waterloosbegging your pardon my young lady since mr alpenny was your father my stepfather corrected beatrice againwell durban if you wont tell me ill ask mr paslow myself do missy i am quite sure he can explain and dont trouble your pretty head any more about waterloo as there is trouble enough in the house now what do you mean by that asked the girl her heart giving a bound durban pointed over his shoulder with his thumb i was coming to look for you he said and i am glad that you called me major ruck is in the drawingroom who is he asked mrs lilly he was a friend of my late masters then i hope he is a more respectable friend than the one we have seen said the housekeeper indignantly mercy me and all the silver and china ornaments in the drawingroom and she hurried towards the house it is all right mrs lilly you will find major ruck quite a gentleman and very presentable he is a friend of lady watsons too but mrs lilly never waited to hear this explanation as fast as her stoutness would allow her she ran up the steps of the terrace and disappeared round the corner left alone with durban beatrice asked the question which had been burning her lips ever since she heard that the major was within why has he come durban to ask you to marry him said durban grimly but i dont know him said beatrice alarmed he knows you missythat is he has seen your picture mr alpenny promised him that you should be his wife and as i told you he will not let you slip through his fingers if he can help it durban said the girl after a pause i quite understand that major ruck wanted to marry me when i was supposed to be the heiress of mr alpenny but now that i am poor he has seen your photograph said durban again and meaningly and you think that he is in love with me he did said beatrice resolved to say as little as possible will you not permit me to offer you a chair said ruck casting an admiring glance at her beautiful face beatrice seeing no good reason to refuse accepted the seat he brought forward then ruck sat down on a near sofa with his back to the window and resumed the conversation with great coolness beatrice although prejudiced against him from what her stepfather had said liked his voice and the wellbred manner he possessed all the same she was on her guard no doubt major ruck would betray the cloven hoof before the interview was at an end poor alpenny said the major leaning back on the sofa and twisting his gloves idly i was at school with him and with mr paslow also vivian asked beatrice involuntarily major ruck laughed with his father my dear young lady i am old enough to have vivian for a son paslow alpenny and myself were at rugby a very long time ago i am old enough to be your father and yet said the major insinuatingly as he leaned forward with a smile i have come to offer myself as a husband mr alpenny told me before he died that you were likely to do so said beatrice quite at her ease and mistress of the situation but i cannot guess mr ruck major ruckretired said that gentleman i cannot guess major replied beatrice making the amendment why you should wish to marry me whom you have never seen pardon me i have seen your photograph which was shown to me by my late friend poor alpenny also said the major with emphasis one day i came to the camp and alpenny showed you to me that is impossible said beatrice wondering if he was lying i have always been at the camp and i never saw you you were asleep my dear young ladyasleep in a hammock under the trees my friend alpenny added the major smiling was good enough to offer me a sight of the sleeping beauty i fell in love with you on the spot mr alpenny as we were old friends was not averse to my asking you to be my wife and indeed but for his untimely death i should have come down to propose in a more reasonable way no way can be reasonable in this case major you say you know me from a sight of you in the hammock from your photograph and from the fact that my late friend poor alpenny gave me a very vivid conception of your charming character you seemed to have talked me over thoroughly between you said the girl her face flushing we did confessed ruck candidly i wanted to know if your character was as charming as your face and as fine as your figure i was told by mr alpenny that your character transcended both i think you must be irish major you speak so glibly i was quartered in ireland once said ruck coolly and not far from the celebrated blarney stone at least miss hedge i hope i speak sufficiently glibly to explain thoroughly the reason i wish you to be my wife in spite of her vexation beatrice could not be angry with the man his manners were so charming his voice so fascinating and his whole attitude so devoid of anything approaching rudeness that she was compelled to keep her temper i dont think i quite understand she said at length and suppressed a smile ruck lifted his eyebrows surely my dear young lady your glass tells you the reason i have an eye for beauty i have also an independent income of two thousand a year and a small house in yorkshire i belonged to a good club and you will find my career is well known as regards the army you are a very eligible suitor said beatrice with some scorn in that case i trust you will accept me said the major with easy assurance and especially as your late father wished that the marriage should take place i must decline major mr alpenny was my stepfather and no blood relation of mine there was little love lost between us again i am poorlady watson has mr alpennys money a very charming lady whom i know intimately i am glad she has the money and not you miss hedge as you can acquit me of mercenary motives yes but i dont see why you wish to marry me i can give you three reasons your beauty onethe major checked off his remarks on his fingers the wish of my late friend poor alpenny two and the strong desire of lady watson three what has lady watson to do with my marriage asked beatrice in a fiery tone she was your mothers best friend and that gives her no right to interfere cried miss hedge rising i thank you major ruck for your proposal but i must decline no no dont send me away with a broken heart miss hedge men like you do not break their hearts major theres some truth in that admitted the major our hearts are too tough but seriously speaking he added and his jovial countenance became grave you will be wise to marry me on the three grounds you mentioned asked beatrice disdainfully on a fourth groundor rather i should say for a fourth reason miss hedgei can protect you from what ill tell you when you are mrs ruck i have no intention of being mrs ruck retorted the girl her courage rising as she felt that she was being driven into a corner and i do not understand these hints of danger which are given to me so freely i gave you only one hint said ruck his eyes on her face mr paslow and durban have given me others what does it all mean i should advise you to ask the two men you have mentioned said ruck taking up his hat unless indeed you will change your mind and become the star of my life as my wife you will know everything as miss hedge i fear you must be kept in the dark come now miss hedge be advised i am speaking for your good i am a gentleman welloff and passable in looks why do you refuse me i can explain very shortly i am engaged to mr paslow you will never marry mr paslow said ruck his face darkening before beatrice could ask the reason for this remark the door opened and vivian very pale and defiant entered i heard your last words ruck he said calmly and beg to tell you that you are quite wrong miss hedge will become my wife in two weeksthat ishe bowed to beatriceif she will accept me as her husband chapter xii vivian explains major ruck made no remark but stood silent and motionless ever smiling according to his custom beatrice on the contrary uttered an exclamation of surprise and ran forward to throw herself into vivians arms suddenly she stopped do you mean what you say she asked hesitating i do he replied firmly the obstacle i spoke of has finally been removed and i am free to marry you can i believe this murmured beatrice clasping her hands and looking down doubtfully for a long time you held back from asking me to be your wife although you must have seen that i loved you on the night mr alpenny was killed you proposed and i accepted you ah said major ruck smiling more broadly than ever then continued beatrice still addressing paslow you again changed your mind and said that some obstacle which you then declared was removed again prevented our marriage now you come once more and say much the same as you said before how do i know but what you may change your mind again i have never changed my mind throughout cried vivian impetuously there was an obstacle i thought that it was removed and then i discovered that it still remained now i have made strict inquiries and i learn that i am free what is the obstacle asked beatrice very pale and still doubtful i can tell you that remarked major ruck changing his attitude for the first time this young gentleman is married i was married said paslow as beatrice shrank back with a cry of amazement and as vivian thought of anger but my wife is dead ruck shrugged his shoulders so you say so durban saysso this death certificate says i heard all about my wifes illness as i went to the house where she died i have seen her grave and the doctor gave me this he held out a certificate to beatrice do you not believe me it is so strange she murmured taking the paper and glancing at it in a scared manner and so untrue said major ruck coolly you lie i am not accustomed to be told that i lie said ruck and his eyes narrowed to pinpoints paslow turned his back on him contemptuously i care very little for that he said you and your creatures betrayed me into difficulties for which i have suffered bitterly but now i am free and you can harm me no longer dont be too sure of that mr paslow beatrice saw vivian wince and came forward whatever mr paslow has done she said with dignity i am certain that he is an honourable man bless you for those words my darling major ruck gave a short laugh and did not seem so goodtempered as he had been an honourable man he repeated i fear if you knew all mr paslows life you would see fit to change your opinion vivian restrained himself from violent words of course you talk like that because it is to your interest to stop my marriage but i trust to a womans instinct and he stretched out his hands toward beatrice with an anxious smile she waved him back i must have an explanation first beatrice vivian i love you i shall always love you but can you expect me to blindly believe when i am so much in the dark as to what all these things mean there must be an end to these hints and mysteries if you really love me you will explain fully so that i know where i stand i think i can do that said ruck fondling his moustache then do so said paslow throwing back his head we know a great deal of one another major so it may be to your interest to speak the truth and he looked meaningly at the other man i never tell lies unless they are necessary said ruck calmly in this instance the truth will suit me very well beatrice sat down still holding the certificate of mrs paslows death which seemed to be quite in order i am waiting to hear the truth she said and hear it i will without any invitation major ruck sat down i may as well be comfortable he said lazily and smiled in his most genial manner vivian did not sit down but stood near the window looking out at the fair prospect unseeingly knowing that his past was about to be revealed he seemed nervous and did not look at the girl he loved major ruck was much the coolest of the trio i can tell you the truth very briefly said ruck stretching out his legs as i said i was at school with mr paslows father and also with alpenny some eight years ago this gentlemanhe glanced towards the silent viviancame to town i did what i could to give him pleasure as his father was dead and i desired to do what i could for the son of my old friendthat is true i think he added turning politely to paslow you were extremely kind said vivian stiffly and guardedly thank you mr paslow then had money and i think i showed him london very thoroughly we had a great time pray go on with your story said beatrice icily oh its the truth replied ruck with a genial chuckle i think mr paslow will bear me out in that i have yet to hear what you have to say ruck raised his eyebrows what can i say save that which happened my dear fellowmr paslowhe now addressed himself to beatricemet in town at the house of a friend of mine a certain young lady called maud ellis he fell in love with her i was trapped by a scheming woman you mean put in paslow brusquely fie fie fie said ruck goodhumouredly dont blame the woman my dear fellow that is mean but trapped or not you married her i did and found that she only married me because she thought that i had money so you should have had and a great deal of it but that alpenny managed to collar the estates but you loved her i did not save in the way one loves such women at an early age oh sneered ruck she was perfectly respectable i should not have married her else said vivian quickly and not daring to glance at beatrice i have nothing to say against her save that she was heartless and left me within six months but i repeat that i was young and foolish at the time and that she schemed to marry me i fell into her toils and bitterly have i had to pay for doing so but for her i should have long ago have married miss hedge i dont think alpenny would have permitted that paslow perhaps not but he is dead and cannot harm me now the evil that men do lives after them scoffed ruck alpenny had the power when alive someone else may have the power now not you at all events ruck beatrice rose quickly am i to hear the rest of the story she asked ruck is this all you have to bring against mr paslowthat while a young man he was entrapped into marriage by an adventuress oh maud ellis was no adventuress said the major easily but a very nice girl lady watson knew her well lady watson seems to know everyone retorted beatrice but who knows lady watson i do very well said ruck quietly but we are not discussing her later on should you desire to learn about her i can supply you with all necessary information meanwhile meanwhile repeated beatrice i should like to hear what mr paslow has to say what can i say said vivian with a look of despair i married maud ellis as i said and she left me after six months of a miserable life some times since i saw her but she never would come back to me did you wish her said beatrice quickly she was my wife said vivian calmly and i wished to behave as her husband little as i loved her but she always refused to come back to me i met you and said nothing about my fatal marriage there was no need to it would have been better had you been open i see that now i did not see it at the time but you know that i loved you always and you know now why i did not dare to ask you to be my wife a few weeks ago i heard that maud was ill i went to see her and found that she was suffering from influenza i saw her several times then i heard that she was dead i proposed to you beatrice under the oak later on when i went to town to look after your property and learn if alpenny had done you justice i again went to the house and learned that what i had heard was false maud was extremely ill but still alive then i came down and you know what took place between us i went again and again to town and saw the doctor and your wife also noyes once but she was so ill and my presence disturbed her so much that the doctor would not let me see her again then i went one day and heard that she was dead and buried why did you not go to the funeral asked ruck sneeringly i did not know that she was dead i remained away from the houseit was in kensingtonfor a long time as it was useless for me to go and see her and the doctor always kept me advised as to how she was going on however he gave me no notice of her death and she was buried when i next heard news beatrice expressed surprise but surely the doctor was wrong in not telling you she was dying you should have been with her i should but the doctor neglected to inform me i had a row with him about the matter however i got the certificate which you hold and saw the grave so i am now free to marry youthat is if you will have me after what you have heard beatrice did not reply immediately to this question we can talk of that when we are alone she said and glanced towards ruck who still lounged in his chair that is a hint for me to go he said rising lazily well i shall gounless you will marry me were you the last man in the world i should not marry you said the girl quietly and i do not see why you wish to we talked about that before said ruck taking up his hat but now that the real prince charming has come on the scene i see that there is no chance for me i will allow you to marry paslow allow me cried miss hedge indignantly allow me echoed vivian clenching his fists i will allow you repeated the major smoothly on condition that you give me the obi necklace what asked beatrice starting back colonel halls it was his property i knew him very well interrupted ruck he gave that necklace to mrs hedge to my mother impossible the necklace was stolen when colonel hall was murdered in this very house so it was thought but i know otherwise colonel hall gave the necklace to mrs hedge who was his cousin just before the murder i learned that from alpenny who was in the house at the time and that was why alpenny married mrs hedgehe wanted the necklace and that is why i wished to marry you added ruck smiling blandly as i want the necklace it is valued at ten thousand pounds and alpenny promised to give it to you when we married i dont know how much of this is true or how much is not said beatrice looking puzzled and pressing her hands to her head but i have not got the necklace i never knew that my stepfather had it there is no need for you to get angry major ruck i know nothing about the necklace save what i heard from mrs lilly and she told me that colonel hall was murdered and the necklace was stolen the necklace was given to mrs hedge said ruck who was now very angry and alpenny promised to give it to you if you give it to me i will go out of your life and you can marry paslow if not i can stop this marriage i defy you to do your worst said paslow savagely dont do that it might be dangerous said ruck with a meaning look well miss hedge he turned to beatrice i know nothing about the necklace she replied if you married me you would marry a pauper lady watson has mr alpennys money and if he did receive the necklace from my mother he certainly never gave it to me or even spoke of its existence ruck turned pale and looked at the ground can lady watson have secured it he muttered you had better ask her and now major ruck that i know your real reason for wishing to marry me i may tell you that i would willingly have given the obi necklace to escape such a match and she turned her back on him scornfully the major notwithstanding that he was in the house and in the presence of a lady put on his hat he had quite lost his suave manners and looked thoroughly angry i shall take my leave miss hedge he said bowing ironically marry paslow whenever you choose he is free now as he says but if trouble comes of your marriage do not say that i did not warn you what trouble can come asked beatrice turning like a lioness dont say that you have not been warned said ruck backing towards the door as to myself i shall search for the necklace and get it lady watson may know of its whereaboutspaslow i congratulate you on a possible marriage you cannot stop it ruck said vivian coolly oh i have no desire to do so all i wanted from this lady was the obi necklace as she has not got it there is no need for me to sacrifice my freedom miss hedge goodday paslow goodday and with a bow the major took his gigantic figure out of the room the two young people looked at one another in silence what does it all mean asked beatrice helplessly you heard what ruck said answered vivian he wanted to marry you for the necklace as you have not got it he will trouble you no more in any case he would not trouble me cried beatrice indignantly does major ruck think me a child to be driven into a match about which i care nothing what influence can he have to make me do what he wanted he was playing a game of bluff said vivian eagerly he cannot force you to marry him nor can he stop my marriage he could have done so before because he knew that my wife was alive but now that she is dead his power ceases and beatricehe paused and looked downhow can i ask you to be my wife after what you have heard the girl looked at him in silence had she loved him less she might have refused to answer his appeal as it was her love overcame the momentary anger which she felt at having been kept in the dark at once she moved towards him and placed her arms round his neck we are all sinners she whispered and i love you too well to let you go god bless you my darling faltered vivian pressing her to his breast let the past alone said beatrice kissing him we shall marry and live for one another look with me vivian to a happy future my darlingmy darling and paslow fell on his knees chapter xiii the exbutler it really did seem as though the course of this true love was about to run smooth durban to whom beatrice explained all that had taken place during rucks visit heard what she had to say in silence and seemed relieved when he heard the whole i am glad that mr paslow arrived at the moment said durban when the story was ended he and the major now understand one another i never knew that vivian was acquainted with major ruck he met him at mr alpennys town office missy the major seemed to threaten vivian observed the girl thoughtfully durban shrugged his fat shoulders that is so like the major he retorted carelessly he is all stage thunder now that he knows you have not the necklace he will trouble you no more mr paslow is not rich missy and you have lost the masters money still i should like you to marry the man you love and go away why do you want me to go away she demanded peremptorily it will be better murmured durban uneasily you are still keeping something from me durban nothing that is necessary for you to know missy beatrice saw very well that the old servant was fencing and wondered what it was that he feared the necklace she said suddenly i do not know where it is missy did you ever see it once colonel hall showed it to mea very fine set of diamonds where did colonel hall get it i cannot saysomewhere in the west indies i think you were colonel halls servant in the west indies durban i was missy durban looked at her with fire in his dark eyes he was the best of masters and i loved him he brought me to this place with him and here he met with his death do you know who killed him no missy i do not why did you take service with mr alpenny i was poor said durban with a shrug and my master the colonel was dead i had no home and i was thankful to accept the situation i might not have stayed in it for so long missy but that mr alpenny married it was you who have kept me at the camp all these years and what about mrs hall nothing missy she was a silent lady i know very little about her durbanbeatrice looked at him keenlyare you telling me the truth i am missy why should i tell you a lie all i know of mrs hall is that she was the daughter of a west indian planter who was my fathers master in the time of slavery i was born on the estate and afterwards entered the service of colonel halla captain he was thento whom i became greatly attached he saw mrs hall and fell in love with her they married but did not get on well together for what reason i cannot tell you they came here to see mr paslows father who was an old friend of the colonels mrs hall stopped in london for a time and then came down for one night with the nurse and her child my master was murdered and the necklace disappeared that is all i know but durban major ruck says that the colonel gave the necklace to my mother before his death that is not true cried durban vehemently and his eyes blazed there was no reason why he should give it totomrs hedge and i saw the necklace in the colonels hands on the very night the crime was committed yes and i saw him place it in the green box beside his bed next morning the window was open the colonel was lying dead with a cut throat and the obi necklace was gone i can tell you no more and i dont know why you wish to know all this because said beatrice slowly it is my belief that the same man with the black patch who murdered colonel hall murdered mr alpenny and in both cases i believe that the murder was committed for the sake of this necklace i did not know that mr alpenny had it missy major ruck says that he had and married my mother for the sake of the necklace which doubtlessas it has not been found after his deathhe turned into money it might be so murmured durban moodily major ruck knew a great deal about mr alpenny which i did not know he was a kind of decoy duck to the mastera man about town who brought foolish youths to borrow money a dangerous man missy and one you are well rid of missyhe laid his hand on her armbe advised seek to know no more mr alpennys life was not a good one or a clean one marry mr paslow and go away ill think of it durban said beatrice after a few moments of thought and there the conversation ended for the time being all the same beatrice had no idea of going away she even thought that she would not marry vivian paslow until things were made clear and sheso to speakknew where she stood what with vivians marriage to maud ellis and the late mr alpennys hints that the young man had committed crimes there was much in paslows life which she did not understand had she loved him less she would have had nothing more to do with him but she did love him with all her heart and soul consequently she believed that he was more sinned against than sinning it was nothing out of the common that a young man in london should be entrapped into such a marriage and after all it was not unusual that vivian should strive to hide from herthe woman he really lovedthe folly of which he had been guilty eight years ago that she could forgive and did forgive and was ready to marry her lover as soon as he wished but she could not rid herself of a vague fear that if she did marry him it would only be the beginning of fresh misery durbans desire that the young couple should go away seemed to her ominous and vivian although under stress of circumstances had confessed the marriage did not seem to be communicative regarding the other mysteries what if at the back of all these things lurked some terrible scandal which might ruin her happiness and that of paslows while thinking thus it occurred to beatrice that she had never learned what vivian had done on that night when he left her under the witches oak they were together walking in the garden after dinner when she considered this question and she asked vivian at once to explain he removed his cigar and looked at her searchingly what a woman you are to ask questions he said with a forced laugh i want them answered said beatrice rather imperiously vivian shrugged his shoulders i am not averse to doing so he said in a weary manner well on that night i left you and ran to see who was watching it was a redheaded little beast called waterloo employed as a spy by mr alpenny i know himi have seen him seen him vivian started and looked uneasy whenwhere in this very garden and beatrice related how the tramp had suddenly appeared to mar the beauty of the scene he wanted to see you she concluded but durban sent him away had i seen the brute i should have horsewhipped him cried the young man angrily he was a spy of alpennys on meon you on us both alpenny knew that i loved you and did not want us to meet he told waterloo who was hanging round the camp to keep his eye on you and on me waterloo confessed did you catch him yes i did and nearly broke his neck he confessed that he had been set to watch by mr alpenny and had been lurking outside the great gates of the camp i saw him said beatrice recalling the vague shadow which she had seen crouching in the shade on that fatal night he saw you go past went on paslow and followed to the witches oak like your shadow when i caught him he told me all this so i gave him a kicking and let him go the dog was not worth fouling my hands with then i went back to the oak to find you you had gone so i fancied that you had gone home i did not follow as i thought that i might run up against alpenny and that there would be more trouble i went home to the grange and then was coming along the next morning to see you and give you the key when i met durban it was then that you heard of the murder yes and afterwards went up to town to see alpennys lawyer about your chances of getting the money you see beatrice major ruck and other creatures employed by alpenny were quite capable of destroying the will so as to get the money themselves but how could they do that by bribing or blackmailing the lawyer of alpenny the man is not above reproach as he did much dirty work for alpenny ruck knows of many of these underhanded dealings and on hearing of alpennys death it struck me that ruck might try to force the lawyertuft is his nameto destroy any will that might be made in your favour by threatening to communicate with the police however i saw tuft and he produced the will it was genuine enough as i know alpennys handwriting very well the money was left as you know to lady watson i believe that years ago alpenny admired her although i do not see why he should leave her such a large fortune and cut you out he hated me said beatrice sadly he always did before he died he told me to expect nothing and i am a pauper as you know vivian she said suddenly let us put off our marriage for a time i can go out as a governess and we can wait why should we wait he asked quickly and his arms went round her in a firm embrace are you sure murmured beatrice that if i marry you all trouble will be at an end quite sure my first wife is dead so i can take a second ruck and those other beasts cannot harm me now no beatrice we shall marry in a week as you promised i have no weddingdress that does not matter i marry you and not your clothes if we postpone our marriage it may never take place why not because there are those who would stop me from marrying you not ruckhe can do nothing beatricehe caught her hands and looked deep into her eyesi own to you that i have been a fool my marriage with that adventuress introduced me into strange company i will not tell you now what straits i have been in and what trouble i have undergone only trust me and marry me i shall then tell you the whole of my lifes history believe me there is nothing in it for which you will cease to love me my worst sin is having kept this first marriage from you i will trust you whispered beatrice who was much perplexed but is it not possible to clear up these mysteries you may clear them up said vivian after a moments hesitation i cannot help youi dare not he ended and abruptly left her what did it all mean beatrice asked herself that question again and again but without receiving any answer but for her overwhelming love she would have hesitated to step forward in the dark as she really was doing when consenting to this marriage but she felt that vivian needed her aid and that only when they were man and wife would that aid be of any real service she made no attempt to continue the conversation when they met again in the drawingroom nor did she seek out the old servant to ask questions but since vivian hinted that by her own unaided efforts she might arrive at the truth whatever it might be she determined to search on in one way or another she was resolved with all the force of her strong nature to put an end to these provoking mysteries it was for this reason that the next morning found her climbing the downs vivian had gone with dinah into brighton and beatrice alleging the death of her stepfather as a reason for retirement had remained at home in reality she wanted to trace out orchard the exbutler who had turned shepherd and whom mrs lilly had told her of from that elderly dame beatrice obtained the information that orchard lived on the downs in a little wooden hut like the savage maid in the popular song and having gained a fair notion of its whereabouts she set out to seek the man he had been in the house at the time of colonel halls murder and apparently had seen something had he not done so his nerves certainly would not have been so shattered as to make him give up the comfortable profession of a butler for the hard life of a shepherd certainly he might refuse to speak out as he assuredly had not told the police anything likely to lead to the discovery of colonel halls assassin but beatrice had great faith in her womans wiles and in the power of her tongue to get what she wanted it was the sole way in which she could do so as she had no money wherewith to tempt the old man but then so patriarchal a person might be above bribery and corruption it was a divine day and the breezes were blowing freshly across the spacious downs from the distant channel beatrice loved to look on these wide spaces of green and to watch the sheep moving across the closeshorn turf which they kept in such good order a miles walk brought her into the vicinity where mrs lilly had informed her that orchard watched his flock and she speedily saw the hut a tiny box of a house roofed with turf and standing on the downs without railing or fence or garden round itjust like a house that had lost its way fate favoured her and she took it as a good omen when she saw the old man seated at the door eating his midday meal he was bent and whiteheaded and had a long white beard in fact he might have passed for father christmas had he been appropriately dressed his eyes were faded blue and mild and he seemed in no wise disturbed when she approached good day miss said the exbutler good day responded beatrice will you let me sit down i have been walking for some time certainly miss said orchard with the deference of a former indoor servant but the air will do you good i suppose miss you are one of the gentry from brighton they often come up here to breathe the air and get appetites sit down miss by this time he had brought out a stool and beatrice sat down with a weary air for she really was tired i come from the weald she said waving her hand towards the luxurious verdure of the valley below i live there a very nice place miss i lived there once myself at convent grange said beatrice glad to see that orchard was disposed to be communicative he turned a mild look of surprise on her and considered her face attentively why yes miss he replied although i dont know how you come to know that mrs lilly told me orchard let a glimmering smile rest on his pale lips sarah lilly he said musingly ah i have not seen her since we were fellowservants togetherand that was long ago i might have married her miss as we liked one another but she was married and i was married so we couldnt come together i should think not said beatrice smiling at the grave way in which the old shepherd spoke mrs lilly is a great friend of mine is she miss and no doubthe considered her still more attentivelymrs lilly told you how i came to be a shepherd yes she told me that i did it for my nerves said orchard looking away at the treeless green expanse they were shattered by the terrible calamity which happened in that house the air here cured me do you know who killed colonel hall you are the first person who has asked me that question for many years miss time was when many did so but the colonel has been buried these fiveandtwenty years and his terrible death is quite forgotten i dont know who killed himfor certain that is miss have you no suspicion oh yes said orchard calmly i believe that mr alpenny murdered colonel hall to get a certain necklace that cannot be true said beatrice aghast a major ruck i dont know him interpolated orchard well he says that colonel hall gave the necklace to my mother and who was your mother miss mrs hedge who married mr alpenny cried orchard rising suddenly to his feet and really startled out of his mildness yes mr alpenny is now dead and i knowi know said orchard waving his hand he met with the due reward of his wickedness i can talk of him later and ill tell you why i suspect him mrs hedges daughterthe colonels child what cried beatrice springing to her feet mr alpenny never told you i suppose said orchard coolly but he married mrs hall who took the name of mrs hedge because she was suspected of being concerned in the crime you are miss hallmiss beatrice hall chapter xiv mrs snows past beatrice waited to hear no more as a sensible woman she should have remained where she was to question the old shepherd and learn why he stated so firmly that she was the daughter of colonel hall who had been murdered so cruelly at the grange but the mere fact of the announcement startled her and without pausing she rushed away as though to escape from her thoughts orchard looked after her in mild surprise but did not call her back although her action must have puzzled him the exbutler seemed to have outlived all curiosity or else the downs had cured his nerves so thoroughly that he did not feel startled however be this as it may he returned to his dinner and sat watching the slowlymoving sheep without giving a thought to the young lady who had called upon him how beatrice descended the slope of the downs into the valley she never knew her brain was filled with the information she had so strangely gained she was not beatrice hedge but beatrice hall the daughter of the dead man who had owned the necklace ruck asserted that the colonel had given the necklace to his wife before the murder as mrs alpenny who called herself mrs hedge and who really was mrs hall had been the wife of the colonel this was not unlikely alpenny finding that she possessed the necklace might have married her to gain possession of the same but what beatrice could not understand was why her mother should have married the usurer it was true that he had always been her admirer as durban himself had stated but from accepting attentions to marrying the man who paid them was a long step mrs hall had taken it under the name of mrs hedge and again beatrice wondered what the reason could be durban must have known this truth he had been the faithful servant of colonel hall and had always spoken of him with love and admiration if shebeatricewere the colonels child the adoration of durban for herself would be explained he loved her because he had loved her dead father but why had durban held his tongue over the marriage and had allowed everyone to think that alpenny had married a mrs hedge durban as beatrice well knew had no love for alpenny yet he had said nothing likely to prevent such a match certainly durban might not have had the power but there appeared no reason why he should have concealed the truth from his dead masters child beatrice was beginning to see light there was some mystery concerning her which had to do with her fathers murder with the missing necklace and probably with the murder of alpenny himself durban now might tell the truth and explain matters seeing that she already knew so much then again he might refuse to speak out and she would be as much in the dark as ever major ruck doubtless knew the truth from alpenny although he had declared that mrs hedge was the cousin of colonel hall but beatrice remembering his hesitation in making the statement was certain that ruck was cognisant of the real state of affairs was vivian paslow likewise enlightened she could not be certain of this vivian might or might not know but he assuredly had some secret on his mind which he refused to impart to her until the marriage took place had that secret to do with her real parentage which had been revealed to her by orchard beatrice was minded then and there to ask vivian for the truth but she could not do so on the spur of the moment much as she wished to since vivian was at brighton with dinah and would not be back for some hours durban certainly was at the camp but beatrice very naturally considering his attitude was doubtful if he would speak out at the foot of the downs and when on the road leading to hurstable village she paused to think what was best to be done she half regretted that she had not stopped with orchard to learn more it would be just as well she thought to go back but a glance at the steep wall of the downs led her to change her mind she could not face that weary climb again as her nerves were shattered by the communication which had changed her life then it occurred to her that mrs snow knew her mother mrs snowthen miss duncanhad been at convent grange when colonel hall was murdered she must have known that the socalled mrs hedge was really mrs hall and must have known also the reason why mrs hall under a feigned name had married jarvis alpenny mrs snow declared herself to be a dear friend of mrs hall why then did she hate beatrice who was the daughter of that same dear friend that mrs snow hated her beatrice was convinced as she had pointedly neglected her throughout five and twenty years yes mrs snow would be the best person to question and having made up her mind rapidly the girl took her way to the vicarage of hurstable mrs snow looking more sour and elderly than ever was in the garden engaged in the arcadian pastime of gathering roses for decorative purposes she was a good housekeeper and liked to see a dainty dinnertable notwithstanding her disagreeable nature she made the vicar and his son comfortable enough and really loved them both in her sour way jerry indeed was the apple of her eye and it was for this reason that she resented his engagement to dinah paslow with any other girl it would have been the same it was not the individual maiden that mrs snow hated but the girl who took her son to be a husband for the sake of her own selfishness which she miscalled maternal love she would have liked jerry to remain a bachelor all his life just to please her and bestow all his affection on his dear mother but the young man himself had not found that affection although it really existed strong enough to fill his life therefore he had asked dinah to marry him and so strongly had he held his own on the subject that mrs snow had been won over so far as to receive dinah as a future daughterinlaw mrs snow said beatrice when she entered the pretty grounds of the vicarage i wish to speak to you particularly the vicars wife looked sourly at her visitor she hated beatrice because of her beauty amongst other things and when she saw that same beauty was somewhat worn and haggard that the girl looked ill and had lost her vivacity she felt pleased quite washed out said mrs snow to herself and thus became more amiable laying down the scissors with which she had been clipping the flowers she advanced with what was meant to be an ingratiating smile my dear miss hedge i am so pleased to see you this is the first time that you have called come inside please thank you i prefer to remain in the garden and take up as little of your time as possible mrs snow stiffened what an extraordinary tone to take with me she said with the offended air of a thorough egotist can you wonder at it we know so little of one another that is as it may be snapped mrs snow wondering what her visitor had come to see her about i may know more of you than you think for that reason i come to see you said beatrice calmly her hostess started but speedily recovered her calmness i really do not know what you mean miss hedge she said composedly i think you know this much that i am not miss hedge oh said mrs snow her sallow face flushing an uneasy red will you not be seated thank you beatrice moved towards a garden seat at the far end of the lawn but mrs snow touched her arm and pointed to a sidepath i have a very secluded arbour there she said significantly where we cannot be overheard and she led the way down the path the whole world may hear what i have to say declared beatrice boldly and resolved to be a party to no mystery but the whole world said mrs snow stopped with a disagreeable smile may not hear what i may have to saythat is if you press me i want to hear everything said the girl sharply for that reason i have come to you i fear you will go away less easy in your mind than you came beatrice shrugged her shoulders my mind has been uneasy ever since the death of my stepfather she retorted is this the place this is the place assented the vicaress it wasas mrs snow had stateda very secret place the path ended in a kind of semicircular enclosure surrounded by a high hedge of hawthorn the arbour faced the path so that any one seated therein could see an intruder advancing along the path the haven of rest was of light trelliswork overgrown with roses and had a comfortable wooden seat at the back and two basket chairs in front of this with a small greenpainted table between beatrice sank into one of the chairs and mrs snow subsided into the other the table was between them and the two glanced at one another when seated mrs snow looked as sour as ever but there lurked a watchful look in her eyes which a more discerning person than the visitor would have seen at once beatrice on her part having nothing to conceal was perfectly open and caring very little for what mrs snow had to say resolved that whatever it might be she would bind herself to no secrecy the scene being set the actresses spoke beatrice politely waited to give mrs snow a chance of opening the conversation while mrs snow was equally determined that her visitor should speak first under these circumstances a silence ensued which lasted for quite two minutes mrs snow being the most impatient yielded first to the desire to use her tongue you spoke very strangely just now miss hedge she said and purposely uttered the name to evoke frank speech from beatrice miss hall if you please said the girl falling into the trap oh miss hall replied the other flushing i never knew that your mother was called hall as she was your dearest friendyou told me as muchi fancy you must have had some idea perhaps said mrs snow looking down uneasily then she raised her face with a frown who told you this a man called orchard you may know of him mrs snow i have no reason to deny that i know of him he was the late mr paslows butler and became a shepherd on the downs because the doctor said he would have to live in the open air why did he not tell you his nerves were so shattered by that horrid murder which took place at the grange twentyfive years ago you allude to the murder of my father to the murder of colonel hall corrected mrs snow snappishly my father was colonel hall so this man orchard says sneered the other her face flushing and her hands opening and shutting and so i believe come now mrs snow you must tell me what you know of this matter i know nothing perhaps miss duncan may be able to tell me ahthe vicars wife laughed carelesslyyou know my maiden name and perhaps my occupation before i married my husband i heard that you were a governess who said so durban in that case since he has been so frank i wonder that he did not tell you how mrs hallyour motherkilled the colonel beatrice started to her feet you dare to say that yes i do cried mrs snow venomously she killed your father to gain possession of a diamond necklace and married alpenny because he could have accused her of the murder that is not true said beatrice closing her eyes with horror it is true i can prove it why did you not do so twentyfive years ago because your mother was my friend mrs snowbeatrice opened her eyes and leaned across the tableyou were never my mothers friend the woman moved uneasily and her hands were restless had i not been so your mother would have stood in the dock ah you had your own reason for keeping quiet do you mean to accuse me of being her accomplice said mrs snow rising and scowling sit down please beatrice pushed her back into the chair how dare you gasped mrs snow i was never treated before so in the whole course of my life and she made to rise again again beatrice pushed her back i am stronger than you mrs snow she said scornfully you shall sit down and you shall tell me everything you know and if i do not ill go at once to the police mrs snow turned white to the police yes listen i believe that the man with the black patch who murdered my father colonel hall also murdered mr alpenny my mother is entirely innocent and were she alive she would say so mrs snow laughed at this remark but in a hollow manner yes you may laugh mrs snow but what i say is true resumed beatrice firmly and if you dont tell me all you know i shall tell the police that you accuse my mother and say that you can substantiate your accusation when arrested you may be forced to speak out arrested how dare you mrs snow was furious how can i be arrested when the murder of your father took place twentyfive years ago it is ridiculous oh no this second murder has to do with the first so that will bring the death of my father uptodate speak out or i go at once to brighton and then you will not dare gasped the vicaress in a cowed tone i give you three minutes to make up your mind mrs snow i dont want one minute i shall tell you all i knowall i believe to be true your mother is guilty was guilty since she is dead corrected beatrice quietly and i do not believe one word you hated her in spite of the fact that she wasas you sayyour dearest friend you are right cried mrs snow with hysterical vehemence i did hate heralwaysalways she took from me the man i loved yes you may look and look but i loved george hall your father with all my heart i was only a governess poor and plain your mother was a planters daughter rich and beautiful we were at school together i was her companion afterwards but i always detested her and now now you detest her daughter finished beatrice you have your mothers beauty said mrs snow and cast a venomous look on the girls pale face so this is the reason you kept away from the camp and spoke of me to others so bitterly as you did yes you may as well know the truth i hate you you have the beauty of your mother who stole george hall away from me but you have not the money i saw to that how could you prevent my inheriting the money i suppose you allude to mr alpennys fortune because i told mr alpenny if he left the money to you that i would accuse him of being an accomplice of mrs hall in her murder of the colonel miss hedge or miss hall or whatever you like to call yourself i hate you so much that i would like to put the rope round your neck yet i am the daughter of the man you loved said beatrice wondering at this bitterness all the more reason i should hate you his daughteryes and the daughter of amy hall whom i loathed with all my soul if so why did you not accuse her of the murder i gave her a chance of repentance no mrs snow that was not the reason you did not tell the police because you could not prove your accusation for all i knowfor all the police knowyou may have murdered my father yourself mrs snow laughed scornfully i murder george hall why i loved the very ground he trod on you can prove nothing against me nor can you prove anything against my mother can i not mrs snow rose and flung her arms about exultingly i was stopping at the grange i was lying awake on that night wondering when my misery would end what misery the misery of loving your father and of seeing him with your mother but i sowed dissension between them they were never happy you wicked woman i am a woman and that answers all said mrs snow sullenly i dont mind telling you all this as you cannot accuse me of anything if you did say that i told you what i am now telling you i should deny it and who would believe you against a respectable woman like me you are a wicked woman said beatrice again go on with what you have to say i want to get away from you as soon as possible you may not be in such a hurry to leave me on a future occasion retorted mrs snow you and i have not done with one another yet i know much that you would like to know what is that ill tell you later meanwhile i tell you that i was lying awake and heard a noise i stole out and saw mrs hall ready dressed to go out into the passage she was at the head of the stairs and with her was old alpenny for he was old even then they stopped talking for a time as i saw and he apparently was persuading her to do something then they went along towards the wing where colonel hall slept i went back to bed wondering what mrs hall meant by keeping a midnight appointment with old alpenny i never suspected the truth next morning the necklace was gone and george hall murdered and she did it shouted mrs snow savagely sheyou mother alpenny was her accomplice he wished to get the necklace he was afraid to kill george hall himself and made a woman do it then she got the necklace after she cut poor georges throat and alpenny made her marry him under a threat of denouncing her as what she was a murderessa murderessyouyou daughter of one jeered mrs snow pointing a mocking finger at the pale girl you lie said beatrice shaken but not convinced a black patch was found under the window of my fathers room it was open and now that a man with a black patch killed mr alpenny for the necklace for all i know i believe he also killed my father you admit that mr alpenny had the necklace how did he get it orchard said that alpenny killed my father no your mother did alpenny was merely the accomplice wait major ruck declared that colonel hall gave the necklace before his death to mrs hedge now i know that mrs hedge was really mrs hall i believe him father gave my mother the necklace and doubtless what else you say is true my mother was forced to marry alpenny because he threatened to denounce her she must have been suspected of the crime i can see that plainly else she would not have changed her name to hedge i wonder she was not recognised no one knew her here said mrs snow gloomily she was only one night at convent grange and on that night her husband was murdered pshaw she is guilty i dont believe it insisted beatrice rising defiantly but i will prove the truth of what you say durban must speak out now and he will accuse your mother as i accuse her why did durban go to serve alpenny for nothing because alpenny wishing to get a faithful servant for nothing said he would denounce mrs hall unless she married him and brought durban with her durban knows the truth but he has kept silent all these years because he dared not speak out without hanging mrs hall she is dead now so nothing can be done said beatrice sadly but at least her memory can be cleared and i shall clear it if you delve into your mothers past you will find more things than murder in it said mrs snow sneeringly she loved major ruck what she loved major ruck i tell you he also was at convent grange on the night the crime was committed and i believe that your mother was about to elope with him when i saw her dressed at midnight with alpenny talking to her oh said beatrice coldly i thought that she was thereas you sayto murder my father she intended to do so and then elope with ruck but alpenny caught her in his toils for all i know i may have seen her talking after the murder and alpenny may have gone with her to get the necklace you make out a very pretty case mrs snow said beatrice her heart beating loudly and quickly for the weight of evidence did seem to be against mrs hall however i shall see durban and then come again to see you good day and she moved away while mrs snow laughed chapter xv a curious coincidence it was all very strange thought beatrice as she walked towards convent grange she had learned much from orchard and from mrs snow yet apparently there was more to learn who had killed colonel hall who had murdered jarvis alpenny was the assassin one and the same and if she found the assassin would she learn who possessed the necklace which seemed to account for both crimes finally did she discover the identity of the assassin and the necklace would she be able to learn the mystery which lurked in the background of vivians life these were the questions which beatrice asked herself on the way home in spite of mrs snows assertion and significant tale of the midnight meeting with alpenny the girl could not bring herself to believe that her mother was guilty a woman would never think of cutting a mans throat and probably when a frail little woman such as mrs hall was reported to have been would not have the power then again alpenny was murdered in the same way and mrs hall had been lying in hurstable churchyard for years also if mrs hall was guilty what had the black patch which had reappeared in the second crime to do with the first one it seemed impossible that these riddles could be answered on arriving at the grange beatrice found dinah and jerry snow walking down the avenue apparently they had been quarrelling for they did not walk arm in arm as usual and jerry was as sulky as dinah was tearful whatever is the matter asked beatrice stopping its jerrys cruelty mourned dinah whose sorrow made her look even plainer than usual its dinahs foolishness retorted jerry and walked on come back cried the girl or ill never never never speak to you again do you wish to break my heart youre breaking it yourself grumbled the young man all the same he returned to where the two girls were standing and after all i have put up with from your mother complained dinah oh leave my mother alone i wish she would leave me alone she is always highly disagreeable to me i believe it is a family failing concluded dinah spitefully dont marry me then i dont intend toyouyou bear beatrice listened to all this with covert amusement she knew that the two loved one another too well to think of parting whatever might be the grounds of their quarrel come come she said soothingly and prepared to play the part of peacemaker what is the matter is jerry jealous no snapped dinah i amvery jealous heshe pointed to jerry who still looked sulkyhas been flirting with another girl i was in the village an hour ago and there was jerry as bold as brass talking to a redhaired minx who squinted she doesnt squint growled jerry there you see he defends her dinah cried jerry in desperation how can you be so silly i love you and you only you love that horrid girl i saw her looking at you a cat may look at a king she certainly is a cat though youre not a king well said beatrice preparing to move on i am going back to the house and you two can settle it yourselves dinah clung to her friend no i wont be left alone with jerry well then explain said beatrice impatiently for she had too many worries of her own to take any profound interest in the frivolous ones of these milkandwater lovers ill explain said mr snow defiantly there is a young lady i know in london young cried dinah shes thirtyfive and painted well then she came down here to the inn and i met her outside she exchanged a few words with me and said that she wanted to know the nearest way to the downs it seems that her father is a shepherd on the downsa man called orchard what cried beatrice disengaging herself from dinahs too fond embrace she could scarcely believe her ears that she should come from seeing the exbutler for the first time to stumbleso to speakacross his daughter was indeed an extraordinary coincidence jerry looked at her amazed as he could not understand her tone why do you look so astonished he asked i have only lately come down from seeing orchard she said oh by the way dinah she added turning to the girl vivian came back with you from brighton no said dinah crossly he had to see someone and will not be back until late i came home myself and passed through the village to see jerry making love to that horrid girl and jerry had the coolness to follow me only to explain urged jerry come dinah dont be silly i know the lady only a little she is on one of the papers belonging to our editorial firm and does the fashion column she might dress better then retorted dinah crossly and determined not to be appeased i saw cheapness in every line of her dress ah said jerry artfully she cannot set off a dress like you dont be silly cried miss paslow but smiled for all that what is this ladys name asked beatrice ladydinah tossed her headwhen her father is a shepherd and i dare say a very bad one miss maud carr is her name said mr snow ignoring dinah much to her wrath maud beatrice remembered that this was also the name of vivians dead wife and again wondered at the long arm of coincidence i know very little about it or her said jerry in an injured tone save that she writes about womens fashions we have met at journalistic clubs in london and of course when i saw her i passed the time of day with her you passed an hour snapped dinah and very pleasantly im sure shes not a bit ashamed of her birth continued jerry still ignoring dinah as a punishment i never knew her father was a shepherd in london but she confessed it to me here quite easily thats her artfulness commented dinah why are you so curious about this woman she asked beatrice the girl shrugged her shoulders i am not curious she denied but as i have just seen old orchard it is strange that his daughter should have been speaking to jerry not at all beatrice jerry is always fond of these painted horrid women who never pay for their dresses because they write for fashion papers i should be ashamed to earn my living in that waywellshe faced round to the impenitent mr snowand what have you to say nothing said jerry crossly you are always nagging dinah after that cried miss paslow looking up to see why the heavens did not fall well imim words failed her and she turned her back im going home all is at an end and she sped up the avenue glancing back meanwhile on occasions to see if jerry followed but jerry did nothing of the sort and explained to beatrice why he stood his ground dinah needs a lesson he said gravely you have no idea how she nags at me i cant speak to any one without her getting into a pelting rage it shows how she loves you said beatrice soothingly i dont want to be loved in that selfish way its just like mother she wants all ones affection and nags the whole time saying it is for my good ive had quite enough of that in mother without taking it on in a wife i want a woman who will cheer me up and look upon me as something to be looked up to but ill punish her said jerry wrathfully she expects me to run after her i wont ill stay here and talk to you im busy said beatrice taking a step or two away i have to go to the camp to see durban you neednt hes at convent grange looking for you oh then ill go to him at once better wait to hear what i have to say urged jerry its about the murder of mr alpenny beatrice stopped short wondering what she was about to hear have you discovered anything she asked breathlessly i cant say if what i have discovered is of any use explained mr snow but it might put the police on the track of the assassins what have you found out well i was down whitechapel the other night said jerry making an inquiry into some robbery that has taken place there was a detective with me and we saw all manner of queer things also we heard all manner of queer talk in one way and another we picked up information about the black patch gang the black patch gang echoed beatrice yesyes its a gang of rogues thieves and vagabonds went on mr snow the police have never been able to lay hands on the head of the gang or break it up this gang goes about committing burglaries and stealing things and picking pockets they must have a kind of academy like fagins mused jerry and they know one another by a black patch worn over the left eye just like the man i saw yes i thought of that when i heard the story said jerry and the detective thought the same he is going to hunt out this gang and learn the whereabouts of their headquarters and beatricehe moved forward to place a cautious hand on her armit struck mei dont know if it struck the detective but it struck me that alpenny who was a precious scoundreli beg your pardon go on she said impatiently i know he was my stepfather but i always thought him a wicked man myself i believe he was a fence said jerry solemnly what is that the chap who disposes of stolen goods yes i really believe that was why alpenny lived in the country the black patch gang brought their stolen goods down here and he got rid of them in some way i expect the police will come down and make a thorough search throughout the camp there may be all manner of secret hidingplaces but jerry protested beatrice who was very pale as various thoughts rushed through her mind i never saw any london thieves in the camp or indeed any one disreputable did you ever see any client asked jerry impressively no mr alpenny kept his business very quiet he had need to if he was a fence beatrice remember how the keys were in the countinghouse where the man was murdered and how the assassin could not have got out unless he used the keys i believe there is another entrance to that railway carriage and the assassin came in by that way along with the rest of alpennys precious clients i am quite sure the old man was the head of the gang there was waterloo i know said jerry quickly dinah told me about him and mrs lilly told her waterloo is a blackguard the detective in whitechapel explained what a scoundrel he wasone of the worst why did he come down here i dont know murmured beatrice and then it flashed across her mind that the tramp had come to see vivian coupling this desire with the speech of the late jarvis alpenny regarding vivians crimes and vivians secret troubles which she was so anxious to find out the girl suddenly turned pale she wondered if paslow himself was one of the black patch gang its impossible said beatrice with a gasp and leaned against a tree to support herself what is impossible asked jerry here hold up its all right she said recovering herself with a violent effort a little weariness that is all i have been on the downs remember i dont see how you can connect this gang with mr alpenny remember he was murdered by a man with a black patch over his eye yes but the girl broke off i hope the police wont come down here she said with palelips and wondering if vivians conduct would bear investigation they just will said jerry bluntly and i hope so ill be able to make a lot out of the matter if any loot is found why the editor may raise my salary you arent worth it cried an indignant voice near at hand and dinah appeared from amongst the trees how dare you treat me in this way jerry snow why didnt you come after me and why didnt dinah asked beatrice hurriedly have you been listening long no all i heard was that jerry wanted his salary raised what has he been talking about and she eyed the two suspiciously are you jealous of beatrice demanded mr snow scornfully what nonsense when you know she is going to marry vivian and i really dont think ill marry you take back your ring and beatrice waited to hear no more leaving dinah pouring out her voluble wrath on the devoted head of her lover she ran up the avenue wondering what further revelations she would hear this was a day of wonders she had learned that she was the daughter of colonel hall she had heard her dead mother accused of murder by mrs snow and now she discovered that alpennyas was probably the casehad been connected with a gang of rogues what would be the end of all these terrible things she could not tell and ran on anxious to reach her own room in order to think matters over she quite forgot that jerry had told her durban was waiting to see her but the old servant was on the watch hardly had she set foot on the terrace when he issued from the house and came towards her with a smile it died away however when he saw her pale face whatever is the matter missy he asked anxiously beatrice looked at him calmly and wasted no time in explaining herself i have learned at last what you would not tell me missy cried durban and his swarthy face grew green as it always did when he was startled i am the daughter of colonel hall who was murdered here my mother was really mrs hall who called herself mrs hedge and married alpenny durban gasped who told you this orchard who was the butler here and now is a shepherd on the downs it is true said durban flinging wide his hands i knew you would find out i am glad you have found out why did you not tell me i was prevented by whom first by alpenny and then by major ruck the man with whom my mother was about to elope durban looked at her swiftly orchard never told you that no mrs snow told me you have seen her then you know i know that she accuses my mother of the crimeof the murder of my father colonel hall that is a lie said durban between his teeth but she would not stick at a lie to harm your mother how can she harm the dead she might harm the memory of the dead said durban evasively and what else have you heard from mr jerry snow i have just heard that there is a gang of thieves in london called the black patch gang augh groaned durban casting down his eyes go on mr alpenny is connected with them mr snow says that he was a fence who disposed of stolen goods where did mr snow hear this story from various people in whitechapel rumours only said durban striving to appear calm there is not a word of truth in it mr alpenny was wicked but not so bad as that missy i swear it i believe that mr snow has spoken the truth said beatrice sharply you are still trying to keep me in the dark for your good missyfor your good or for mr paslows safetywhich i dont know what you mean gasped durban hoarsely i dont know myself exactly since you will not be candid said the girl wearily but i have found out much and i shall find more when i discover that necklace the obi necklace you have never found that no but i am looking for it missy do not i implore you do not there is a curse on that necklace it caused the death of your father the disgrace of your mother and the murder of mr alpenny how do you know that had mr alpenny the necklace yes your mother gave it to alpenny for you then where is it i dont knowi cannot tell and if i did know i would never tell missy enough sorrow and trouble has come about over that necklacethe accursed thing ii durban broke down and with a groan fairly ran away leaving the amazed beatrice mistress of the field chapter xvi an interruption there was certainly enough to think about beatrice retreated to her room and proceeded to reason out the meaning of all she had heard it was evident that both vivian and durban were in some way connected with criminality in connection with mr alpennys vocation of fence since both refused to speak waterloo apparently was a member of the black patch gang and had come down the other day to see vivian beatrice remembered now how vivian had hinted that he was connected with rogues and vagabonds and how he appeared to be fearful as to what major ruck might say ruck himself probably was a member of this criminal association in any case as durban had confessed he was a decoy duck to lure the unwary into the late mr alpennys nets but the question which now presented itself to the puzzled girl was whether alpenny being dead the organisation would end the old usurer had been extremely clever and wanting his brains this association might disband for want of a competent head ruck certainlyas he appeared to have some authoritymight become the moving spirit but from what beatrice had seen of him she did not think he was capable of handling such difficult matters and she did not much care all she desired was to learn what paslow had to do with these rascalitiesif durban was implicated in the rogueriesand if so to rescue both she could not believe that either of these kind men and whom she loved so dearly would act in a blackguardly way in some manner the two had become entangled in alpennys nets and knowing this ruck was making capital out of the knowledge this was the conclusion which beatrice arrived at and she determined to force vivian to explain i love him dearly she assured herself as she stared at her pale drawn face in the lookingglass but i cannot marry him until i know exactly what part he has taken in all these terrible doings with this resolve she went down to dinner and found vivian there in a very happy state of mind lately the cloud had passed away from his brow and he seemed more like his old self of the days when she had never guessed what an abyss there was under her feetunder their feet indeed as she could not separate herself even in thought from vivian paslow my dear beatrice he said coming towards her with a smile and then when he saw her face he stopped short just as durban had done why my darling what have you been doing with yourself nothing replied beatrice quietly after dinner ill tell you then there is something said paslow seeing how she contradicted herself and trying to make her speak out yes she answered with an effort there is some thing i have learned much today about whatfrom whom paslow gasped out the questions and his heart beat violently he felt sick with apprehension what had she heard and why did she look at him in this way ill tell you after dinner but i want you to tell me now no said beatrice very directly and was spared further speech for at that moment dinah came into the room followed by jerry in evening dress ive made it up with jerry he has asked my pardon she said in a cheerful voice so i invited him to dinner as a reward i hope it is a good dinner said jerry blandly i deserve a big reward for having given in to you it is always a mans duty to give in to a woman said miss paslow i hope you dont think it is the wifes duty to bully the husband on occasions a little storm clears the air further argument was cut short by the sound of the gong vivian who had been watching beatrice all the time gave her his arm and they led the way into the diningroom while the lovers wrangled behind the table looked dainty and neat as it was brilliant with flowers and glittered with old silver and cut crystal in spite of his difficulties paslow had always kept up a certain state at the grange and looking at the table no one would have guessed that its owner was nearly bankrupt dinah who with mrs lilly was responsible for the meal pointed out to jerry the various dishes set down on the menu and described what share she had taken in preparing the same so you see jerry darling i am a magnificent housekeeper on your brothers income said jerry with a shrug and enjoying the soup what will you be on mine on ours corrected dinah ill be splendid of course your income cannot be very much less than vivians we live here like elijah who was fed by ravens i am fed by a dove said mr snow gallantly how sweet sighed dinah sentimentally then feeling really hungry after her argument with jerry she began to eat and laid all sentiment aside that could come afterwards in the moonlight beatrice and vivian exchanged few words during the meal they talked about the weather about the various trifles in the newspapers which interested idle people and made a light meal but at the back of their thoughts lay the consciousness that a crisis was approaching in their lives and neither one knew how it would end would love be strong enough to make the girl overlook youthful folly that was what vivian asked himself and beatrice wondered if vivians love would be powerful enough to make him confess plainly what was the meaning of all these mysterious things which raised a barrier between them the dinner was a mere farce so far as they were concerned but dinah and jerry ate enough for four and chatted meanwhile so gaily that any silence on the part of the remaining two was overlooked the meal ended vivian and jerry did not linger over the bottle of old port which the host placed before his guest jerry was at an age when love was preferable to strong drink and vivian wished to have a confidential conversation with beatrice as speedily as possible therefore by common consent they adjourned to the drawingroom and found the two girls drinking coffee on the terrace it was a deliciously warm night with a full moon and countless stars gemming the heavens quite a night for romeo and juliet meet for love and for soft whisperings nightingales sang in the thickets and the trees were absolutely still owing to the want of the faintest breath of wind dinah finishing her coffee began to get sentimental again and beckoned to jerry the two went down the steps into the sleeping gardens and beatrice was left seated at the small table on the terrace with vivian smoking at her elbow she glanced at him in the ivory moonlight while she made up her mind what to say he looked slim and handsome in his wellcut clothesa dark and somewhat stern man with a finelyfeatured face greek in its perfect lines it seemed impossible that such a man could be involved in sordid roguery he looked what beatrice in spite of circumstances always believed him to bean honourable english gentleman who was her lover and who would be her adoring husband vivian was staring at the retreating forms of jerry and dinah as they vanished down the avenue but he became conscious that beatrice was looking at him and turned to look at her surely a lover never saw a fairer maid in her black dress with her white neck and arms shining in the moonlight she looked wonderfully beautiful the pale glimmer of the moon concealed all the ravages which trouble had made and she appeared like an angel ready to take flight it was with difficulty that paslow prevented himself pressing her in his arms but until matters were cleared up between them there was no chance that she would allow him to embrace her he could see that in the sad stern way in which she looked at him and so restrained himself with a violent effort well he said stiffly and prepared to listen what is it you wish to know she asked in a low voice i wish to know what has changed you am i changed very much this morning when i went to brighton with dinah you were bright and happy now you are sad and look as though you had received bad news only you can give me bad news said beatrice in an embarrassed manner i want you to be plain with me tonight vivian i have promised to marry you i take that promise back beatriceoh beatrice unless you satisfy me that you really and truly love me oh my darling is there any question of that there is every question it is easy for a man to say that he loves a woman it is not so easy to prove it i can prove it in any way you will good said beatrice leaning forward and placing her arms on the small table between them i shall tell you what i have heard today and then you must tell me what you know about what asked paslow lighting another cigarette with shaking hands and not daring to look at her in the first place about my parentage this time he did look at her and in much amazement you are the stepdaughter of alpenny he said quietly and the daughter of mrs hedge whomsoever she may be is that all you know she asked looking at him yes i have never heard anything else but i have i heard this day and from orchard the shepherd who was your fathers servant that i am the daughter of colonel hall vivian dropped his cigarette and jumped up with an exclamation of genuine surprise did orchard tell you that he asked he did mrs hedge my mother was really mrs hall and married mr alpenny becausebecause she hesitated because why she must have had a strong reason to marry that old rascal she had alpenny according to mrs snow what does mrs snow know about your affairs asked vivian angrily a great deal she was my mothers best friendso she saysand her bitterest enemy as i have found out mrs snow declared that my mother married alpenny to prevent alpenny accusing her of murdering her husband and my father oh it is incredible muttered vivian clutching his hair wait till you hear details i think my mother is innocent myself but certainly the evidence seems to be against her and beatrice without giving vivian time to intervene told him all that she had heard from the old shepherd and from mrs snow he listened in silence although his amazement was too profound and too openly expressed to be anything else than genuine what do you think said beatrice when she had finished i dont know what to think he muttered glancing sideways at her and then away into the shadowy garden i believe orchard is right and that you are the daughter of the man who was murdered in this house but i do not believe what mrs snow says your motheror indeed any womanwould never commit a crime in so brutal a manner i dont believe any woman unless an amazon would have the strength for one thing so i think said beatrice heartily and i am glad that you agree with me however the discovery of my parentage does not make any difference to my position i dont know so much about that said paslow meditatively it might be that colonel hall left money as he is dead and your mother is deadas alpennys wife any money that there is should come to you well said beatrice watching the effect of her words it seems to me that the necklace is mine i understand that it is valuedso major ruck saidat ten thousand pounds if i can find that i certainly will be an heiress but durban wants me to leave it alone for what reason he declares that the necklace is accursed pooh said vivian with supreme contempt that is his african superstition you must not forget beatrice that durban is half a negro if the necklace can be found it certainly must be given back to you for your own sake not for mine he added quickly i dont care if you are an heiress or a pauper i marry you because i love you my darling he offered to take her in his arms but she drew back one moment vivian she said rapidly can you tell me where the necklace is to be found i he started back in great surprise and met her gaze frankly but with a puzzled look how should i know mr alpenny i truly believe was killed for the sake of that necklace as was my father before him i do not believe that my father gave it to my mother he was killed and robbedso was alpenny beatrice do you imply that i know anything of this murder i can explain she said and came closer alpenny was killed by a man who wore a black patch over his left eye a black patch was found under the window of the room in which my father colonel hall was murdered both crimes were committed if not by the same man as i have hitherto believed at least by a member of the black patch gang to which alpenny belonged paslow covered his face with a groan unable to meet the vivid lightning of her eyes what do you know about the black patch gang he asked in stifled tones all that jerry snow could tell me he was in whitechapel and heard many remarks about this gang of thieves which the police are always trying to break up now that the gang is concerned in murder as well as in thievery the police will make every effort to capture the man who heads them what is his name how should i know demanded paslow hoarsely because you do know alpenny hinted that you had committed crimes he liedhe lied said vivian passionately i am as innocent of evildoing as you are folly perhaps but never crime i believe that i am certain that the man i love would never descend to sordid crime but you have been drawn into the toils of this gang i believe that alpenny was the headhe decoyed you into his snares or else ruckmajor ruck his decoyduck there is some truth in what you say but no you must speak out i will stand by you to the end and do all i can to reveal my love more and more but i refuseshe drew herself uprightto marry you unless you tell me the whole truth give me time he panted and clenched his hands no you must tell me now or tonight we part for ever paslow uttered a groan and moved forward two or three steps as though about to seek safety in flight beatrice he said brokenly your answer she demanded making every effort to appear calm but the answer was not to come from paslow even while he opened his mouth to speak jerry appeared on the lawn with two ladies one was dinah as they could see by the eveningdress the other a tall slim fairhaired woman fashionably arrayed in walkingcostume the moonlight was strong but neither beatrice nor paslow could tell who the strange woman was hullo vivian shouted jerry here is miss carr who wants to see you he would have said more but was drawn back by dinah who apparently was still jealous of the stranger beatrice remembered that this was the woman with whom jerry had been speaking during the day the same that had awakened the jealousy of dinah also she was the daughter of the exbutler she advanced with gliding steps and looked like a beautiful lithe tigress stealing towards her prey with dinah still jealous jerry after that one abrupt introduction disappeared down the avenue probably to be scolded but beatrice did not look at the retreating lovers nor indeed at the advancing miss carr whose foot was now on the lowest step of the terrace all her attention was concentrated on vivian paslow who stood at the top of the steps as though frozen into stone the woman came up the steps and was now so near that beatrice could see the smile on her fair face you said vivian hoarsely and fell back a pace myself said miss carr and no ghost either beatrice rose with a bound and felt a sudden jealous anger surge in her heart she looked from one to the other imperiously who is this woman she asked the cowering man mymywife he said in low broken tones god help me my wife come back from the dead chapter xvii a story of the past miss carr or miss orchard or mrs paslowbeatrice thought of her by all these three namessmiled quietly when her husband made the confession and sank gracefully into the seat he had vacated she was certainly a handsome woman and if not entirely a lady was an extremely good imitation of the same vivian still stood as in a dream staring at the wife he had believed to be dead and buried and beatrice stared alternately at him and at the strange woman a silence ensued for each of the three was thinking hard beatrice was the first to break silence will you explain she asked vivian quietly i think he answered in a harsh dry tone that my wife had better explain i have the certificate of her death and and you can consider it so much wastepaper the woman who was buried was my double said mrs paslow composedly you cannot deceive me in that way maud i saw you ill in bed and so i was i had a bad attack of influenza said his wife with a calm smile oh my illness was genuine enough but i did not diealthough i appeared to do so for reasons connected with a second marriage with mr paslows marriage to me asked beatrice striving to regain her calmness and emulate the sangfroid of this cold audacious woman who appeared to have no feelings well no drawled mrs paslow not exactly i never did care to benefit my fellowcreatures to that extent i refer to a marriage i wished to make with a rich american however his mother stopped the marriage and i found myself without a natural protector therefore as i heard from major ruck that vivian proposed to make you his wife i came here to save you and stop him from committing bigamy which you just now proposed to commit yourself said beatrice with cold contempt mrs paslow looked at her between halfclosed eyelids and shrugged her finely moulded shoulders quite so she said politely but i have my reasons for risking imprisonment reasons connected with money sneered vivian connected with over a millionpounds not dollars well wellhe faced her squarelyand what do you propose to do now one moment interposed beatrice now perfectly calm and determined to break down this womans composure i should like to know how you carried out this plot of a feigned death there was a case of cigarettes on the table belonging to vivian mrs paslow cast a disdainful and rather amused look on beatrice and lighted one of the little rolls of tobacco when the smoke was wreathing round her fashionable hat she spoke with great calmness and appeared in no way upset by the imperious tone of the woman whom her husband loved certainly she replied in a low sweet voice which seemed to be one of her greatest charms and she had many as i explained i wanted to be free of vivian to marry a richer man than he was or is likely to be when i was ill and he came to see me the plan suggested itself i took the doctor into my confidence and he agreed for a consideration to forward my aims my double was really illoh yes with consumption she could not live so what do you mean by your double asked beatrice abruptly vivian can tell you he knew of my double i didi do but i did not think you would pass her off as yourself maud mrs paslow removed the cigarette from her mouth and smiled it was a capital plot she said musingly and but that i want you to be again my husband would have succeeded what about your double asked beatrice pertinaciously oh she was not a twin sister as you seem to think i am the only daughter and only child of joseph orchard who was a butler and is a shepherd you see she added leaning her arms on the table and addressing her rival in an amused tone i have no false pride about me when occasion serves i can say that i am the daughter of an army officer or of a clergyman or of anyone with a position i have done such things in my time but to you i can be frank since there is nothing to be gained by telling lies your doubleyour double miss carr or miss orchard neither name is mine mrs paslow if you please unlessshe glanced contemptuously at vivianmy husband denies i deny nothing i cannot he said savagely say what you have to say maud and then i shall tell miss hall how we met and into what troubles you led me miss hall echoed mrs paslow with a glance at beatrice then you know that do you how do you know asked beatrice pointedly oh my father told me long ago later i might have made capital out of the affair but now she shrugged again i believe that you are a bad woman said beatrice hotly i amwhat god made me retorted mrs paslow in no wise disturbed by the speech but about my double she was a girl on the stage extremely like me in fact we might have passed for twins i also went on the stagei have done most things in my time and wethat is miss arthur my double and myselfappeared in a play as twins if you knew anything of the theatre miss hall you would be surprised to hear how successful that play was the author was unknown and major ruck financed the play and i want to hear nothing about that mrs paslow i know now how you carried out the deception though it seems to me that as you did not let vivian see the dead body it was needless to have this double well admitted mrs paslow apologetically as though excusing a fault it was necessary to make sure vivian after a few visits never came near me the doctor would not let me said her husband quickly good old doctor murmured mrs paslow selecting a fresh cigarette he knew what i wanted however to make a long story short miss arthur died in my place and was buried under my name you have the certificate my dear vivian so all is well you were so easily deceived that there was no fun in deceiving you a clever man would have made more certain of his wifes death before arranging to take another one especially as you were cheated once before i did hear that you were dead before mr alpenny was murdered and i then asked miss hall here to be my wife confessed vivian afterwards major ruck told me that you were alive but ill i went to see you and you really seemed to be dying i am a good actress vivian i was on the stage remember so i thought when i saw the doctor and got the certificate that you were really and truly dead oh i shall see that the doctor is punished for this deception i think not said mrs paslow narrowing her eyes and looking at him very directly no doubt he will be punished in time but not by your will vivian dear the tone and words were so peculiar and significant that beatrice looked straight at the woman who now had a mocking smile on her face and spoke quietly you have some power over mr paslow why not call him vivian sneered the stranger he wasshe emphasised the wordto be your husband remember if you speak like that said paslow standing over her and speaking in a low angry voice i shall forget that i am your husband his wife glanced slightingly at beatrice it seems to me that you have forgotten she scoffed what the infuriated man would have said or done on the spur of the moment it is impossible to say but he was dangerous beatrice saw that and drew him back with an exclamation dont she said quickly let her say what she will it cannot hurt me and let me remind you mrs paslow that you have not answered my question nor do i intend to said the woman rising and throwing aside the cigarette the contemptuous words of beatrice stung her not a little this is my husband and i want him to return to town with me you are my wife said vivian in quiet anger and you were willing to commit bigamy after deceiving me by a feigned death i refuse to have anything more to do with you the law will make you she threatened the law will do nothing of the sort as my wife i will allow you enough to live on but no law will ever make me have anything to do with you again then i shall make you ah interposed beatrice you exercise this power i want my husband said the woman sullenly i refuse to have anything to do with you retorted paslow once more his wife was rapidly losing her temper she had come prepared for victory and meeting with this opposition all the disdainful certainty of her assumed nature wore away and the coarser feelings became apparent her face flushed a dark red the expression changed and instead of a quiet ladylike person beatrice saw before her a virago of the worst you shall come she shouted or rather i shall stay here this is my house and youshe turned on beatriceyou shall leave it i am here with mr paslows sister and i decline to leave it at the word of a disgraced wife i mrs paslow sprang forward with upraised fist you dare to say that to me you before she could strike vivian caught her arm and flung her back with such force that she fell against the balustrade of the terrace do you want me to commit murder he said savagely why not another since you killed alpenny she panted and glared at him like a tigress losing her prey that is a lie cried beatrice before vivian could speak mr paslow was with me on that night and about the time the crime was committed oh sneered the woman seizing her advantage vivian was with you indeed and what would be said were that known miss hall as you call yourself be silent said her husband catching her arm in an iron grip and his face whiter than that of the dead you shameless creature go away at once and cease your insults leave me alone cried mrs paslow wrenching herself free i intend to stop in my own house my housenot yours i am your wife and just now you confessed to a feigned death to commit bigamy i have a great mind to give my lawyers instructions to apply for a divorce give them to tuft then cried mrs paslow her fair face convulsed with fury he is alpennys lawyer and knows all about me and all about you see seeshe pointed a mocking finger at vivian who had turned away with a gesture of despairhe dare not face the law if you mean that you will denounce him for having killed mr alpenny said beatrice in a clear low voice you are wrong i can clear mr paslows character i can save him and i will indeed why because i love him why he married you how he married you i do not know but i believe that you trapped him into trapped him indeed shouted mrs paslow i could have married a dozen better men than he he is a cowarda milksopaa thief ah she cried as beatrice recoiled with a shudder you know the truth now this dainty wellborn gentlemanthis honourable manis a thief who was tried for shoplifting and who was acquitted said paslow deadly pale it was you who were condemned and rightly god forgive me for saying so after all bad as you are you are my wife vivian said beatrice with her face drawn with agony is what this woman says true truequite true and ill thank you to speak of me more respectfully snapped mrs paslow is it true asked beatrice again paying no attention to this spiteful speech quite true said vivian drawing a long breath and prepared to face the worst this is the power she has held over me that she can send me to prison is a lie but she can disgrace my name by telling my friends that i was accused of shoplifting but was it not in the papers asked beatrice anxiously no i was accused under another name beatrice i married that womanhe pointed to mrs paslow who was still fuming with ragewhen my father was alive she was the daughter of our old servant who became a shepherd afterwards when a child and when i was a child she came here and mrs lilly helped her for the sake of her father i was a boy and foolish she was clever and unscrupulous she grew weary of this quiet life and went to town i thought that i loved her and you did panted mrs paslow i did not said vivian sternly i was entrapped as you know wellit was a year later that i met her when in town and then she was the associate of thieves and rogues alpenny had seen her here he inveigled her into his nets and used her in the west end as a decoy in the same way as he used major ruck she met me i believed that she was goodthat she was still my old playfellow i married her under my own name but in order to save the feelings of my father i lived with her as my wife under another name i wanted to take my own and come down here said the woman i know you did but i would not allow it said vivian and continued his story rapidly while beatrice perfectly still listened intently it would have broken my fathers heart and then he added turning to beatrice i found out how vile she was i never deceived younever said mrs paslow no you had that redeeming point said her husband as a wife i could find no fault with you in that way had you been good and kind i might have come to love you as i did when we were children together but your nature was essentially false and wicked under the tuition of alpenny you developed into an adventuress and made the worst use of your talents but for alpenny we should have starved she reminded him i did not know that he retorted you said that the money had been left to you by your godmother only when it was too late did i learn that alpenny gave you the money for having stolen things and then i was dragged into your evil ways you did steal insisted mrs paslow i did not beatrice one day we were in a drapers shop in the west end this woman stole some lace she was arrested and i was arrested also as her accomplice oh vivian oh vivian mocked mrs paslow you see he is a thief you lie said paslow angrily beatrice does not believe that no no i would never believe it said beatrice you fool scoffed mrs paslow you angel cried vivian fervently and then proceeded rapidly with his nauseous story under my feigned name i was triedand thus thank god i was enabled to save my father from dying of a broken heart i was accused but tuft alpennys lawyer defended menot from kindness no alpenny by this accusation of theft secured a hold over me which he used after my fathers death to extort the property from me this is why i am so poor alpenny and my wifehe laid a scornful emphasis on the wordgot all my money and we had a right to said mrs paslow i am your wife and alpenny through tuft saved you from going to gaol for his own ends merely retorted vivian i had to pay bitterly for his aidthis womanhe again pointed to maudwas condemned as it was proved that she was an expert thief and she was sentenced to a few months imprisonment to five months said mrs paslow shamelessly i was acquitted but the judge read me a lecture on the kind of society i kept and heaven help me cried vivian then was the first time that i knew what sort of society my marriage had led me into you were always a greenhorn said mrs paslow patting her hair into shape and arranging her ruffled plumes vivian turned his back on her i left the court without a stain on my character he said quickly and left england for the five months telling my father that i was going abroad for my health and my health was bad he added i broke down under the vileness of it all my father never knew the truth nor did any of my friends the case since i was accused under another name passed unnoticed but maud knew the truth and so did alpenny so did tuft his creature and major ruck another of his minions they tried to make me vile by threats of exposure but so long as i could bribe alpenny by giving him money no action was taken by him or ruck maud i also kept i had a right to the money i am your wife i admit that you had the right he said wicked as you were i acknowledged you as my wife not to the world she said sharply because that would have made the marriage known to my father and he would have cut me off without a shilling after his death when you found that alpenny had the money you refused to be acknowledged although i asked you to come here as my wife i had not then met with miss hall ended vivian significantly i see you love her with all my heart and soul and i love him acknowledged beatrice from what i have heard i can see that vivian is not to blame you wicked woman here said mrs paslow advancing get out of my house i have come here to take up my rightful position the house is mine you will leave this place at once said vivian his face dark with anger you can tell what you like and do what you like alpenny is dead and i decline to be under your thumb any longer i shall stop here said mrs paslow and sat down firmly vivian placed his hand on her shoulder she jumped up in a fury and struck at him you dare to touch me you thief she stormed you have spoilt my lifeyou haveyou have her anger choked her and she tore at the lace round her neck in doing so she ripped the dress and her hand caught unknowingly at something within to the amazement of beatrice a chain of glittering gems was pulled from its hidingplace round her neck and fell on the pavement the jewels were diamonds and they flashed pools of liquid light in the moonlight oh cried beatrice guessing at once the obi necklace almost before the words were out of her mouth mrs paslow had snatched up the necklace and was flying across the lawn vivian would have followed but beatrice stopped him chapter xviii what orchard knew let her go said beatrice holding back the angered husband by main force only in this way can you keep her out of the house but the necklace said vivian pausing while his wife vanished amongst the shadows of the trees are you sure no how can i be sure i have never seen the necklace but the diamonds were too lovely to be paste you know i have seen many jewels pass through alpennys hands and sometimes he explained their particular beauties and values to me i am sure the gems in that necklace are real they flashed so wonderfully in the moonlight diamond necklaces are rare in the weald mused vivian thoughtfully and maud is not likely to possess such jewels for she has little money it must be the famous obi necklace where could she have got it beatrice who knows she replied her cheek slightly paling is she one of the members of this black patch gang so far as i know anything of her life she is replied paslow his eyes averted then he turned and seized her hands with vehemence oh my hearts darling what can you think of me after this revelation beatrice did not pause an instant in making reply i think you were very foolish to keep the truth from me but how could i tell you of my sinful folly he pleaded and his voice was very sweet in her ears see what a sordid tale it is a foolish boy and a clever woman yet god knowshe broke off and cast away her handsit is not right that i should blame the woman as men usually do after all maud has some good points about her i did not see them responded beatrice with the bitterness with which one woman will always talk about another she hates but believe me she has insisted vivian quickly she has been a burden to me she did her best to drag me down to her level of thievery and roguery but i cannot forget that i knew her here as a childwhen she really was good and kind and beatrice he added with a flush on my soul i believe that in some things she is not what one might think her you heard her say that she had been a true wife to me yes answered the girl not to be outdone in justice even to a rival and i believe what she said but if you love her dont say that he sprang towards her all his heart in his eyes and passion in every note of his voice i love you and you only no other woman has ever made me feel what you have i met maud in london and even before i had a kind of boy and girl passion for her then we were playmates remember in spite of the difference of our position i was sorry when she told me how lonely she was in london i did not know that she lied in saying so i was young and inexperienced and she caught me with a tearful eye and a quivering voice and a tale of woe i married at haste to repent at leisure but oh heavenshe broke off pressing his hands against his aching browwhen i think of that horrible policecourt and the way in which i was accused of what i never did i hardly dare to look you in the face i am soiled with the mire of criminality i must be an outcast a scoundrel in your eyes you are in my eyes what you always have been replied beatrice in a soft tonethe man i love still stillyouyou love me he stammered yes no do not touch me she added hastily as vivian flung himself forward you had a right before she came as you were ignorant and i see from her own confession how you were deceived but now she is your wifeshe is alive until that barrier is removed we can be nothing but friends to one another i cannot stay here beatrice beatrice i cannot she answered steadily i love you and i cannot see you day after day with calmness you can remain as dinahs companion he said entreatingly i shall pay you a salary and then you will be independent no dinah has jerry she wants no companion i will go to town and to lady watson she was my mothers friend and will be able to help me you will go as her companion oh no i dont like her sufficiently for that but she may be able to get me a position as a governess or something else and also i wish to ask her about my mother whom she knew mrs snow gives a cruel version of what my mother was lady watson may be more truthful and some day she added drawing so near to vivian that it took him all his powers of selfrepression to refrain from taking her in his armssome day when the barrier is removed we may come together vivian shook his head maud will never give me a chance of divorce my dear said he bitterly she is too clever andi may say it to youtoo passionless never mind we can remain friends paslow groaned aloud with anguish can there be friendship between us after all that has come and gone yes said beatrice quietly because we are soul friends and do not love entirely after the physical come vivianshe placed a gentle hand on his shoulderlet us commence our friendship by talking sensibly of these matters what matters he asked listlessly for the man was worn out with the struggle which was going on in his breast about the murders of my father and of alpenny we must learn who committed them what good will that do this much it will destroy the power which this gang holds over your head major ruck knows that you were accused of theft so does tuft the lawyer and your wife for their own ends they will hold this in terrorem over you they have always done so said vivian sadly they cannot hurt me so far as the police are concerned as i left the court without a stain on my character but socially if they told my friends if your friends turn their backs on you they are not worthy to be called friends said beatrice quickly you must face this gang of people do you not know their secrets and thus may be able to counterplot them i know nothing about them but durban may the paper which was on my desk and which told me to threaten alpenny with the black patch wasnow i feel surein durbans handwriting it probably was said beatrice thoughtfully i shall see durban and ask him to be open with me but did you not know anything about the black patch gang vivian no he said earnestly i swear i did not i fancied from what maud let drop at times that alpenny and herself and ruck were all connected with some criminal organisation but i never knew anything about the black patch which seems to be their badge i used the words on durbans paperif durban did write themquite unknowingly and now when i remember their effect and remember also how your father was murdered and how you also saw a man issuing from the camp with a black patch over his eye i feel sure that there is such a gang and that alpenny was connected with it probably i was used to warn him that he would be killed for some reason he may have betrayed them or made personal use of the goods he received but whatever it was i certainly unconsciously gave him the warning and he was killedi am convinced of thisby a member of the gang i agree with you said beatrice promptly well i shall see durban tomorrow and he may speak out i shall insist on his doing so also i shall see old orchard why because i believe she got that necklace from himyour wife i mean that was why she came down and why she acknowledged the relationship to orchard you dont think he killed alpenny beatrice no the man is too old and moreover would not have the courage but he may know something of the murder in any case if the necklace was in his possession he will have to account for having it major ruck insisted that my mother had it and left it to alpenny who should have given it to me and he would have done so in order to close major rucks mouth but how could he do that if he gave you the necklace oh said beatrice calmly it was to be my dowry and i was to be made to marry major ruck you heard yourself vivian how the major confessed that it was the obi necklace he wanted perhaps he will make your wife give it up to him he will indeed be clever if he can manage that said vivian grimly my wife will not readily part with diamonds like that and i fancy she knows enough about the major to keep him silent well beatrice let it be as you say see durban in the morning and then orchard but i wish you would stay here no you do not vivian said the girl determinedly you love me too well for that perhaps i do i shall always love you oh beatrice if you can only get at the truth of these murders and bring home the crime to the black patch gang you will lift from my shoulders the burden of years i will work also i have been a weak fool allowing myself to be blackmailed and humbled by these rogues but you have put fresh life into me my darling i shall now assert my manhood i quite understand how you shrank from publicity she said in a soothing tone you are brave and manly i know but a man who would face a cannons mouth would in a case like this be fearful for his good name let me search out the matter but you will allow me to help when i want your help i shall ask it of you she replied and now as our relations are changedfor the present at all eventslet us shake hands on the bargain of being friends vivian did so without a sigh the position was a hard one for him but he recognised that it was harder for the girl and when he saw how bravely she faced these difficult matters he cursed himself for the moral cowardice which had made him submit for long years to extortion and concealment you put new heart into me he said again and they shook hands as friends as dinah came up with jerry jerry and i have been talking about our new flat in london cried dinah long before she arrived on the terrace and we will live in west kensington i shall keep a saloon and be a literary woman a drinking saloon asked vivian glad of the diversion no you stupid a thing like madame de rambouilletcollecting all the wits of london you know goodness knows where youll find them said jerry bluffly wit is an extinct arti say vivian where is miss carr that horrid girl interpolated dinah you didnt think her horrid once dinah when you played with her i never did said dinah opening her eyes and following her brother into the welllighted drawingroom a painted she was not painted then interrupted vivian impatiently and what jerry told you about orchard being her father ought to have oh cried dinah starting now i remember maud orchard of course she was a housemaid or something not quite that she attended on mrs lilly who behaved like a mother to her yes yes and then she went to london and mrs lilly was very angry so that was her why did she call herself carr its a journalistic name said jerry oh said dinah again i hope snow is your real name my very own said jerry with a grimace i would certainly have chosen a different name had i selected one but i am born a snow and have to put up with it where has maud orchard gone asked dinah irrelevantly she had to see after some business and went away said beatrice as vivian found it difficult to answer this question she only came here to see your brother and remind him who she was well i am stupid said dinah swallowing this white fib but i have such a bad memory for faces i can only remember jerrys because it is so very plain i call that hard said jerry plaintively i call it silly retorted dinah tapping him on the face with her fan now have a whisky and soda with vivian and go home beatrice and i are going to bed and i am sure you want to sleep she said glancing at her friends pale face you look quite worn out i am all right said beatrice somewhat impatiently good night jerrygood night vivian and the two girls went up to their rooms while vivian played host to jerry and got rid of him as speedily as he could he was in no mood for the young journalists aimless chatter next morning beatrice awoke at five oclock she could not sleep longer although owing to being worn out on the previous night she had slumbered very soundly it was a lovely fresh morning and she felt inclined for a walk it was too early to see durban as he would not yet be up early riser though he was after a few minutes thought beatrice decided to walk up to the downs and see if old orchard was about she would get there about the time he was starting off with his flock and in any event would be certain to find him in his hut at the morning meal hastily scribbling a note that she would return to breakfast and had gone for a stroll beatrice dressed herself and stole downstairs leaving the note on the diningroom table where it would certainly be found by mrs lilly the girl went out of the back door the housedog in the yard barked joyously at her coming as she was a favourite of his beatrice for the sake of company let him loose and took him with her she literally danced along the road in spite of the troubles which environed her she was young and the morning air was like champagne also she felt a conviction that things would surely come right and that she and vivian would become man and wife she did not wish for the death of mrs paslow wicked as the woman was nor did she wish vivian to divorce her whichas he had saidhe could not do but she felt that in some way the barrier would be removed and that its removal lay in her own hands thus her heart began to grow light and as she climbed the downs amidst the glory of the dawn she breathed a prayer to god that he would take all these troubles out of her life and bring her to a safe haven orchard was at the door of his hut as usual and also he was eating just as he had been when she saw him last he might have been seated there all the time for all she knew the sheep were nibbling the dewy grass and the sun was rising in splendour when the old shepherd beheld her he turned his mild eyes on her and greeted her quietly youre the young lady as called to see me the other day he said colonel halls daughter explained beatrice taking the stool he offered and i have come to see you about yours about my what asked orchard quietly about your daughter maud she came last night to see mr paslow ah yes said orchard with such composure that beatrice was certain that he knew nothing about the marriage or his daughters life maud and master vivian were playmates together shes a pretty girl she is assented beatrice cordially for no one could deny the beauty of maud paslow marred as it was by artificial aids and a good girl said the old man slightly warming she aint ashamed of her old father although she writes books and lives like a fine lady in london yes i hear she is a journalist said beatrice and then abruptly added she must make a lot of money to have so fine a diamond necklace as she showed mr paslow and myself did she show that said orchard with a slight cloud on his brow it was foolish of her it is a necklace like one that colonel hall had years and years ago durban said that there was some witchcraft about that necklace else why should it have been missing for so long only to turn up here two days ago on the neck of a sheep what asked beatrice amazed and now i come to think of it said orchard whose memory was apparently going colonel hall was murdered by alpenny for that necklace it is the same of course it is miss i recognised the setting when i took it off the sheeps neck but how could such a set of jewels get on a sheeps neck ah said old orchard with great mildness thats what i want to find out mr alpenny had the necklace i am sure perhaps as durban said there was bad luck about it and mr alpenny put it on a sheeps neck to get rid of the spell what rubbish said beatrice impatiently rubbish or not miss i found that necklace on the neck of one of my sheep the poor thing had broken its leg and i went to put it out of its pain the diamond necklace was round its neck and i gave it to maud as it was no use to me i hope it wont bring her bad luck since it is the obi necklace chapter xix durban speaks at last beatrice did not remain long with orchard after she had learned how maud paslow became possessed of the obi necklace she was convinced that the old shepherd was speaking the truth as he did not appear to have sufficient brains to be inventive and moreover was rapidly growing senile but on her way down to the weald she thought it strange that the necklace should have been discovered by the man round the neck of a sheep who had placed the gems there and why had they been attached to the animal an attempt to solve this problem lasted beatrice all the way to the camp it was now nearly ten oclock but beatrice was too excited to think about breakfast she found the great gates of the camp wide open and indeed since alpennys death they had been rarely closed the gardens looked as beautiful as ever but the railway carriages appeared a little deserted and forlorn beatrice walked at once towards the kitchen carriage where she hoped to find durban preparing his morning meal he certainly was there and with him was a redheaded dirty little man in whom she recognised waterloo oh said beatrice recoiling from the door for the mere sight of that evil face made her sick blimme cried waterloo turning his ratlike eyes on her if it aint old alpennys gal hold your tongue said durban in a low fierce voicewhat is it missy i have come to ask you for some breakfast said beatrice retreating still further so as to get away from waterloo and to have a chat well all have a jaw cried waterloo enthusiastically were all pals in the same boat what does this horrible creature mean asked beatrice looking appealingly at her old servant orrible critture yelped waterloo well i likes that i does oh yuss not at all by no means why me an your par were old pals are you talking of colonel hall or of mr alpenny asked beatrice taking a sudden step towards the man the result of her remark and action surprised her not a little and indeed seemed to surprise durban also colonel all muttered waterloo and his red hair rose on end over a rapidly paling face oh my stars if you knows about him its time fur me to cut my lucky you know something cried beatrice i know as old alpenny murderedmurdered here cried waterloo with a snarl you lemme out and before beatrice could stop himshe was blocking the doorwayhe had darted under her arm and was running noiselessly out of the camp apparently he was frightened out of his wits yet the girl wondered that so bold a thief and a man accustomed to being in tight places should be seized by so sudden an access of genuine terror what does it mean she asked durban but making no attempt to follow the man i know no more than you do missy durban said beatrice entering the kitchen and taking a seat you have kept me in the dark long enough you ran away just as this man has done when i asked you about the obi necklace now you must speak out as i am leaving hurstable leaving this place missy said durban startled are you not to marry mr paslow how can i marry him when he has a wife living durban did not seem to be so surprised at this news as she expected so you have found that out missy he said slowly you knew about it yes i knew but i thoughti thought that she was dead no she pretended to die for her own purposes in fact she intended in that way to get rid of vivian and marry an american millionaire but she is aliveher double was buried miss arthur cried the servant quickly you know that also i know everything but i thought that mrs paslow was dead and so i wanted you to marry mr paslow and be happy durban said the girl quietly the discovery of this which you should have told me alters the position of myself and mr paslow i can no longer remain at convent grange tomorrow i go up to town to see lady watson durbans face took on its greenish pallor he made one stride forward and spoke to beatrice with dry lips you must not you dare not do not go missy take your hand from my arm durban said beatrice sharply and when he did so she resumed in hard tones why should i not go oh how can i tell you durban clapped his hands together in a helpless sort of way like a great child she is bad she will do you harm she has got alpennys money which ought to be yours for all i know she may have the obi necklace also i hope she has for its possession will bring her the worst of luck she has not got the necklace durban mrs paslow has it yes you may well look surprised durban mr paslow and myself saw it on her neck last night when she came to see him and prevent our marriage how could she have got it murmured durban but more to himself than to his mistress she obtained it from her father old orchard the butler old orchard the shepherd i saw him this morning he recognised the necklace as having belonged to my fatherto colonel hall it seems the setting is peculiar but how did it come into his possession missy he found it on the neck of a sheep durban did not look at all surprised i thought he would was his strange reply you thought he would what i thought he would find it there durban did you know it was on a sheeps neck yes iwell missy i may as well make a clean breast of iti placed it on the sheeps neck myself you and where did you get it come with me missy and ill show you in silent amazement beatrice followed the stout man out of the kitchen he led the way across the lawn to the countinghouse and opened the door with a key which he took from the pocket of his white suit she beheld the countinghouse in exactly the same state as she had seen it when alpenny had insisted on the marriage with major ruck but much water had flowed under westminster bridge since that time which now seemed so far away missy said durban pointing to the seat in front of the mahogany desk sit down and let us talk i have much to tell you for the time has come when you must know what i know why have you kept information from me all this time said beatrice sitting down while durban stood at the door his bulky form blocking up all exit why missy i ask you would it have been right for me who love you to overshadow your young life by telling you of the murder of your father of the rascality of alpenny and of the terrible position in which mr paslow was placed durban spoke vehemently and with the very greatest earnestness i am not a child said beatrice i should have been told you were a child for a long time and i loved you said durban with exquisite sadness i wished to keep you in ignorance of the evil that surrounded you i wished you to marry mr paslow and go away never to learn what the evil was but i knewfor i learned it from major ruck who wished to marry you and get the obi necklacethat mr paslow had married maud orchard or maud carr as she calls herself in town when she diedor pretended to diei thought that all would be well and so kept silence but you were determined to search out these matters for yourself i placed no bar in the way of your doing so as i thought that perhaps you were the chosen instrument to put all right since unaided you have found out so much i think you are that instrument so i am now going to make much plain which has hitherto puzzled you beatrice crossed her feet and hands i shall be glad to hear what you have to say she said coldly ah missy do not be angry said durban caressingly it was love that made me keep you in the dark he was so genuinely moved that a large tear rolled down his dark face and a profound emotion stirred him to the depths of his being beatrice was annoyed at the way in which she had been treated but she was just enough to recognise that the man had kept silence out of pure affection impulsively stretching out her hand she caught his which hung listlessly by his side and shook it heartily i believe you love me durban and that you acted for the best oh missymissy hush be quiet and tell me what you know durban wiped his face with the duster which he carried and leaning against the door spoke slowly and to the point indeed he seemed glad that after his years of silence he was at last able to confess freely and to a sympathetic listener i was born in the west indies missy he said and knew your mother and father you told me that you were born on my mothers estate begin from the time you came to convent grange very well missy i came to convent grange with my master to see mr paslows father who was an old friend of the colonels master and your mother had quarrelled he was severe and kept your mother too quiet she liked gaiety and pleasure yet so severely had he trained her that she was always silent and demure she came down with you and your nurse for one night then my master was murdered as you know can you tell who murdered him no missy durban spoke very earnestly i swear that i do not know who did that but your mother was suspected she cleared herself but people still looked at her askance so she changed her name to hedge and married mr alpenny heredurban glanced out of doorsin this quiet place she was safe and here she lived until she died worn out with grief a few months later mr alpenny then sent you to miss shallow at brighton and you know all your life since then why did my mother marry mr alpenny because she had the obi necklace your father gave it to her she told me and major ruck said the same thing it must be true then muttered durban half to himself although i was never sure but alpenny said that he would accuse your mother of the murder unless she married him she did so and then died alpenny kept the necklace and being fond of jewels he could not make up his mind to part with it even for money of which he was equally fond he kept it by him in this place in the safe no missy the safeas mr alpenny an associate of thieves knew very wellwas the first place where thieves would look see here missydurban advanced to the wall and pulled aside the faded red rep which hung there as a kind of arrashere is a pocket behind this made in the rep the necklace was kept here for no one would think of feeling the hangings it was safer here than in the safe beatrice examined the pocket and admired the ingenuity of the hidingplace whichso to speakwas so public that even the most expert thief would never think of looking here for a valuable necklace of gems an ordinary man would have kept the jewels in the safe but mr alpenny who must have got the hint from poes story of the purloined letter chose the least likely place to be searched and you found the necklace here durban yes missy i will tell you how i did mr alpenny was a member and the chief one of the black patch gang durban then you wrote that paper which was on mr paslows desk i did missy he admitted quietly mr alpenny wanting all the money to himself had several times played the gang false twice he was warned and was told that at the third warning he would be killed i remember how mr alpenny shivered when vivian spoke said beatrice recalling the scene and he spoke of the third warning i was told to give him the warning said durban calmly and i wanted to make mr paslow use it in the hope that mr alpenny would be frightened into consenting to your marriage with mr paslow but you knew that maud paslow was alive she pretended to die twice said durban and i was equally deceived along with mr paslow he did not know what the warning of the black patch gang meant but i did and made mr paslow unconsciously use it but it proved useless not to mr alpenny he was murdered yes missy and i believe by a member of the black patch gang but i do not know who listen missy i am about to place my life in your hands and the man looked cautiously round durban she exclaimed frightened are you going to tell me that you were a member of the gang no missy i was not they tried to get me to join but being an honest man i refused but i held my tongue for your sake i loved you and the gang declared if i told the police about them that they would kidnap you therefore i was silent kidnap me cried beatrice indignantly how could they the gang are very clever and could do what they wanted to said durban drily and as alpenny hated you he certainly would have put no bar in the way of your being carried off it was only i who stood between you and this danger oh durban how much i owe you missyhe kissed her handyou do not owe me so much as i owed your good father who saved me from being lynched in the states but we can talk of that afterwards he added hastily let me go on i was here on the night of the murder you why you went to town i pretended to but after the warning mr alpenny intended to bolt as he feared for his lifethat was why he left the note on your table but i came back here before you returned in the wind and the rain and looked through the window of the countinghouse in which a light burned i saw alpenny lying dead and knew that the black patch gang had accomplished their vengeance did you meet any one no i saw no one then i entered the countinghouse by the secret way missy is there a secret way durban yes i found it by chance see durban advanced to the end of the carriage and touched a spring which was concealed behind the rep hangings at once there was a creaking noise and the sheet of galvanised tin upon which rested the stove swung aside to reveal a narrow flight of stone steps these said durban lead along an underground passage into the shrubbery and from there one can go out by the great gates or the small one i entered by this way as i had a duplicate key of the great gates i searched for the obi necklace and found it by looking everywhere for it i felt the hangings and so discovered the pocket then i left the camp and climbed the downs on to the neck of the first sheep i could catch i tied the necklace and let it stray away but why did you do that asked beatrice astonished because there was a curse on the necklace said durban with all the intensity of his negro nature and i did not want that curse to come upon you you might have got the necklace and then you would have had nothing but misery therefore instead of throwing it away for there was always the chance that it might be found i bound it on the neck of the sheep and lightly thinking that the animal might lose it on the pathless downs i did it missy to save you from the curse well said durban throwing out his hands old orchard found it and has given it to his daughter she will be unlucky for evermore unless she gives it to another person and i hope finished the halfcaste vindictively that she will give it to major ruck in order that he may come to the gallows as he has long deserved them what a strange story and you do not know who killed alpenny no more than i know who killed colonel hall but missy now that i have told you this you will not go to lady watson i must durban i have to earn my living then go to any one but not to that woman and durban fell on his knees i implore you but the more he implored the more beatrice was determined to go and learn if possible why durban feared lady watson so much i go tomorrow she said quietly and twitched her dress from his grasp it is fate fate fate muttered durban gloomily chapter xx a great surprise beatrice kept her word in spite of all durbans protestation that her visit to lady watson would lead to trouble frank as the old servant had apparently been beatrice could not rid herself of the idea than even now he had not told everything there was some mystery concerning lady watson which had a bearing on the other mysteries and this she was determined to find out only by knowing everything would her mind be set at rest the girl was sufficiently unhappy in these days the discovery of the evil by which she was surrounded made her recoil from everyone in terror all people seemed to have skeletons in their various cupboards and beatrice dreaded the chance of becoming friendly with any one else who had a secret also it was pain and anguish to her to stand aside and know that maud orchard possessed vivian of course maud had returned to london and vivianso he saidhad heard nothing about her from the time she had fled with the obi necklace all the same this woman wicked and lawless was his wife and while she lived beatrice knew that vivian could never be anything to her but a friend loving him as she did and in spite of his manifold weaknesses her heart ached as she thought of the long dreary desolate life that necessarily was before her when deprived by a prior claim of his society but recent events had hardened the girls character and she grasped her nettle firmly in other words she made all arrangements to go to london and see lady watson on the chance of obtaining work so long as she could earn her living nothing else seemed to matter beatrice felt very unhappy and lonely what she greatly desired was a confidant dinah being a scatterbrain and wrapped up in jerry was useless while owing to the changed circumstances she could not feel easy in the company of vivian durban after the short interview she had with him in the camp had vanished for when beatrice went again to question him still further she found the place deserted and locked up where durban had gone she did not know and needing him as she did her state of mind was one of wretchedness and foreboding however as she greatly desired advice and comfort she induced vivian to come to the lonely camp and there told him all that durban had told her vivian heard her in silence and wondered at the queer story durban he thought was deeper implicated in the doings of the black patch gang than he chose to acknowledge and he said this to beatrice after some thought the girl vigorously refused to believe in the guilt of the man durban has always been my best friend vivian she said with a look of pain how can you accuse him without evidence it seems to me that there is a great deal of evidence upon which to accuse him said paslow grimly he had the necklace and the crime was committed for the sake of the necklace no it was a case of revenge alpenny evidently betrayed the gang in some way or took more than his fair share of the plunder therefore he was sentenced to death and you were used by durban as the unconscious instrument to give him warning you saw how terrified old alpenny was and how he muttered about the third time also the note he wrote to me was a trick to give him time to get away he would have fled but that he was killed had he fled said vivian judiciously or had he intended to fly he would have taken his jewels with him according to major ruck he had a great many jewels i saw some replied beatrice well perhaps he did make up a parcel of jewels and these were stolen by the thief who killed him no insisted vivian the necklace was left behind or would have been had alpenny intended to fly to the continent with his plunder in order to escape death he certainly would have packed up the obi necklace at once as it was he left it in its hidingplace and durbanas he saysfound it there how do you meanas he says questioned beatrice struck by the peculiar tone in which paslow uttered the words i mean that durban may be telling a lie alpenny may have got the necklace ready to go away durban coming back as he confessed to you he did probably killed him and stole the necklace nonsense said beatrice quickly for what reason should he steal the necklace and then hang it on the neck of a sheep ah that is orchards story you told it to durban and he seized the idea orchards daughter is connected with the gangmy wife that is added vivian with a grimace so it is probable that orchard also is a member probably durban after killing alpenny went up the downs and gave the necklace to orchard for safe keeping no one would expect to find it in the possession of the old man i think that orchard was to have returned it to durban so that money could be made only his daughtermy wifesaw it and wheedled it out of him for herself but i dont think shell keep it long if major ruck sees it i dont agree with you at all said beatrice defending durban as durban was supposed to be in town he could have come back which he did remember yes but only to find alpenny dead had he killed alpenny for the sake of the necklace he could have slipped it into his pocket and have gone away in safety no vivian i believe that durban really believes that there is some spell attached to the necklace and placed it on the neck of the sheep to prevent its doing further harm to anyone especially to me had i found it i certainly should have claimed it lady watson would have claimed it i know that since she inherits all under the will and that is one of the reasons why i go up to town to see her ill tell her all that we know and she will get the necklace from your wife that is if major ruck doesnt get it in the meantime said vivian coolly maud is a clever woman but she wont be able to get the better of major ruck let us have a look at the secret passage we cannot open the door objected beatrice durban opened it with a beam when the body was found dead said the young man and here is the beam left near the carriage all the time he picked up the heavy log of wood and poised it against the door the lock mended but lightly gave way at once and the two had little difficulty in entering here is the spring explained beatrice and walked to the end of the carriage followed closely by vivian in another minute the galvanised tin upon which the stove stood slipped aside and disclosed the damp steps isnt it ingenious said she admiringly very assented vivian let us go down come on but a light ohshe caught sight of a candle on the tablehere is one you lead vivian with the lighted candle the pair went down into the unwholesome passage it descended by means of the steps for some distance and then there was a trend to the right the passage was perfectly straight and had been dug out of the soft earth part of it was roofed with brick but the whole was much dilapidated and showed signs of collapse vivian seeing this and fearing a fall of earth wished the girl to return but this she refused to do i want to see where it leads to she said go on vivian thus urged he cautiously felt his way by the feeble glimmer of the candle in a shorter time than either expected they came to a second flight of steps and scrambled upward the steps ended at a kind of trapdoor vivian placed his shoulder beneath this and with a vigorous push forced it outward and upward the next moment he had leaped lightly on to the surface of the earth and found himself in the wood just outside the walls of the camp oh said beatrice when she was assisted out of the bole and began to recognise her surroundings durban said that the exit was within the camp ah replied vivian with much significance durban has told another lie he is not to be trusted beatrice i am certain he is although appearances are against him declared the girl impetuously he is cautious in speaking even to me as he fears the vengeance of the gang close the trapdoor vivian see she added when he did this the surface is masked with moss and so it was the wood was ingeniously covered with ragged moss and when the trap was down and a few leaves fell on the moss no one could have told that a passage lay underneath it was a most clever arrangement and doubtless had been often used by the scoundrelly gang of which alpenny undoubtedly had been a prominent member the respectable clients however who had come to borrow money and be swindled by the old rascal had always entered by the great gates or if they wished for especial privacy by the smaller one what a dangerous lot of people i have lived amongst said beatrice who was rather pale when they reclosed the door of the countinghouse and left the camp undoubtedly assented vivian rather grimly it is a mercy that the police never came down here you might have been implicated i can see that and for the same reason i refuse to believe that durban is mixed up with these rascalities he served mr alpenny for my sake and for my sake he held his tongue about the roguery which he must have known went on but i do not believe that he took any part in the same vivian well said paslow after a pause you may learn more when you see lady watson but she can have nothing to do with these things she is a lady of rank and fashion she was a friend of alpennys or he would not have left her his money said vivian and is the friend of major ruck i dont know a bigger blackguard in london beatrice said nothing more she quite agreed with her lover and began to be afraid as to what she might discover when she was in the presence of lady watson all the same as she was determined to learn everything and if possible to so get to know the doings of the gang that vivian would be safe from their threats she left early the next morning for town vivian accompanied her to the local station and took a formal farewell of her it had to be formal because of the publicity of the platform and also because their relations with one another since the appearance of the supposed dead wife were so very difficult so vivian coldly shook hands although his face belied the formal action and beatrice watched him through tearful eyes as the train steamed towards brighton dinah had given her a couple of pounds or rather beatrice had borrowed these from her with the intention of repaying her out of the first instalment of a possible salary this was all the money she had in the world and she prayed on the way to london that heaven would see fit to make lady watson welldisposed towards her at victoria station the girl sent a wire to the address which she had procured from dinah who got it from mrs snow this telegram intimated that miss hedgeshe thought it best to keep to the namewas coming to see lady watson on business it was rather a strange thing to do but beatrice was new to social ways and moreover could not by reason of her scanty purse run the risk of having to wait long in town without seeing her probable patroness lady watson lived in kensington and there beatrice not knowing the intricacies of the underground railway drove all the way in a fourwheeler but first she went to a small and quiet hotel which was kept by a sister of mrs lillys here thanks to the housekeepers letter beatrice was received by the counterpart of mrs lilly and felt quite at home you can stay here as long as you like miss said the landlady when beatrice asked for cheap apartments my sister has told me all about you miss a bedroom and sittingroom are waiting for you miss and well talk of payment on some future occasion beatrice worn out and feeling intensely lonely could have wept because of the kindness of this reception but she restrained her tears as she had no desire to make her eyes red for the meeting with lady watson she had some luncheon and then dressed herself in her best mourning and took her way to the great ladys house which was not very far away in a quiet square mrs quail the landlady sent a small servant to show beatrice where the square was and once there the girl soon found the house by its number but when she rang the bell and stood alone on the doorstep she felt very nervous all the same her courage did not give way the interview meant much to her and she was determined to carry it through cost what it might the footman who opened the door said that his mistress was within and conducted beatrice up a wellcarpeted flight of wide shallow stairs into the drawingroom the house was well furnished and in a rather frivolous way which reflected the spirit of its mistress on all hands in the drawingroom beatrice saw evidence of waste of money in little things lady watson apparently liked comfort and spent with a lavish hand in the midst of this modern splendour the girl felt lost accustomed as she was to the plainest of houses and indeed as a carping critic might have said she was not accustomed even to houses seeing that she lived in a disused railway carriage however beatrice had little time for thought hardly had she cast a glance round the apartment when lady watson entered with a rush she looked as young and wrinkled as ever and was dressed in a soft teagown exquisitely made at the distance she looked twenty but when near and in spite of the blinds being down she looked nearly forty however her eyes brown and bright twinkled as merrily as ever and to beatrices surprise she flung her arms round her visitors neck my dear child she rattled on i am glad to see you i received your telegram and stopped in on purpose to see you of course you have come to be my companion your room is ready and we will be such friends ah you dont know how i love you why should you asked beatrice rather surprised by this gushing reception and mistrusting its truth oh there are a thousand reasons ill tell you them later come my dearest child take off your jacket and hat and no lady watson i have only come for a short visit i want you to get me a situation as a governess and a governess with your beauty cried the little woman what nonsense let me look at you dearest and she pulled up the near blind to let in the sunlight on the girl it made beatrice look like an angel and lady watson aged in the golden splendour at least a dozen years oh you are lovely lovely why what are you looking at oh at my necklace beautiful diamonds are they not yes beatrice with white lips recognised the necklace at once as that stolen by maud paslow but where did you get it why do you ask that questioned lady watson sharply it is the obi necklace you got it from maud orchardfrom vivians wife ithat iswhat do you mean stammered lady watson growing pale under her rouge it is minemine mr alpenny gave it to me no you are in this plot too you know about the murder i shall tell the police i shall beatrice hardly knowing what she did was about to rush from the room when lady watson stopped her wait she said in a cracked scream if you denounce me you ruinyour mother chapter xxi lady watsons story my mother beatrice stopped short at the door and caught hold of a chair to support herself the shock of this discovery came upon her with overwhelming force impossible it is true said lady watson advancing towards her with outstretched arms i am your most unhappy mother the girl suffered the little woman to embrace her but did not return the caress my mother she repeated again faintly it is impossible lady watson dont call me lady watson i am your mother i should not have told you i promised durban that i would not but nature is too too strong cried lady watson theatrically my heart spoke and i responded darling darling she embraced beatrice still more affectionately and guided her to a low armchair into which the bewildered girl sank unresistingly was lady watson in earnest was she really her mother were these violent demonstrations genuine beatrice could not tell the whole thing seemed to be beyond the bounds of possibility what of the supposed mother who was buried in hurstable churchyard revolving these things in a muchpuzzled brain beatrice sat silently staring at the artificial little woman who claimed so sacred a relationship lady watson seeing the girls coldnessas she thought it wassqueezed out a few serviceable tears oh cruel cruel she wept my own childthe baby that i carried in my armsto act like this it is wicked it is incredible mother said beatrice blankly are you really and truly my mother of course i am snapped the elder woman drying her tears how often do you wish me to repeat it i am not in the habit of calling other peoples children my children cant you say something more affectionate you coldhearted girl it is all so strangeso new gasped beatrice tell me how it came about that i never knew this until now its durbans fault said lady watson sullenly durban always hated me though im sure i was always kind to himthe beast durban is a good man said beatrice quickly oh dear me that is exactly the exasperating sort of thing your father would have said he was a good man alsothe kind of man i most particularly hate never mind ill make everything plain to you ive held my tongue long enough now i am going to speak out and take back to my hungry heart the baby girl i loved did you really love me asked beatrice doubtfully yesreally i did you were all that i had to love as my husbandthe first one your fatherwas a kind of stone image with no feelings and no affections i loved you fondly and wanted to be your dearest motherwhich i certainly ambut that durban and that horrid alpenny were too strong for me no it wasnt alpenny i dont think he wanted to bring you up but durban insisted and i gave way why did you there were reasons said lady watson evasively and a spot of red burned on either cheek they must have been strong reasons to make a mother surrender her child to the care of strangers durban wasnt a stranger he was in the house when you were born and really you might have been his own child from the fuss he made over you but colonel hallyour father my dearsaved durban from being lynched in america and durban always pretended that he loved him dearly i am sure durban did insisted beatrice he is not a man who says one thing and does another that is just what he does do cried lady watson fanning herself with a flimsy handkerchief all lace and scent look at the way he has kept you in the dark all these years and i am quite sure that he has told you heaps and heaps of lies these niggers never can tell the truth durban told me as little as he could confessed beatrice but he never told me a deliberate lie i am sure but if you are my mother who is the woman who is buried as you not as methe idea protested lady watson as alpennys wifeand a nice bargain she got in that old scoundrel she was amelia hedge and called herself mrs hedge when she married alpenny to account for you it wasnt my fault im sure i always liked to have you with me beatrice as you were such a pretty child and it looks well to have ones children about one nowadays but durban would insist that i should give you upand perhaps he was right after all ended lady watson candidly as sir reginaldmy second husbandwould never have married a widow with a child so the weak little woman babbled on and beatrice felt her heart sink as she at last beheld her mother to think that this frivolous and weak creature should have given her birth then a thought came to her durban said that my mother was quiet and silent and so i was for years and years and years colonel halli never could call him george he was so military and stiffmade my life a perfect burden and never would give me any pleasure i was crushed beatrice perfectly crushed and held my tongue because i could not be natural i was a dull dowdy thing in those days but now i really am something to look at and to listen to and lady watson smirked in a near mirror at her artificial beauty mother said beatrice accepting what appeared to be the inevitable with a good grace although the discovery of the relationship did not please her will you tell me if you had anything to do with the murder of my father oh dear me no said lady watson perfectly calmly and showing no signs of indignation at the accusationwhich it was in a way of course durban made capital out of it and forced me to part with you and the necklace because of that horrid death but ive got back the necklacelady watson fingered it fondlyand you how did you get the necklace a friend of mine called miss carr gave it to me she got it from her father though i dont know how he got it im sure major ruckyou know the man dearwanted maudthat is miss carrto give it up and would have killed her for it hes just the sort of bully who would kill a woman to get money and i dont mind saying it although he was my friend so maud to spite him gave it to me and wait one moment mother were you not going to elope with major lady watson interrupted in her turn and uttered an embarrassed scream yes i was my dear your father was a beartheres no good saying anything else he was a bear i couldnt stand his puritan airs any longer and on the very night he was murdered i intended to elope with him to pay your father out but alpenny met me at the head of the stairs who told you that mrs snow said beatrice promptly julia duncan ah she always was a falsehearted cat why the very last time i saw her and that was when i went down to get alpennys money she promised to hold her tongue i forced her to speak and you have forced me you clever girl i promised durban never to reveal who i really was but i did so through natural affections and now you know im sure i dont care added lady watson with a reckless air durban can do his worst what can he do accuse me of your fathers murder although im as innocent as a child but i dare say hell hold his tongue if i pay him well he was always fond of money and alpennys legacy has made me rich i dont think durban can be bribed nor do i think he is fond of money said beatrice with decision but for my sake he may hold his tongue well i shant give up the obi necklace muttered lady watson the colonel bought it for me he got it from a brazilian negro and said there was a curse on itat least the negro did for that reason your fatherwho really was fond of me i suppose although he had a horrid dull way of showing his lovewould not give it to me he kept it in a green box along with his papers beside his bed and i got it from there when he was lying dead did you see him dead asked beatrice horrified of course i did that is why durban says that i killed him he always did hate me the beast beatrice passed her hand wearily across her forehead i cannot gather much from these scraps of information she said irritably please tell me all connectedly and from the beginning oh dear me how very like your father you are said lady watson with an affected shudder he was always so very precise i dont know how i came to marry so dull a man but my father made the match he was a planter in jamaica and colonel hall was stationed at port royal i was merely a childseventeen in factand the colonel fell in love with me i married him although i liked twenty other men better sir reginald was one but he went to england on leave and my father made me marry the colonel while reginald was away he was in a rage when he came back afterwards when the colonel died so dreadfully sir reginald married me as he knewif no one else didthat i had nothing to do with that horrid murder tell me the events of that night said beatrice keeping the voluble little woman to the point well im doing it if you will only let me speak snapped lady watson but you are like your father and want me to hold my tongue as he did im sure i never opened my mouth for years with that man shortly after you were born we went to england amelia and durban came also as durban would never leave the colonel and amelia was brought for your sake you being a babyand a very pretty one too colonel hall went down to see mr paslow at convent grange as they were great friends i stopped in london for a time as i was so sick of the colonels stiffness then i came down because he insisted on it major ruckwho was really a nice man in those daysfollowed and stopped at the camp as he wished me to elope with him on the night of the murder i arranged to do so had the major anything to do with the murder asked beatrice hurriedly he said he hadnt but he might have told a lie he never could tell the truth said lady watson vaguely but as i was sayingand dont interrupt again pleasei dressed late at night i knew that mr paslow and alpenny and the colonel had gone to bed your father and i were in different rooms because we had quarrelled i came out into the passage and intended to meet major ruck at the camp where he had a carriage waiting alpenny should have been at the camp also only he stopped at the grangeto spite me i believe as he loved me and wanted to prevent my elopement did he know about it yes he wheedled the information out of the major and learned also that i intended to bring the obi necklace with me it was because of the necklace as well as because of his love for me that he stopped at the grange to thwart me but the necklace was in my fathers possession in a green dispatch box beside his bed explained lady watson you are quite right dear so it was i stole out into the passage and there i met at the head of the stairs that horrid alpenny who was on the watch julia snow was watching also as she told me afterwards the horrid woman she loved george and i knowi knowplease go on i am going on cried lady watson in despair but you will interrupt alpenny said he wanted to help me to get away which was a lie i believed him and we went to the colonels chamber i could easily make some excuse you know that i had the toothache or something and george would believe me but your dressyour hat oh i took those off and gave them to alpenny who remained outside the bedroom door when i went in i nearly screamed for the colonel did look so horrid lying in bed with his throat cut i could see it and him plainly in the moonlight i called alpenny and we were both afraid then i saw the box and got out the necklace ugh said beatrice disgusted at this callous behaviour why didnt you call for help what and be arrested everyone knew that george and i were on bad terms and besides with the necklace in my possession i might have been accused of killing him alpenny said we had better take the necklace and go away the window was open and i suppose the man who killed the colonel got in there i took the necklace and went out into the passage with alpenny closing the door after me i put on my hat and cloak and then he refused to let me go to the camp to meet the major unless i gave him the necklace i had to and then went back to bed why didnt you elope asked beatrice sarcastically my dear my nerves were shattered and it would have been most dangerous i went to bed and pretended to be horrified when i heard of the murder the major would not marry me when he found that i hadnt got the necklace so after the inquest i came to town and met reginald watson i told him everything and he married me but how did my nurse marry mr alpenny durban arranged that said lady watson promptly he was almost mad when he found the colonel was dead and he forced the truth out of me i believe julia snow told him what she had seen i knew durban would say nothing because if he hated me he loved you and your father he did hold his tongue but he insisted that alpenny should give the necklace to him in trust for you of course alpenny would not do so and durban threatened to inform the police then durban who didnt know much about english law thought that he might get into trouble and be accused i really dont know added lady watson pondering if i didnt threaten to accuse him oh how could you well he might be guilty niggers always prefer to cut throats and your father certainly died in that horrid way the man with the black patch killed him did he i heard something about that but im not sure however to make a long story short durban arranged that you should be taken charge of by alpenny and that he should look after you along with amelia who was consumptive but why lady watson rose wrathfully you may well ask that beatrice why because if you please this nigger didnt think i was a proper person to look after you then amelia refused to go to the camp unless she wentas she said respectably alpenny who was in love with me and knew that i intended to marry sir reginald agreed to marry her in order to keep the necklace amelia died shortly afterwards and for the sake of safety was buried as your mother you took her name of hedge you know thats the story it is a very horrible one said beatrice rising in her turn lady watson burst into tears it is not my fault she sobbed im sure in spite of reginalds objections i would have kept you beside me only durban took you away and amelia also because she wanted to marry a rich man as alpenny was supposed they knew too much i had to yield and then reginald thought you were dead but i have always loved and longed for my pretty baby kiss me darling no said beatrice sternly the little woman looked up aghast your own mother i do not look upon you as my mother said the girl coldly you deserted me in the most heartless manner i dont know how much of your story is true it is all truei swear it it may be and you may be innocent but to see my father lying dead and not give the alarm was wicked the assassin might have been caught and i would have been caught cried lady watson vehemently as it was people thought that i had something to do with the horrid thing i was quite innocent she protested sobbing beatrice her voice rose to a scream as the girl walked to the door for the second time i am going said beatrice quietly you must give me time to think over our new relationship ill see you again soon oh wailed lady watson as the door closed on the daughter who rejected her how like your fatherhow very like beatrice walked calmly down the stairs and opening the front door herself returned to the hotel to think over the matter at the door of the little inn she found the stout landlady arguing with a redhaired foxy man waterloo said beatrice drawing back there chuckled the rogue grinning at the landlady she knows me does the young lydymiss come at oncedurbans dying durban dying hell be dead in a jiffy said waterloo grinning you come miss then dropping his voice he wants to tell you who killed your father chapter xxii revelations dont go with him miss urged mrs quail hes a bad one look at his eyes beatrice had no need to look at them she knew well the evil that they held and shrank as she always did from contact with this creature of the night certainly waterloo was much better dressed than when she had seen him last he wore a somewhat shabby frock coat a pair of smart patentleather boots a fashionable collar and a silk hat which glistened like the sun the tramp actually reeked of some fashionable scent and swung a dandy cane with a genteel air he wore a wig from under which his natural red hair peeped and his false teeth looked aggressively white and new on the whole waterloo evidently considered that he was now a perfect buck and ogled the comely landlady and the shrinking girl with an assured air you are not deceiving me asked beatrice forcing herself to be civil to the man for obvious reasons selp me bob no leered the rejuvenated wreck durban he come up ttown tother day an wos run hover by a bus as wos drivin motorcar fashionsmore miles an hour than sense miss he ses tmean ole pal of hisas he wanted to see you and tell you wot yshould know he ses es hell tell you who killed your par an th ole alpenny bloke this remark decided beatrice come what may she determined to learn the truth at last also durban was her best and oldest friend and from what lady watson had said he had evidently been a better friend to her than she knew after a moment or two she made up her mind and turned to mrs quail who was gazing disdainfully at the leering waterloo i must go mrs quail she said decisively if durban is ill i must help him but with this man oh im saif laidy no arm about me oh no not at all if mr paslow comes said beatrice addressing the landlady and taking no notice of waterloo tell him i have gone with waterloo to see durbanwhere is he she asked the man in a room in a ouse malta street stepneyno said waterloo quickly and passed along a scrap of dirty paper to mrs quail if the young laidy dont come back saif an sound youll find me ere if shes not back by nine tonight retorted mrs quail putting the paper in her pocket ill see the police about the matterand after all miss i wouldnt go with him i must said beatrice quickly there is so much at stake and giving the landlady no further time to remonstrate she walked away with waterloo who swaggered like the buck he thought he was how do we get to stepney asked beatrice while they walked along kensington high street underground said waterloo glibly underground to bishopgate an then we taike th liverpool street train to stepney an that is enough said beatrice cutting him short and walking very fast speak as little to me as you can waterloo scowled and his scowl was not a pleasant sight however he held his tongue until they were safe in a firstclass underground carriagebeatrice did not want to go with this creature in a thirdclass and luckily there were three or four ladies in the compartment while the train was steaming through the tunnels waterloo held a whispered conversation with beatrice at first she was inclined to stop him but when she heard what he had to say she listened attentively i saiy murmured the rogue confidentially youre a clipper yare tryin to find out all about us but ywont theres only one cove es can put things straight an thet is waterloo esquire what do you mean by that ah thets tellins miss dont you arsk any questing an no lies will be tole but if ymeke it wuth me while ill git you the young gent all tyourself mr paslow thets him not a bad coveoh by no meansbut a greenhorn miss es anyone kin see if he dont do wot the major wants him to do hes a gonersaime es your par an the alpenny cove what does the horrible creature mean beatrice asked herself half aloud and he heard her don call naimes miss th king comes the cadgers waiy sometime es i knows an you may ave to meke use of me some daiy its all a questing of money of money yusshe leaned forward and whispered hoarsely in her earor of thet there necklace it is not mineit is but it are yours miss and you git it wen yarsked everyone to try an git tknow wot ywant tknow and fail said waterloo with great emphasis you pass along the necklace tme and then ill tell y wots wot im a oner i am but why do you wish to betray your friends for me ah their toimes acomin to an end miss an i dont want tbe in et th finish which is in th dock wen ole alpenny wos alive he ad a ead he ad but this major ruck coves spilin things as quick es jimmy oh but in what way oh i aint agoin to saiy any more wen th bust comes ythink of me miss and with this final remark waterloo lay back luxuriously against the soft cushions beatrice saw the necessity of enlisting this traitor on her side and saw also that he was open to bribery although the bribe of the necklace was a very costly one but in spite of all her endeavours she could not get the man to talk waterloo only winked and leered and thrust his tongue in his cheek much to the disgust of the ladies opposite who apparently could not understand how such a quiet ladylike girl came to be in the society of such a raffish animal with the utmost gravity waterloo conducted beatrice to the liverpool street station and placed her in another firstclass carriage this time he got the tickets himself and she wondered where he had procured the money to do so from what she had seen of the man he was a genuine tramp and more used to walking than to riding but it was evident that he belonged to the black patch gang and apparently the gang had been successful lately waterloo himself declined to impart further information but leered and winked as usual so beatrice held her peace and tried to steel herself to the adventure she recognised that she was acting foolishly in going into the slums with waterloo but since vivian was lost to her she felt that she cared very little what happened besides desperate diseases require desperate remedies and in that proverb she found ground for believing that she was acting rightly finally she was certain that whatever was intended her life would be safe and while she lived she could always get out of any difficulty by exercising her strong will and undaunted spirit alighting at stepney station waterloo conducted her to a fourwheeler and this drove off down the street then waterloo engaged her in conversation and hinted that he knew everything about the black patch gang beatrice listening to his half hints became so interested that she did not notice that the cab was passing down a series of mean streets and only when it drew up with a jerk before a most disreputablelooking house did she see that she was in a very low and dangerous neighbourhood however she had gone too far to retreat and therefore stepped out with great coolness the cab drove off without payment one of us said waterloo jerking his thumb over his shoulder with a wink they were admitted through a closely barred door into a narrow passage dimly lighted on ascending the stairs beatrice noted how foul the walls were with grime and grease various small rooms some of which had open doors revealed raffish individuals and various states of disorder the place was a den as foul as that inhabited by mr fagin and beatrice used to the fresh air of the country felt ill with the tainted atmosphere however she suppressed all signs of disgust as these would have made waterloo angry and for apparent reasons she wished to cultivate his good will he led her to the very top of the house and came to another door sheeted with iron in response to a touch on a button this opened and pushing beatrice in he closed it again remaining on the outside the girl who was taken by surprise tried to reopen the door but it was fast closed and she heard the little brute chuckle on the other side she was caught like a rat in a trap it only remained for her to see if durban was caught alsoor if he exercised sufficient authority over the gang to release her when she wished to return to kensington the surroundings amazed her the corridorit was not a narrow passage this timewas spacious and decorated with velvet hangings the carpet was velvet pile and the ceiling was painted in a most delicate and artistic manner while she was marvelling at this sight so unexpected a side door opened and she beheld major ruck as gigantic as ever arrayed in a smart smoking suit just in time for afternoon tea said the major gallantly and threw open the door please to enter a bachelors den miss hedge but durban she asked drawing back i will tell you all about him said the big man with a bland smile in the meantime as we have much to talk about and you must be faint after your long journey into these wilds perhaps you will enter and accept my hospitality beatrice cast one look at him and entered without another word the room was not large but furnished with a splendour which startled her when she remembered the exterior of the house the walls were hung with green silk and the hangings were drawn back here and there by silver cords to show choice pictures the ceiling was also painted the floor was stained and covered with valuable persian praying mats and the furniture would have done credit to a west end drawingroom it really looked rather like a womans room as there were plenty of flowers about and on a tiny table of carved wood stood a tea equipage of silver and delicate eggshell china i have made ready for you said the major drawing forward a chair to the table and near a window which was filled in with stained glass i hope you like my crib it is not so comfortable as that in the west end but in these wildshe shrugged his big shouldersone has to put up with hardship will you have some tea no thank you i want to see durban he will be in presently beatrice started to her feet is he not ill he never was better in all his life pardon the ruse that was used to bring you here but i knew well that you wouldnt come of your own free will allow me to go away said beatrice walking towards the door when we have had a talk and understand one anothernot before said ruck rising and standing before the fireplace he was still smiling and bland and genial and looked very spruce in his wellcut clothes it was difficult to imagine such a man in such a room when one recollected the vile neighbourhood you will not dare to detain me against my will oh yes if it be necessary said ruck easily but i trustwith a graceful bowthat it will not be necessary if you keep me here my landlady in kensington has the address of this place and will tell the police i fear the police will waste their time miss hedge the address was a wrong one with which waterloo was purposely furnished the address was stepney but not malta street this is in a different locality come miss hedge you must see that you are in my power but i am a gentleman so do not be afraid afraid the sound of the word made beatrice fling back her head with a proud gesture i am afraid of nothing and no one major ruck i know how to protect myself i hope you will know how to protect mr paslow what do you mean that can be explained after tea do pour out the tea miss hedge it is so pleasant to see a lady officiate beatrice deliberately walked to the table and poured out a cup of tea for the major which she handed to him along with a plate of delicate cakes will you not take one yourself said ruck winningly it is not drugged beatrice although her heart was beating loudly walked back to the table with a gay laugh you do not give me time she said i am not at all afraid of drugs and she filled herself a cup which she sipped with great enjoyment when she also began to eat a cake the major smacked his leg with a look of admiration upon my word miss hedge you are plucky and no mistake i wish you would marry me thanks but i have no wish to we should do great things together urged ruck doubtless but you see i have an aversion to appearing in a policecourt major ruck by the way why did you not tell me that mr paslow had appeared in one i very nearly did said ruck with great frankness as i thought it might frighten you into refusing him but then i thought it would be better to send his wife along is she really his wife asked beatrice doubtfully really and truly paslow always was a moral man you can never marry him now no but i can always love him the shadow without the substance said ruck with a shrug you will find that unsatisfactory miss hedge that is entirely my affair major and why dont you give me my proper name of miss hall oh yes i forgot that you knew all about that matter i know more than you think since i have seen lady watson ruck started she told you nothing he said in vexed tones everythingeven to the fact that she was about to run away with you on the night my father was murdered rucks brow grew dark and he uttered something which was not exactly a blessing however he speedily recovered his good humour and asked for a second cup of tea which beatrice just as goodhumouredly handed to him it was an odd interview well said beatrice after a pause and what do you wish to see me about major i dont want to stay long you seem to forget that you are in my power said ruck nettled by this coolness oh no i dont but i am not afraid come now major you can speak glibly enough when it suits you i pay you the compliment of saying that you dont want to make love i dont all the same i admire you so much that i am mighty near insisting upon your becoming my wife we have a clergyman who belongs to the black patch gang you know ah then you are a member of that gang yes said the major with an embarrassed air i am a poor gentleman who has taken to bad ways instead of earning an honest living that is a pity replied beatrice for in spite of your behaviour major i like you i wish you would turn over a new leaf i doubt if i have one to turn muttered ruck flushing a brickred at her words however if you will give me that necklace i shall try and lead a better life i have to he confessed candidly as i dont mind telling you that the course of the black patch gang is nearly run the police have got to know too much and at any moment may raid us i have not got the necklace said beatrice coldly i know that maud carr had it and told me how her father had found it but instead of giving it to me she passed it along to your mother to whom said beatrice with emphasis it rightfully belongs well yes but also it belongs to me lady watson will not give it to me but she will to you and as a matter of fact your father the colonel left you the necklace you contradict yourself major you said it belonged to my mother possession is nine points of the law said the big man with a shrug and lady watson has the necklace sure enough but you can insist on her giving it to you and then hand it to me ill vanish out of your life and trouble you no more there is a wide field for the exercise of a gentlemans abilities in the states and suppose i decline asked beatrice disdainfully in that case replied ruck regarding her attentively i shall be compelled to accuse mr vivian paslow of having murdered alpenny that is a lie cried beatrice starting to her feet it is the truth retorted the major the real truth chapter xxiii nemesis beatrice sank back in the chair and fixed her eyes fearfully on the man who thus accused vivian of a terrible crime you say that to frighten me she gasped major ruck made no direct reply but touched a bell in response to its sound an old woman neatly dressed but as evillooking as the tramp appeared send waterloo to me said the major the old woman vanished and major ruck strolled to the window whistling with his hands behind his back beatrice grasping the arms of her chair with the perspiration beading her forehead wondered what waterloo had to do with the accusation she remembered the tramps hint and fancied that perhaps after all he really knew the truth but that the truth should place vivian in the position of an assassin appeared too terrible for words while she thus meditated and the major whistled waterloo with his familiar leer appeared in the presence of his master the old manfor he was very old as durban had said in spite of his attempts to renew his youthseemed meaner than ever and very much afraid yuss major said waterloo meekly ruck wheeled sharply tell this young lady what you saw of alpennys murder he commanded why lor bless me i sawr very little sir whined the tramp tell what you did see and how vivian paslow killed the man i dont believe iti cant believe it muttered beatrice twisting her hands in agony wait till you hear what waterloo has to say said ruck grimly it wos this waiy miss said the tramp addressing himself to the pale girl the alpenny cove he set me to watch you an mr paslow seein as you loved one another and do still in spite of all murmured beatrice while the major raised his eyebrows superciliously i wos awatchin the pair of you on thet night went on waterloo in a cringing way and follered you miss to th oak you were the man crouching near the gates of the camp yuss miss i guessed you sawr me i follered y and then wen mr paslow sawr me he follered me he got old of me and kicked me and i tuck out my knife to stab him but he went away and back to the oak i pulled myself together and follered to knife him if i could you had gone miss and mr paslow he went to the camp to see if you wos back miss i didnt keep quiet enough in the follering and mr paslow he caught me agin near the camp and kicked me ard i tried to use my knife said waterloo with a venomous look but he took it off me and climbed over the big gates i follered why did mr paslow enter the camp questioned beatrice to see if you wos back miss explained the tramp while the major smiled graciously i follered to git back me knife i sawr the door of the countinghouse open an the ole cove alpenny come out hollering thieves he was dressed in his hat an cloak to go away that interpolated the major will be explained later wen he sawr mr paslow he made for him and mr paslow held out my knifeunthinking like alpenny fell on it and then he struck mr paslow i never sawr any cove go so mad es mr paslow did he fair raged and got the ole man down an cut his throat no no no cried beatrice fiercely you lie i dont lie now said waterloo sullenly its the truth and wen mr paslow sawr me comin over the gate he bolted leaving his handkerchief behind ah beatrice remembered what durban had said about the handkerchief mr paslow left that with mr alpenny on the day he quarrelled with him previous to the death did mr paslow explain that himself asked ruck sneeringly no durban gave me the explanation i never spoke to mr paslow of the handkerchief as i believed durban and durban told that lie to save your asking mr paslow though i dare say added the major with a shrug that paslow would have lied also had you spoken to him go on said beatrice speaking to waterloo with grey lips the conviction was forcing itself upon her that after all he might be telling the terrible truth wen mr paslow slung his ook said waterloo leering and more at his ease he got over the big gate i dragged alpenny into the countinghouse and laid him out then i locked the door and got away by the underground passage outside i heard voices and saw the major here quite so said ruck courteously and now i can tell the remainder of the story i came down miss hedge to punish alpenny who had been betraying the organisation of which he was the founder the black patch gang said beatrice faintly she felt very ill exactly alpenny founded it thirty years ago and i was one of the earliest members as was waterloo here when alpenny was stopping at convent grange with your father and mr paslows father he was even then a receiver of stolen goods although the operations of the gang were not so wide then as they have been since we include all classes amongst us tuft the lawyer who acted for alpenny and who got mr paslow out of trouble when he was accused of shoplifting is one of us so is his wife miss carror as i should say mrs paslow i am the head of the lot the cabman who drove you here is a member so is the doctor who attended miss carrs double and who gave a false certificate by my direction why asked beatrice quickly well if you had procured me the necklace i would have allowed you to marry paslow and then if miss carr had married this american we would have got money out of him i always added the major with a smile showing his white teeth believe in killing two birds with one stone however to resume we are bound by a deathoath not to betray one another alpenny made a lot of money and found that the police were getting to know too much he decided to bolt i warned him twice and the third time the warning was conveyed by durban through mr paslow wait is durban one of the gang no scowled the major with a sudden change of tone he is too honest but he knows everything about us because we threatened to kidnap you he held his peace however alpenny received his third warning and instead of profiting by it he prepared to bolt i thought he would do it and went down with another man to kill him kill him screamed beatrice oh no no oh yes yes said the major coolly we had to make an example of him however mr paslow saved us the trouble when waterloo here heard my voice he came out and told us the truth i entered by the great gates as i had a duplicate key waterloo went through the underground passage and let us into the countinghouse we saw the body and searched for the obi necklace which however we were unable to discover it was in a pocket behind the rep curtains said beatrice and durban found it i know all about that but at the moment we could not find the necklace and as you might be back at any moment according to waterloo here we had to go away but i picked up mr paslows handkerchief where he left it on the ground while struggling with his victim and soaking it in the blood i left it beside the body in the countinghouse i found it said beatrice why did you do that i wanted paslow to be accused since he would not join us however you found it and durban explained its presence there by a lie waterloo and the other man whose name need not be mentioned as he is our executioner ah you did not intend to kill mr alpenny yourself no said ruck with an expression of disgust i have done many criminal things in my time but my hands are free from blood this man was always employed to punish any traitor i took him down to kill alpenny but mr paslow as i say saved us the trouble i was alone outside the countinghouse as waterloo and the other man locked the door from the inside and then escaped by the underground passage when i was going away amidst the storm i saw you enter the great gates ah beatrice started up you were the tall man in the cloak with the black patch i was admitted the major coolly so now you know the whole storywaterloo you can go the little man seemed glad to get away from the calm searching eye of the major and with a final leer at beatrice he slunk out of the door when alone with the girl ruck turned to her again well he asked what do you want me to do you must get your mother to return the necklace to you and go back to the camp i shall meet you there in a couple of daysin the evening at any moment the police may get to know of the gangs movements and then we will be raided i have had several warnings there are traitors about but i wont punish them since alpennys death things have gone wrong i have not the head to command as had that old scoundrel i confess it freely however i have collected what money i could and i am going to america i want the obi necklace also which will bring me in ten thousand pounds ill settle in mexico and live a decent liferetire as it were said the major jocularly on my money and if i get the necklace then ill say nothing about vivian paslows guilt or about your mothers complicity in the death of your father she never killed him said beatrice weakly she felt crushed by the things she had been told i am not so sure of that if she did not kill him herself she knows who did i wanted the necklace said the major brutally and not her however alpenny got ahead of me but hes dead and now you know my terms i must have that necklace you will hold your tongue ruck bowed gracefully i promise you he said in a smooth voice you can easily see that if you do not accept my terms that i can make myself very unpleasant you forget that if the gang is found out the police will arrest you said beatrice trying to get out of the dilemma in which he had placed her i admit that and so i intend to do what alpenny designed namely to boltwith the necklace of course but even if arrested i could denounce paslow and get him hanged i could also tell lady watsons friends what she is and how she helped to kill her husband i could make things very unpleasant now if you accept my terms ill hold my tongue and then you can marry vivian paslow that is impossible he is married already i dont suppose you intend to kill mrs paslow with that executioner of yours oh nothe major shudderedi can fix matters without going so far believe me miss hedgeor rather miss halli can do all i say you will marry paslowthat is if you are willing to take a hand which is stained with blood i dont believe that he is guilty what not after all the evidence no i cannot believe that vivian would act in such a way well well said ruck impatiently believe it or not as you like miss hall time is precious with me accept my terms and you can return to get the necklace i dont want to keep you here i accept said beatrice faintly there is nothing else for me to do major ruck really i dont think there is said the major pleasantly well then ill expect you in the countinghouse where that old scoundrel was murdered within two daysin the evening if you play me false ill send a letter to the police and mr paslow will find himself in the dock instead of at the altar and now miss hall permit me to escort you to the fourwheeler which will be waiting he held out his long white hand with a polite smile but beatrice ignoring the courtesy walked alone towards the door ruck frowned and winced and followed with a shrug all the same scoundrel as the man was he did not like the implied slight as the two emerged into the corridor there came a ring at the door with a stifled exclamation of anger the major opened it and there on the threshold stood durban looking green with rage the halfcaste entered hurriedly and closed the door waterloo told me that missy was here he said in an imperious tone and i have come to take her away oh durban durban cried the girl and seized his arm its all right missy he patted her hand you are safe with me she is safe in any case said ruck contemptuously she has accepted my terms and she has my leave to go as to waterloo i will punish him for telling you what he had no right to tell you he has told many other things he has no right to tell said durban significantly and to the police what the majors face became ghastly and he reeled against the wall with an oath the game is up major said durban holding the hand of beatrice still tighter all i want to do is to get miss hall away before the police come to arrest the lot of you i believe you told the police yourself said the major choking with fury waterloo would never dare pshaw i come to give you warning major as you have always been kind to me waterloo was in league with my dead master to cheat you and the rest of the gang is this true asked the major of himself biting his carefullytended nails it is impossible i could have staked my life on waterloos truth then you would lose your wager said durban the man is and always was a scoundrelcome missy one moment said ruck recovering himself i am ready to get away and have placed all my money safely abroad when do the police come this night i believe said durban i came up from town a few days ago to see if i could find out who killed alpenny i guessed it was one of the black patch gang especially as you gave him warning through meor rather through mr paslow in making enquiries i heard enough to convince me that waterloo was in correspondence with the police and was prepared to turn kings evidence to save his skin and the beast was here only a few moments ago where is he where you wont find him he met me down the stairs a short time since and told me what i now tell youthat the police were going to break up the gang he hates you major because you once horsewhipped the poor wretch he also told me that missy was here and i came to save her from being taken along with your scoundrels waterloo has hidden himself where he is i dont know he guessed that i would tell you i suppose as i let him know that i knew of his treachery you wont get him major oh yes i shall said ruck grimly im not going to be betrayed by a reptile like that without revenging myself all the same miss hall i hold you to my terms remember the camp in two daysseven in the evening of the second day beatrice bowed her head being too weak to speak durban with a surprised glance at the majorfor he could not understand the reason of this appointmentdrew the girl away and together they descended the grimy stairs leaving the major arranging for immediate flight the fourwheeler was waiting sure enough and durban told the man to drive to the station when in the cab with his young mistress durban questioned her about the interview and the appointment beatrice told him the truth and concealed nothing and i fear she said with a shudder that the major will betray vivian in spite of everything no said durban quietly when he gets the necklace he will hold his peace the major is not a cruel man in spite of his surroundings and folliescriminal follies he will hold his tongue but i doubt if waterloo will he wants the necklace also said beatrice faintly i dont care if he gets it or if the major secures it or if lady watson keeps it missy said durban gloomily it will bring bad luck to either one of the three but the major said that you could marry mr paslow yes i dont know how he intends to arrange but i cannot marry mr paslow i believe him to be innocent but i cannot be sure there was the handkerchief you know i lied about that to save you pain missy said durban sadly but it really seems as though mr paslow was guilty but he is not how do you know because i know who killed mr alpenny you durban she said astonished yes you can marry mr paslow with a clear conscience missy because you love him and he is innocent of this crime then who is guilty durban i am missy i killed the master chapter xxiv the necklace in spite of her regard for the old servant beatrice shrank from him as far as the space of the fourwheeler would permit it was not agreeable to be cooped up with a selfconfessed murderer especially when the crime had been of so terrible a nature durban saw the movement and his eyes filled with tears he was always emotional and wept at very slight provocation dont shrink from me missy he implored much agitated i did it for you missyfor you why for me asked beatrice controlling herself with an effort ill tell you when we are in the train replied the man as the cab stopped at the station he assisted her to alight and she strove to suppress the shudder which almost overcame her as she touched his hand shortly they were seated in the train which was going to liverpool street as the distance was very short durban commenced to tell the story of his crime at once fortunately there was no one else in the carriage missy he said solemnly your dear father saved me from being hanged in the states i was accused of stealing a horse and although it was utterly false the white men wanted to lynch me on account of my colour the colonel however came upon the scene and he saved me the real culprit confessed a few days later but had it not been for the colonel i should now have been dead since that day to the hour of his death i never left him and he always trusted me you did not kill him durban faltered beatrice pale with fear missy he exclaimed vehemently i would rather have killed myself than the good man who saved me no i did not kill him but i believe alpenny did for the sake of the diamond necklace no no cried beatrice quickly my mother told me that she took the necklace from the green box and as she was in the company of mr alpenny all the time he must be innocent it might be so said durban gloomily but i never did trust your mother why do you dislike her so asked beatrice wonderingly in the interest of the conversation she quite forgot the earlier confession of the old servant why asked durban fiercely because shes a wicked woman and made my dear colonels life a misery she was always fond of admiration and she broke his heart but for the sake of his name and but that he loved you missy as i love you the colonel would have separated from her many and many a time she was always flirting with other men she would have run away with alpenny had he been willing to settle a good income on her she would have eloped with major ruck but that he refused when he found that she had not the obi necklace and alpenny left her the moneyi was angry at that yes i remember how angry you were because she deserved it so little said the servant with a gesture of rage but everything has gone well with her she may not have killed the colonel but she knows who did and i believe she and alpenny between them are guilty but she went away as i arranged to keep things quiet for your sake missy i could not bear that there should be a blot upon your name i intended to tell you one day who you were and about the money you ought to have but you found out things for yourself i let you do so as i thought that you might be the chosen instrument to put things right you have proved yourself to be so for now the black patch gang which has been the cause of these troubles will be broken up and everything will be right durban i cannot believe that a good man like yourself would murder mr alpenny god bless you for that thought missy but i did kill him and for your sake he was about to force you into a marriage with major ruck whom i knew to be a scoundrel you would have killed yourself had you married him i should never have married him said beatrice firmly yes you would insisted durban alpenny would have threatened to accuse your mother to the police in order to save her you would have consented to become the wife of that wretch perhaps said beatrice hesitating is he a wretch durban yes he is also a gentleman and was in the army but he has no moral principles he never had he was kicked out of the army for cheating he has been twice or thrice suspected of cardsharping but the charges could not be brought home to him there is not a club in london will have him for a member and he knows only the wicked needy people who hang on to the skirts of society he knows ladyi mean my mother yes but he knew too much about her for her to refuse to acknowledge his acquaintance lady watson knows very good people as her husband sir reginald watson was a rich and wellknown sporting officer nothing is known in society about lady watsons past or her connection with the death of colonel hall her first husband that is an old story and people forget very easily nowadays when a lady is rich what with sir reginalds money and mr alpennys your mother must be very wealthy did she inherit nothing from my father no she did not the moneyand there was a great deal of itwas left to you missy with your mother as guardian but i knew that if your mother brought you up she would ruin you in some way as she is so wicked i therefore threatened to tell the police what miss duncan who now is mrs snow told to methat is about the midnight meeting with mr alpenny on the stairs i insisted that you should be given into my care so that i could look after you and you have done it like a father said beatrice giving him her hand gently durban bent down and kissed it with tears in his eyes i have done my best for your fathers sake missy and at least i have saved you from your mother i would have worked for you and would have taken you from hurstable but i insisted on getting the diamond necklace which rightfully belonged to you but mr alpenny refused to give it up in spite of all threats so i arranged that amelia hedge should marry him and take charge of you alpenny promised that when he died he would leave the money and the diamond necklace to you but he left the money to your mother whom he always loved and the necklace i got rid of as i told you as i feared for its luck but it must be got back from your mother we will go to her house now by this time they were at liverpool street station and the conversation was interrupted for a time but shortly they were seated in a cab as durban thought he could talk more freely in one than if the two returned to kensington by the underground railway as the hansom rolled down ludgate hill and on to the embankment the old servant renewed the conversation we will meet major ruck at the camp missy and give him the necklace as i dont want you to have it but could we not break it up and destroy the bad luck argued the girl it seems a pity to throw away ten thousand pounds on major ruck especially as mr paslow needs money you will have your fathers money said durban obstinately i shall make your mother give it to you of course as you were thought to be dead lady watson got the money and no doubt has spent it but she will have to refund it out of alpennys legacy there will be no need to employ lawyers i can force her to do what i want does she know thatthat beatrice hesitated that i killed alpenny no she does not know that but she thinks that i killed my masteras though i would have hurt a hair of his dear head and i dont believe that you killed alpenny either yes i did missy said durban obstinately he wanted to make your life a misery and i was right to kill him beatrice said nothing for a few moments with a white man it would have been different but durban had negro blood in his veins and did not look upon murder as a more civilised person would have done beatrice was horrified inwardly but she controlled herself sufficiently to keep quiet after all durban had committed the crime for her sake and much as she reprobated his wickednessif wickedness it could be called to kill so evilliving a man as the usurershe could not find it in her heart to condemn him to the uttermost how did you kill him she asked in a low voice i did not go to town that night i returned to see him and had a quarrel in the countinghouse he was violent and flew at me i had a struggle with him and killed him that is all he ended with apparent indifference durban spoke as though he were saying a lesson beatrice looked at him attentively and saw that his face had resumed the usual green colour it always took on when he was excited the story was plausible enough all the same she did not believe that he was guilty any more than she believed in the guilt of vivian you are innocent she said sharply dont deny it you accuse yourself to screen mr paslow do you believe that he is guilty asked durban hoarsely no i dont care what waterloo says what did he say beatrice related the whole accusation with the evidence as detailed by waterloo durban listened attentively and wiped his face guilty or innocent he said in a strangled voice that evidence is sufficient to hang mr paslow i am guilty missy i dont believe it retorted beatrice everything connected with these matters has been sordid and evil but that you who have always been so kind should kill even so wicked a man as mr alpenny is ridiculous nothing will ever make me believe in your guilt but here we are she broke off abruptly say nothing more until we have seen my mother we will get the necklace and close the majors mouth i will question vivian and hear what he has to say no no missy yes yes retorted beatrice imperiously i will not let you my oldest friendmy almost fatheraccuse yourself of a vile crime when i know that you would not hurt a fly durban would have answered but that they had to alight the cab was dismissed and durban rang the bell as lady watson proved to be at home they were shown up into the drawingroom the mistress of the house might have refused herself to durban whom she hated but the footman said that he had been given orders to admit miss hedge whenever she called this showed beatrice two things firstly that her mother really wanted to see her as often as possible and might have some small affection left and secondly that she did not intend to acknowledge her as her daughter seeing that she had given the servant the name of miss hedge instead of miss hall lady watson expressed surprise at seeing durban and joy at beholding beatrice you dear girl she said embracing her you did make me so miserable this afternoon i am just going out to dinner and can only give you ten minutesi am surprised to see you durban and not very pleased mrs hall give me my title if you please said the little woman sharply say what you have to say and go away i wish to speak with my childthe child of whom you robbed me durban shrugged his stout shoulders and turned away while beatrice looked at her mother steadily lady watson was arrayed in a very fashionable dinnergown worn very low and her complexion was coloured to match her jewels were many and rich and conspicuous amongst them was the diamond necklace which they had come to take away she really looked very well in the rosehued light of the drawingroom and wonderfully pretty no one would have thought that she was the mother of this noble sad girl arrayed in deep black ten minutes said lady watson consulting a tiny jewelled watch but you can come tomorrow darling i am going down to hurstable tomorrow said her daughter coldlyto the camp the horrid place said lady watson fastening her glove i shall sell it i think no said durban coming close to her you will give it to miss beatrice along with the money she inherits from her father she inherits nothing yes she does the money of my dead master was left to you for her use she was supposed to be dead that was your fault burst out lady watson savagely and you used the money went on durban as though he had not heard her speak but mr alpennys legacy will provide funds for you to restore the money there is sufficient to give miss beatrice two thousand a year i wont give her a penny said the little woman setting her teeth and looking extremely ugly i want all my money to myself you must return this money said durban coldly and also this very moment you must give back the diamond necklace lady watson placed her gloved hand on the jewel which flashed on her neck this she gasped never it is mine it was bought for me quite so madam said durban but when the colonel found that you were flirting with major ruck he determined to keep it for his child by the willof which i have a copymiss beatrice inherits that necklace child said lady watson tragically will you see your mother robbed by thisthisthis low nigger if the necklace is mine i intend to have it said beatrice coldly it is my intention to make some use of it otherwise i would leave it to you i want to have nothing to do with you lady watson lady watson dashed the fan she held on the table and broke it to pieces i am your mother no said beatrice steadily you never loved me or you would not have given me into the care of strangers he made mehe made me and she pointed to durban for the sake of my dead master said durban calmly come now madam you must give up the necklace i will see your lawyer tomorrow about the transfer of miss beatrices money to herself i refusei refuse take care said durban fiercely and again coming close to her i can make mrs snow tell what she saw on that night i have told all that to my child quivered lady watson crying with fear but not to the police the police echoed the little woman growing pale under her carefully coloured face and sinking into a chair yes if you did not kill the colonel alpenny did no i swear he was with me the whole time he is as innocent as i am you can do nothing i perhaps cannot prove you guilty said durban steadily but i can tell the police what mrs snow saw and get the whole case into the papers who will care when the colonel died so long ago his death is evidently connected with this alpenny crime said durban harshly and so the public will be quite glad to read all about the earlier one what will your friends saywho will take your hand when he or she knows what i have to tell about that midnight meeting and of your projected elopement with the notorious major ruck lady watson trembled and burst into tears which streaming down her face aged her in a few minutes beatrice what am i to do she wept give up the necklace said the girl keeping aloofshe could not find it in her heart to pity a mother who had behaved so badly to her child a wife who had tricked her husband so oftenthen we will leave you and say nothing but if i give up the necklace will you come and see me yes said beatrice with an effort after all you are my mother you horrid girl you are just like your father oh well if i am to be blackmailed by an unnatural child and a nigger i must pay the price and you may be glad that i dont give you both in charge durban crossed to the bell i will ring if you like there is a constable outside no shrieked lady watson and unfastened the necklace with trembling fingers durban took it from her in silence and then she rallied sufficiently to rage you horrible black creature she cried you have stolen my property and have turned from me the heart of my dear child go away i hate the sight of you come missy said durban holding open the door yes gogo beatrice youve made me quite ill i shant enjoy my dinner a bit tonight and there is such a good cook ill have to look after my face againits quite ruined she tripped to the mirror and looked in perfectly calmly while she did this beatrice sad at heart at such frivolity under such circumstances withdrew with durban and they took their way to mrs quails hotel im glad you saved me from my mother durban was all the girl said but in the seclusion of her bedroom she wept bitterly in those days at that moment the world was very grey and dismal chapter xxv waterloo having finished her business in london beatrice returned to hurstable with durban they went back to the camp as the girl did not wish to again take up her abode in convent grange until her relations with vivian paslow were more settled what major ruck meant by his mysterious hints she could not imagine but deep in her heart she cherished a hope that everything would yet be made smooth and that all these troubles which desolated her life would be finally ended by her marriage with the man she loved it may seem strange that she should dwell at the camp along with one who had confessed himself guilty of a terrible crime but beatrice as she had said in london and repeated frequently afterwards did not believe durban to be guilty in an excess of zeal and in order to secure her happiness he professed himself to be the criminal had waterloo and major ruck not accused vivian the girl felt very certain that durban would not have accused himself the man still insisted that he was guilty and beatrice still refused to believe him after much thought she determined to give vivian a chance of clearing himself and believed that could he prove his innocence durban would not proceed with his selfsacrifice with this in her mind she wrote a note to paslow the day after she arrived at the camp durban was not with her at the time as he had gone to the station to get the newspapers it was necessary to see if the black patch gangs quarters had been raided and if major ruck had been arrested if so the appointment which the major had made for the next evening at seven need not be kept paslow looking anxious and eager arrived about three in the afternoon and with him came dinah without giving her brother time to speak the girl flew at beatrice and kissed her several times oh beatrice i have such heaps and heaps to tell you she gasped with a flushed face and very bright eyes jerry and i are going to be married in three months that is indeed good news said beatrice cordially and did not seek to stop the flow of miss paslows confidences after the sordid scoundrels with whom she had been mixed up lately she was more than delighted to be in the company of this homely honest maiden and to hear her artless prattle vivian cast an inquiring look at beatrice as he was anxious to know how she had sped with lady watson and could not understand why she had returned with durban but the girl merely smiled to reassure him although she felt far from smiling and demanded the news from dinah that damsel was only too glad to lead the conversation its this way she declared sitting down and breathing hard jerry has had his salary raised and well have enough to rent a tweeny house at fulham or bedford park or somewhere nice jerry is writing a novel and im going to help him and mr snow has been made a dean of some place in wales i am glad to hear that said beatrice quickly for she thought that this preferment would remove mrs snow from the neighbourhooda thing devoutly to be wished for since the woman disliked her so am i because mr snow will get a large salary and in spite of mrs snow who is a cat mr snow intends to allow jerry and me one hundred a year vivian who is a dear intends to allow me the same so what with this and jerrys salary well have about four or five hundred a year to begin life on i really dont know if i am standing on my head or my heels cried dinah clapping her hands and with her freckled face aglow with lively joy so you see beatrice said vivian with a smile on his dark face her happiness and life are settled she will marry jerry and help him to become the shakespeare of his generation oh no shakespeare only wrote plays said dinah contemptuously or was it bacon jerry is to write novels like thackeray or george eliotbut she was a woman wasnt she well be so happy and i intend to furnish the drawingroom in cherrycolour which always my dear dinah said vivian impatiently cant you leave these minor details to some future occasion ah wait till you and beatrice consult about the refurnishing of the grange said dinah reprovingly then youll find how important all these things are mr and mrs snow go to wales in a month beatrice and i shant be sorry i want to be miles and miles away from my future motherinlaw but i must go dinah rose in a hurry i am on my way to the station to meet jerry i only called in to tell you how delicious everything is goodbye goodbye and dinah kissing beatrice twice took herself off rapidly while vivian shrugged his shoulders what a whirlwind in petticoats said he goodhumouredly i am glad she is to be happy with her lover said beatrice in a pensive manner and i am also glad she added looking attentively at paslow to know that mrs snow is leaving the neighbourhood so am i said paslow with a sigh that woman hates you beatrice she cannot do me any harm replied the girl and then looked again at vivian she noted with a pang how worn and thin he appeared noted also that there were white hairs amongst his thick black locks my poor boy she said tenderly you have suffered vivian looked at her in a startled way and put out his hand as though to keep her off dont he said hoarsely or else i shall forget myself and take you in my arms vivianshe touched his arm and he winced with a flush of colour at the tendernesswe may come together after all beatrice he said breathlessly then dropped the hand which he had seized you know who stands between us she may not always stand between us vivian what is she dead no but major ruck wait vivian let us sit down and talk i have much to tell you dear yes yes sit here vivian hurriedly led her towards a garden seat near the battered sundial and fixing his eyes on her tired face waited impatiently for what she had to say but beatrice did not begin at once she wanted to startle him into telling the truth major ruck and waterloo both accuse you of killing alpenny she said bluntly and looking straightly at him vivian jumped up with a suppressed oath what a lie tell me she said quicklytell me exactly what you did on that night i have told you i caught waterloo and kicked him then i looked for you and not finding you went home next morning i called to see how you were getting on and gave the key of the smaller gate to durban who hung it up in the countinghouse as he told you you were not near this place on that night no i swear i was not beatrice saw from his earnest puzzled look that he really spoke the truth without wasting further time in skirting round the subject she related what had taken place at the black patch gangs den in stepney vivian listened with growing surprise and jumping up began to walk backwards and forwards much agitated when she had finished he stopped before her with an angry air the whole story is a lie he declared decisively i certainly caught waterloo and kicked him he certainly threatened me with a very uglylooking knife but he got away before i could take it off him i wish i had found it before i tied his hands you tied his hands yes with my handkerchief beatrice rose suddenly and caught her lovers arm with so much force that he winced what is it he asked puzzled by her look diddidwaterloo get away with the handkerchief yes i knocked him down and tied his hands i was going away when he got rid of the handkerchief and ran at me with a knife i dodged him and then tried to seize him again but he showed no more fight and ran away he held the handkerchief in one hand and the knife in another vivian cried beatrice with a pale face waterloo killed mr alpennyyes he killed him i am certain what do you mean how can you explain listen i found your handkerchief soaking in the blood of alpenny and lying near the body in the countinghouse yonder i thought for the moment that you were guilty i spoke to durban and he told me that you had given him the handkerchiefno that wasnt it he said that you had left the handkerchief behind when you quarrelled with mr alpenny when you last met him i never did and wait wait of course you didnt to save my feelings durban told a lie why didnt you speak to me i didnt think of doing so you explained about the key i forgot i suppose with all the troubles that we had but you can see now this man waterloo had the knife he had the handkerchief and he was a member of the black patch gang alpenny because he betrayed the gang was condemned to death and waterloo is the man whom major ruck called the executioner he left you to return to the camp and kill mr alpenny then he escaped by the secret passage vivian walked about in an excited manner by jupiter beatrice i do believe that you are right well have the little beast arrested i dare say if the police have raided the stepney den that he has already been arrested oh how i wish those papers would come what papers the daily newspapers durban went to the station to get them as we expect to read about the raid and i want to clear your characterso that durbans life may be saved what do you mean asked vivian utterly puzzled he accuses himself of the crime to clear you he knows that i love you and thinking your loss would break my heart intended to answer for you but i have not committed any crime no but the major and waterloo can build up an accusation against you it will be difficult to disprove and it will not be difficult said vivian determinedly the handkerchief will prove waterloos guilt does durban believe that i am the guilty person i think so or he would not take the guilt upon himself then i forgive his doubts of me because he is so ready to take my supposed crime on his own shoulders but do you believe me to vivianshe stretched out her handsi never have believed you to be guilty you know that and now we both know the truthwaterloo is the criminal and waterloo will soon be in the hands of the police beatrice i shall go and see the constable at hurstable he will send for the inspector who had charge of the case well tell him everything and when major ruck comes here tomorrow at seven he can be arrested but he is not guilty he is an accomplice waterloo apparently killed alpenny by his orderand indeed the major probably was present at the time since he admits himself to have been the man you saw leaving the camp i shall go at once wait here beatrice ill come back with the constable and meantime when durban returns with the papers you can see if the gangs den has been raided yes yes go at once the face of beatrice was aglow with joy and she went with her lover to the great gates which now usually stood wide open and she had every cause for joy they now knew that waterloo was the assassin who had murdered old alpenny vivian was guiltless and so was durban who to save the tears of his young mistress had so nobly taken upon himself the burden of shame when vivian departed posthaste to see the village constable and to put all things in train for the capture of major ruck and his accomplices beatrice walked to and fro much excited dear durban good durban she murmured again and again what a friend he has been to me but there will be no need for this sacrifice vivians character can be cleared and then she hesitated and wondered again if major ruck could fulfil his promise and remove the obstacle to her marriage with vivian she could not think of how this could be done save by the death of maud paslow and yet she did not think that ruck villain as he was would kill a woman all the same he had certainly killed alpenny through the instrumentality of waterloo i must give major ruck the necklace in any case said beatrice quite forgetting that when vivian told the police ruck would need no necklace and would be in the dock she went to her bedroomcarriage and got out the necklace which flashed bravely in the sun it was certainly a magnificent ornament and beatrice was woman enough to regret parting with it especially to such a scamp as the major however as she recollected vivians errand it might be that it would not need to be given up but then she thought if major ruck is arrested he will certainly not forward my marriage with vivian as out of revenge he will hold his tongue with the necklace in her hand she went across to the countinghouse carriage in order to make a packet of it and seal it up the place was chill and dismal in its desolation beatrice closed the door and seated herself at the desk looking about for a sufficiently thick sheet of paper in which to wrap the jewel hardly had she found one when she heard a grating noise and turned her head to see the sheet of galvanised tin upon which stood the stove slip aside the next moment and she saw the red head of waterloo protrude from the hole you cried beatrice starting to her feet and her blood ran cold when she thought of what the reptile had done yuss said waterloo who looked haggard and white the major is after me i cut away from stepney when the plaice was raided by the perlice the major cove got away too and has been follering me he come down by the saime train he is here cried beatrice interrogatively bending forward she had the necklace dangling from her hand and in bending down it was brought within reach of waterloo he snatched at it at once and growled like a dog over a bone yuss he said hoarsely while the girl remained paralysed by his sudden move hes after this and me hes goin to kill me becas i set the peelers on to the gang but hell not come by this passage and ill slip away dont you give the alarm miss or ill cut your throat the same as you did mr alpennys ho you knows that does you yelped waterloo yuss i did an ill kill you if beatrice ran to the door and opened it help help she cried not thinking of the mad thing she was doing to provoke this murderer to wrath there was no help nearthe camp was completely isolated and unless durban came back at once or vivian returned she was at the mercy of this wild beast in the lonely place waterloo apparently guessed that he could do what he liked for he made a spring to get out of the passage as he did so he was pulled back and gave a yell of alarm oh lor whos got me elp elp ah owowits the majorits here he was pulled out of sight apparently the major on the track of the man who had betrayed him had entered the secret passage also and was pulling the traitor down into the depths beatrice stared at the gaping black hole and heard sounds of snarling and worrying and swearing and fighting going on in the bowels of the earth suddenly she heard the shriek of a man in mortal agony with an effort she opened wide the countinghouse door anxious only to escape from the horrible place but as the sunshine streamed on her face everything seemed to grow black round her and she fell down in a dead faint chapter xxvi what took place it was quite two months before beatrice hall recovered sufficiently to hear afterevents for a long time she remained unconscious and then came to herself only to suffer from a severe attack of brain fever the poor girl had gone through so muchshe had borne up with such braverythat the longcontinued strain had sapped her strength and she was seriously ill for weeks even when she recovered her reasonwhich she did owing to the careful and assiduous nursing of vivian and his sisterthe doctor would not allow her to be told anything and indeed beatrice did not seem anxious to hear it appeared as though her mind was a blank all she cared to do was to lie on her bed and listen to vivian reading some soothing book dr herman the same who had examined the corpse of alpenny and had given evidence at the inquest was her medical attendant and he conducted the treatment with great care with such a delicatelybalanced brain as beatrice possessed and after she had undergone such terrible experiences the doctor seemed to be doubtful if she would be quite sane when she got back her physical strength he went about with a grave face and vivians heart was wrung with anguish as he thought of what might happen it seemed terrible that he should for once have a chance of happiness with the woman he loved only to find that she would suffer from something worse than death in those long days of suspense vivian turned more to god than he had ever done before in his careless life and god rewarded his faith slowly but surely beatrice recovered and when the doctor permitted her to be taken on to the terrace in the mild autumn weather the peace and fresh air completed her cure she felt her brain becoming much steadier and again began to take an interest in life but always she desired to have vivian by her side and was never so happy as when he sat beside her couch holding her hand in two months she was quite her old self although paler and thinner but the troubles she had passed through left their marks on her lovely face and in her sad eyes let me tell her everything now vivian urged to dr herman one day she is beginning to ask questions and will not be satisfied with being put off with vague replies ah said the doctor with much satisfaction she is asking questions is she then you can take it from me mr paslow that she will recover completely it is that renewed interest in life which i wished to see wait for a week and then she will be strong enough to hear what you have to say but when she once knows added the doctor raising his finger gravely never let her hear of the subject again never never said vivian with a shudder as he also was only too anxious to bury the past which had tormented him for so long and then he went to tell the joyful news to durban needless to say durban also had been watching everlastingly beside the couch and bed of the creature whom he held dearest on earth he was like a dog and when not within the sickroom would lie on the mat at the door when he heard that his dear young mistress was out of danger he almost went out of his mind and vehemently embraced mrs lilly much to the indignation of that portly female but when she saw his doglike devotion she forgave that exuberant expression of the mans feelings so things slowly worked themselves out to a joyful issue beatrice was told that in a few days she would be informed of all that had taken place since she fainted in the countinghouse and obeyed the orders of vivian that until the time came she was not to ask any questions then one glorious autumn day when the sun was shining with a summerlike force and everything seemed to revive under its royal beams vivian carried her down the stairs as usual and out on to the terrace here in her favourite nook she rested contentedly on a soft couch and a small table was placed beside her dinah and jerry who were also faithful attendants hovered round with shawls and rugs and reviving drinks and suchlike things when beatrice was comfortably established she took vivians hand softly how good it is to be loved she said sweetly who could help loving you my own said paslow tenderly we are all your slaves here where is durban he will come shortly and dinah and jerry can go away why demanded dinah quickly and rather offended because dr herman says that i can tell beatrice everything and it will be better that we should be alone oh vivianthe face of the invalid flushed a rose colouram i to know everything now yeshe bent down and kissed heras a reward for obedience then durban will come and see you and jerry can escort dinah back unless they forget us in lovemaking well said jerry very shrewdly and taking dinahs hand i expect you really wont want us as you will be lovemaking yourselves besides i have to read a letter to dinah from your mother asked dinah rather nervously from my father he is now settled comfortably in wales and likes everything immensely and oh come away interrupted dinah tugging him by the hand dont give me the gist of the letter here cant you see that beatrice and vivian are dying to be alone and i want to consult you again about that study of ours i really dont think that green hangings will suit your complexion and then here dinah dragged the willing jerry down the shallow steps and across the lawn babbling all the time of their future home beatrice left alone with vivian put out her hand and heaved a sigh of pleasure when she felt his warm fingers close on that frail member a thrill ran through her and everything she beheld before her seemed to take on a brighter hue because the man she loved was beside her yet as she felt his touch and looked into his bright facefor bright it seemed though sadly worn and thina recollection of the barrier between them disturbed her pleasant thoughts why do you wish to take your hand away asked vivian as he felt her exert a weak strength youryourwife faltered beatrice faintly you are to be my wife dearest he answered gravely no in reply to her startled look maud is not dead but she never was my wife vivian she said that she was of course to gain her own ends but she is really the wife of major ruck she married him when she first went to town i believe old alpenny arranged the marriage as major ruck being a member of his gang he wished to secure so clever a woman as maud also is this true perfectly true so you can leave your hand in mine for ever that would be a long time said beatrice with a weak laugh of joy but all the same she allowed her little white hand to rest within vivians and then looked at him inquiringly you wish to ask how we found out said paslow smiling easily enough major ruck redeemed his promise and removed the obstacle to our marriage by leaving on the desk in the countinghouse a certificate of marriage between himself and maud orchard wethat is durban and myselfwent to the church where the marriage was solemnised and found that the certificate was genuine major ruck and maud orchard were man and wife some months before i came on the scene and she entrapped me into that unhappy marriage but what was major ruck doing in the countinghouse said beatrice puzzled he was not due until the next evening at seven you forget my darling what has happened waterloo yes yes i remember now cried beatrice half raising herself in her excitement he was coming out to kill me with that horrible knife when someone pulled him down and i fainted it was the major who pulled him down said vivian gently pushing her back be calm beatrice and ill tell you everything but i remember a lot she insisted waterloo said that the den at stepney had been raided and that he had got awaythe major also then because he knewthe major i meanthat waterloo had betrayed the gang he followed him down to kill him the major did not kill him however darling waterloo was wait a moment vivian she entreated i want to see how much i remember waterloo said that the major had followed him down by the same train i suppose the major came by the secret passage vivian placed his arms round her so that her head could rest on his breast darling darling you must allow me to speak what you say is true and you have remembered much major ruck was after waterloo to kill him because of his treachery how he found that the man was coming to hurstable i do not know but the den was certainly raided tuft and the doctor who attended my wifes double are in custodythe gang is broken up the police have examined durban and myself and everything has been made clear while you have been ill the newspapers have been full of the business and jerry snow has made quite a reputation in writing sensational articles go on said beatrice much interested i will if it will not excite you too much no no i am perfectly calm feel my pulse dear vivian did so and caressed her fondly speak as little as you can my dear he said softly and then continued his story waterloo knew that ruck would kill him if he could and never thinking that the major would suspect his coming to the campinto the jaws of the lion as it werehe came down here and the majoras waterloo told youfollowed him waterloo got the necklace said beatrice thinking with an effort he did for a time but the major has it now hush dear the major as he wanted to escape could not wait until the next evening to see you he came down at once or perhaps he followed waterloo however he tracked him to the camp and saw him go down the secret passage ruck went down also and listened below while waterloo was talking to you he knew or guessed that he had the necklace and when waterloo was about to kill youwhich he would have done in that deserted campthe major saved you by pulling waterloo into the passage waterloo fought like a wild cat i believeat least he says that he did what did waterloo confess on his dying bed he did is he dead then quite dead god punished him do listen my own waterloo fought not only for his life but for the necklace but ruck as you know is a big man of great strength he dragged him along the passage and strove to strangle him waterloo tried to use his knife but could not do so at first then ruck secured the necklace and waterloo made a violent effort to strike to escape the wound ruck threw him as far as he could along the passage waterloo struck against the brickwork and tried to rise but the passage as you know beatrice was in bad repair the blow loosened the earth overhead where it was not bricked in and a mass of earth fell which buried waterloo under it then ruck seeing that the villain was punished entered the countinghouse and found you insensible he did not wait to revive you as he knew that the police were on his track he simply left on the desk the certificate of his marriage with maud orchard and bolted where has he gone i cant tell you that but he vanished and his wife maud has vanished also they managed to get a boat at brighton and rowed out at night to a passing tramp it seems that the captain was in the pay of the black patch gang to take the stolen goods abroad however the steamer was waiting offshore and ruck escaped with his wife and the necklace in that way nothing has been heard of him up to date and i dont expect anything ever will be heard of the two maud is clever and so is her rightful husband so i expect now that they have money they will live in some tropical clime in the odour of sanctity at all events my darling they have passed out of our lives thank god for that said beatrice fervently and waterloo durban came back and tried to revive you i returned with the constable and saw that something terrible had taken place while durban and dinah took you back to convent grange i and the constable searched we went down the secret passage as we found the trap in the countinghouse open we heard groans and got some men to dig waterloo out he was taken to the brighton hospital and inspector joneswho had to do with the inquest you rememberwas sent for waterloo made a full confession about alpennys murder yes and about the doings of the black patch gang you were right my dear waterloo was the member ruck called the executioner and i will not shock your feelings by telling you how many people the wretch murdered but he killed alpenny almost in the way he accused me of killing him that is he went back to the camp and there met ruck they entered through the large gates and alpenny dressed for his flight came out he cried for mercy but waterloo cut his throat beatrice shivered dont tell me any more only this darlingthat waterloo gave ruck my handkerchief and he placed it near the body to incriminate me ruck walked to brighton after making an ineffectual search for the necklacewhich was the real reason for the crime and waterloo escaped by the secret passage and loafed up to london as a tramp and durban he arrived later and found alpenny dead he told you all about that he then found the necklace and placed it on the sheeps neck to get rid of it for ever he returned the next morning pretending to know nothing as he was fearful lest he should be accused then ruck was the man i saw at the gate yes he wore the black patch over the left eye as a member of the gang that is their markor rather it was as the gang is now but a name those caught have been sentenced to long terms of imprisonment although ruck and maud have escaped and waterloo is dead the black patch mused beatrice vivian she added suddenly did waterloo kill my father he did said vivian quickly i thought you would guess that it seems that alpenny found out about your mothers intended elopement and told ruck that he would prevent it unless he got the necklace as that was all ruck wantedfor he had no love for your motherhe induced waterloo to try and steal it promising him a share waterloo assumed the black patch so that if possible the blame might be put on to alpenny how do you mean waterloo threw away the patch when he escaped so that alpenny if the doings of the gang ever came to light might be suspected i see go on vivian i am much interested i hope it is not too much for you dearest said paslow earnestly but to make a long story short waterloo entered by the window and tried to steal the green box where ruck had told him the necklace was placed the box however was chained to the bed the noise that waterloo made woke your father but before any struggle could take place and while the colonel was but half awake waterloo sprang on him and cut his throat then while he was trying to wrench open the green box and get the necklace he heard voices those of my mother and alpenny yes but they spoke so low that he did not know who they were or he might have remained as it was he ran away fearful of being caught he dropped the black patch to incriminate alpenny as i told you next day ruck learned that alpenny had the necklace and how he had forced it from mrs hallthat is from lady watson your mother the rest you know how terrible said beatrice with a sigh and my mother she saw the police and substantiated waterloos dying confession but the police acquit her of complicity in the crime however although as little as possible was published in the papers she has gone to the continent and talks of entering a convent and i hope she will like it ended vivian grimly i am not sorry for i never could have loved her vivian but she is my mother after all so i shall see her when we go abroad you shall do what you like dearest we will be married as soon as possible and go to italy for a year can you afford it vivian you can he said laughing dont you know that you have two thousand a year inherited from your father lady watson had spent it but at durbans request she refunded it out of alpennys legacy we will not be rich dearest but we will be able to pay off the mortgage and restore the grange and live a quiet life together that is all i wish for said beatrice putting her arms round his neck i want peace after all this storm you will have darling said vivian kissing her but we will first go abroad so that your cure may be completed jerry and dinah will be married on the same day as ourselves not by mr snow said beatrice shuddering i have no grudge against him but his wife she cannot harm you dear now the police gave mrs snow a pretty talking to for withholding the evidence she could have given she is a very subdued woman now and i think is glad to bury herself in wales as the wife of that rural dean mr snow he will be master in his own house at last for he knows so much about her that she will not dare to contradict him and durban here he comes durban come here the halfcaste his face shining with joy rolled towards them as stout as ever in spite of his grief at the expression on the face of his young mistress he stopped short she knows he asked vivian timorously everything said beatrice before vivian could speak and i thank god durban for having given me such a friend missy i loved your father he dropped on his knees beside the couch and took her hand and you do not blame me for having kept you in ignorance no the situation was a difficult one you and mr paslow here were both surrounded by rogues and many dangers and all your concealments and reluctant confessions were made to save me anxiety so i thank you my dear friend for your kindness i knew you were a good man even when you accused yourself to save vivian i could not let him be hanged when you loved him said durban hanging his head you see beatrice said vivian smiling it is only of you that durban thinks i am nowhere when you marry miss beatrice said durban rising with a grave smile you will be one with her and ill love you both equally i know you will be happy missy after much storm has come the sunshine and that said vivian gaily will endure for the rest of our lives beatrice took the old servants hand there is only one thing to settle she said sweetly durban is to give me to you at the altar oh missymenonoa blacka half black you are a whole white said vivian quickly and taking the good old fellows other hand beatrice is right you have stood to her in the place of her father and mother and you have shielded her from a thousand dangers you shall come to the wedding and give your treasure to me sirmissy durban could say nothing more his eyes filled with tears and he hastily retreated joyful tears good old soul said vivian again gathering beatrice to his breast hell come and live with us beatrice and well turn that horrible camp into a jungle never more will we talk of the past andand vivian vivian how you run on i am too happy to be sensible what are those birds we hear singing saying my sweetest praise god from whom all blessings flow was the unexpected answer of beatrice vivians face grew grave i think we will and now he said and with his future wife in his arms he breathed a prayer of thankfulness to the merciful father who had brought them both to a safe haven the end printed by neill and co ltd edinburgh
