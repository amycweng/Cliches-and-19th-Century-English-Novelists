contents part i on board the vancouver part ii san francisco and northward part iii a golden link part iv love and hate part v at the black caon the mate of the vancouver part i on board the vancouver i am going to write not the history of my life which on the whole has been as quiet as most men's but simply the story of about a year of it which i think will be almost as interesting to other folks as any yarn spun by a professional novel writer and if i am wrong it is because i haven't the knowledge such have of the way to tell a story as a friend of mine who is an artist says i know i can't put in the foreground properly but if i tell the simple facts in my own way it will be true and anything that is really true always seems to me to have a value of its own quite independent of what the papers call style which a sailor who has never written much besides a log and a few love letters cannot pretend to have that is what i think our family for somehow it seems as if i must begin at the beginning was always given to the sea there is a story that my great grandfather was a pirate or buccaneer my grandfather i know was in the royal navy and my father commanded a china clipper when they used to make for those days such fast runs home with the new season's tea of course with these examples before us my brother and i took the same line and were apprenticed as soon as our mother could make up her mind to part with her sons will was six years older than i and he was second mate in the vessel in which i served my apprenticeship but though we were brothers there wasn't much likeness either of body or mind between us for will had a failing that never troubled me and never will he was always fond of his glass a thing i despise in a seaman and especially in an officer who has so many lives to answer for in when i had been out of my apprenticeship for rather more than four years and had got to be mate by a deal of hard work for to tell the truth i liked practical seamanship then much better than navigation and logarithms i was with my brother in the vancouver a bark of tons register if it hadn't been for my mother i wouldn't have sailed with will but she was always afraid he would get into trouble through drink for when he was at home and heard he was appointed to the command of this new vessel he was carried to bed a great deal the worse for liquor so when he offered me the chief officer's billet mother persuaded me to take it you must tom she said for my sake do you can look after him and perhaps shield him if anything happens for i am in fear all the time when he is away but if you were with him i should be more at ease for you are so steady tom i wasn't so steady as she thought i dare say but still i didn't drink and that was something anyhow that's the reason why i went with will and it was through him and his drinking ways that all the trouble began that made my life a terror to me and yet brought all the sweetness into it that a man can have and more than many have a right to look for when we left liverpool we were bound for melbourne with a mixed cargo and emigrants and i shouldn't like to say which was the most mixed what we had in the hold or in the steerage for i don't like such a human cargo no sailor does for they are always in the way however that's neither here nor there for though will got too much to drink every two days or so on the passage out nothing happened then that has any concern with the story it was only when we got to sandridge that the yarn begins and it began in a way that rather took me aback for though i had always thought will a man who didn't care much for women or at any rate enough to marry one our anchor hadn't been down an hour before a lady came off in a boat it was will's wife as he explained to me in a rather shamefaced way when he introduced her and a fine looking woman she was of a beautiful complexion with more red in it than most australians have two piercing black eyes and a figure that would have surprised you it was so straight and full she shook hands with me very firmly and looked at me in such a way that it seemed she saw right through me i am very pleased to see you mr ticehurst she said i know we shall be friends you are so like your brother now somehow that didn't please me for i could throw will over the spanker boom if i wanted to i was much the bigger man of the two and as for strength there was no comparison between us besides however that doesn't matter and i answered her heartily enough for i confess i liked her looks though i prefer fair women i am sure we shall said i my brother's wife must be if i can fix it so and with that i went off and left them alone for i thought i might not be wanted there and i knew very well i was wanted elsewhere for tom mackenzie the second officer was making signs for me to come on deck after that i saw her a good deal for we were often together especially when she came down once or twice and found will the worse for liquor the first time she was in a regular fury about it and though she didn't say much she looked like a woman who could do anything desperate or even worse than that but the next time she took it more coolly well tom she said he was to take me to the theater but now he can't go what am i to do i don't know said i foolishly enough as it seemed but then i didn't want to take the hint which i understood well enough hum she said sharply looking at me straight i believe i blushed a little at being bowled out for i was i knew that however when she had made up her mind she was not a woman to be baulked then i know tom if you don't she said you must take me yourself i have the tickets so get ready but helen i said for i really didn't like to go off with her in that way without will's knowing her eyes sparkled and she stamped her foot i insist on it so get ready or i'll go by myself and how would will like that there was no good resisting her she was too sharp for me and i went like a lamb doing just as she ordered me for she was a masterful woman and accustomed to have her own way if i did wrong i was punished for it afterward for this was the beginning of a kind of flirtation which i swear was always innocent enough on my side and would have been on hers too if will had not been a coward with the drink in melbourne we got orders for san francisco and it was only a few days before we were ready to sail that i found out helen was going with us i was surprised enough any way for i knew the owners objected to their captains having their wives on board but i was more surprised that she was ready to come i hope you will believe that for it is as true as daylight i thought at first it was all will's doing and he let me think so for he didn't like me to know how much she ruled him when he was sober however she came on board to stay just twenty four hours before we sailed the very day will went up to melbourne to ship two men in place of two of ours who had run from the vessel next morning when we were lying in the bay for we had hauled out from the wharf at sandridge a boat ran alongside just at six o'clock and the two men came on board who are you and where are you from i asked roughly for i didn't like the look of one of them these are the two hands that captain ticehurst shipped yesterday from a williamstown boarding house said the runner who was with them i always like to ship men from the sailor's home but i couldn't help myself if will chose to take what he could get out of a den of thieves such as i knew his place to be very well said i gruffly enough look alive get your dunnage forward and turn to one of them was a hard looking little cockney who seemed a sailor every inch though there weren't many of them but the other was a dark lithe man with an evil face who looked like some oriental half caste here said i to the cockney what's your name bill walker sir he answered who's the man with you what is he i asked dunno sir said walker looking forward at the figure of his shipmate who was just disappearing in the fo'c'sle i reckon he's some kind of a dago that's what he is some kind of a dago now a dago in sailor's language means as a rule a frenchman spaniard or greek or anyone from southern europe just as a dutchman means anyone from a fin down to a real hollander so i wasn't much wiser however in a day or two bill walker came up to me and told me in a confidential london twang that he now believed matthias as he called himself was a half caste malay as i had thought at first but i was to know him better afterward as will be seen before i finish now it is a strange thing and it shows how hard it is for a man not accustomed to writing like myself to tell a story in the proper way that i have not said anything of the passengers who were going with us to san francisco i could understand it if i had been writing this down just at the time these things happened but when i think that i have put the malay before elsie fleming even if he came into my life first i am almost ready to laugh at my own stupidity for elsie was the brightest bonniest girl i ever saw and even now i find it hard not to let the cat out of the bag before the hour as a matter of fact this being the third time i have written all this over i had to cut out pages about elsie which did not come in their proper place so now i shall say no more than that elsie and her sister fanny and their father took passage with us to california as we were the only sailing vessel going that way and old fleming who had been a sailor himself fairly hated steamboats aye a good deal worse than i do for i think them a curse to sailors but when they came on board i was busy as a mate is when ready to go to sea and though i believe i must have been blind yet i hardly took any notice of the two sisters more than to remark that one had hair like gold and a laugh which was as sweet as a fair wind up channel but i came to know her better since though in a way different from the malay when we had got our anchor on board and were fairly out to sea heading for bass's straits i saw her and helen talking together and i think it was the contrast between the two that first attracted me toward her not much liking dark women being dark myself she seemed compared with will's wife as fair as an angel from heaven though the glint of her eyes and her quick bright ways showed she was a woman all over i took a fancy to her that moment and i believe helen saw it when i think over what has happened since for she frowned and bit her lip hard until i could see a mark there but i didn't know then what i do now and besides i had no time to think about such things just then for we were hard at it getting things shipshape tom mackenzie the second officer and a much older man than myself for he had been to sea for seventeen years before he took it into his head to try for his second mate's ticket came up to me when the men were mustered aft mr ticehurst said he gruffly i should be glad if you'd take that malay chap in your watch for i have two d d dagos already who are always quarreling and if i have three there will be bloodshed for sure i don't like his looks no more do i i answered but i don't care for his looks i've tamed worse looking men and if you ask it mackenzie why i'll have him and you can take the cockney i think this was very good of me for bill walker i could see was a real smart hand and a merry fellow not one of those grumblers who always make trouble for'ard and come aft at the head of a deputation once a week growling about the victuals but mackenzie was a good sort and though he was under me i knew that for practical seamanship though i won't take a back seat among any men of my years at sea he was ahead of all of us so i was ready to do him a good turn and it was true enough he had two greeks in his watch already when we had been to sea about a week and got into the regular routine of work which comes round just as it does in a house for it is never done will got into his routine too and was drunk every day just as regular as eight bells at noon helen came to me of course tom can't you do something she said with tears in her eyes the first time i ever saw them there though not the last it is horrible to think of his drinking this way and then before those two girls i am ashamed of myself and of him can't you do anything what can i do helen i asked i can't take it from him i can't stave the liquor there's too much of it besides he is captain if he is my brother and i can't go against him but can't you try and persuade him tom and she caught my arm and looked at me so sorrowfully haven't i done it helen i answered do you think i have seen him going to hell these two years without speaking but what good is it what good is it she turned away and sat down by elsie and fanny while just underneath in the saloon will was singing some old song about pass the bottle round he did too and it comes round quick at a party of one i can see easily that if i tell everything in this way i shall never finish my task until i have a pile of manuscript as big as the log of a three years' voyage so i shall have to get on quickly and just say what is necessary and no more and now i must say that by this time i was in love with elsie fleming in love as much as a man can be in love with a passion that trial only strengthened and time could not and cannot destroy it was no wonder i loved her for she was the fairest sweetest maid i ever saw with long golden hair bright blue eyes that looked straight at one but which could be very soft too sometimes and a neat little figure that made me feel great strong brute that i was as clumsy as an ox though i was as quick yet to go aloft as any young man if occasion called for the mate to show his men the way and when we were a little more than half across the pacific to the golden gate i began to think that elsie liked me more than she did anyone else for she would often talk to me about her past life in sunny new south wales and shiver to think that her father might insist on staying a long time in british columbia for he was going to take possession of a farm left him by an old uncle near a place called thomson forks it was sweet to have her near me in the first watch and i cursed quietly to myself when young jack harmer the apprentice struck four bells for at ten o'clock she always said good night mr ticehurst i must go now how sleepy one does get at sea dear me how can you keep your eyes open and when she went down it seemed as if the moon and stars went out when it was old mackenzie's first watch i was almost fool enough to be jealous of her being with him then though he had a wife at home and a daughter just as old as elsie and he thought no more of women as a rule than a hog does of harmony as i once heard an american say still when i lay awake and heard her step overhead for i knew it well i was almost ready to get up then and there and make an unutterable fool of myself by losing my natural sleep and now i am coming to what i would willingly leave out i hope that people won't think badly of me for my share in it for though i was not always such a straight walker in life as some are yet i would not do what evil minded folks might think i did somehow i have a difficulty in putting it down for though i have spoken of it sometimes sorrowfully enough to one who is very dear to me yet to write it coolly on paper seems cowardly and treacherous and yet seeing that i can harm no one and knowing as i do in my heart that i wasn't to blame i must do it and do it as kindly as i can this is what i mean i began to see that helen loved me more than she should have done and that she hated will bitterly but elsie even worse it was a great surprise to me for to tell the truth women as a general rule have never taken to me very much and will was always the one in our family who had most to do with them and for my part until i saw elsie i never really loved anyone although like most men i have had a few troubles which until then i thought love affairs so it was very hard to convince myself that what i suspected was true even though i believe that i have a natural fitness for judging people and seeing through them even women who some folks say do not act from reason like men however i don't think they are much different for few of us act reasonably but all this has nothing to do with the matter in hand now i must confess although it seems wicked that i was a little pleased at first to think that two women loved me for we are all vain and that certainly touches a man's vanity and yet i was sorry too for i foresaw trouble unless i was very careful though not all the woe and pain which came out of this business before the end the first thing that made me suspect something was wrong was that helen almost ceased to keep will from the bottle and she taunted him bitterly so bitterly that if he had not usually been a good tempered fellow even when drunk he might have turned nasty and struck her and then she would never leave me and elsie alone if she could help it although she was not hypocrite enough to pretend to be very fond of her indeed elsie said one night to me that she was afraid mrs ticehurst didn't like her i laughed but i saw it was true then whenever she could helen came and walked with me and she hardly ever spoke it seems to me now when i know all that she was in a perpetual conflict and was hardly in her right mind i should like to think that she was not i was in a very difficult position as any man will admit i loved elsie dearly i was convinced my brother's wife loved me and we were all four shut up on ship board i think if we had been on land i should have spoken to elsie and run away from the others but here i could not speak without telling her more than i desired or without our being in the position of lovers which might have caused trouble for i even thought so suspicious does a man get that helen might perhaps have come on board more on my account than on will's all this time we were making very fair headway for we had a good breeze astern of us and the islands as they call them in san francisco that is the sandwich islands were a long way behind us if we had continued to have fine weather or if will had kept sober or even so drunk that he could not have interfered in working the ship things might not have taken the turn they did and what happened between me and the malay who called himself matthias might never have occurred and when i look back on the train of circumstances it almost makes me believe in fate though i should be unwilling to do that for i was taught by my mother a very intelligent woman who read a great deal of theology that men have free will and can do as they please however when we were nearing the western coast of america will who had a great notion a much greater one than i had by the way of his navigation began to come up every day and take his observations with me until at last the weather altered so for the worse and it came on to blow so hard that neither of us could take any more now if will drank enough heaven knows in fine weather he drank a deal harder in foul though by getting excited it didn't have the usual effect on him and he kept about without going to sleep just where he sat or lay down so he was always on deck much to my annoyance for i could see the men laughing as he clung to the rail at the break of the poop bowing and scraping like an intoxicated dancing master with every roll the vancouver made for five days we had been running by dead reckoning and as well as i could make out we were heading straight for the coast a good bit to the nor'ard of our true course besides we were a good fifty miles farther east than will made out according to his figures and i said as much to him he laughed scornfully i'm captain of this ship said he and tom don't you interfere if i've a mind to knock mendocino county into the middle of next week i'll do it but i haven't and we are running just right you see when he was in this state he was a very hard man to work with and if we differed in our figures i had often enough a big job to convince him that he was wrong and being wrong even a second in the longitude means being sixty miles out and with only dead reckoning to rely on we should have been feeling our way cautiously toward the coast seeing that in any case we might fetch up on the farallon islands which lie twenty miles west of the golden gate on the sixth day of this weather it began to clear up a little in the morning watch and there seemed some possibility of our getting sight of the sun before eight bells will was on deck and rather more sober than usual well sir said i to him for i was just as respectful i'll swear as if he was no relation there seems a chance of getting an observation shall we take it very well said he send harmer here and we'll wait for a chance harmer came aft and brought up will's sextant and just then the port foretopsail sheet parted for it was really blowing hard though the sun came out at intervals i ran forward myself and by the time the watch had clewed up the sail and made it fast eight bells had struck when i went aft i met harmer did you get an observation i asked anxiously for when a man has the woman he loves on board it makes him feel worried especially if things go as they were going then yes mr ticehurst said he and the captain is working it out now but sir if i were you i would go over it after him for two heads are better than one and he laughed being a merry thoughtless youngster and went into his berth however i did not do what he said thinking that we should both get an observation at noon we were very lucky to do so for it began to thicken again at ten o'clock and we were in a heavy fog until nearly twelve and as soon as eight bells was struck the fog which had lifted came down again when i got below will already had the chart out and was showing the women where we were as he said and when i came in he called me there look mr chief officer what did i tell you look and he pricked off our position as being just about where he had reckoned i took up the slate he had been making the calculation on but he saw me and snatched it out of my hand what d'ye mean said he fiercely what do you want and he threw it on the deck smashing it in four pieces i made a sign to elsie and she picked them up like lightning while will called for the steward and some more brandy and began drinking in a worse temper than i had ever seen him in when i passed elsie she gave me the broken bits of slate and i went into my cabin pieced them together and worked the whole thing out again and when i had done it the blood ran to my head and i almost fell for the morning observation which will only had taken was wrongly worked out i ran out on deck like lightning and found it a thick fog all round us for all the wind old mackenzie was in the poop and he roared out when he saw me what's the matter tom ticehurst put the ship up into the wind for god's sake i shouted and send a hand up aloft to look out for the coast should be right under our bows we must be in ballinas bay and as he ported the helm i rushed back into the cabin and took the chart out again to verify our position as near as i could the coast ought to be in sight if the fog cleared for we had run through or past the farallones without seeing them when i came down the women all cried out at the sight of me for though i controlled myself all i could it was impossible so sudden was the shock to hide all i felt and just then the vancouver was coming into the wind the men were at the lee braces and as she dived suddenly into the head seas her pitches were tremendous it seemed to the women that something must be wrong while will who seaman like knew what had happened though mad with drink rushed on deck with a fierce oath i dropped the chart and ran after him yet i stayed a moment it will be all right i said to the women but i can't tell you now and i followed will who had got hold of old mackenzie by the throat while the poor fellow looked thunderstruck what the devil are you doing he screamed why don't you keep the course man the weather braces you dogs and put the helm up but no one stirred while tom mackenzie seeing me there took will by the wrists and threw him away from him i caught him as he fell roaring mutiny mutiny it's no mutiny i shouted in my turn if we keep your course we shall be on the rocks in half an hour i tell you the land is dead to loo ard aye and not five miles off but it was less than that for just then it cleared up a little and the lookout on the foreyard shouted land on the lee bow then he cried out land right ahead whether will heard him or not i don't know but he broke away from me and fell rather than went down the companion and in a moment i heard the women scream i caught mackenzie by the arm it's for our lives and the lives of the women he's gone for his revolver i shall take command and i sprang behind the companion like lightning and just in time for as will came up i saw he was armed and i jumped right on his back his revolver went off and struck the taffrail the next moment i had kicked it forward to where mackenzie was standing and grasped will by the arms i had never given him credit for the strength he showed but then he was mad mad drunk and it was not till walker and matthias for all hands were on deck by this time came to help me that i secured him in the struggle will drew back his foot and kicked the malay in the face and as he rose with the evilest look i ever saw on a man's countenance he drew his knife instinctively with my left hand i caught his wrist and nearly broke it while the knife flew out of his hand and then even by that simple action i saw that i had made an enemy of this man whom up to this time i had always been kind to and treated with far more consideration than he would have got from rough old mac but this is only by the way though it is important enough to the story i had to tie will's hands and all the time he foamed at the mouth ordering the crew to assist him i'll have you hung you dogs all of you he shrieked while the three women stood on the companion ladder white and trembling with fear it was with great trouble that we got him below and when he was there i shut him in his berth and sent the two stewards in with him to see that he neither did himself harm nor got free and then i turned my attention to saving the ship and our lives we were in an awfully critical situation and one which in ordinary circumstances might have made a man's heart quail but now with the woman i loved on board it was maddening to think of and made me curse my brother who had brought us into it think of what it was not five miles on our lee bow there was the land and we could even distinguish as we lifted on the sea the cruel line of white breakers which seemed to run nearly abeam for the vancouver was not a very weatherly ship and the gale instead of breaking increased until if i had dared i would have ordered sail to be shortened i went to the chart again just as i took it mackenzie called to me mr ticehurst there's a big flat topped mountain some way inland i think it must be table mountain yes he knew the coast and even as i looked at the chart i heard him order the helm to be put up i saw why for when we had hauled into the wind we were heading dead for the great four fathom bank that lies off bonita point but there was a channel between it and the land i ran on deck and spoke to mackenzie he pointed out on the starboard hand and there the water was breaking on the bank we were running for the narrow channel under a considerable press of canvas seeing how it blew for all mac relieved her of when we first put her into the wind was the main top gallant sail and now i could do nothing for a moment but try to get sight of our landmarks and keep sight of them for the weather was still thick fortunately as it might have seemed for us the chain cables had already been ranged fore and aft on the deck and i told mackenzie to see them bent on to the anchors and the stoppers made ready yet i knew that if we had to anchor we were lost in such a gale it could only postpone our fate for they would come home or part to a dead certainty mackenzie and i stood together on the poop watching anxiously for the right moment to haul our wind again what do you think of it mr mackenzie i said as i clung on to a weather backstay where do you think we shall be in half an hour i don't think i shall ever see whitechapel again sir he answered quietly and i knew he was thinking of home of his wife and his daughter she will go to leeward like a butter cask in this sea and now look at the land and he pointed toward the line of breakers on the land which came nearer and nearer we waited yet a few minutes and then i looked at mackenzie inquiringly yes i think so sir he said and with my hand i motioned the men at the wheel to put the helm down again as she came into the wind the upper foretopsail blew out of the boltropes while the vessel struggled like a beaten hound that is being dragged to execution and shivered from stem to stern for the waves were running what landsmen call mountains high she now shipped a sea every moment which came in a flood over the fo'c'sle head and pouring down through the scuttle the cover of which had been washed overboard it sent the men's chests adrift in the fo'c'sle and washed the blankets out of the lower bunks and to windward the roar of the breakers on the bank was deafening i went below just for a moment i knew i had no right to go there my place was on deck but could not help myself i must see elsie once more before we died for if the vessel struck the first sea that washed over her might take me with it and we should never see each other again on earth but the two sisters were not in the saloon i stepped toward their berth and helen met me rising up from the deck where she had been crouching down in terror i have said she was beautiful and so she was when she smiled and the pleasant light fell about her like sunlight on some strange and rare tropical flower showing her rosy complexion her delicate skin of full blooded olive and her coils of dark and shining hair but i never saw her so beautiful as she was then clothed strangely with the fear of death white with passion that might have made a weaker woman crimson with shame and fiercely triumphant with a bitter self conquest she caught me by the arm tom dear tom she said in a wonderful voice that came to me clearly through the howl of the wind i know there is not hope for us he and she pointed toward her husband's cabin has ruined us i hate him and tom now it is all over and we shall not live say good by to me say good by i stood thunderstruck and motionless for i knew what she meant even before she put up her hands and took me round the neck kiss me once just once and i will die for now i could not live and would not kiss me and i did kiss her why i know not whether out of pity it was not love no not love of any kind i swear or from the strong constraint of her force of mind i cannot say and as i lifted my head from hers i saw elsie the woman i did love looking at me with shame at my fall as she thought and with scorn i freed myself from helen who sank down on her knees without seeing that she had been observed and i went toward elsie she too was pale though not with fear for perhaps she was ignorant of her danger but as i thought with a little feeling of triumph even then for we are strange beings with jealousy and anger you are a coward and a traitor she said when i reached her no no i am not elsie i answered sharply but perhaps you will never know that i am speaking the truth but let that be are you a brave woman for but where is your father with fanny she answered disdainfully even then i called him and he came out mr fleming i said you know our position in a few minutes we shall be safe or ashore get your daughters dressed warmly stay at the foot of the companion with them and if it is necessary come up when i call you the old man shook hands with me and pointed to will's wife i had forgotten her look after her too i said and went to will's cabin he was fast asleep and snoring hard i could hardly keep from striking him but i let him lie was it a wonder that a woman ceased to love him and i went on deck i had not been absent five minutes but in that time the wind had increased even more the seas seemed to have grown heavier the decks were full of water and the fatal wake was yet broader on the weather quarter all the men were aft under the break of the poop and most of them thinking that we must go ashore had taken off their oilskins and sea boots ready for an effort to save themselves at the last even in the state of mind that i was in then i saw clearly and the strange picture they presented wet through some with no hats on up to their knees in water for the decks could not clear themselves though some of the main deck ports were stove in and some out in the bulwarks remains vividly with me now among them stood matthias with a red handkerchief over his head and a swelled cheek where will had struck him by his side was walker the only man in the crowd who seemed cheerful and he actually smiled perhaps he was what the scotch called fey suddenly mackenzie called me loudly look sir look there is the point the last of the land it's bonita point if i know this coast at all i sprang into the weather mizzen rigging and the men who had noticed the second mate's gestures did the same at the main i could see the point and knew it and i knew if we could only weather it we could put the helm up and run into san francisco in safety just then harmer who was as cool as a cucumber struck four bells and matthias and a man called thompson an old one eyed sailor came up to relieve the wheel the point which we had to weather was about as far from us as the land dead to leeward and it was touch and go whether we should clear it or not the vancouver made such leeway closehauled that it seemed doubtful and i fancied we should have a better chance if i freed her a little to let her go through the water faster yet it was a ticklish point and one not to be decided without thought in a situation which demanded instant action what think you mac said i hurriedly shall we ease her half a point he nodded and i spoke to the men at the wheel and as i did so i noticed the malay's face which was ghastly with fear although he seemed steady enough but i thought it best to alter the way they stood for the englishman had the lee wheel i ordered them to change places what's that for sir said matthias almost disrespectfully i stared at him do as you are told you dog i answered roughly for i had no time to be polite i don't like your steering i have noticed it before when the course was altered she got much more way on her but neared the land yet more rapidly i called the men on to the poop for i had long before this determined not to chance the anchors and looked down into the saloon to see if the women were there as i did so mr fleming called me if i can be of any use mr ticehurst i am ready i think not mr fleming i replied as cheerfully as possible we shall be out of danger in a few minutes or on the rocks i added to myself as i closed the hatch it was a breathless and awful time and i confess that for a few moments i forgot the very existence of elsie as i calculated over and over again the chances as we neared the point it depended on a hair and when i looked at mackenzie who was silent and gloomy i feared the worst yet it shows how strangely one can be affected by one's fellows that when i saw harmer and walker standing side by side their almost cheerful faces made me hope and i smiled but we were within three cables' length of the point and the roar of the breakers came up against the wind until it deafened us i watched the men at the wheel and i saw matthias flinch visibly as though he had been struck by a whip i didn't know why it was i am not good at such things but i took a deeper dislike to him that moment than i had ever had and i stepped up to him now in what followed perhaps i myself was to blame and yet i feel i could not have acted differently perhaps i looked threatening at him as i approached but at any rate he let go the wheel and fell back on the gratings with an angry oath i jumped into his place struck him with my heel and then i saw walker make a tremendous spring for me with an expression of alarm in his face as he looked beyond me that made me make a half turn and that movement saved my life i felt the knife of matthias enter my shoulder like a red hot iron and then it was wrenched out of his hand and out of the wound by walker in a moment the two were locked together and in another they were separated by mackenzie and the others and walker stood smiling with the knife in his hand although the blood was running down my body i did not feel faint and kept my eye fixed on the course kept by the vancouver while mackenzie held me in his arms and harmer took the lee wheel from me luff a little i cried for we were almost on the point and i saw a rock nearly dead ahead luff a little and they put the helm down on a spoke or two the moments crawled by and the coast crawled nearer and nearer as i began to feel i was going blind and fainting but i clung to life and vision desperately and the last i saw was what i can see now and shall always see as plainly the high black point with its ring of white water crawl aft and yet nearer aft to the foremast aft to the mainmast and then i fell and knew no more for we were saved when i came to we were before the wind and i lay on a mattress in the cabin near me was elsie and by her helen who was as white as death both were watching me and when i opened my eyes helen fell on her knees and suddenly went crimson and then white again and fainted but elsie looked harder and sterner than i had ever seen her i turned my face away and near me i saw another mattress with a covered figure on it the figure of a dead man for i knew the shape in my state of faintness a strange and horrible delirium took possession of me it seemed as if what i saw was seen only by myself and that it was a prophecy of my death i fainted again when i came to we were at anchor in san francisco bay and a doctor from the shore was attending to me while mackenzie stood by smiling and rubbing his hands as if delighted to get me off them i looked at him and he knelt down by me mackenzie old man i whispered didn't i see somebody dead here aye poor chap he answered brushing away a tear it was poor walker walker i said how was that accident sir said old mac just as we rounded the point and you fainted the old bark gave a heavy roll as we put her before the wind and walker as he was standing with that black dog's knife in his hand slipped and fell the blade entered his body and all he said after was 'it was his knife after all he threatened to do for me yesterday' where's will i asked when he ended for i was somehow anxious to save my brother's credit and i shouldn't have liked to see him dismissed from the ship he's on deck now as busy as the devil in a gale of wind growled mackenzie 'tis he that saved the ship oh he's a mighty man but i don't sail with him no more however he altered his mind about that now it has taken me a long time to get to this point and perhaps if i had been a better navigator in the waters of story telling i might have done just what will didn't do and have missed all the trouble of beating to windward to get round to this part of my story i might have put it all in a few words perhaps but then i like people to understand what i am about and it seems to me necessary if it isn't i dare say someone will tell me one of these days at any rate here i have got into san francisco a city i don't like by the way for it is a rascally place managed by the professional politicians who are the worst men in it i had been badly wounded and the malay was in prison and not having money he was likely to stay there i was in the hospital for three weeks and i never had a more miserable or lonely time if i had not been stronger in constitution than most men i think i should have died so much was i worried by my love for elsie who was going away thinking me a scoundrel who had tried to gain the love of my brother's wife of course she did not come near me though i knew the flemings were still in the city i learnt so much from will who had the grace to come and see me thanking me too for having saved the vancouver you must get well soon tom said he for i need you very much just now i kept silence and he looked at me inquiringly will i said at length i shall never i sail with you again i can't do it why not he cried in a loud voice which made the nurse come up and request him to speak in a little lower tone why not i can't see what difference it will make anything that has occurred no he did not see but then he did not know how could i go in the ship again with helen besides i had determined to win elsie for my wife and how could i do that if i let her go now thinking what she did of me well will i can't go said i once more and i don't think i shall go to sea again i am sick of it will stared and whistled and laughed ho said he i think i see how the land lies you are going to settle in british columbia eh you are a sly dog but i can see through you i know your little love affair helen told me as much as that one day well then will i answered wearily for i was out of heart lying there if you know you can understand now why i am not going to sail with you but will and i rose on my elbow hurting myself considerably as i did so let me implore you not to drink in future have done with it it will be your ruin and your wife's aye and if i sailed with you mine as well give me your hand and say you will be a sober man for the future and then i shall be content to go where i must go aye and where i will go he gave me his hand that was hot with what he had been drinking even then it was eleven in the morning and i saw tears in his eyes i will try tom he muttered but i think that but was the saddest word and the most prophetic i ever heard on any man's lips i saw how vain it was and turned away he shook hands and went without saying more than good by tom i saw him twice after that and just twice by the time i was out of the hospital the vancouver was ready to go to sea being bound to england and she might have sailed even then only it was necessary for tom mackenzie and one or two others to remain as witnesses when they tried matthias for stabbing me i shall not go into a long description of the trial for i have read in books of late so many trial scenes that i fear i should not have the patience to give details which after all are not necessary since the whole affair was so simple and yet what followed afterward from that affair i can remember as brightly and distinctly as if in a glass the look of the dingy court the fierce and revengeful eyes of matthias who never spoke till the last and the appearance of helen and fanny elsie was not there when the judge after the verdict inflicted a sentence of eighteen months' hard labor on the prisoner perhaps he had been in prison before and knew what it meant or it was simply the bitter thought of a revengeful oriental at being worsted by his opponent but when he heard the sentence he leant forward and grasped the rail in front of him tightly and spoke his skin was dark and yet pallid the perspiration stood in beads on his forehead he bit his lips until blood came while his eyes looked more like the eyes of a human beast than those of a man this is what he said as he looked at me and he spoke with a strange intensity which hushed all noise when i come out of jail i will track you night and day wherever you go or whatever you do to escape me though you think i do not know where you are i shall always be seeking for you and at last i shall find you if a curse of mine could touch you you should rot and wither now but the time will come when my hand shall strike you down such was the meaning of what he said although it was not put exactly as i have here written it down and if i confess as i should have to do at last before the end of this story comes that the words and the way they were spoken spoken so vehemently and with so fixed a resolution made me shiver and feel afraid in a way i had never done before i hope nobody will blame me but i am sure that being in love makes a coward of a man in many ways and in one moment i saw myself robbed of life and love just at their fruition i beheld myself clasping elsie to my bosom having won from her at last an avowal of her love and then stabbed or shot in her arms ah it was dreadful the number of fashions my mind went to work in a quick fever of black apprehension to foretell or foresee my own possible doom i had never thought myself cowardly but then i seemed to see what death meant better than i had ever done and often the coward is what he is as i think now from a vivid imagination which so many of us lack i went out of the court in a strange whirl for you see i had only just recovered if i had been quite well i might have laughed instead of feeling as i did but i did not laugh then now on the next morning the vancouver was to leave the harbor being then at anchor off goat island all the money that was due to me i had taken for will had given me my discharge and i sent home for what i had saved being quite uncertain what i should do if i followed elsie to british columbia and that night i saw the last of will the last i ever saw little thinking then how his fate and mine were bound up together nor what it was to be helen was with him and i think if he had been sober or even gentle with her in his drink she would have never spoken to me again as she did on that day when she believed that life was nearly at its end for both of us but will having finished all his business had begun to drink again and was in a vile temper as we sat in a room at the american exchange hotel where i was staying helen tried to prevent his drinking will she said in rather a hard voice from the constraint she put on herself you have had enough of drink we had better go on board go on board yourself said he and don't jaw me i wish i had left you in australia a woman on board a ship is like a piano in the fo'c'sle come and have a drink tom no thank you i said i have had quite enough and out he went standing drinks at the bar to half a dozen some of whom would have cut his throat for a dollar i dare say by the looks of them then helen came over and sat down by me i have never spoken to you tom she began and then she stopped since you know since that dreadful day outside there and she pointed just like a woman who never knows the bearings of a place until she has reckoned out how the house points first to the east when she meant the west and now i feel i must because i may never have the chance again she took out her handkerchief although she was dry eyed and twisted it into a regular ground swell knot until i saw the stuff give way here and there she seemed unable to go on and perhaps she would not have said more if we hadn't heard will's voice thick with drink as he demanded more liquor hear him she said hurriedly hear the man who is my husband what a fool i was you don't know but i was and i am his wife ah i could kill him i could i could i was horrified to see the passion she was in it seemed to have a touch of real male fury in it just as when a man is trying to control himself feeling that if one more provocation is given him he will commit murder for she shook and shivered and her voice was strangely altered and just then will came back demanding with an oath if she was ready to go she never spoke but i should have been sorry to have any woman look at me as she did at him when his eyes were off her i shook hands with her and with him for the last time and they went away next morning being lonely and having nothing to do i went out to the park made on the great sand dunes which runs from the higher city to the ocean beach and the cliff house on the south side of the golden gate for the sake of a quiet think i went out by the cars and walked to a place where few ever came but chance visitors except on sunday it is just at the bend of the great drive and a little above the road where there is a large tank with a wooden top which makes a good seat from which one can see back to san francisco and across the bay to oakland saucelito and the other little watering places in the bay or before one toward the opening of the golden gate and the guns of alcatraz island where the military prison is here i took my seat and looked out on the quiet beautiful bay and the sea just breaking in a line of foam on the beach beneath me the sight of the ships at anchor was rather melancholy to me for my life had been on the sea it seemed as if a new and unknown life were before me and a sailor starting anything ashore is as strange as though some inveterate dweller in a city should go to sea there were one or two white sails outside the heads and one vessel was being towed in there was a broad wake from the saucelito ferry boat and far out to sea i saw the low farallones lying like a cloud on the horizon it was beyond them that my new life had begun really begun and though the day was fair i knew not how soon foul weather might overtake me and i knew indeed that it could only be postponed unless fate were very kind i don't know how long i sat on that tank drumming on the hollow wood as i idly picked up the pebbles from the ground and threw them down into the road but at last i saw what i had partly been waiting for the vancouver being towed out to sea i had no need to look at her twice i knew every rope in her and every patch of paint to say nothing of her masts being ranked a little more than is usual nowadays i had no glass with me but i fancied i could see a patch of color on her poop that was helen i watched the vessel which had been my home and which but for me would have been lying a wreck over yonder for more than an hour and then i turned to go home if i can call an american hotel home by strained politeness and just then i saw a carriage come along now i knew as well before i could distinguish them that elsie fanny and her father were in that carriage as i did that helen was on board the vancouver and i sat down again feeling very faint i suppose from the effects of my wound or the illness that came from it the carriage had almost passed beneath me and i felt elsie saw me though she made no sign before mr fleming caught sight of me hi stop he called and the driver drew up why mr ticehurst is that you i thought the vancouver had gone besides how does a mate find time to be out here things must have changed since i was at sea come down come down i did so and shook hands with them all though elsie's hand lay in mine like a dead thing until she drew it away the vancouver has gone mr fleming said i and there she is look they all turned and elsie kept her eyes fixed on it when the others looked at me again well said fleming what does it all mean where are you going back to town that's right get in and without more ado the old man who had the grip of a vise caught hold of me and in i came like a bale of cotton drive on now then he went on you can tell us why you didn't go with them i paused a minute watching elsie well mr fleming i said at last you see i didn't quite agree with my brother h'm calls taking the command from the captain not quite agreeing with him chuckled fleming but i thought you made it up didn't you yes we made it up but i wouldn't sail with him any more i had more than one reason again i looked at elsie and she was i thought a little pleasanter though she did not speak but fanny pinched her arm i could see that and looked roguishly at me however mr fleming did not notice that byplay well he said a trifle drily as i fancied i won't put you through your catechism except to ask you in a fatherly kind of way elsie looked down and frowned what you are going to do now i should have thought after what that rascal of a half bred malay or whatever he is said that you would have left california in a hurry time enough mr fleming time enough i have eighteen months to look out on without fear of a knife in my ribs and i may be in china or alaska or the rocky mountains then you see i wanted to give them a hint that i might turn up in british columbia fanny gave me a better chance though and i could have hugged her for it or british columbia perhaps mr ticehurst she said smiling very innocently who knows i answered hastily when a man begins to travel there is no knowing where he may turn up i had a fancy to go to alaska though for the way to alaska was the way to british columbia and i did not want to surprise them too much if i went on the same steamer as far as victoria and in four days i might see what chance i really had with elsie well said the father thoughtfully i don't know and can't give advice i should have thought that when a man was a good sailor and held your position he ought to stick to it a rolling stone gathers no moss yes i answered but i am tired of the sea so am i said fanny and i don't blame you though you ought to go with careless captains just on purpose to save people's lives you know mr ticehurst for you saved ours and i think some of us might thank you better than by sitting like a dry stick without saying a word with this she dug at elsie with her elbow smiling sweetly all the time yes said elsie and there is mr harmer now in the vancouver perhaps she will be wrecked this was the first word she had spoken since i had entered the carriage and i recognized by its spite that elsie was a woman not above having a little revenge for poor fanny who had flirted quite a little with harmer said no more they put down at their hotel and i went inside with them well said fleming i suppose we shan't see you again unless you do as fanny says and turn up in our new country if you do be sure we shall welcome you and i wish you well my boy i shook hands with them again and turned away and as i did so i noticed some of their boxes marked per ss mexico fanny saw me looking and whispered quickly as she passed me tom ticehurst go to mexico and vanished while elsie stood in the gaslight for a moment as if in indecision but she turned away part ii san francisco and northward i never felt so miserable and so inclined to go to sea to forget myself in hard work as i did that evening after i had bidden farewell to elsie and her people it seemed to me that she had let me go too easily out of her life for her to really care for me enough to make her influence my course in the way i had hoped and hoped still indeed i think that if she had not stayed that one undecided moment after she withdrew her hand from mine i should have never done what i did do but have looked for a ship at once for after all i said to myself what could a modest girl do more why under the circumstances when she thought me guilty of a deliberate crime hateful to any woman to say nothing of my having made love to her at the same time it was really more than i could have expected or hoped it showed that i had a hold upon her affections and then fanny thought so too or she would have never said what she did go to mexico indeed if i wasn't a fool it was not mexico the country but mexico the steamer she meant i had one ally at any rate still i wondered if she knew what elsie did though i thought not for she alone kissed helen when they said good by and elsie had only given her her hand unwillingly if i could speak to fanny it might help me but i was determined to go northward and sent my dunnage down on board the steamer that very evening in the morning and early for i lay awake all that night a thing i did not remember having done before i went down on the front at the bottom of market street where all the tram cars start and walked to and fro for some hours along the wharves where they discharge lumber or ship the coal it was quite a bright morning in the late autumn and everything was pleasant to look upon in the pure air before it was fouled by the oaths of the drivers of wagons and the jar of traffic yet that same noise which came dimly to me until i was almost run over by a loaded wagon pleased me a great deal better than the earlier quiet of the morning and by eight o'clock i was in a healthy frame of mind healthy enough to help three men with a heavy piece of lumber just by way of exercise i went back to my room washed my hands had breakfast and went on board the steamer careless if the flemings saw me though at first i had determined to keep out of their way until the vessel was at sea i thanked my stars that i did so for i saw fanny by herself on deck and when she caught sight of me she clapped her hands and smiled well and where are you going mr ticehurst said she nodding at me as if she guessed my secret i am going to take your advice and go to mexico i answered is it far here by land do you go or water not far fanny in fact you are there now said i laughing in my turn oh i am so glad mr ticehurst said she for and then she stopped for what fanny i asked i'm afraid i can't tell you i should be a traitor and that is cowardly no fanny not when we are friends if you tell me would you do any harm no she answered doubtfully then treachery is meant to do harm and if you don't mean harm it isn't treachery i replied coaxingly but with bad logic as i have been told since well then perhaps i'll say something now suppose you liked me very much so i do fanny i swear no you don't stupid how can you i'm not twins that is i and somebody else aren't the same so don't interrupt suppose you liked me very much and i liked you very much it would be very nice i dare say i said in a doubtful way that was neither diplomatic nor complimentary and suppose you went off and suppose i didn't speak to my sister for hours and kept on being a nasty thing by tossing and tumbling about all night so that she poor girl couldn't go to sleep and then suppose when she did go off nicely she woke up to find me what do you think crying what would it mean fanny i exclaimed in delight you are a dear girl the very dearest no she said no that i ever saw if there weren't so many folks about i would kiss you and i meant it but fanny burst into laughter the idea i should like to see you try it i would box your ears till they were as red as beetroot but there tom i am glad you are coming on this dirty steamer for i have no one to talk to now but elsie and she won't talk at all however fanny's little woes did not trouble me much for i was thinking of my own and wondering how i ought to act fanny said i tell me what i shall do shall i lie low and not show up until we are out at sea or what if you don't want them to see you you had better look sharp for they are coming up now i see elsie's hat said fanny and i dived out of sight round the deck house and by dint of skillful navigation i got into my bunk without any one seeing me now the way elsie found out i was on board was very curious and perhaps more pleasing to fanny than to her my bunk was an upper one and through the open porthole i could look out on to the wharf as i lay there in a much happier frame of mind than i had known for many days i stared out carelessly watching the men at work and the passers by and suddenly to my great astonishment i saw young harmer looking very miserable and unhappy he had left the vancouver too but of course without leave as he was an apprentice now if i was surprised i was angry too it was such a foolish trick and i thought i would give him a talking to at once i spoke through the port you infernal young fool said i what are you doing here why did you leave your ship if ever i saw a bewildered face it was harmer's for some seconds he looked everywhere for the voice and could not locate it either on the wharf deck or anywhere else you ought to be rope's ended for an idiot i went on and then he saw part of my face but without knowing who i was he flushed crimson and looked like a young turkeycock with his wings down and his tail up who the devil are you anyhow he asked fiercely you come out here and i'll pull your ugly head off thank you i answered calmly my head is of more use to me than yours is apparently and if you don't know my voice it belongs to tom ticehurst harmer jumped hurrah oh i'm so glad i was looking for you mr ticehurst and hunting everywhere and not for anyone else i suppose i put in and then i saw him look up i knew just as well as he did that he saw fanny and i hoped that elsie was not with her but she was how d'ye do miss fleming said he nervously and you miss fanny i hope you are well i was just talking to mr ticehurst i swore a little at this and tumbled out of my bunk and went on deck to face the music as the americans say and i got behind the girls in time to hear the little hypocrite fanny say sweetly oh mr harmer you must be mistaken i'm sure mr ticehurst if going to mexico or somewhere he can't be here miss fanny said the boy earnestly i tell you he is and there just behind you by jove i am coming on board and he scrambled up the side like a monkey as elsie turned and saw me i said good morning to her and we shook hands i could see she was nervous and fancied i could see traces of what fanny who talked hard had told me dear me mr ticehurst said fanny vigorously you didn't shake hands with me and see the time it is since we last met why was it yesterday or when but men are so forgetful i never did like boys when i was a little girl and i shall keep it up yes mr harmer now i can shake hands for not having arms ten feet long i couldn't reach yours over the rail though you did hold them out like a signal post then she and harmer talked and i lost what they said where is your father miss fleming i asked for though i felt obliged to talk i could say nothing but that unless i remarked it was a fine day but it had been fine for six months in california he went ashore mr ticehurst and won't be back until the steamer is nearly ready to go but now i must go down come fanny what for demanded that young lady i'm not coming i shall stay i like the deck and hate the cabin misty stuffy hole i shall not go down as the pilot told the man in the stupid song 'i shall pace the deck with thee' mr ticehurst please thank you fanny said i but i want to talk to harmer here before the steamer goes and if you will go with your sister perhaps it will be best she pouted and looked about her and with a parting smile for harmer and a mouth for me she followed elsie i turned to the lad now i began you're a nice boy what does it all mean it means that i couldn't stay on the vancouver if you weren't there mr ticehurst i made up my mind to that the moment i heard you were leaving i will go on your next ship but you know if you don't mind my saying it i couldn't stand your brother i would rather be struck by you than called a cub by him a 'cub' indeed i am as big as he is and bigger so he was and a fine handsome lad into the bargain with curly brown hair though his features were a little too feminine for his size and strength harmer i said drily i think you have done it now very completely this is my next ship and i am a passenger in her he didn't seem to mind in fact he took it so coolly that i began to think he knew that doesn't matter mr ticehurst he said cheerfully i will come with you i stared the devil you will do you know where i am going what i am going to do or have you any plans of your own cut and dried for me i don't see that it matters mr ticehurst he answered with a coolness i admired i have more than enough to pay my fare and if you go to british columbia i dare say i can get something to do there ah i see i replied you are tired of the sea and would like to marry and settle down eh he looked at me and blushed a little all the more reason i should go with you sir for then then there would be you know what harmer i asked a pair of us he answered humbly h'm you are a nice boy what will your father say if he hears you have gone off in this way harmer looked at me and laughed he will say it was your fault sir but i had better get my dunnage on board and away he went harmer come back i cried but he only turned nodded cheerfully and disappeared in the crowd on the whole although the appearance of harmer added a new responsibility to those which were already a sufficient burden i was not ill pleased for i thoroughly liked him and had parted with him very unwillingly when i shook his hand on board the vancouver for the last time as i thought then at any rate he would be a companion for me and if by having to look after him i was prevented in any measure from becoming selfish about elsie i might thank his boyish foolishness in being unable to prevent himself running after fanny whom to say the truth i considered a little flirt though a dear little girl and then harmer might be able to help me with elsie it was something to have somebody about that i could trust in case of accident it was nearer eleven than ten when the steamer's whistle shrieked for the last time and the crew began to haul the warps on board i could see that elsie and fanny were beginning to think that their father would arrive too late when i saw him coming along the wharf with harmer just behind him up to this time i really believed mr fleming with the curious innocence that fathers often show even those who from their antecedents and character might be expected to know better had never thought of me as being his daughter's lover but when he had joined his daughters on the hurricane deck and caught sight of harmer and myself standing on the main i saw in a moment that he knew almost as much as we could tell him and that for a few seconds he was doubtful whether to laugh or to be angry i saw him look at me sternly for a few seconds then he shook his head with a very mixed smile on his weather beaten face and sitting down on the nearest beach he burst into laughter i went up the poop ladder and caught fanny's words why father what is the matter with you don't laugh so all the people will think you crazy so i am my dear clean crazy he answered because i fancied i saw tom ticehurst and young harmer down on deck there and of course it is impossible i know that quite impossible it was an hallucination for what could they want here i should like to know you don't know of course well well i am surprised just then i came up and showed myself looking quite easy though i confess to feeling more like a fool than i remember doing since i was a boy oh then you are here ticehurst said the old man it wasn't a vision after all i was just telling fanny here that i thought i was going off my head i laughed why mr fleming i said is it impossible that i too should go to victoria on my way to alaska fleming looked at me curiously and almost winked ah alaska to be sure said he you did speak of alaska it must be a nice place you will be quite close to us come over and give us a call thank you for the invitation i replied laughing i will come to tea and bring my young friend with me for harmer now walked up shook hands with the old man in the most ordinary way and sat down between him and fanny with a coolness i could not have imitated for my life it is a strange thing to think of the amount of impudence boys have from seventeen to twenty three or so they will do things a man of thirty would almost faint to attempt and succeed because they don't know the risk they run harmer was soon engaged in talk with fanny and i tried in vain to imitate him i found elsie as cold as ice i could make no impression on her and was almost in despair at the very outset if fanny had told me the truth in the morning then elsie held a great command over herself i soon gave up the attack and retreated to my berth where i smoked savagely and was miserable you can see i did not understand much about women then the passage from san francisco to victoria takes about four days and in that time i had to make up my mind what i was going to do if what fanny said were true elsie loved me and it was only that foolish and wretched affair with helen that stood in my way yet could i tell the girl how matters were it seemed to me then and seems to me now that i was bound in honor not to tell her i could not say to her brutally that my brother's wife had made love to me and that i was wholly blameless it would be cowardly and yet i ought to clear myself it was an awkward dilemma then again it was quite possible that fanny was mistaken if she did not care for me it was all the harder and i could not court her with that mark against me yet i was determined to win her and as i sat in my berth i grew fierce and savage in my heart i swore that i would gain her over i would force her to love me if i had to kill any who stood in my way for love makes a man devilish sometimes as well as good i had come on board saying if i see no chance to win her before i get to victoria i will let her go and now when we were just outside the golden gate i swore to follow her always yes even if she spurns me if she mocks taunts me i will make her come to me at last put her arms round my neck and ask my forgiveness i said this and unconsciously i added i will follow her night and day in sunshine and in rain in health or sickness then i started violently for i was using words like those of the malay who was waiting his time to follow me and for ever in the daytime or nighttime i knew he was whetting the keen edge of his hate i could see him in his cell i could imagine him recalling my face to mind for i knew what such men are i had served as second mate in a vessel that had been manned with orientals and the off scourings of singapore such as matthias was and i knew them only too well he would follow me even as i followed her and as she was a light before me he would be a dark shadow behind me i wished then that i had killed him on board the vancouver for i felt that we should one day meet and who could discern what our meeting would bring forth in our lives i know that from that time forward he never left me for in the hour that i vowed to follow elsie until she loved me i saw very clearly that he would keep his word though he had but strength to crawl after me and kill me as i slept henceforth he was always more or less in my mind yet if i could win elsie first i did not care it might be a race between us and her love might be a shield to protect me in my hour of need i prayed that it might be so and if it could not then at least let me win her love before the end for two days i kept out of the flemings' way or rather out of the way of the girls for mr fleming himself could not be avoided as he slept in the men's berth in a bunk close to mine i believe that the first day on board he spoke to elsie about me indeed i know he did for i heard so afterward and i think it was only on her assurance that there was and could be nothing between us that he endured the situation so easily in the first place although he was not rich he was fairly well off in australia and though the british columbian ranch property was not equal in value to that which he had made for himself yet it represented a sum of money such as i could not scarcely make in many years in these hard times it would hardly be human nature for a father to look upon me as the right sort of man for his daughter especially since i was such a fool as to quit the sea without anything definite awaiting me on land so i say that if he had thought that elsie loved me i might have found him a disagreeable companion and it was no consolation to me to see that he treated me in a sort of half contemptuous half pitying way for i would rather have seen him like one of the lizards on the australian plains such as the girls had told me of which erect a spiny frill over their heads and swell themselves out the whole length of their body until their natural ugliness becomes a very horror and scares anything which has the curiosity or rashness to approach and threaten them what are you going to do in alaska or british columbia tom said he to me one day do you think of farming or seal hunting or gold mining or what i should like to hear your plans if you have any and then he went on without waiting for an answer showing plainly that he thought that i had none and was a fool and that young idiot harmer why didn't he stick to his ship because he will never stick to anything mr fleming i answered though he is a clever young fellow and fit for other things than sailoring if i'm a judge but as for myself i don't think i am and yet when i make up my mind to a thing i usually do it you usually succeed then said he with a hard smile it is well to have belief in one's own strength and abilities but sometimes others have strength as well and then and then i answered it is very often a question of will he smiled again and dropped the subject on the third day out from san francisco when we were running along the coast of oregon i found at last an opportunity of speaking to elsie i first went to fanny fanny my dear girl i want to speak to you a few minutes i sat down beside her i think you know fanny why i am here don't you i asked it is tolerably obvious mr ticehurst she answered rather gravely i thought yes i suppose it is but first i want to be sure whether you were right about what you told me on the morning we left san francisco i was silent and looked at her she seemed a trifle distressed well tom i thought that i was she answered at length and i still think i am and yet i don't know you see elsie is a strange girl and never confides in anyone since dear mother died and she would never confess anything to me still i have eyes in my head and ears too but since you have been with us she has been harder and colder than i ever saw her in all my life and she has said enough to make me think that there is something that i know nothing about which makes her so you know i joked her about you yesterday and she got so angry all of a sudden like pouring kerosene on a fire and she said you were a coward when i asked her why she turned white and wouldn't answer then i said of course you must be a coward if she said so but i didn't think she had any right to say it or think it when you had saved all our lives by your coolness and courage and then you know i got angry and cried because i like you very much just as much as i do my brother on the station at home and i said she was a cruel beast and all kinds of horrid things until i couldn't think of anything but making faces at her just as i did when i was a child and we are having a quarrel now and it is all about you you ought to be proud and fanny looked up half laughing and half crying for she dearly loved elsie as i knew well my dear little sister fanny i said for you shall be my sister one day there is something that makes her think ill of me but it is not my fault as far as i can see and i can't convince her of that except by showing her that i am not the man she thinks unless some accident puts me back into the place i once believed i held in her thoughts but i want to speak to her and i must do it to day to morrow we shall be in victoria and i should not like to part with her without speaking if i talk with her now it will probably take some time so i want you if you can to prevent anyone interrupting us fanny nodded and wiped away a tear in a quick manner just as if it were a fly very well i will you know i trust you if elsie doesn't and she went over to harmer who was in a fidget and kept looking at me as if he was wondering what i meant by talking so confidentially to fanny i found elsie sitting by herself just forward of the funnel she was reading and though when i spoke she answered and put the book down in her lap she kept looking at it in a nervous way as if she wished i had not interrupted her and we had been talking some minutes before she seemed to wholly forget that it was there i spoke without any thought of what i was going to say miss fleming see i call you that though a little while ago it was elsie i have determined to speak to you in spite of the way you avoid me i would rather you did not mr ticehurst she said it has come to a time when i must do as i think fit even if i am rude and rough i have something to say and mean to say it miss fleming and if i word it in rough or broken fashion if i stumble over it or stammer with my tongue you will know why just as you know why i am here come now why am i on this steamer she remained mute with her head bent down and the gold of her hair loose over her eyes so that i could not see them but she trembled a little and was ripping one of the pages of her book i took hold of it and put it down she made no remonstrance and i began to feel that i had power over her though how far it went i could not tell why am i here i went on scornfully oh on a pleasure trip to see the advertised coast from san francisco to sitka to behold mount elias and its glaciers by heavens i think i have ice nearer at hand oh it is business i wish to gain wealth so i give up what i understand and go into what is as familiar to me as a sextant is to a savage it can't be business do you know what it is miss fleming look i think there was a girl who i knew once but she was a kind bright girl who was joyous whom i called by her christian name who walked by my side in the moonlight when the sails were silvered and their shadows dark when i kept the first watch in the vancouver i wonder what has become of her that girl would have known but i stopped and she was still stubborn but she did not move i went on again there must be evil spirits on the sea that fly like petrels in the storm and come on board ship and enter into the hearts of those they find there why i fear mr ticehurst she interrupted that you think me a fool if i am not then your talk is vain and if i am i surely am not fit to mate with you let us cease to talk about this for it is useless i was almost choking with passion it was so hard to be misconceived even though she had so much reason on her side yet since i knew she was wrong i almost wished to shake her no i said at last i will not go until i have an understanding one way or the other we have been beating about the bush but i will do it no longer you know that i love you she drew herself up how many can you love at a time mr ticehurst she said one only one i replied you are utterly mistaken i am not mistaken she said and i think you are a coward and a traitor if you were not i might love you but as you are such a thing is impossible i caught her by the wrist instinctively she tried to free herself but finding she could not looked up when she caught my eye her indignant remonstrance died on her lips look you elsie what can i do perhaps i cannot defend myself there are some situations where a man cannot for the sake of others i can say no more about that and i will make you see you are wrong if not by proof by showing you what i am a man incapable of what you think me and in the end i will make you love me i paused for a moment but she did not move you have listened to me elsie and you can see what i mean you can think whether i shall falter or swerve and now i ask you for i am assured you do love me or that you did whether you will not trust me now for you cannot believe that i could speak as i do if i had done what you think i looked at elsie and she was very pale i could see that i had moved her had shaken her conviction that she was at war with herself i got up went to the side and then turned beckoning to her to look over to seaward with me she came almost like a woman walking in her sleep and took a place by my side i did so to avoid notice for i feared to attract attention indeed i saw two passengers looking at us curiously one of whom smiled so that i began to wish to throw him overboard yet i think as a matter of fact i did wrong in allowing her to move it broke the influence i held over her in a measure for i have often noticed since that to obtain control of some people one should keep steadily insisting on the one point and never allow them to go beyond or even to think beyond it but then to do so one must be stronger than i was or he will lose control over himself as i did and so make errors in judgment elsie i said quietly are you not going to answer me or am i not worth it now up to this moment i had taken her away from the past in her emotion she had almost forgotten helen she was just wavering and was on the point of giving in to me yet by that last suggestion of mine i brought it back to her i could see in her mind the darker depths of her fear and distrust of me and what i rightly judged her hatred and jealousy of helen though i do not think i know much of character yet in the state of mind that i was in then i seemed to see her mind as a much more subtle man might have done and my own error i could have cursed my own folly she had taken the book again and was holding it open in her hand until i spoke she held it so lightly that it shook and wavered but she caught it in both hands and shut it suddenly as though it was the book of her heart that i had been reading and she denied my right to do it and she turned toward me cold once more though by a strange influence she caught my thought this is a closed book mr ticehurst it is the book of the past and it is gone for ever she dropped it over the side with a mocking smile but i caught hold of her hand and held it ah said i then we begin again if the past is dead the present lives and the future is yet unborn you mean one thing now and i mean the other but in the future we shall both mean the same remember what i say elsie remember it for unless i am dead i will be your acknowledged lover and your husband at last i dropped her hand and walked away and when i looked back i saw her following me with her eyes i would have given much then to have been able to know of what she thought i went below and slept for many hours a sleep of exhaustion for though a man may be as strong as a lion physically an excess of emotion takes more from him than the most terrible physical toil the next morning we were in victoria and i neither had nor did i seek an opportunity of again speaking with elsie but i did talk for a few moments with fanny i told her some part of what occurred but not much she said as much you are keeping something back tom i think you know some reason why elsie won't have anything to do with you i do fanny i replied but there is nothing in it at all and one of these days she will discover it i hope so said she a little dryly for so young a girl but elsie is a little obstinate and i have seen horses that would not jump a gate you may have to open it yet tom it may open of it itself fanny or the horse may desire the grass and jump at last but i will never open it myself and i shook hands with her and mr fleming i took off my hat to elsie but said in a low voice remember what i said elsie for i shall never forget and then she turned away but did not look back this time as she had done when we parted in the hotel yet such is the curious state a lover is in that i actually comforted myself that she did not for if she had i said it would have showed she was callous and cold perhaps though she kept command over herself just for the time it failed her at the last and she would not let me see it when they were gone harmer and i went ashore too as to the boy he was so desperately in love calf love that i had to cheer him up and the way i did it makes me laugh now for i have a larger experience of boys and men than i had then never mind harmer said i you will get over this in no time see if you don't he turned round in a blazing rage and i think if it had not been for the effects of the old discipline which was yet strong upon him he would have sworn at me for although harmer looked as if butter wouldn't melt in his mouth i knew he had a very copious vocabulary of abuse at his command such as one learns only too easily at sea what mr ticehurst he said stammering get over it i never shall and i don't want to and what's more i wouldn't if i could it's not kind of you to say so and i think i think what jack said i thunderstruck at this outburst when i meant consolation that you'll get over it first there now said he triumphant with this retort i burst into laughter well well harmer i didn't mean to vex you we must not quarrel now for jordan's a hard road to travel i believe and you and i have got to make lots of money at least you have if we are going to do anything in this country for it's what the yankees call a tough place yes replied harmer now ashamed of of being angry i heard one fellow say to another on the steamer 'you goldarned fellers from the east think you're going to get a soft seat over here but you bet you'll have to rustle on the pacific slope or else git' and then he turned to me 'd'ye hear that young feller you've got to rustle right smart or you'll get left' and jack laughed heartily trying to imitate the accent of his adviser but he found it hard to disguise his own pure english learnt in a home far across the seas and the wide stretch of the american continent that night we stayed in victoria in a rough hotel kept by two brothers cornishmen who invited us both to have drinks on the strength of our all being englishman though i should never have suspected that they were such so well did their accent disguise the truth from me and in the morning two days after we went on board the western slope bound for new westminster on the mainland of british columbia whither the flemings had preceded us part iii a golden link what i have just written is but the connecting link between two series of events the hyphen between two words and i shall not try to hurry on to the strange drama of a few days to which all that precedes it has been but the inevitable prologue without which there were no clear understanding of its incidents i am going therefore to dispose of a whole year's events in a few words though much occurred in that time which might be worth relating if i were a professional writer able to make things interesting to all or if i had the faculty of making word pictures of places and scenes which stand out clearly before me whenever i reflect and the full times of the past come up for review what jack harmer and i did for that year truly would take ten times the space i have allowed myself and have been allowed and i shall say but little now if i can only dispose of that twelve months in a way that places my readers in a position to clearly understand what passed in the thirteenth month after i had landed in british columbia now on our landing we had but between us and i was the possessor of nearly all that amount about two hundred dollars in american currency it is true i had a hundred and fifty pounds in england which i had sent for and harmer had quite coolly asked his father for fifty which i may state here he did not get in a letter which advised him to return to england and go in for something worth having before it was too late he means the civil service i know said jack when he read the letter and i hate the notion they are all fossils in it and if they have brains to start with they rarely keep them why should they they're not half as much use as a friend at court perhaps he was right yet i advised him to take his father's advice and he took neither his nor mine but stuck to me persistently with a devotion that pleased and yet annoyed me for i desired a free hand and with him i could not get it i had some idea of going in for farming when i landed i would get a farm near elsie's father and stay there but i found i hadn't sufficient money or anything like sufficient to buy land near thomson forks so i looked round and in looking round spent money finally i got harmer something to do in a sawmill on burrard's inlet a position which give him sufficient to live on but very little more and yet he had not to work very hard in fact he tallied the lumber into the ships loading in the inlet for china and australia and wrote to me that he liked his job reasonably well though he was grieved to be away from me as for myself i went up to thomson forks looked round me there and at the hotel fell in with a man named mackintosh an american from michigan a great strong fellow with a long red beard and an eye like an eagle's who was going up in the big bend gold hunting prospecting as they call it i told him after we got into conversation that i wanted to go farming he snorted scornfully and immediately began to dilate on gold mining and all the chances a man had who possessed the grit to tackle it and as i knew i really had too little money to farm with it wasn't long before he persuaded me to be his partner and go with him for i liked him at once and was feeling so out in the cold that i was glad to chum with anyone who looked like knowing his way about we were soon in the thick of planning our campaign and mac got very fluent and ornamental in his language as he drank and talked however i did not mind that much although his blasphemy was british columbian and rather worse than that in use on board ship yet people do not think the sea a mean school of cursing presently as i turned round at the bar i saw mr fleming who did not notice me until i spoke good morning mr fleming i said will you drink with me he turned round sharply at the sound of my voice and then shook my hand half doubtfully at first and then more heartily well ticehurst he said at last i am glad to see you after all hang it i am for here he lowered his voice to a whisper i don't care about the style of this place after new south wales they nearly all carry revolvers here damn it as if they were police and last time i came in my man and another fellow fought and siwash jim that's what they call him tried to gouge out the other chap's eyes and when i pulled him off the other men growled about my spoiling a fight what do you think of that and the old man stared at me inquiringly and then laughed wish i could ask you over to the creek but i can't and you know why take my advice and go back to sea now look here let's speak plain i know you want elsie but it's a mistake my boy she didn't care for you and i know her she's just like her mother the obstinatest woman you ever saw when she made up her mind i wouldn't mind much if she did care for you though perhaps you aint so rich as you ought to be tom but then my wife had more money than i had by a long sight so i don't care for that but seeing that elsie doesn't want you what's the use take my advice and go to sea again here he stopped and gave me the first chance of speaking i had had since i accosted him thank you mr fleming i said firmly but i can't go back yet i am glad you have no great objection to me yourself but i believe that elsie hasn't either and i'm bound to prove it and i will well you know best he replied but mind your eye old boy when your friend the malay comes out i shouldn't like to be on the same continent with him if i were you i don't like being either i said but then it shows how fixed i am on one object and i shall not go even if he were to find out where i am for i might have to kill him yet i don't see how he can find out nobody knows or will know except my brother and he won't tell him fleming shrugged his shoulders and dropped the subject to take up his own affairs damn this country my boy give me a plain where i can see a few miles on my soul this place chokes me i can't look out five hundred yards for some thundering old mountain at the creek there are hills at the back at the front and on both sides and nearly all are chokeful of trees so that riding after the cattle is worse than going after scrub cattle in australia i can't get the hang of the place at all and though i am supposed to own nearly two hundred head of cattle i can't muster seventy five on my own place some are up at spullamacheen some on the nicola and others over at the kettle river on the border for all i know and the place is full of caons as they call gulches in this place and thundering holes they are two hundred feet deep with a roaring stream at the bottom the black caon at the back of my place gives me the shivers i am like a horse bred on the plains when it gets on the mountains it is all abroad and shivers at the sight of a sharp slope i reckon i can ride on the flat old as i am but here if it wasn't for my scoundrel siwash jim who says he knows the country like a book i shouldn't know where to go or what to do here he comes the vagabond i had learnt by this time that siwash means indian for in that country they say siwashes instead of indians so i thought jim was one of the natives however i saw at once he wasn't for though he was dark his features were pure white he had earned his nickname by living with the indians for so many years that he was more at home with them than with white people and he had acquired all their vices as well as a goodly stock of his own probably inherited he was a slightly built man of about forty with a low forehead a sharp aquiline nose and no lips to speak of his mustache was short and a mere line his teeth were black with smoking and chewing his legs bowed with continual riding he wore mocassins and kept his hair long he was more than half intoxicated when he came in carrying a stock whip coiled round his neck he did not speak but drank stolidly and when he looked at me i fancied it was with an air of dislike as though he had read my thoughts and knew how i regarded him i drew fleming aside i don't like him said i and wouldn't trust him farther than i could swing a bull by the tail do the girls like him like him repeated fleming they hate him and want me to give him the bounce as they say here elsie says he looks like a murderer and fanny that he is uglier than a murrumbidgee black fellow but then he knows the country and does his work and don't want to go i don't care much either way for when i can get all the cattle together and put the place in order i shall sell out and go back stay in british columbia no sir i won't not if they make me governor i tell you i like to be where i can see ten miles then i can breathe i can go out at home and see all my station and almost count the sheep and cattle from my door and here i have to ride up and ride down and i never know where i am i'm going back just as soon as i can and he went away then without asking where i was going or whether i was doing anything next morning i jumped on board the steamer with mac and started for the head of the shushwap lakes thence we went into the big bend and though we never made the millions mac was always prophesying about and hungering for our summer's work was not wasted for before the season was over we had struck a rich pocket and made about four thousand dollars a piece of course i wanted to up stick and go back as soon as i had as much as that but mac would not hear of it no tom no said he there's more here yet and he eyed me so entreatingly that i caved in and promised to remain with him prospecting at any rate till the first snow but a week after making that agreement we both went down to the columbia for more provisions finding none there we had to make the farther journey to the landing there i found a letter waiting for me from harmer saying that he was tired of the sawmill on the inlet and wanted to join me i wrote back requesting him to be good enough to stay where he was but to console him promised that if i saw any chance of his doing better with me i would send for him he asked rather timidly for news of fanny how could i give him news when i knew nothing of elsie yet the simple mention of the girl's name again made me anxious to get back to the forks and if one of the steamers had come up the lake i think i should have deserted mac in spite of my promise yet we had only brought down half the gold that trip perhaps because my partner had made a calculation as to what i might do having it on me if we got within reach of some kind of civilization and i thought it best to secure the rest while i could though i thoroughly trusted mac at the same time that i answered harmer's letter i wrote one to my brother telling him both what i had done and what i proposed doing later on and i begged him to be careful if he should be in san francisco then of the malay when his time was up for although his chief spite was against me yet will was my brother and i well remembered the look that he had cast on him when he was kicked in the struggle between will and myself the rest of the summer and a beautiful season it was in the wooded mountains was spent in very unsuccessful prospecting for one thing after our success mac had taken to prospecting for pockets and if gold mining be like gambling as a general rule that is almost pure chance once or twice he was in high spirits at good indications but on following them up we were invariably disappointed and we had to start again august and september passed and the higher summits above us were already white with snow which fell on us in the lower valleys as rain in october there was a cessation of bad weather for a time and mac promised himself a long fall season but at the end of it we woke one morning to find a foot of snow on our very camping ground we shall have to get up and get said i cheerfully for i was glad of it oh no said mac this is nothing it will all go again by to morrow there will be nothing to stop us from another week or two besides yesterday i had a notion that i saw something i didn't tell you but i found another bit of quartz aye richer than the piece i showed you at the forks tom and we've got to find out where it comes from i groaned but in spite of argument there was no moving him and though i was angry enough to have gone off by myself yet knowing neither the trail nor the country well i had no desire to get lost in the mountains which would most assuredly have meant death to me however i still remonstrated and at last got him to fix ten days as the very longest time he would remain i was obliged to be content with that but mac was sorry before the hour appointed for our departure that he had not taken my advice tenderfoot and englishman though i was on the evening of the eighth day the temperature which had up to that time been fairly warm in spite of our altitude and the advanced season fell suddenly and it became bitterly cold our ponies who had managed to pick up a fair living on the plateau where our camp stood and along the creek bottoms came right up to our tent and one of them put his head inside dick as we called him was a much gentler animal than most british columbian cayuses and had made a friend of me coming once a day at least for me to give him a piece of bread of which he had grown fond though at first he was as strange with it as a young foal with oats i put up my hand and touched his nose which was soft and silky while the rest of his coat was long and rough he whinnied gently and i found a crust for him and then gently repulsing him i fastened the fly of the tent mac was fast asleep under his dark blankets whence there came sudden snorts like those a bear makes in his covert or low rumblings like thunder from a thick cloud but it was he who woke me in the morning and he did it without ceremony get up old man he said hurriedly while he was jamming himself as it were into his garments the snow's come at last and by thunder it's come to stay there's no time to be lost and he vanished into the white space outside when i followed i found him already at work packing the ponies and without any words i set to struck the tent rolled it up and got together everything i thought should go when i touched the tools mac turned round leave 'em pard leave 'em there's plenty of weight without that aye plenty and too much the last i only just caught for it was said to himself in half an hour we were off leaving behind us nearly three weeks' provisions all the tools but two light shovels and what remained after our working the quartz it's worth a thousand dollars said mac regretfully but without a proper crusher it's only tailings we moved off camp mac first leading the nameless pony which was the stronger of the two and i following with dick the snow was two feet deep in many parts and in some drifts much more than that fortunately the trail was for its greater length well sheltered both by overhanging rocks and big trees spruce cedar hemlock and pine which helped to keep it clear but it was evident to me by the way the ponies traveled and the labor it was for me to get along with no other burden than the shovel from which i sometimes used to free dick that another fall of snow would make traveling almost impossible mac walked on in somber silence reflecting doubtless that it was his obstinacy which had brought us into trouble a thing i confess i was not so forgiving as to forget though merciful enough not to remind him of it it had taken us three days to come up from the columbia and it seemed barely possible under the circumstances to retrace our steps in the same time even although the horses were not so much burdened and there was not so much hard climbing to be done but i could see mac was bent on getting out and he traveled without more rest than we were absolutely compelled to take on account of the animals as for myself i confess that though i had traveled that same trail twice yet so greatly was it altered by the snow that i should have lost my way in the first mile for mountaineering and the knowledge of locality are things not to be learnt in a hurry they must come by long custom or by native instinct sorrowfully for i am always loth to harm even a noxious animal as long as it leaves me alone i suggested to mac that we should leave the horses he shook his head who'll carry the provisions then said he do you think we can get to the landing mac i asked we shall be lucky he answered with a significant nod if we get to the other side of the columbia tom i think i have let you in for a winter up here unless you care about snow shoeing it over the other pass i was a fool say yes to that if you like it was late when we camped but my partner was in better spirits than he had been at noon when we held the above conversation for we had done by dint of forced marching quite as much as we did in fine weather but the ponies were very tired and there was nothing for them to eat or next to nothing for the grass was deeply buried i gave dick a little bread however and the poor animal was grateful for it and stood by me all night until at the earliest dawn we packed them again with a load that was lighter by the day's food of two men and heavier to them by a day's hard toil and starvation toward the afternoon of that the second day we came to the hardest part of the whole trail for on crossing a river which was freezing cold we had to climb the side of an opposing mountain mac's pony traveled well and though he showed evident signs of fatigue he was in much better case than mine who every now and again staggered or sobbed audibly with a long drawn breath i drew mac's attention to it but he shook his head he must go on there's no two ways about it and he marched off i went behind dick and pushed him for a while and though i tired myself yet i am not sorry for what i did even that little assistance was such a relief to the poor wretched animal who from the time he was able to bear a weight had been used by a packer without rest or peace as though he were a machine and whose only hope of release was to die starved wounded saddle and girth galled of slow starvation at last such is the lot of the pack horse and though poor dick's end was more merciful his fellows have no better fate to expect while their life is a perpetual round of ill usage and hard work by about four o'clock in the afternoon the sky grew overcast and the light feathery flakes of snow came at first slowly and then faster turning what blue distances we caught sight of to a gray finally hiding them dick by this time was almost at a standstill i never thought i was a very tender hearted man and never set up to be indeed if he had been only stubborn i might have thrashed him in a way some folks would call cruel and yet being compelled to urge him both for his sake and my own i confess my heart bled to see his suffering and wretchedness having scarcely the strength to lift his feet properly he had struck his fetlocks against many projecting stones and roots until the blood ran down and congealed on his little hoofs which were growing tender as i could see by the way he winced on a rockier piece of the trail than common his rough coat was standing up and staring like that of a broken haired terrier in spite of the sweat which ran down his thin sides and heaving flanks while every now and again he stumbled and with difficulty recovered himself when we came to the divide just as if he had said that he would do so much for us he stumbled again and fell on the level ground cutting his knees deeply mac heard the noise and leaving his pony standing he came back to me he's done up poor devil said he he'll go no further what shall we do i shook my head for it was not i who arranged or ordered things when mac was about he was silent for a while there's nothing for it he said at last but one thing we must put all the other kieutan can stand on him by this time i had got the pack off dick and he lay down perfectly flat upon his side with the blood slowly oozing from his knees and his flanks still heaving from the exertions which had brought him up the hill to die on the top of it come on said mac as he moved off with what he meant to put on the other pony but at first i could not go i put my hand in my pocket took out a piece of bread and kneeling down by the poor animal i put it to his lips he mumbled it with his teeth and dropped it out then in my hat i got some water out of a little pool and offered it to him he drank some and then fell back again i took my revolver from my belt stroked his soft nose once more and putting the weapon to his head between his eye and ear i fired he shivered all over stiffened a little and all was still except for the slow drip of the blood that ran out of his ear from a vein the ball had divided then i went on and i hope no one will think me weak if i confess my sight was not quite so clear as it had been before and if there was a strange haziness about the cruelly cold trail and mountain side that did not come from the falling snow at our camp that night we spoke little more than was absolutely necessary and turned in as soon as we had eaten supper drunk a tin of coffee and smoked a couple of pipes fortunately for the remaining horse in the place we had reached there was a little feed a few tussocks of withering frost nipped bunch grass which he ate greedily to the last roots his sharp teeth could reach and then he pawed or rustled for more using his hoof to bare what was hidden under the snow but for that we should have left him on the trail next morning the toil and suffering of the third day's march were dreadful for i grew footsore and my feet bled at the heels while the skin rose in blisters on every toe which rapidly became raw but mac was a man of iron and never faltered or grew tired and his example and a feeling of shame at being outdone by another kept me doggedly behind him at a few paces' distance how the pony stood that day was a miracle for he must have been made of iron and not flesh and blood to carry his pack while climbing up and sliding down the steep ascents and slopes of the hills while every few yards some wind felled tree had to be clambered over almost as a dog would do it he was always clammy with sweat but he seemed in better condition than on the second day perhaps on account of the grass he had been able to get during the night yet he had had to work all night to get it while i and mac had slept in the torpor of great exhaustion late in the evening we came to the banks of the columbia across which stretched sandy flats and belts of scrub until the level ended and lofty mountains rose once more covered with snow and fringed with sullen clouds thousands of feet above where we stood mac stopped and looked anxiously across the broad stream and when he saw a faint curl of bluish smoke rising a mile away in the sunless air he pointed to it with a more pleased expression that i had seen on his face since he had roused me so hurriedly on that snowy morning three days ago there is somebody over there at any rate old man he said almost cheerfully though i don't know what the thunder they're doing here unless it's montana bill come up trapping he said he was going to do it but if so what's he doing down here can't he trap here then i asked well replied mac this might be the end of his line but still he ought to be farther up in the hills there isn't much to trap close down on this flat you see trappers usually have two camps and they walk the line during the day and take out what is caught in the night setting the traps again and sleeping first at one end and then at the other however we shall see when we get across and he set about lighting a fire when we had crossed before there had been a rough kind of boat built out of pine slabs which was as crazy a craft to go in as a butter tub it had been made by some hunters the winter before and left there when they went west in the early spring before we came up i asked mac what had become of it for it was not where we had left it hauled up a little way on a piece of shingle and tied to a stump somebody took it he said or more likely when the water rose after we crossed it was carried away perhaps it's in the pacific by this i went down to the stump and found there the remains of the painter and as it had been broken violently and not cut i saw that his last suggestion was probably correct we sat down to supper by our fire which gleamed brightly in the gathering darkness on the surrounding snow and the waters close beneath us and ate some very vile bacon and a greasy mess of beans which we had cooked the night before we left our mountain camp how are we going to cross mac said i when we had lighted our pipes build a raft said he and then when we are over yes why stay there i guess if it snows any more one more fall of heavy snow will block eagle pass as sure as fire's hot i shrugged my shoulders though i had been expecting this it was not pleasant to have the prospect of spending a whole winter mewed up in the mountains so close before me does it get very cold here i asked at length when i had reflected for a while he nodded sardonically does it get cold is it cold now i drew closer to the fire for an answer then this is nothin' nothin' at all it would freeze the tail off a brass monkey up here it goes more than forty below zero often and often and it's a worse kind of cold than the cold back east for it's damper here and not so steady bah i wish i was a bear so as to hole up till spring all of which was very encouraging to a man who had mostly sailed in warm latitudes and hated a frost worse than poison and it didn't please me to see that so good tempered a man as mac was really put out and in a vile humor for he knew what i could only imagine the conversation if conversation it could be called flagged very soon and we got out our blankets scraping away the snow from a place where we lay close to each other in order to preserve what warmth we could we lay in the position commonly called in america spooning like two spoons fitting one into another so that there had to be common consent for changing sides one of which grew damp while the other grew cold just as we were settling down to sleep we heard the sudden crack of a rifle from the other shore and against the wind came a halloa across the water mac sat up very unconcernedly but as for me i jumped as if i had been shot thinking of course at first that the shot had been fired by indians though i knew there were no hostile tribes in that part of british columbia where indeed most of the indians are very peaceable i told you so said mac that's montana bill's rifle i sold it him myself he's the only man up here that carries a sharp he rose and went down to the water's edge halloa he shouted in his turn and in the quietness of the windless air i heard it faintly repeated in distant echoes is that you mac said the mysterious voice you bet it is answered my partner in a tone that ought to have been heard on the arrow lake bully old boy said bill faintly as it seemed do you know me aye i reckon i know old montana's bellow roared mac then i'll see you in the morning pard came the voice again after which there was silence broken only by the faint lap of the water on the shingle as it slipped past and the snort of our pony as he blew the snow out of his nostrils vainly seeking for a tuft of grass we rose at earliest dawn and saw montana bill slowly coming over the level he sat down while mac and i built a raft and fashioned a couple of rude paddles with the ax is the pony coming across mac i asked we'll try it but it's his own lookout said he if he won't come easy we shan't drag him for we shall hev to paddle to do it ourselves fortunately for him he did want to go over and having a long lariat round his neck he actually swam in front of us and gave us a tow instead of our giving him one as we were going over mac said to me i never thought i'd be glad to see montana bill before he's got more gas and blow about him than'd set up a town and he's no more good at bottom that is he aint no more grit in him than a clay bank though to hear him talk you'd think he'd mor'n a forty two inch grindstone but i hope he's got a good stock of grub in a few minutes we touched bottom and we shook hands with the subject of mac's eulogium who looked as bold as brass as fierce as a turkeycock and had the voice of a man o' war's bo'son we took the lariat off the pony and turned him adrift did you fellows strike it said bill the first thing enough to pay for our winter's board i reckon said mac have you got plenty of grub bill nodded using the common american word for yes which is a kind of cross breed between yea and the german ja pronounced short like ye you bet i've plenty old hank kem up with me and then he cleared out again he and i kind of disagreed first thing and he just skinned out good thing too for him and bill looked unutterable things is there any chance of getting out over the pass asked mac if you can fly answered bill drifts is forty foot deep in parts and soft too i could hardly get on snow shoein' it better stay and trap with me better'n gold huntin' any time and more dollars in it why aint you farther up in the hills asked mac as we tramped along dunno said bill i allers camp here every year it's kind of clear and there's a chance for the cayuses to pick a bit to keep bones and hide together besides i feel more freer down here i see more than 'ull do me of the hills walking the line and with that we came to his camp now if i tell all that happened during that winter which was all round the most uncomfortable and most unhappy one i ever spent for i had so much time to think of elsie and how some other man more to her mind might go to windward of me in courting her why i should not write one book but two which is not my intention now besides i have been long enough coming to the most serious part of my history to tire other people as it has tired me although i could not exactly help it because all or at least nearly all that happened between the time i was on the vancouver and the time we all met again seems important to me especially as it might have gone very differently if i had never been gold hunting in the selkirks or even if i had got out of the mountains in the fall instead of the following spring for things seem linked together in life and in writing one must put everything in unless more particular description becomes tedious because of its interfering with the story and though trapping is interesting enough yet i am not writing here about that or hunting which is more interesting still and when a man tells me a yarn he says is about a certain thing i don't want him to break off in the middle to say something quite different any more than i like a man to get up in the middle of a job of work such as a long splice which is wanted to do something he wasn't ordered to do it's only a way of doing a literary tom cox's traverse three times round the deck house and once to the scuttle butt just putting in time or making what a literary friend of mine calls padding so folks who read this can understand why i shall say nothing of this long and weary winter and if they prefer it they can think that we holed up as mac said like the bears and slept through it all for in the next part of this yarn it will be spring with the snow melting fast and the trail beginning to look like a path again that even a sailor who was not a mountaineer could hope to travel on without losing his life or even his way part iv love and hate it had been raining for a week in an incessant torrent while the heavy clouds hung low down the slopes of the sullen sunless mountains when we struck camp in the spring time and loaded our gaunt pack ponies for the rapidly opening trail our road lay for some twenty miles on the bottom of a flat which closed in more and more as we went east until we were in the heart of the gold range the path was liquid mud in which we sank to the tops of our long boots sometimes even leaving them embedded there and the ponies were nearly sloughed down a dozen times in the day at the worst places we were sometimes compelled to take off their packs which we carried piecemeal to firmer ground and there loaded them again it had taken us but four or four and a half days to cross it on our last trip and now we barely reached summit lake in the same time yet in spite of the miserable weather and our dank and dripping condition in spite of the hard work and harder idleness when wind and rain made it almost impossible to sleep i was happy far happier than i had been since the time i had so miserably failed to make elsie believe what i told her for now i was going back to her with the results of my long toil and there was nothing to prevent my staying near her perhaps on a farm of my own until she should recognize her error at last yet i thought it well to waste no time for though i had to a great extent got rid of my fears concerning that wretched matthias still his imprisonment had but a few more months to run and he might keep his word and his sworn oath i wished to win her and wear her before that time and after that why i did not care i would do my best and trust in providence even if i trusted in vain i have often thought since that it was strange how much john harmer was in my mind from daylight even to dark during the sixth day of our toilsome tramp over eagle pass for his image often unaccountably came before me and even dispossessed the fair face of her whom i loved but it was so and no time during that day should i have been very much surprised though perhaps a little angry to see him come round a bend in the trail saying half humbly and half impudently as he approached me how do you do mr ticehurst i almost began to believe after that day in second sight clairvoyance and all the other mysterious things which most sensible people look upon as they do on charlatanry and the juggling in a fair for my presentiments came true in such a strange way even if it was only an accident or mere coincidence after all yet i have seen many things put down as coincidences which puzzled me and wiser people than tom ticehurst we had camped in a wretchedly miserable spot which had nothing to recommend it beyond the fact that there really was some grass there for the wall of rock on our right which both mac and bill considered a protection from the wind acted as break winds often do and gave us two gales in opposite directions instead of one so the wind instead of sweeping over us and going on its way fought and contended over our heads and only ceased for a moment to rush skrieking again about our ears as it leapt on the fire and sent the embers here and there while the rain descended at every possible angle perhaps it was on account of the fizzing of the water in the fire the rattle of the branches overhead and the whistling of the wind that we heard no one approaching our grumbling company until they were right upon us i was just then half a dozen paces out in the darkness cutting up some wood for our fire and as the strangers approached the light i let fall my ax so that it narrowly escaped cutting off my big toe for one of the two i saw was a boy and that boy john harmer i slouched my big hat down over my eyes and with some wood in my arms i approached the group and replenished the fire john was talking with quite a western twang as though he was determined not to be taken for an englishman rain he was saying well you bet it's something like it on the lake it takes an old hand to know which is land and which is water old hank was nearly drowned in his tent the other day serve him right growled bill but who are you young feller i never see you before and i mostly know everybody in this country harmer looked up coolly and taking off his hat swung it round well he answered i aint what you'd call celebrated in bc yet and so you mightn't have heard of me but if you know everybody perhaps you know tom ticehurst and can tell me where he is to be found for i am looking for him oh you are are you said bill then what's he been doing that you want him so bad as to come across in this trail this weather he hasn't been doing anything that i know pard said jack but i know he was up here with a man named mackintosh ah i know him replied bill in fact i've seen him lately is tom ticehurst a little chap with red hair and a squint no he isn't shouted jack as if he had been libeled instead of me he's a good looking fellow big enough to eat you oh is he sneered the joker i tell you what young feller it would take a big man to chew up montana bill's little finger harmer burst out laughing so you're montana bill are you said he i am answered bill as gravely as if it were a kingly title well then old hank said he could eat you up without pepper or salt he's as mad at you as a man can be says he's been practicing shooting all the winter on purpose to do you up and he puts a new edge on his knife every morning that'll do young feller put in mac seeing that bill was getting in a rage and knowing that he was just the man to have a row with a youngster you're a little too fast you are my name's mackintosh if you want anyone of that name do i want you cried harmer anxiously of course i do do you know where ticehurst is yes replied mac while i stood close beside harmer looking down at the fire so that he couldn't see my face i was laughing so then where is he hang it has anything happened to him that you fellows make such a mystery about it he asked getting a little alarmed as i could tell by the tone of his voice well replied mac quietly i'll tell you he was up in the hills with me and we struck it rich got a lot of gold we did you bet we did he went on in an irritating drawl and then came down when the snow flew we had such a time getting out young feller and then at last we came to the columbia and there he was drowned said harmer growing pale no he warn't replied mac we got across all right and stayed all winter trapping with bill here and let me tell you young man you mustn't trifle with bill he's a snorter he is i could see damn bill almost on jack's lips but he restrained it and when the chinook came up and the snow began to melt a few days back we all got ready to cross the range him and bill and me that's six days ago and a better fellow than him you never struck no nor will what do you think pard he asked with a grin turning to me i grunted and young feller mac went on again if he's a pardner of yours or a shipmate for i can see you're an englishman why i'm glad he's here and safe then suddenly altering his tone he turned fiercely on harmer who jumped back in alarm why the thunder don't you shake hands with him there he is a waitin' and john sprang across the fire and caught me by both hands confound it mr ticehurst how very unkind of you he said with tears in his eyes i began to think you were dead and he looked unutterably relieved and happy but bursting with some news i could see wait till supper jack said i and then tell me but i'm glad to see you i was too in spite of his leaving the inlet without asking me as to the man with whom he came montana bill knew him and they spent their time in bullying the absent hank patterson it appeared that harmer had hired him to come and hunt for me as far as the columbia river in order to bury me decently as he had been firmly convinced that i was dead when he learnt no news of me at the landing the whole five of us sat down to beans and bacon but i and harmer ate very little because he wanted to tell me something which i was strangely loth to hear so sure was i that it could be nothing good it certainly must be bad news to bring even an impulsive youngster from the coast to the columbia in such weather well what is it harmer said i at last he hesitated a moment is it anything about her i asked quietly lest the others should overhear who miss f he asked i nodded and he shook his head it's no such luck he went on but i am so doubtful of what i have to tell you although a few hours ago i was sure enough that i didn't know how to begin when mat's sentence be up mr ticehurst i had no need to reckon the th of august jack he looked at me and then bent over toward me it's up already sir what is he dead then no sir but he has escaped and he filled his pipe while i gathered myself together it was dreadfully unfortunate if it were true how do you know this i said at length i saw him in new westminster one night the deuce you did harmer are you sure the lad looked uncomfortable and wriggled about on his seat which was the old stump of a tree felled by some former occupants of our camping ground i should have been perfectly sure if i hadn't thought he was in the penitentiary he said finally but still i don't think i can have mistaken his face even though i only caught sight of it just for a moment down in the indian town i was sitting in a cabin with two other fellows and some klootchmen and i saw him pass there was not much light and he was going quick but i jumped up and rushed out after him but in the rain and darkness he got away if he thought anyone was following him or i missed him i'm glad you did my boy he would have thought little of putting his knife into you and here i rubbed my own shoulder mechanically besides if he had seen you that would have helped him to track me but then how in the name of thunder as mac says did he come here at all it can't be chance did you look up the san francisco papers to see if anything was reported as to his escape harmer brightened as if glad to answer that he had done what i considered he ought to have done yes sir i did but i found nothing about it nothing at all i reflected a little and saw nothing clearly after all but the imperative necessity of my getting down to the forks if mat were loose why i should have to be very careful it was true but perhaps he might be retaken though i did not know if a man could be extradited for simply breaking prison and if he came up country and couldn't find me he might take it into his oriental skull to harm anyone i knew the thought made me shiver did you stay at thomson forks harmer i asked to try and turn the dark current of my thoughts he blushed a little yes sir but only a day i saw no one though what not even fanny no but i wrote to her and told her i was going up the lakes to see what had become of you that was kind of you jack said i i mean it was kind of you to come up here how do you like the country eh he turned round comically shrugged his shoulders and said nothing i could see that early spring in the mountains did not please him especially as we were in the wet belt but if he did not like the country i found he could stand it well for he was as hardy as a pack pony and never complained not though we were delayed a whole day by the rain and on our return to the landing had to go to thomson forks in indian dugouts when we did arrive there it was fine at last and the sun was shining brilliantly mac harmer and i were greeted in the friendliest manner at the hotel by dave the bar tender who was resplendent with a white shirt of the very finest get up and diamond studs he stood us drinks at once you're welcome to it gentlemen and more too for we did think down here that you had been lost in the snow we never expected to hear of you again i think a young lady round here must have an interest in you mr ticehurst said he knowingly for only two days ago she called me out and asked more than particularly about you when i told her nobody knew enough to make a line in 'local items' unless they said 'nothing has yet been heard' i reckon she was sorry who was it dave i asked carelessly was it miss fanny fleming no sir it was not it was miss fleming herself and i must say she's a daisy the best looking girl between the rocky mountains and the pacific gentlemen miss fanny is nice a pretty girl i will say but he stopped and winked so that i could hardly keep from throwing my glass at his carefully combed and oiled head but i was happy to think that elsie had asked after me in the morning we got horses from ned conlan and rode over to mr fleming's ranch which was situated in a long low valley that terminated a mile above his house in a narrow gulch down which the creek came on either side were high hills covered on their lower slopes with bunch grass and bull pines and higher up with thick scrub that ran at last into bare rock on the topmost peaks of which snow lay for nine months of the year as we approached the farm we saw a few of the cattle on the opposing slopes and on the near side of the valley were the farm buildings and the house itself which was partly hidden in trees we tied our horses to the fence and marched in as we fancied as bold as brass in appearance but if harmer felt half as uncomfortable as i did which i doubt i am sorry for him the first person we saw was fanny and the first thing she did was to upset her chair on the veranda on the top of a sleeping dog who at first howled and then made a rush at us barking loudly down di cried fanny how dare you o mr ticehurst how glad i am you're not dead and you too mr harmer though no one said you were oh where's father i wonder he'll be glad too and elsie will she be glad as well fanny i asked she looked at me slyly and nodded you'd better ask her i think here comes father he rode up on horseback followed by siwash jim swinging the noose of a lariat in his right hand as though he had been after horses or cattle oh it's you tom is it said fleming who was looking very well i'm glad you're not quite so dead as i was told and you harmer how are you jim take these gentlemen's horses to the stable you've come to stay for dinner of course i shan't let you go i heard you did very well gold gambling last fall come in for that news went down the country when we went to the landing for grub i followed wondering a little whether he would have been quite so effusive if i had done badly but i soon forgot that when i saw elsie who had just come out of her room i thought when i saw her that she was a little paler than when we had last met though perhaps that was due to the unaccustomed cold and the sunless winter but she more than ever merited the rough tribute which dave had paid her in conlan's bar she was very beautiful to them but how much more to me as she came up a little shyly and shook hands softly saying that she was glad that the bad news they had heard of me was not true i fancied that she had thought of me often during that winter and perhaps had seen she had been unjust at any rate there was a great difference between what she was then and what she was now we talked during dinner about the winter which the three australians almost cursed in fact the father did curse it very admirably while elsie hardly reproved his strong language so much did she feel that forty degrees below zero merited all the opprobrium that could be cast on it i described our gold mining adventures and the winter's trapping which by the way had added five hundred dollars to my other money i told fleming that i was now worth with some i still had at home more than five thousand dollars and i could see it gave him satisfaction what do you think of the country now mr fleming i asked and how long shall you stay here he shook his head i don't know my boy he answered i think in spite of the cold we shall have to stand another winter here this summer i must rebuild the barns and stables there are still a lot of cattle adrift somewhere and i won't sell out under a certain sum that's business you know and i have just a little about me though i am an old fool at times when the girls want their own way what would you advise me to do said i hoping he would give me some advice which i could flatter him by taking you see when one has so much money it is only the correct thing to make more of it the question is how to do it that's quite right ticehurst quite right said he energetically i'm glad you talk like that your head's screwed on right you will be well in yet an australian phrase for our well off i'll bet on that well you can open a store or go lumbering or gold mining or hunting or raise cattle like me i pretended to reflect though i nearly laughed at catching harmer's eye for he knew quite well what i wanted to do yes mr fleming you're right that's nearly all one can do but as to keeping a store you see i've been so accustomed to an open air life i don't think it would suit me besides a big man like me ought to do something else than sell trousers as to gold mining i've done that and been lucky once which in such a gambling game is against me and hunting or trapping well there's nothing great in that i think i should prefer cattle raising if i could do it i was brought up on a farm in england and why shouldn't i die on one in british columbia or and i looked at elsie in australia quite right tom said fanny laughing for she was too cute to miss seeing what i meant mr fleming looked at me approvingly you'll die worth a lot yet tom ticehurst i like your spirit i was just the same once now i'll tell you what did you ever see george nettlebury at the forks no i replied not that i know of i dare say you have said he he's mostly drunk and indian alice who is always with him usually has a black eye as a gentle reminder that she belongs to an inferior race if she is his wife now he lives about two miles from here over yonder he pointed over the valley he has a house a very dirty one now it is true a stable and a piece of meadow fenced in where he could raise good hay if he would mend the fence and keep other folks' cattle out he told me the other day that he was sick to death of this place and he wants just enough to go east with and return to his old trade of shipbuilding he says he will take for the whole place with what is on it that don't amount to much two cows one old steer and a cayuse he rides round on if you like we'll go over and see him you can buy it and buy some more cattle and if you have more next winter than you can feed i'll let you have the hay cheap what do you say my heart leapt up but i pretended i wanted time to think about it then let's ride over now and you can look at the place said he rising harmer would not come so i left him with the sisters when we returned i was the owner of the house stable two cows etc and george nettlebury was fighting with indian alice to whom he had announced his intention of going east at once and without her i'm tired of this life it's quite disgusting said george as we departed i'm glad you came mr ticehurst for i'm off too quick as we rode back to thomson forks harmer asked pathetically what he was to do we must see jack i answered kindly we'll get you something in town i'd rather be with you he answered dolorously well you can't yet that's certain said i i can't afford to pay you wages when there will be no more than i can get through myself when there is i'll let you know in the meantime you must make money jack there's a sawmill in town i know the man that runs it bill custer and i'll go and see him for you jack sighed and we rode on in silence until we reached the forks after we had had supper jack and i were standing in the barroom not near the stove which was surrounded by a small crowd of men who smoked and chewed and chattered but close by the door for the sake of the fresher air when we saw siwash jim ride up after tying his horse to the rail in front of the house to which half a dozen other animals in various stages of equine despondency or irritation were already attached he swaggered into the bar brushing against me rather rudely as he did so harmer's eyes flashed with indignation as if it was he who had been insulted but i am a very peaceable man and don't always fight at the first chance besides being so much bigger than jim i could i considered afford to take no notice of what an ill conditioned little ruffian like that did when he was probably drunk presently jack spoke to me that beastly fellow keeps looking at you mr ticehurst as if he would like to cut your throat what's wrong with him is he jealous of you do you think it was almost blasphemy to dream of such a thing and i looked at mr john harmer so sternly that he apologized yet i believe it must to some extent have been that which caused the trouble that ensued almost directly and added afterward to the danger in which i already stood i turned round and looked at jim who returned my glance furiously he ordered another drink and then another it seemed as if he was desirous of making himself drunk presently dave who was as usual behind the bar spoke to him going back to the ranch to night jim jim struck the bar hard with his fist no i'm not never unless i go to set the damned place on fire why what's the matter asked dave smiling while harmer and i pricked up our ears ah i had some trouble with old fleming just now said jim in a hoarse voice of passion he's like the rest wants too much the more one does the more one may do he's a dirty coyote and his girls are and the gentle minded jim used an epithet which made both our ears tingle jack made a spring but i caught him by the shoulder and sent him spinning back and walked up alongside the men i saw my own face in the glass at the back of the bar it was very white and i could hardly recognize it mind what you say you infernal ruffian i said in a low voice or i'll break your neck for you don't you dare to speak about ladies you dog or i'll strangle you he sprang back like lightning if he had had a six shooter on him i think my story would have ended here for i had none myself but jim had no weapon yet he was no coward and did not take water or back down as they say there he steadied himself one moment and then threw the water bottle at me with all his force though i ducked i did not quite escape it for the handle caught me on the forehead near the hair and in breaking cut a gash which sent the blood down into my left eye but i caught hold of him before he could do anything else in a moment the room was in an uproar some of the men climbed on to the tables in order to get a view while those outside crowded to the door they roared leave 'em alone when dave attempted to approach and one big fellow caught hold of harmer and held him saying at the same time as jack told me afterward you stay right here sonny and see 'em fight mebbe you'll larn something i found jim a much tougher customer than i should have imagined although i might have handled him more easily if i had not been for the time blind in one eye but he was like a bunch of muscle his arms though slender were as tough and hard as his stock whip handle and his quickness was surprising he struck me once or twice as we grappled and then we fell rolling over and over and scattering the onlookers as we went until we came against the legs of the table which gave way and sent three men to the floor with a shock that shook the house finally jim got his hand in my hair and tried to gouge out my eyes fortunately it was not long enough for him to get a good hold but when i felt his thumbs feeling for my eyes all the strength and rage i ever had seemed to come to me and i rose suddenly with him clinging to me for a moment we swayed about and then i caught his throat pushed him at arm's length from me and catching hold of his belt i threw him right over my head i was standing with my back to the door and he went through it fell on the sidewalk and rolled off into the road where he lay insensible very good said dave very well done indeed pick him up some of you fellows and see if he's dead the son of a gun i'll make him pay for that bottle and for the table come have a drink mr ticehurst you look rather warm i should think i did besides being smothered with blood and dust i was glad to accept his invitation is he dead i asked of harmer who came in just then not he said jack he's coming to already but i guess he'll fight no more for a few days that must have been a sickener by jove how strong you must be he went out of the door like a stone out of a sling lucky he didn't hit the post and harmer chuckled loudly and then went off with me to wash away the blood and bandage the cut in my forehead when i left town in the morning i heard that jim was still in bed and likely to stay there for some time and harmer who was going to work with bill custer promised to let me know if he heard anything which was of importance to me on my way out to my new property i met its late owner and his indian wife in their ricketty wagon drawn by the horse i had not thought worth buying nettlebury was more than half drunk although it was early in the morning and when he saw me coming he rose up waved his hand to me bellowed i'm a goin' east i am and falling over the seat backward disappeared from view alice reached out her hand and helped her husband to regain his former position i came up alongside and reined in my horse he looked at me been fightin' already hev you or did you get chucked off more likely you got chucked it takes an american to ride these cay uses said he half scornfully no said i i wasn't chucked and i have been fighting did you hear why siwash jim left fleming no not exactly he returned but he was sassy with miss elsie and oh i dunno but you hev been fightin' eh did you lick him and who was it the man himself mr nettlebury said i jim and i reckon i did whip him he laughed good on you old man he's been wanting it this long while past but look out he don't put a knife in your ribs now then said he ferociously turning to his wife why don't you drive on here catch hold and giving her the reins he lifted his hand to strike her but just then the old horse started up he fell over the seat again and lay there on a pile of sacking i hardly thought he would get east with his money and i was right for i hired him to work for me soon afterward when i came to the flemings' there was no one about but the old man busy said he you may bet i'm busy i sent that black ruffian off yesterday and i've got no one to help me what's the matter with your head when i told him he laughed heartily and then shook my hand i'm glad you thrashed him tom said he i'd have done it myself yesterday if i had been ten years younger when elsie wanted him to get some water he growled and said all klootchmen as he calls 'em women you know were alike indian or white and no good i told him to get out is he badly hurt not very i answered i hoped he was said the old man it's a pity you didn't break his neck i would as soon trust a black snake are you going over yonder i guess so i answered i must get the place cleaned up a bit it's like a pigsty or what they call a hog pen in this country well i guess it is he replied but come over in the evening if you like i thanked him and rode off happy in one thing at least i was near elsie i felt as if harmer's suspicions about mat were a mere chimera and that the lad in some excitement had mistaken the dark face of some harmless indian for that of the revengeful malay and as to siwash jim why i shrugged my shoulders i did not suppose he was so murderously inclined as nettlebury imagined it would be hard lines on me to have two men so ill disposed toward me through no fault of my own as to wish to kill me i went back to the flemings' after a hard day's work in which i burnt or otherwise disposed of an almost unparalleled collection of rubbish including old crockery and bottles dirty shirts and worn out boots which had been accumulating indoors and out for some ten years after being nearly smothered i was glad to go down to the creek and take a bath in the clear cold water which ran into the main watercourse issuing some two miles away from the black caon at the back of the valley concerning which fleming had once spoken to me that evening at his ranch was the pleasantest i ever spent in my life up to that time in spite of the black cloud which hung over me for fanny was as bright and happy as a bird while elsie who seemed to have come to her senses spoke almost freely displaying no more disinclination to me even apparently than might naturally be set down to her instinctive modesty and her knowledge that i was courting her and desired to be received as her lover i spoke to her late that evening when fleming went out to throw down the night's hay to his horses for fanny vanished discreetly at the same moment and continued to make just enough noise in the kitchen to assure us she was there while it was not sufficient to drown even the softest conversation good girl she was and is i love her yet though well perhaps i had better leave that unsaid at present elsie i said when we were alone do you remember what i said when we parted on the steamer she cast her eyes down but did not answer i think you do elsie i went on i said i should never forget do you think i have don't you know why i left my ship why i came to this country why i went mining and why i have worked so hard and patiently for long long months without seeing you answer me do you know why she hesitated a moment lifted up her blue eyes dropped them at the sight of the passion in mine and said gently i suppose so mr ticehurst yes you know elsie it was that i might be near you that i might get rich enough to be able to claim you how fortunate i have been in that but am i fortunate in other things too elsie will you answer me that elsie i approached her but she held up her hand stay mr ticehurst if i must speak i may have judged you wrongly but i am not wholly sure that i have if i have not i should only be preparing misery for myself and for you if i answered your questions as you would have me i want time and i must have it or some other assurance for how can i wholly trust you when you will not speak as you might do ah how could i but this was far better than i had expected far better elsie i answered quietly i am ready to give you time all the time you need to prove me and my love for you though there is no need my heart is yours and yours only ever from the time i saw you i have never even wavered in my faith and hope but i do not care so long as i may be near you so long as i may see you sometimes and speak to you for without you i shall be wretched and would be glad even if that wretched malay were to kill me as he threatened i thought i was cunning to bring in matthias and indeed she lifted her eyes then but she showed no signs of fear for me perhaps she looked at me saying to herself there was no need of such a strong man being afraid of such a visionary danger she spoke after a little silence then let it be so mr ticehurst if what you say be true there at least is nothing for you to fear she looked at me straight then with her glorious blue eyes and i would have given worlds to catch her in my arms and press her to my heart she went on and if you never give me cause why she was silent but held out her hand i took it pressed it and would have raised it to my lips only she drew it gently away but i went to rest happy that night give her cause indeed what cause could i give her that is what i asked myself without knowing what was coming without feeling my ignorance my blindness and my helplessness in the strange web of fate and fated crime which was being woven around me without being conscious as an animal is in the prairie of that storm so ready to burst on my head whose first faint clouds had risen on the horizon of my life even before i had seen her in the very hour that i had joined the vancouver under my own brother's command i went to sleep wondering vaguely what had become of him but we are blind all of us and see nothing until the curtain rises on act after act being ignorant still whether the end shall be sweet or bitter to us whether it shall justify our smiles in happiness or our tears in some bitter tragedy for two days i worked in and about my house putting things in some order and on the third i rode over to the flemings' early in the morning as it had been arranged that i was to go out with mr fleming to look after some cattle of his which a neighbor had complained of i never felt in better spirits than when i rode over the short two miles which separated us for the morning was calm and bright with a touch of that glorious freshness known only among mountains or on high plateaus lifted up from the common level of the under world i even sang softly to myself for the black cloud of doubt which but a few days ago had obscured all my light was driven away by a new dawning of hope and i was content and without fear i shouted cheerfully for fleming as i rode up and he came to the door with his whip over his arm followed by the two girls i alighted and shook hands all round then you are ready mr fleming i asked when i have put the saddle on the black horse he replied as he went toward the stable leaving me standing there for i was little inclined to offer to assist him while elsie remained outside the house fanny was quite as mischievous as ever and whether her sister had told her anything of what had passed between us two days before or not she was evidently conscious that the relations between elsie and myself had somehow altered for the better how do you find yourself these days tom she asked with a merry twinkle in her eye very well fanny i answered thanks for your inquiry does the climate suit you then or is it the surroundings both my dear girl as long as the sun shines on us i replied laughing while elsie turned away with a smile fanny almost winked at me and then looked up the road toward thomson forks which ran close by the ranch and led toward an indian settlement on the lake about ten miles away there's someone coming she said and he's in a hurry isn't he galloping mr ticehurst i looked up the road and saw somebody who certainly was coming down the long slope from the crest of the hill with more than reasonable rapidity i looked and then turned away carelessly what was the horseman to me i leant against the post of the veranda which some former occupant of the house had ornamented by whittling with his knife until it was almost too thin to do its duty and began to speak to fanny again when i saw her blush and start why mr ticehurst she said it's mr harmer then the horseman was something to me after all for what but some urgent need would bring jack who was entirely ignorant of horses and riding at that breakneck gallop over the mountain road my carelessness went suddenly and i felt my heart begin to beat with unaccustomed violence i turned pale i know as i watched him coming nearer i was quite unconscious that elsie had rejoined her sister and stood behind me harmer came closer and closer and when he saw us waved his hat in a moment he was at the gate while i stood still at the house and did not move to go toward him he alighted opened the gate and with his bridle over his aim came up to us he said good morning to the girls hurriedly and turned to me you must come to thomson forks directly mr ticehurst he said gasping wiping his forehead with his sleeve something's happened i don't know what and i can't tell but she wants to see you at once and sent me off to fetch you and so i came and oh how sore i am and he wriggled suggestively and in a way that would have been comic under other circumstances i caught hold of his arm what do you mean i roared you young fool what's happened and who wants to see me who's she he looked up in astonishment why didn't i say mrs ticehurst of course i let him go and fell against the post making it crack as i did so i looked at elsie and she was white and stern but she did not avoid my eye well what is it what's happened i said at last i don't know i tell you sir said he almost piteously all i know is that i was sent for to the sawmill by dave and when i came i saw mrs ticehurst and she's dressed in black sir and she looked dreadfully bad and she just shook hands with me and told me to fetch you at once and when i asked what for she just stamped sir and told me to go and so i came and that's all surely it was enough much as i liked her i would rather have met mat or the very devil in the way than had this happen now when things were going so well with me and in black good god had anything happened to my brother i turned white i know and almost fell you had better go at once tom laid fanny who held me by the arm i turned i hardly know why to her sister her face was very pale but her eyes glittered and she looked like marble i know my own asked hers a question but i got no response i turned away toward my horse and then she spoke mr ticehurst let me speak to you one moment fanny go and talk to mr harmer and fanny and i both obeyed her like children she looked at me straight how could i prove you mr ticehurst she said in a low voice was what i asked the other night now the means are in my power what are you going to do i am going to the forks i said in bewilderment her eyes flashed and she looked at me scornfully then go but don't ever speak to me again go and she turned away i caught her arm don't be unjust elsie don't be cruelly unjust i cried what a fool i was i knew she loved me and yet i asked her not to be cruel and unjust can a woman or a man in love be anything else how can i stay away i asked passionately when my brother's wife sends for me and she is in black poor will must be dead if he was dead then helen was free i saw that and so did elsie and it hardened her more than ever for she did not answer look then elsie i am going and you say i shall not speak to you again you are cruel very cruel but i love you and you shall speak to me aye and one day ask my pardon for doubting me but even for you i cannot refuse this request of my own sister in law who is ill alone in sorrow and trouble in a strange land for the present good by i turned away took my horse from the fence and rode off rapidly without thinking of harmer or of fleming who was standing in amazement at his stable as i saw when i opened the swing gate and if harmer had come up at a gallop i went at one until my horse was covered with sweat and the foam flying from his champed bit hung about my knees like sea foam that did not easily melt in half an hour i was at conlan's door and was received by dave in two minutes i stood in helen's presence when i saw her last she had that rich red complexion which showed the pure color of the blood through a delicate skin her eyes were piercing and perhaps a little hard and her figure was full and beautiful she had always rejoiced too in bright colors such as an oriental might have chosen and their richness had suited her striking appearance but now she was woefully altered and i barely knew her the color had deserted her cheeks which were wan and hollow her eyes were sunken and ringed with dark circles and her bust had fallen in until she looked like the ghost of her former self a ghost that was but a mere vague memory of her whom i had first known in melbourne her dress too was black which i knew she hated and in which she looked even less like herself her voice when she spoke no longer rang out with assurance but faltered ever and again with the tears that rose to her eyes and checked her utterance i took her hand full of pity for her and dread of what she had to tell me for it must be something dreadful which had changed her so much and brought her so far what is it helen i said in a low voice what did i come for you mean tom she asked though desiring no answer i came for your sake and not for will's i thought you might never get a letter and i wanted to see you once again ah how much i desired that tom you are in danger she spoke that suddenly in danger every moment for that man who threatened your life i nodded sucking my dry lips for i knew what she meant and i was only afraid of what else she had to tell me that man has escaped and has not been caught o tom be careful be careful if you were to die too what do you mean helen i asked though i knew full well what she meant she looked at me can't you think yes you can perhaps partly but not all not all the horror of it tom will is dead and not only that but he was murdered in san francisco i staggered and sat down staring at her she went on in a curiously constrained voice yes the very first night we came ashore and in our hotel he was intoxicated and came in late and i wouldn't have him in my room i made them put him in the next and i heard him shouting out of his window over the veranda soon afterward and then i fell asleep and in the morning i found him i myself found him dead in bed struck right through with a stab in the heart and he was robbed too tom it nearly killed me it was so horrible oh it was horrible i didn't know what to do i was going to send for you and then i read in the paper about mat having escaped two days before so i came away at once she ceased and sobbed violently and i kept silence god alone knows what was in my heart and how it came there but for a moment yes and for more than that i suspected her his wife of my brother's murder i was blind enough i suppose and so was she but then so many times in life we wonder suddenly at our want of sight when the truth comes out i remembered she had once said she hated him and could kill him and besides she loved me i shivered and was still silent she looked up and caught my eye which i knew was full of doubt she rose up suddenly came to me fell on her knees and cried no no tom not that for god's sake don't look at me so and i knew she saw my very heart and i was ashamed of myself i lifted her up and put her on a chair heavens how light she was to what she had been for her soul had wasted her body away like a strong wind fanning a fire poor will i said at last and then i asked if she had remained for the inquest no she had not she answered i started at her reply if i could think what i had what might others not do for her to disappear like that after the murder of her husband was enough to make people believe her guilty of the crime and i wondered that she had not been prevented from leaving but on questioning her further i learnt that the police suspected a certain man who was a frequenter of that very hotel and after the manner of their kind had got him in custody and were devoting all their attention to proving him guilty of the crime whether there were prima facie proofs or not still it seemed bitter that poor will should be left to strangers while his wife came to see me and though she had done it to save me as she thought yet after all the danger was hardly such as to warrant her acting as she had done but i was not the person to blame her she had done it poor woman because she yet loved me as i knew even then but i saw too that it was love without hope and even if it had not been she must have learnt that i was near to elsie and that i was courting old fleming's gal was the common talk whenever my name was mentioned i tried to convince myself that she had most likely ceased to think of me and i preferred to believe it was only the daily and hourly irritation of poor will's conduct which had driven her to compare me with him to his disadvantage well whatever his faults were they had been bitterly expiated as indeed such faults as his usually are it does not require statistics to convince anyone who has seen much of the world that most of the trouble in it comes directly from drink i was in a strange situation as i sat reflecting i suppose strict duty required me to go to san francisco and yet will would be buried before i could get there then what was i to do with his widow she could not stay there i could not allow it nor did i think she desired it still she was not fit to travel in her state of nervous exhaustion indeed it was a marvel that she had been able to come so far even under the stimulus of such unwonted excitement i could not go away with her even for a part of the return journey for i felt elsie would be harder and harder to manage the more she knew i saw of helen i ended by coming to the conclusion that she must stay at the forks for a while and that i must go back and try to have an explanation with elsie helen bowed her head in acquiescence when i told her what she had better do for the poor woman was utterly broken down and ready to lean on any arm that was offered her and she who had been so strong in her own will was at last content to be advised like an obedient child i left her with mrs conlan to whom i told as much as i thought desirable and kissing her on the forehead i took my horse and rode slowly toward home as i left the town i saw siwash jim sitting on the sidewalk and he looked at me with a face full of diabolical hatred when i got to the crest of the hill above the town i turned in the saddle and saw him still gazing after me when half way home i met harmer who was riding even slower than i and sitting as gingerly in the saddle as if he were very uncomfortable as i had no doubt he was well mr ticehurst said he eagerly when we came near what was it i told him and he looked puzzled well he remarked at last it seems to me i must have been mistaken after all and that i didn't see mat when i thought i did let me see when did he escape i reckoned it up and it was only twelve days ago for helen had taken nine days coming from san francisco according to what she told me then it is impossible for me to have seen him in new westminster said harmer but it is very strange that i should have imagined i did see him and that he did escape after all then i told him of my brother's death why mr ticehurst he exclaimed matthias must have done it himself he must don't you see he must the thought had not entered into my head no said i i don't see it at all there's a man in custody for it now and it is hardly likely mat would stay in san francisco if he escaped for two days besides it is even less likely that he would fall across my brother the very first evening he came ashore harmer shook his head obstinately we shall see sir we shall see you know he didn't like captain ticehurst much better than you then you say he was robbed of his papers was your address among them do you think i started for jack's suspicion seemed possible after all the thing looked more likely than it had done at first sight and yet it was only my cowardice that made me think so i shook my head but answered yes to his question then pray mr ticehurst be careful said jack earnestly and carry your revolver always besides that fellow jim is about again you hardly hurt him at all he must be made of iron and i heard last night he threatened to have your life threatened men live long jack said i i am not scared of him that's only talk and blow i don't care much if mat doesn't get on my track he would be dangerous did you see miss fleming before you left i said turning the conversation he shook his head she had gone to her room and remained there when i went away well harmer i shall be in town the day after to morrow i said at last and if anything happens you can send me word and go and see mrs ticehurst meanwhile i will do that said he but to morrow morning i have to go up the lake to the logging camp and don't know when i shall be back that's what custer said this morning when i asked him to let me come over here very well it won't matter i dare say i answered take care of yourself jack oh mr ticehurst said he turning round in the saddle and wincing as he did so it is you who must be careful pray do be very careful i nodded shook hands and rode on when i came to the flemings' fanny was at the big gate and she asked a question by her eyes before we got close enough to speak yes fanny said i it was serious and then i told her what had occurred she held out her hand and pressed mine sympathetically i am so sorry tom was all she said but she said it so kindly that her voice almost brought the tears to my eyes has elsie spoken to you since i went fanny i asked as we walked down to the house together while my horse followed with his head hanging down i haven't even seen her tom she replied the door was locked and when i knocked she told me to go away which as it's my room too was not very polite in spite of my love for elsie i felt somewhat bitter against her injustice to me and i was glad to see that i made her suffer a little on her part i know i have said very little about my own feelings for i don't care somehow to put down all that i felt any more than i like to tell any stranger all that is near my heart but i did feel strongly and deeply and to see her who was with me by day and night as the object of my fondest hope so unjust was enough to make me bitter i wished to reproach her for i was not a child a boy to be fooled with like this go and ask her to see me fanny please i said rather sternly as i stood outside the door and don't tell her anything of what i told you either of will or matthias fanny started you never said anything of matthias she cried didn't i fanny well then i will he has escaped from prison and i suppose he is after me by this but don't tell elsie just say i want to see her in a few moments she came back with tears in her eyes she won't tom she is in an obstinate fit i know and though she is crying her eyes out the spiteful cat she won't come i know her she just told me to go away what shall i do she asked nothing fanny i answered you can tell her what you like will you be so cruel to your lover little fanny she looked up saucily i don't know tom i shall see when i have one and she laughed what about jack harmer then well you see and she looked down he's very young she wasn't more than seventeen herself and looked younger and besides i don't care for anybody but elsie and father and you tom very well fanny said i give me a kiss from elsie and make her give it you back i will tom she said quite simply and kissing her i rode off quietly across the flat to my solitary home part v at the black caon now as far as i have gone in this story i have related nothing which i did not see or hear myself which is as it seems to me the proper way to do it provided nothing important is left out but as i have learnt since then what happened to other people and have pieced the story together in my mind i see it is necessary to depart from the rule i have observed hitherto if i don't want to explain after i have come to the end of the whole history what occurred before and that i can see would be a very clumsy way of narrating any affair now what i am going to tell i have on very good evidence for dave at the forks and conlan's stableman told me part and afterward as will be seen i actually learnt something from siwash jim himself who here plays rather a curious and important part it appears that the day after i was at the forks which day i spent by the way with mr fleming riding round the country returning afterward by the trail which led from the black caon down to my house siwash jim who had to all appearance recovered from the injuries which however were only bruises that i had inflicted on him began to drink early in the morning he had so dave says quite an unnatural power of keeping sober and dave himself can drink more than any two men i am acquainted with unless it is mac my old partner so he ought to know and though jim drank hard he did not become drunk but only abused me he called me all the names from coyote upward and downward which a british columbian of any standing has at his tongue's end and when jim had exhausted the resources of the fertile american language he started in siwash or indian in which there are many choice terms of abuse but in spite of his openness dave says it was quite evident he was dangerous and that i might really have been in peril at any time of the day if i had come to town for jim was deemed a bad character among his companions and had so it was said killed one man at least though he had never been tried for it but though he sat all day in the bar using my name openly he never made a move till eight in the evening when he went out for awhile when he returned he was accompanied by a thin dark man wearing a slouch hat over his eyes whom dave took to be a half breed of some kind and they had drinks together for which the stranger paid speaking in good english but not with a western accent then the two went to the other side of the room what their conversation was no one knows exactly nor did i ever learn but dave who was keeping his eye on jim says that it seemed as if the stranger was trying to persuade jim to be quiet and stay where he was and from what occurred afterward there is little doubt his supposition was correct moreover my name undoubtedly occurred in this conversation for dave heard it and the name of my ranch as well soon after that some men came in and in consequence of his being busy dave did not see jim go out but conlan's stableman says jim came to the stable with the stranger and got his horse when asked where he was going he said for a ride and would answer no more questions and all the time the strange man tried to persuade him not to go and to come and have another drink if jim had been flush of money there might have been a motive for this but as he was not there seemed then to be none beyond the sudden and absurd fondness that men sometimes conceive for each other when drunk but if this were the case it was only on the stranger's side for when the horse was brought round to the door jim mounted it and when the other man still importuned him not to go siwash jim struck at him with his left hand and knocked off his hat as he stood in the light coming from the bar and just then attention was drawn from jim by a sudden shriek from the other side of the road where conlan's private house stood when dave came out and looked for him again both he and the other man had disappeared down the road which branched about half a mile out of town into two forks one leading eastward and the other southward to the flemings' now as i said before most of that day i had been out riding with mr fleming who left me early in order to go to the next ranch down the road and i had told him the whole story about mat's escape and my brother's death which he agreed with me were hardly likely to be connected yet he acknowledged if they were i was in much more danger than one would have thought before because such a deed would show the malay was a desperado of the most fearless and dangerous description and besides if he had robbed will it was more than likely he knew where i was from my own letters or from my address written in a pocketbook my brother always carried and which was missing of course this conversation made me full as it were of mat and that combined with the unlucky turn affairs had taken with regard to elsie made me more nervous than i was inclined to acknowledge to her father so before i went to bed which i did at ten o'clock for i was very tired being still unaccustomed to much riding i locked my door carefully and put the table against it neither of which things i had ever done before and which i was almost inclined to undo at once for it seemed cowardly to me yet i thought of elsie and still hoping to win her i was careful of my life i went to sleep in spite of my nervous preoccupation almost as soon as i lay down and i suppose i must have been asleep two hours before i woke out of a horrible dream i thought that i was on board ship in my own berth lying in the bunk and that mat was on my chest strangling me with his long lithe fingers and all the time i heard as i thought the sails flap as though the vessel had come up in the wind as i struggled and i did struggle desperately the blood seemed to go up into my head and eyes until i saw the fiend's face in a red light and then i woke the house was on fire and i was being suffocated as the flames worked in from the outside and made the scorching timbers crack again and again i sprang out of bed i had lain down with my trousers on and seeing at once there must be foul play for the house to catch fire on the outside and at the back too where i never went i drew on my boots snatched my revolver up and leapt at the front window through which i went with a crash uttering a loud cry as i did so for a piece of the glass cut my left arm deeply as i came to the ground i saw a horseman in front of me and by the light of the fire which had already mounted to the roof of the house i recognized siwash jim then whether it was that the horse he rode was frightened at the crash i made or not it suddenly bounded into the air turned sharp round and bolted into the brush just where the trail came down from the black caon as jim disappeared i fired but with no effect and that my shot was neither returned nor anticipated was i saw due to the fact that the villain had dropped his own six shooter probably at the first bound of his horse just where he had been standing i was in a blind fury of rage for such a cowardly and treacherous attack on an unoffending man's life seemed hardly credible to me and there my home was burning and it was no fault of his that i was not burning with it or shot dead outside my own door but he should not escape if i chased him for a month i was glad he had been forced to take the trail for there was no possible outlet to it for miles so thick was the brush in that mountainous region fortunately i now had two horses and the one in my stable which i had only bought from fleming a week before was not the one i had been riding all that day i threw the saddle on him clinched it up tightly and led him out i carried both the weapons my own and jim's and i rode up the narrow and winding path in a blind and desperate fury which seldom comes to a man but it when it does it makes him careless of his own life and utterly reckless and as i rode in a fashion i had never done before even though i trusted a mountain bred and forest trained horse i swore that i myself should die that night or that siwash jim should feel the just weight of my wrath but before i can tell the terrible story of that terrible night i must return once more and for the last time to thomson forks i said some pages back that attention had been drawn from siwash jim and his strange companion by a sudden shriek from ned conlan's house that shriek had been uttered by helen who was still staying with mrs conlan as she and her hostess were standing outside in the dying twilight and after screaming she had fainted remaining insensible for nearly half an hour when dr smith as he called himself though an englishman has natural doubts as to how the practitioners in the west earn their diplomas had helped her recovery she spoke at once in a state of nervous excitement painful to witness oh i saw him i saw him she said in an hysterical voice who my dear asked mrs conlan in what people call a comforting way where is mr conlan was helen's answer he came into the room in which she was lying helen turned to him at once mr conlan i want you to take me out to my brother in law's house to mr ticehurst's farm they all exclaimed against her foolishness and demanded why while conlan scratched his head in a puzzled manner i tell you i must see him to night and at once for i saw the man who swore to kill him the bystanders shook their heads sagely thinking she was mad but conlan asked if she meant siwash jim no she said it was not jim but she must go and she would with an extraordinary exhibition of strength she rose and ordered horses in an imperative tone saying she was quite well enough to do as she liked mrs conlan appealed to the doctor and he perhaps being glad to advise against the opinion of those present as such a course might indicate his superior knowledge said he thought it best to let her have her own way i think too that helen who seemed to have regained her strength had regained with it her old power of making people do as she wished at any rate mr conlan meekly acquiesced and saying he would drive her himself went out to order horses at once when the buggy was brought to the door helen got up without assistance and begged him to be quick his wife who would never have dared to even suggest his hurrying stood aghast at seeing her usually masterful husband do as he was bid they drove off leaving mrs conlan to prophesy certain death as the result of this inexplicable expedition while the others speculated more or less wildly as to what it all meant conlan told me that helen never spoke all the way except to ask how much longer they were going to be or to complain of the slowness of the pace most women said ned would have been scared at the way i drove for it was pitch dark and if the horses hadn't known the road as well or better than i did we should have come to grief in the first mile but she never turned a hair she was a wonderful woman sir it was already past eleven o'clock when they got to the top of the hill just above fleming's and from there the light of my house burning could be distinctly seen although the place itself was hidden by a rise and helen pointed to it nervously demanding what it was ticehurst must have been burning brush said conlan offering the very likeliest explanation but helen said no no impatiently and told him to hurry just then conlan remembered that he did not know the road across from fleming's to my place and said so you had better stop at fleming's and send for him they aint in bed yet ma'am i see their light i don't want to see the flemings i want mr ticehurst said helen obstinately well we must stop at fleming's said conlan if it's only to ask the way i don't know the road and i'm not going to kill you and myself by driving into the creek such a night as this and helen was fain to acquiesce for she could not do otherwise when they reached the house fanny was standing outside and as the light from the open door fell on helen's pallid face she screamed good heavens mrs ticehurst is it you she cried and you mr conlan oh i am so glad father's away and mr ticehurst's house must be on fire ah said helen i thought so oh oh he's dead i know he's dead i must go to him fanny dear can you show us the way can you you must perhaps we can save him yet she frightened fanny terribly for her face was so pale and her eyes glittered so and for a moment the girl could hardly speak i don't know it by night mrs ticehurst but elsie does she said at last where is she then said helen eagerly she's gone over there now cried fanny for father had not come home and when we saw the fire we were afraid something had happened so elsie took the black horse and went over she's there now then what shall we do cried helen in an agony he will be killed what is it mrs ticehurst asked fanny trembling all over oh what is it but she took no notice and sat like a statue only she breathed hard and heavily and her hands twitched as she looked toward my burning home silence she cried suddenly though no one spoke there is somebody coming and the three of them looked into the darkness in which there was a white figure moving rapidly it is elsie screamed fanny joyfully and helen sprang from the buggy and stood in the light as elsie exclaimed in wonder at fanny's excited voice the two women stood face to face looking in each other's eyes and then elsie who for one moment had shown nothing but surprise went white with scorn and anger how glad i should have been to have seen her so or to have learnt even at that moment when i stood in the greatest peril i have ever known that she had ridden over to save or help me even though her acts but added a greater danger to those in which i already stood for her deed and her look were the deed and look of a woman who loves and is jealous but it might have seemed to me had i been there that helen's coming had overbalanced the scale once more against me and perhaps for the last time i am glad i did not know that fear until it was only imagination and the imaginary canceling of a series of events that could place me again in such a situation the two women looked at each other and then elsie turned away stop stop cried helen what has happened where is mr ticehurst what is that to you said elsie cruelly and with her eyes flaming tell us elsie said fanny imploringly i will not said her sister not to this woman go back mrs ticehurst what are you doing here helen caught her by the arm and looked in her face girl i know your thoughts she said but you are wrong i tell you you are wrong you love him i do not said elsie angrily i love no other woman's lover surely though there were two dazed onlookers these women were in a state to speak their natural minds girl girl said helen once more i tell you again you are wrong you are endangering your lover's life is he not your lover or did you go over there to find out nothing i tell you i came to save him and to save him for you no not for you you are not worth it though he thinks you perfection you are a wicked girl and a fool come come why don't you speak what has become of him is he over there now elsie was silent but yielding fanny spoke again elsie elsie speak answer her what happened over there and where is the horse elsie turned to her as though disdaining to answer helen someone set his house on fire i think perhaps it was jim and mr ticehurst has gone after him ah said helen as if relieved if that is all how did you know he is gone did you see him speak to him no said elsie i did not then how do you know cried fanny and helen together there was a man there helen cried out as if she were struck and elsie paused go on the other cried go on and when i came up he was sitting by the house i asked him if mr ticehurst was there oh you fool groaned helen but only fanny heard it and he got up continued elsie and said there was no one there but just as he was coming from his camp to see what the fire was he heard a shot and when he got to the house he saw somebody just disappear up the trail toward the caon did you know him said helen as elsie paused to take breath for when she began to speak she spoke rapidly and conceal it as she would it was evident she was in a fearful state of excitement no said elsie but i think i have seen him before where is he then cried helen holding her hand to her heart is he there still no cried fanny almost joyfully you gave him your horse to go and find tom and help him didn't you elsie and helen screamed out in a terrible voice no no you did not you did not say you did not girl elsie who had turned whiter and whiter turned to her suddenly yes i did she cried i did give him the horse helen lifted her hands up over her head with an awful gesture of despair and fell on her knees catching hold of both the girls' dresses but she held up and spoke oh you wretched unhappy girl she cried what have you done what have you done to whom did you give the horse i know i know i saw him this very night the man who swore to be revenged on him if it were after a century the man who nearly killed him once and who has escaped from prison you have given him the means of killing your lover you have given tom ticehurst up to matthias to a murderer a murderer and she fell back and this time did not recover herself but lay insensible still holding the girls' dresses with as desperate a clutch as though she were keeping back from following me the man who was upon my track that terrible midnight but elsie stooped freed her dress and saying to fanny see to her see to her ran down to the stable again just as her father rode through the higher gate and as that girl who had known and ridden from her childhood was saddling the first one she came to in the stable i was riding hard and desperately in the dark not a quarter of a mile behind siwash jim the trail upon which we both were ran from my house straight up into the mountains for nearly ten miles and then followed the verge of the black caon for more than a mile farther when i came up to that place i stayed for one moment and heard the dull and sullen roar of the broken waters three hundred feet beneath me and then i rode on again as though i was as irresistibly impelled as they were and was just as bound to cut my way through what fate had placed before as they had been to carve that narrow and tremendous chasm in the living rock and at last i came to a fork in the trail if i had not been there before with mr fleming i should most likely have never seen jim that night perhaps never again but we had stayed at that very spot the left hand fork was the main track and led right over the mountains into the nicola valley while the left and disused one which was partially obliterated by thick growing weeds led back through the impassable scrub and rough rocks to the middle of the black caon i had passed that end of it without thinking for indeed it was scarcely likely he would have turned off there the chances seemed a thousand to one that jim would take the left hand path but just because it did seem so certain i alighted from my horse and struck a light the latest horse track led to the right hand he had relied on my taking the widest path and continuing in it until it was too late to catch a man who had so skillfully doubled on me i had no doubt that his curses at losing his revolver were changed into chuckles as he thought of me riding headlong in the night until my horse was exhausted while he was returning the way i had come i stopped to think and then getting on my horse i rode back slowly to where the trails joined at the edge of the caon i would wait for him there and i waited more than half an hour it is strange how such little circumstances alter everything for not only would jim's following the nicola trail have resulted in something very different but waiting half an hour during which i cooled somewhat and lost the first blind rage of passion in which i had set out set me reflecting as to what i should do if i had come up with him at full gallop i should have shot him there and then he would have expected it and it would have been just vengeance but now i was quietly waiting for him and to shoot him when he appeared seemed to me hardly less cowardly conduct than his own then if i gave him warning he would probably escape me and i was not so generous as to let him have the chance yet in after years seeing all that followed from what i did i think i was more generous than just i ought to have regarded myself as the avenging arm of the law and have struck as coolly as an executioner but i determined to give him a chance for his life though giving him that was risking my own which i held dear if only for elsie's sake and so i backed my horse into the brush where i commanded both trails and cocking both revolvers i sat waiting in half an hour i heard the tramp of a horse though at first i could not tell from which way the sound came but at last i saw that i had been right in my conjecture and that my enemy was given into my hands my heart beat fast but my hands were steady for i had full command over myself i waited until he was nearly alongside of me and then i spoke throw up your hands siwash jim i said in a voice that rang out over the roar of the waters below us or you are a dead man and he threw them up and as he sat there i could see his horse was wearied out if it had not been perhaps my voice would have startled it and compelled me to fire what are you going to do said he sullenly peering in my direction for he could barely see me against my background of trees and brush whereas i had him against the sky i will tell you you miserable scoundrel i answered but first get off your horse and do it slowly or i will put two bullets through you mind me he dismounted slowly tie your horse to that sapling if you will be kind enough i said further and don't be in a hurry about it and don't attempt to get behind it or you know what will happen when he had done as i ordered i spoke again have you got any matches yes he replied of course you have you villain the same you set my house on fire with well now rake up some brush and make a little fire here what for said he quickly for i believe he thought for a moment i meant to roast him alive i undeceived him if that was his idea so that we can see each other i replied for i'm going to give you a chance for your life though you don't deserve it where's your six shooter i dropped it he grunted and i picked it up said i so make haste if you don't want to be killed with your own weapon what his thoughts were i can't say but without more words he set about making a fire soon having a vigorous blaze by which i saw plainly enough the looks of fear distrust and hatred he cast at me but he piled on the branches though i checked him once or twice when i thought he was going too far to gather them when there was sufficient light to illuminate the whole space about us and the opposing bank of the caon i told him that was enough that will do i said go and stand at the edge of the caon he hesitated you're not going to shoot me like a dog and put me down there are you said he trembling like a dog said i passionately did you not try to smother me like a bear in his den to burn me alive in my own house do as i tell you or i'll shoot you now and roll your body in the river go and he went as i asked him have you got any cartridges i demanded he pointed to his belt and growled that he had plenty then stay there and i will tell you what i will do with you i am going to empty your revolver and you can have it when it is empty i will get off my horse and then you can load it again and when i see you have filled it you can do your best for yourself do you hear me he nodded his head and kept his eyes fixed on me anxiously as though not daring to hope i was going to be so foolish as my word but i was even to the extent of firing his revolver into the air though i had no suspicion of what i was really doing nor what such an act would bring about i alighted from my horse and let him go for there was no danger of his running away i even struck him lightly and sent him up the trail out of the way of accident and then keeping my own revolver pointed at jim who stood like a statue i raised his in my left hand i fired and the reports rang out over the hills i threw siwash jim his weapon saying load the chambers slowly and count as you do so what a fool i was to be sure not to have shot him dead and let him lie though i should not have been free from the dangers that encompassed me yet they would have been fewer far fewer and more easily contended with but i acted as fate would have and even as i counted i heard jim count too in a strained hoarse voice one two three four five six and he was an armed man again armed in the light almost half way between us that glittered in his eyes and fell on my face and it was his life or mine his life that was worth nothing and mine that was precious with the possibilities of love that i yet knew not of love that was hurrying toward me even then side by side with hate and death when jim's weapon was loaded he turned toward me with the barrel pointed to the ground his eyes were fixed on mine fixed with a look of fear and hatred but hatred now predominated i lowered my own revolver until we both stood on equal terms look said i sternly you see that burning branch above the fire it is already half burnt through when it falls look out for yourself and he stood still perfectly still while behind and under him the flood in the caon fretted and roared menacingly angrily hungrily and the sappy branch cracked and cracked again it was bending bending slowly but not yet falling when jim threw his weapon up and fired treacherous to the last but his aim was not sure no surer than mine when i returned his shot as we both fired again i felt a sting in my left shoulder and the branch fell slowly slowly ah as slowly as jim did for he sank on his knees rolled over sideways and slipped backward on the verge of the caon its sloping treacherous verge and as he slipped he caught a long root disclosed by the falling earth and with the last strength of life hung on to it a yard below me as i ran to the edge and stopped there horror struck my desire for vengeance was satisfied more than satisfied for if i could have restored him to solid ground and life i would have done it and bidden him go his way so that i saw him no more for his face was ghastly and horrible to see his lips disclosed his teeth as he breathed through them convulsively and his nostrils were widely distended i knelt down and vainly reached out my hands but he was a yard below me and to go half that distance meant death for me as well i knelt there and saw him fail gradually his eyes closed and opened again and again he caught his lower lip between his teeth and bit it through and through and then his head fell back his hands relaxed and he was gone and i heard the sullen plunge of his body as it fell three hundred feet into the waters below i remained still and motionless for a moment what a thing man was that he should do such deeds i rose and a feeling of sorrow and remorse for this terrible death of a fellow creature made me stagger i put my hand to my brow and then peered over the edge of the caon what was i looking for was i looking into the river of fate i took my revolver and threw it into the caon that it should slay no other man as it fell it struck a projecting rock and exploding the echoes in the narrow space roared and thundered up the gorge toward the east where just beyond the mountains the first faint signs of rosy dawn were written upon the heavens was that an omen of peace and love to me of a fairer brighter day i lifted my heart above and prayed it might be so but it was yet night still dark and the darkest hour is before the dawn for as i turned my back to the caon and stepped across to the fire which had lighted poor foolish ignorant jim to his death i looked up and saw before me the thin face i feared more than all others and the wicked eyes of my escaped enemy matthias of the vancouver i have never believed myself a coward for i have faced death too often and but a few minutes ago i had risked my life in a manner which few men would have imitated but i confess that in the horrible surprise of that moment in the strange unexpectedness of this sudden and most unlooked for appearance i was stricken dumb and motionless and stood glaring at him with opened eyes while my heart's blood ran cold for i was unarmed by my own act of revulsion and remorse and wounded too for i could feel the blood trickle slowly from my shoulder that had been deeply scored by the second bullet from jim's revolver and i was in the same position that i had put him in in a clear space with thick brush on both sides through which there was no escape and in which there was no shelter but a single tree to the left of the blazing fire which was already gradually crawling in the dry brush surely i was delivered into my enemy's hands for he was armed and carried a revolver on whose bright barrel the fire glinted harshly how long we stood facing each other i cannot say but it seemed hours if he had but fired then he might have killed me at once for i was unable to move but he did not desire that i could see he did not as his hot eyes devoured me and gleamed with a light of savage joy and triumph he spoke at last and in a curiously quiet voice that was checked every now and again with a sort of sob which made me shiver ah mr ticehurst he said slowly you know me you look as if you did i am glad you feel like that you are afraid i looked at him and answered it is a lie and from that time forward it was a lie for i feared no more no he said i think not you are pale and just now you shook i don't shake even after what i have been through look at me he pointed his weapon at me and his hand was as steady as a rock he lowered it again and stroked the barrel softly with his lean left hand you remember what i said to you he went on don't you thomas ticehurst i do and i have kept my word ah i have thought of this many times many times they tortured me and treated me like a dog in the jail you sent me to they beat me and kicked me and starved me but i never complained lest my time there should be longer and when i lay down at night i thought of the time when i should kill you i knew it would come and it has but just now when i saw you by the side of your own grave looking down i didn't know whether it was you or the other man and i thought perhaps he had killed you if it had been he i would have killed him he paused and i still stood there with a flood of thoughts rushing through me what should i do if he had taken his eyes off mine for but one single moment i would have sprung on him but he did not and while he talked i heard the horses champing their bits in the brush and cruelest of all my own horse moved and put his head through the branches and looked at me oh if i were only on his back but i did not speak how shall i kill you said matthias at last i would like to cut you to pieces he paused again and then another horse that i had not yet seen moved on the other side of the trail where he had come up it had heard the others and i knew it must be the animal he had ridden it came out of the brush into the light of the fire and i knew it was elsie's my heart gave a tremendous leap and then stood still how had he become possessed of it i spoke and in a voice i could not recognize as my own so hoarse and terrible it was how did you get that white horse you villain i asked he looked at me fiercely without at first seeing how he could hurt me and then a look of beast like cruel cunning came into his eyes ah said he i knew her it was your girl's horse how did i get it perhaps you would like to know you will never see her again never where is she now where he knew as little as i did but the way he spoke and the horrible things he put into his voice made me boil with fury you are a lying dog i cried though he had said nothing that i should be so wrathful he grinned diabolically seeing how he had hurt me and then laughed loud in an insulting triumphant manner it was too much and i made one tremendous bound across the fire and landed within three feet of him he fired at the same moment and whether he had wounded me or not i did not know but the revolver went spinning two yards off and we grappled in a death hug i have said that siwash jim was a hard man to beat but whether it was that i was weak with my wound or not i found matthias who was mad with hate and fury the most terrible antagonist i had ever tackled he was as slippery as an eel as lithe as a snake and withal his grip was like that of a steel trap yet if i could but prevent him drawing his knife which was at his belt i did not care i was his match if not in agility at least in strength and i would never let him go we were for one moment still after we grappled and i trust i shall never see anything that looks more like a devil than his eyes in which the light of the fire shone while he gnashed his teeth and ground them until the foam and saliva oozed out of his mouth like a mad dog's venom his forehead was seamed and wrinkled his cheeks were sucked in and then blown out convulsively and his whole aspect was more hideous than that of a beast of prey and then the struggle began at first it was a trial of strength for although i was so much the bigger he knew his own power and the force of his iron nerves and he hoped to overcome me thus we reeled to and fro and twice went through the fire where i once held him for an instant with a malicious joy that was short lived for the pain added to his strength and he forced me backward until i struck the trunk of the tree a heavy blow then we swayed hither and thither for i had him by the right wrist and the left shoulder not daring to alter my grip on his right hand lest he should get his knife he held me in the same way and at last we came to the very verge of the caon and spurned the tracks that jim had made in his agony for a moment i thought he would throw us both in but he had not lost hope if he had that moment would have been my last in another second we had staggered to the fire and he tried all his strength to free his right hand at last by a sudden wrench he did it and dropped his fingers like lightning on his knife just as i bent his left wrist over and struck him in the face with his own clenched hand we both went down his knife ripped my shoulder by the very place that jim's bullet had struck and we rolled over and over madly and blindly burning ourselves on the scattered embers tearing ourselves on the jagged roots and small branches which we smashed as i strove to dash him on the ground and he struggled to free his arm which i had gripped above the elbow to end the battle at one blow but though he once drove the point more than an inch into the biceps and three times cut me deeply he did not injure any nerve so as to paralyse the limb and yet i felt that i was becoming insensible so tremendous was the strain and the excitement and i felt that i must make a last effort or die somehow we rose to our knees still grappling and if i looked a tithe as horrible as he did covered with blood saliva and sweat i must have been horrible to see we glared in each other's eyes for one moment and then loosing my hold on his left arm i caught his right wrist with both hands with his freed hand he struck me with all his remaining strength full in the face while i twisted his right wrist with a force that should have broken it but which only compelled him to relinquish the bloody piece of steel and then we rolled over again and lay locked in each other's arms there was a moment's truce for human nature could not stand the strain but i think he believed i was beaten and at his mercy for he was on top of me lying half across my breast with his face not six inches from mine he spoke in a horrible voice that shook with hate and pain and triumph i've got you now and i'll kill you as i did your brother great god then it was he who had done it after all better had it been for him to have held his peace for that word roused me again as nothing else could have done and i caught his throat with both hands though he struck me viciously i held him as he lay on top of me and saw him die then i knew no more for a little while and as i lay there insensible i still bled what was it that called me to myself whether it was that my soul had gone out to meet someone and returned in triumph for i awoke with a momentary feeling of gladness or whether it was an unconscious effort of the brain in the presence of a new and terrible danger i cannot say all i know is that when that spasm of joy passed i felt weak and unable to move under the weight of matthias whose protruding eyes and tongue mocked at me hideously in death as though his revenge was even now being accomplished and i saw the fiery brush creeping across the space that lay between me and the fire jim had kindled at my bidding was i to die by fire at the last when that horrible night was passing and the dawn was already breaking on the eastern horizon for i could not stir my limbs were like lead my heart beat feebly and my feet were cold i lay glaring at the fire and as i did so i saw that the revolver i had struck out of matthias's hand was lying as far from the fire as the fire was from me how is it that there is such a clear intellect at times in the very presence of death i saw then that the shots i had fired from that weapon had brought my enemy up just in time for otherwise he might have been wearied out or lost and now i thought if i could only get to it to fire it i might thus bring help for what enemies had i left now save the crawling fire i might even bring elsie but then how did the dead villain who lay across me choking me still get her horse and what had happened to her in his hands i tried to scream and i sighed as softly as the vague wind which was impelling the slow fires toward me how near they came how near and nearer yet like serpents rearing their heads spitting viciously as they came and then i thought how slow they were why did they not come and end it at once and let me die and i looked at the fires again they were within two feet of me i could feel the heat and within eighteen inches of the revolver i was glad and watched it feverishly but then the weapon's muzzle was pointed almost at me suppose it exploded and shot me dead as it called for help how strange it was i put up my hands feebly and tried to move the dead body so as to screen myself i might as well have tried to uproot a tree for i could barely move my hands i looked at the fire again as it crawled on and on now wavering now staying one moment to lift up its thousand little crests and vicious eyes and then stooping to lick up the grass and the dried brush on which i lay but as i glared at it intently at last it reached the weapon and coiled round it triumphantly as though that had been its goal licking it round and round would the flames heat the cartridges enough and if they did where would the bullets go i asked that deliriously for i was in a fever and instead of being cold at heart the blood ran through me like fire i thought i began to feel the fire that was so close to me i heard the explosion of the heated weapon i was yet alive come elsie come if you are not dead come and save me come i thought i cried out loudly but not even her ear that heard a sharper sound afar could have caught that once more and once again the cartridges fired and i heard a crash saw a horse burst like a flame through the black brush and there was a white thing before my eyes i looked up and saw elsie my own true love after all and then i fainted dead away and did not recover until long long after i ask myself sometimes even now when those hours that were burnt into my soul return to my sight like an old brand coming out on the healed flesh when it is struck sudden and sharply whether after all my enemy had been balked of his revenge to die one death and go into oblivion is the lot of all who face the rising sun and after a while veil their eyes when its last fires sink in the western sea but i suffered ten thousand deaths by violence by cruel ambush and torture by crawling flames and flashing knives in the interval between my rescue and my recovery from the fever that my wounds and the horror of it all brought upon me they told me elsie herself told me that i lay raving only ten days but it seemed incredible to me as i shook my head in a vague disbelief that made them fear for my reason if i had been in the care of strangers who were unfamiliar to me i might have thought myself a worn out relic of some dead and buried era whose monuments had crumbled slowly to ashes in the very fires through which my soul had passed shrieking for the forgetful dead i had loved but though i saw her only vaguely like a spirit in clouds or knew her without sight as i lay half unconscious as a beneficent presence only i grew gradually to feel that elsie who still lived after the centuries of my delirium loved me with the passion i had felt for her i say had felt for i was like a child and my desire for her was scarcely more than a pathetic longing for tenderness of thought and touch until the great strength which had been my pride returned in a flood and brought passion with it once more how strangely that came to pass which i had foretold in my last talk with elsie i had said angrily for i was angered that she should one day speak to me though she swore she would not and that she should implore my pardon and she did it she who had been so strong and self contained in the meekest and dearest way the thoughts of a maiden could devise and then she asked me if i would marry her would i marry her i stared at her in astonishment not at her asking for it seemed the most natural thing in the world for her to do but at the idiocy of the question i do believe you love me elsie i said at last for i have heard that love makes the most sensible people quite stupid if you were in your right senses dear you would not have asked it i should think not indeed she broke in but she smiled tenderly because you know very well that i settled that long enough ago on board the vancouver i said stoutly then i had no voice in it elsie said not the least i assure you i made up my mind and so did i said elsie softly what do you mean dear she leant her head against my shoulder and against my big beard and whispered i made up my mind dear tom that if you didn't love me i would never love anyone else but go and be a nun or a nurse all my life and that's why i was so hard you know yes i knew that well enough and where was helen meantime i am drawing so near the end of my story that i must say what i have to in a few words she had remained at the ranch until the doctor had declared i was going to recover it was no fault of his that i did and then she went away what she told elsie i have never known nor shall i ever ask but they parted good friends yes the best of friends and she returned home to melbourne i never saw her again at least not to my knowledge although once when elsie and i were both in that city for i returned to my profession i thought nay for the moment i made sure that she had come to know of our presence there for elsie had presents of fruit and flowers almost every day she was at melbourne i part with her now with a strange regret and somehow i have never confessed to anyone that i was very vexed at her not waiting until i was well enough to recognize her before she went for you see she loved me but and this is the last the time came when i was able to go out with elsie and fanny and though we rode slowly it did not need rapid motion to exhilarate me when she was by my side as for fanny she used to lose us in the stupidest way just as if she had not been brought up in the bush and been able to follow a trail like a black fellow but when harmer came out on sundays it was we who lost them for fanny used to go off at full speed while jack who never got used to a horse for many months used to risk his neck to keep up with her then she used to annoy him at night by offering him the softest seat which he stoutly refused preferring to suffer untold tortures on a wooden stool rather than confess but i don't think they will ever imitate us who got married at last in the autumn at thomson forks i invited almost everyone i knew to the wedding and i made mac my chief man much to jack's disgust i would even have invited montana bill but he was lying in the hospital with a bullet in his shoulder while hank patterson could not come on account of the police wanting him for putting it there but half the population of the forks had bad headaches next day and if i didn't have to wear my right hand in a sling on account of the shaking it got it was because i was as strong as ever the only man who looked unhappy was mr fleming and he certainly had a right to be miserable considering that i had robbed him of his housekeeper leaving him to the tender mercies of flighty fanny and she was so vicious to poor jack that he actually dared to say to me that if elsie had the temper of her sister he was sorry for me and that it was a pity siwash jim and mat had made a mess of it when i rebuked him he said merrily he guessed it was a free country and not the poop of the vancouver so i let him alone being quite convinced then and i have never changed my opinion since though we have been married almost five years that elsie ticehurst is the best wife a man ever had and worth fighting for even against the world the end
