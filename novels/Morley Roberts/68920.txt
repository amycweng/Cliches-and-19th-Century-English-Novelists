printers to his majesty contents i the owner of the patriarch ii the order of the wooden gun iii captain balaam of the cormorant iv jackallalone v the mutinous conduct of mrs ryder vi the comedy of the oriana the owner of the patriarch if any one cares to look up the patriarch in lloyds list it will be discovered that the line given to her reads thus illustration patriarchs ship record and all these hieroglyphics mean something to the initiated of whom as a matter of fact there are more ashore than at sea but the main point is that the owner of her was t tyser and it matters very little whether she was built of heavier plating than the rules required or whether she was cemented or built under special survey or what not for t tyser otherwise mr thomas tyser was not only the owner of the patriarch but also the owner of a dozen other vessels all beginning with a p he was moreover the owner of a large block of land in the heart of melbourne he had several streets of which the biggest was tyser street se in london and his banking account was certainly of heavier metal than he had any personal use for he was a rough dog from the north country and in the course of half a centurys fight in london he came out topdog in his own line and was more or less of a millionaire and hes my uncle said geordie potts his sister was my mother and here i am before the stick in one of his old windjammers and gettin twopunten in this here patriarch of his and hang me if i believe the old bloke has another relative in the world its hard lines mates its hard lines dont you allow its hard lines it was sunday morning in the southeast trades and every sail was drawing like a bally droringmaster as geordie once said and the crowds of the patriarch were all fairly easy in their minds and ready for a discussion if so be you are is nevvy as you state said the port watch cautiously we allows its ard lines ive stated it frequent said geordie and its the truth the whole truth and nothin but it so help me dye think id claim to be old tysers sisters son if i wasnt id scorn to claim it any man would scorn to be tysers sisters son said the starboard watch hed scorn to be im unless e was for tysers a mean old dog aint e geordie geordie thanked his watchmates for backing him up so thats right chaps there s no meaner in the north of england or the south for that matter and the way this ships found is scandalous the grubs horrid said both watches and look at the gear said geordie everything ready to part a deal easier than my uncle is i never lays hold of a halliard but im thinking ill go on my back if i pulls heavy oh hes a fair scandal he considered the scandal soberly and with some sadness he might leave you some dibs geordie suggested his mate jack braby he might after all not a solitary dime said geordie him and me quarrelled because my father fought him in the street and i hit the old hunks with a bit of a brick because he got my dad down wot was the row about asked the others eagerly nothin to speak of said george my old man said he was a bloodsucker and that led to words and i never hurt him to speak of and yet ive shipped in one of his ships and am as poor as hes rich he allowed none of us would get a farthing he shouted it out in the marketplace and said hospitals would get it because when one of his skippers that hed sacked cut him up awful with a staysail hank they sewed him up very neat at one of em theres nothin so good in a fight as a staysail ank said jack braby contemplatively i cut a polisman all to rags wiv one once was that the time you done three months ard asked the port watch six said braby proudly and i told the beak i could do it on my ead but geordie if you was owner yourself what would you do yes wot asked the rest geordie shook his head and sighed id make my ships such that sailormen would be wanting to pay to go in em said geordie ive laid awake thinkin of it oh tell us said all hands with as much unanimity as if they were tailing on to the halliards under the stimulus of give us some time to blow the man down tell us geordie id be friends with all my men for one thing said geordie and id not have a single dutchman in a ship of mine the three dutchmen on boardone of whom was a swede another a german and the third a finnshifted uneasily on their chests but said nothing and not a dago continued the owner and id give double wages and grog three times a day and tobacco throwed in and the cook shouldnt be a hashspoiler but what frenchies calls a chef we never heard of that how dye spell it geordie s h e double f said geordie and it means a man that is known not to spoil vittles as most seacooks does by the very look of him and when it was wet or cold the galley fire should be alight all night and the skipper and the mates should be told by me and told very stern that if they vallied their billets a continental theyd behave like gents and not cuss too much and there shouldnt be no working up and any officer of mine that was dead on dry pulls on the halliards should have the sack quick and every time a ship of mine came into dock id be there and id see what the crowds opinion was of the skipper and the mates oh id make my ships a paradise i would most of the men nodded approval but braby wasnt quite satisfied and would there be grog every time of shortenin sail geordie oh of course said george and every time you made sail too but an old seaman shook his head tis mighty fine mates to ear geordie guff as to what ed do he growled but i aint young and ive seed men get rich and they wasnt in the least what they allowed theyd be geordie ere is one of hus now and e feels where the shoe pinches but if so be e got rotten with money ed be for callin sailormen swine as like as not and ed wear a topper youre a liar i wouldnt roared geordie maybe i am a liar said the old chap but ive seen what ive looked at if you was to learn as your huncle was dead now youd go aft and set about on the poop and see hus doin pulleyhauley with a seegar in your teeth riches spoils a man and it cant be helped it as to somehow ive no fault to find with you now geordie potts for so young a man youre a good seaman and a good shipmate though you ave called me a liar but you take my word for it money would make an og of you and here was matter for high debate which lasted all through the trades through the horse latitudes and into the region of the brave west winds till the patriarch had made more than half her easting so im to be a mean swab and a real swine when im rich said geordie eh well have it your own way theres times some of you makes me feel id like to make you sit up ear ear said the old focsleman theres the very thought of aughty richness workin in is mind shipmates whatll the real thing do if is huncle pegs out sudden it was curious to note that a certain subdued hostility rose up between most of the men and geordie they sat apart and discussed him even jack braby threw out dark and melancholy hints that they wouldnt be chums any more if old tysers money came to his nephew there were at times faint suggestions that geordie was getting touched with his possible prosperity ill live ashore and have a publichouse said geordie potts and they picked up cape otway light in due time and ran through port phillip heads by and by and came to an anchor off sandridge presently they berthed alongside the pier and began to discharge their cargo and one hot day went by like another till they were empty and began to fill up again with wool in six weeks they were almost ready for sea once more and the very night before they hauled out from their berth and lay at anchor in the bay geordie went ashore at six oclock all by his lonesome as he and jack braby had fought over the job which braby was to get from his mate when old tyser died intestate and as he got to the end of the pier he met a young clerk from the agents office who knew him by sight i say im in a great hurry said the boy my girls waiting for me will you take these letters to captain smith or ill miss my train back ill give you a bob right oh said geordie and he pouched the shilling and the letters and the young fellow ran for his train the letters can wait said geordie potts but the bob cant and ive five more besides jack might have had his whack out of it if he hadnt wanted to be my manager when he aint fit for it he put the letters into his pocket and made his way to the sandridge arms where he sat and drank by himself it was seven oclock and he was by then tolerably full before it occurred to him to see if he still had the letters he took them out and the very first his eyes lighted on was one in a long envelope addressed to george potts esq co captain smith patriarch blimy said geordie this cant be me esq is what they puts after names of gents even the skipper dont have it after his he fingered the long envelope and took another drink to consider the matter on holy sailor it must be me he said as he drew confidence out of his glass theres no other potts but me he was overfull by now and he opened the letter and began to read it my dear sir by the holy frost said geordie me my dear sir he went on reading my dear sirwe regret to inform you of the sudden death of your uncle mr thomas tyser on the th inst he left no will and you as the next of kin and the heiratlaw are entitled to all his real and personal estate which is as you are doubtless aware very large according to our present estimate it will amount to at least half a million sterling and as we have been his legal advisers for the last twenty years and know all his affairs we can assure you that with proper management of certain undertakings at present in our hands it may be much more than our estimate in order that you may return at once we enclose you a draft on the union bank of australia for and have instructed captain smith to give you your discharge which he will of course do at once we hope as we have been so long in the confidence of mr tyser that you will see no reason to complain of our care for your interestswe are my dear sir your obedient servants thomas wiggs co holy sailor said geordie and he stared aghast at a square piece of paper which he had reason to believe represented holy sailor what a pot o money he gasped and took another drink im the owner of the patriarch he said and grasping all the letters and his draft he rammed them down into the bottom of his inside breastpocket im the owner ofhicthehicpatriarch he came out of his corner and went to the bar gimme a drink an expensive drink one thatll cost five bob he demanded of the barman youd better have a bottle o brandy said the barman i wants the best this is hennessys fortystar brandy said the liar behind the bar theres no better in the world and geordie retreated with the bottle to his corner and took a long drink of a poisonous compound which contained as much insanity in it as a small lunatic asylum he came back to the bar presently and told the barman that he was a millionaire i own half newcastle and a lot of bourke street melbourne and a bakers dozen of ships and lumps of london said geordie lend me a thousand pounds till tomorrow said the barman i like youhicill do it said geordie and with that he fell headlong and forgot his wealth they dragged him outside on the verandah and let him lie in the cool of the evening he was picked up there two hours later by jack braby and some of the starboard watch and taken on board he let on he was a millionaire said the barman contemptuously braby shook his head ah hes liable to allow that when hes full sir said braby but that fatal bottle kept geordie potts wholly insensible till they were outside the heads again and on their way to england with the smoke of the tugboat far astern and presently the second mate mr brose who was a very rough sort of dog and had sweated his way up to his present exalted rank from that of a foremast hand hauled geordie out by the collar of his coat and had him brought to by means of a bucketful of nice basss strait water geordie gasped like a dying dolphin but came to rapidly ill teach you to get drunk you swab said brose take those wet things off and turn to and geordie obeyed like a child in the presence of force majeure oh lord ive a head he told his mates and it seems to me that i had a most extrornary dream wot did you dream of old cocklywax asked braby did you dream youd come in for old tysers money and geordie gasped selp me he murmured selp me did i dream he dropped his marlinspike as if it were redhot and made a break for the focsle and his wet coat now if so be i dreamed he said therell be nought in this pocket and if i didnt im jiggered he put his hand in and brought out a handful of damp and crushed letters and came out upon deck staggering mr brose saw him and was in his tracks like a fishhawk on a herringgull geordie saw him coming and stood openmouthed oh sir said geordie oh sir oh blazes said brose whats your damned shenanakin game get to work or ill have you soused till youre halfdead but geordie could explain nothing oh sir he stammered and held up his papers shaking them feebly and brose shook him anything but feebly so that geordies teeth chattered if you please sir he cried out at last if you please sir dont i owns her you owns wot demanded brose and the rest of the men edged as near as they dared hes drunk still said braby as brose shook his mate once more i owns the bally patriarch screamed geordie and all the rest of em and all my uncles richness and i wont be shook i wont and brose let him go youre mad said brose youre mad i aint roared geordie who was fast recovering from the shock i aint take these read em read em out let the skipper read em i owns the patriarch and the palermo and the proosian and the whole line the lawyers says so he put the lot of damp letters into mr broses hands and sat down on the spare topmast lashed under the rail theres letters for the captain ere said brose suspiciously ow did you get em twas a youngster from the office gave em me replied geordie and i took a drink first and there was one for me and it said so said i was the owner said it plain and when brose had read the opened letter he gasped too and went aft to see the skipper the rest of the watch gathered round geordie and spoke in awestruck whispers is it true geordie gospel said geordie its swore to they sends me two hundred quid in a paper show us said the starbowlines show us its in the paper the second greaser has said geordie its wrote pay george potts esq two hundred quid on the nail id never ave let brose ave it said braby like as not ell keep it then ill sack him said geordie firmly let him dare try to keep it and ill sack him and not pay him no wages this is a very strange game this is said braby i never eard tell of the likes did they put esk on your letter they done so said geordie ive seen uncles letters and they done so to him then it must be true said braby they ony puts esk on gents letters and williams the steward was observed coming forard scratching his head where the ell am i asked williams and wots the game im sent by the captain to say will mr potts step into the cabin they all looked at geordie mr pottswhy thats you geordie i spose it must be said the owner must i go mates of course cried braby but geordie fidgeted i could go in if we was painting of her cabin he murmured but to talk with the skipper that evidently disgruntled him tis your own cabin anyow said braby id walk in like a lord well i spose i must said geordie reluctantly and he went aft with williams and youre the owner asked williams geordie sighed so it seems stooard he admitted it beats the devil said williams so it does said geordie and the next moment he found himself announced as mr potts and he stood before the captain with his cap in his hand looking as if he was about to be put in irons for mutiny but as a matter of fact the old skipper was a deal more nervous than he was this seems all correct mr potts said smith does it sir asked geordie im very sorry sir but it aint my fault sir i never meantat least i never allowed my uncle would do it because my father sir said he was a bloodsucker and they fought and i hit uncle with a brick sir to make him let go of fathers beard ah yes to be sure said the captain nervously but im thinking what to do its a very anomalous situation for you to be here pottsmr potts i mean but geordie held up his hand id much rather be potts sir thanking you all the same i couldnt do it replied the skipper i was thinking that you might like me to put back to melbourne wot for sir demanded the owner so that you could go home in a p o boat said old smith thanking you kindly sir replied geordie id rather stay in the patriarch i dont like steamers and never did he had a vague notion that the skipper wanted him to go home before the mast in one then you wish me not to put back mr potts said smith id very much rather not sir replied geordie im very happy here sir and takin it all round the patriarchs a comfortable ship sir may i go forard now sir he made a step for the cabin door oh dear oh dear said old smith you mustnt you must have a berth here and be a passenger the skippers obvious nervousness was not without its effect upon the new owner for old smith knew that if he lost his present billet he was not likely to find another one and he had nothing saved to speak of so somehow and without knowing why geordie without being in the least disrespectful was more decided in his answer than he would have been if the old man had showed himself as hard and severe as usual not me said geordie not me sir i wouldnt and i couldnt id be that uncomfortableoh a passenger good lord no but bein owner you cant stay forard urged the skipper oh yes i can sir said geordie id prefer it smith sighed if you prefer it of course you must but if you change your mind youll let me know right i willsir said geordie the skipper walked with him to the cabin door and if you dont want to work mr potts i dare say we can get on without your services though we shall miss them he said anxiously i couldnt lie about and do nix replied geordie id die of it and away he went forard while the skipper and mr brose and mr ware waked out of his watch below to hear the extraordinary news discussed the situation and ave i to call im mr potts asked brose with a pathetic air of disgust i say so replied the skipper i cant afford brose as you know to lose this job and old tyser promised me a kind of marine superintendents billet when i left the patriarch and i dessay this young chap will act decent about it im damned said ware im damned and glad too that he aint in my watch this is hard lines on you mr brose if you please mr potts will you be so good has to be so kind has to be so hobliging has to go and overaul the gear on the main piped brose in furious mockery oh this is ard far from it said old smith you ought to be proud it aint every second mate has a millionaire owner in his watch but brose was sullen you mark me this josser wont do no ands turn that he dont like and forard the crowd said the same as a result for at least ten days geordie potts worked very well indeed but of course brose under the skippers orders gave him all the soft jobs that were going the second mate got into a mode of exaggerated courtesy which was almost painful be so good mister potts as to put a nice neat matthew walker on this ere laniard or mr potts please be kind enough to go aloft and stop that spillingline on the foretopsailyard to the jackstay and at mealtimes the port watch mimicked brose dear mr potts howner be so good as to heat this orrid ash without growling and presently when the weather began to get cold and the men brought out their cape horn pjackets and their mitts geordie commenced to growl a little i hates turnin out in the gravyeye watch worse and worse he said ive half a mind to let on im sick youd better go haft and tell the old man to ave the galleyfire kep alight all night said the crowd crossly but you dasnt i dast said geordie why i owns the bally galley you dasnt i will said geordie and next morning he went aft and touched his cap to the skipper and begged to be allowed to speak to him the galleyfire at night said smith oh certainly mr potts i never done it because it was against the horders of your late revered huncle sir he was as mean as mean said geordie i think i can afford the fire sir the fire was lighted and the crowd said geordie was the right sort and wot about the gear mr howner asked jack braby if i was you before it gets too rotten cold id have a real overaulin of things ill think of it said geordie and that very afternoon he tackled brose the gears tolerable rotten sir he began and the second greaser knew he was right and yet didnt like to say so he yearned to curse him and im thinkin said geordie it would be a good thing to get up new stuff and overhaul everything i risks my life every time i goes aloft the very reef earings would part if a schoolgirl yanked at em youd better speak to mr ware said brose choking and at eight bells geordie spoke to the chief officer who was quite as anxious as the skipper to keep his billet it shall be done mister potts said ware in the first watch that night geordie felt very tired and said so when it was eight bells in the middle watch he was still asleep or pretended to be rouse out howner said braby and he shook geordie up i feels tolerable ill said geordie i dont think i shall turn out he didnt and the rest of the port watch went on deck by themselves at the muster mr potts didnt answer to his name mr potts is hill sir said the obsequious watch e said e couldnt turn out i thought itd come soon said brose to himself and he went forard to the focsle are you very ill he asked drily i dont know quite how i feel said the owner but i thinks a little drop of brandy would do me good i wish i could poison it said brose under his voice this is most umiliatin to a man in the persition of an officer by noon geordie was well enough to sit on deck and smoke a pipe the old man came to see him wouldnt you like a berth aft now mr potts urged the skipper ill think about it captain said geordie and in the meantime i dont think ill turn to the skipper looked at brose we can dispense with mr pottss services for the time eh mr brose certingly said brose but he walked to the rail and spat into the great pacific from that time onward geordie did no work to speak of except to take his trick at the wheel and when they were south of the horn he decided to do that no longer if youll take my wheel for the rest of the passage ill double your wages he said to braby and braby jumped at the offer in the morning geordie went on the poop it was noticeable that he went up the weather poop ladder except in cases of hurry and emergency at sea such a thing is next door to gross insubordination i aint goin to take no more wheels said geordie and braby will take mine ive doubled his wages even old smith gasped as for brose he felt seasick for the first time since he first went down channel in an outwardbounder thirty years before ill make a note of it said the skipper they shortened sail in a devilish quick flurry of a gale out the southwest later in the day and as all the topsails were down on the cap at once it was jump and no mistake as an act of kindly condescension the owner went to the wheel and shoved away the dutchman there who was congratulating himself at not being on a topsailyard get aloft you dutch swab said geordie ill take her for you and mr ware bellowed like a bull for he had a fine foretopsailyard voice and when it was a real breeze his language rose with the seas and was fine and flowery vigorous and ornamental and magnificent while he was in the middle of a peroration which would have excited envy in cicero or burke or a barrister with no case he heard the owner shouting for a private interview with the steward had given geordie great confidence mr ware mr ware id be glad if youd cuss the men less i dont like it the chief officer collapsed as if he were a balloon with a hole in it and for the next minute he and the skipper engaged in an excited conversation i cant cant stand it said ware you must said old smith almost tearfully and ware did stand it but when the patriarch was shortened down and he left the deck he went below and swore very horribly for five minutes by any chronometer now i know what brose feels said ware ive a great sympathy for poor brose the owner ordered a tot for all hands when they came down from aloft and he called the cook aft and harangued him from the break of the poop now mr spoilgrub mind you cook better than youve been doin or ill have you ducked in a tub and set your mate to doin your work he turned to the skipper with a beaming smile in his blue eyes i can talk straight cant i cap he hiccupped blandly im thinkin ill lie down in the cabin and when the old man went below he found geordie dossing in his own sacred bunk the poor old chap went and sat in the cabin and put his head in his hands this is a most horrid experience he said mournfully i dont like howners on board i dont like em a bit but it was not only the afterguard who suffered geordie shifted his dunnage aft at last and though he left the skippers berth when he was sober he made himself very comfortable in the stewards and he loafed about all day on deck with his pipe in his mouth he began to look at the men with alien eyes i tell you theyre loafin said he to ware dont i know em they watches you like cats and when your eyes are off em they do nothin im payin em to work and im payin you to make em theres a leak somewhere and he addressed the crowd from the poop youre a lazy lot he said thats wot you are for two pins id cut the galleyfire and your afternoon watch below and next day he raised their wages a week later he cut them down again the skipper had a hard job to keep track of what the ship owed them i wish we was home groaned old smith oh hell be a hell of an owner ill murder him said brose wot did i tell you chaps about the orrid effecs of sudden richness in a man asked the old focsle man forard geordie potts was a good sort but mr george potts esquire is an oly terror e raises hus hup an cuts hus down like grass and it presently came about that the only time they had any peace was when geordie was very much intoxicated but when they got into the calms of capricorn on the home stretch to the north he developed a taste for gambling and made the old skipper sit up all night playing brag for huge sums of money i lends you the dibs and win or lose its all hunky for you said geordie he wrote out orders to pay the old man several thousand pounds and smith began to feel rich then geordie raked ware into the game at last even brose succumbed to the lure of i promises to pay mr brose five hundred on the nail and joined the gamble this is a dash comfortable ship said geordie whats a few thousands to me i dont mind losin stooard bring rum by the time they picked up the northeast trader old smith owed the owner ten thousand pounds ware was five thousand to the good and brose who had played poker in california was worth fifteen thousand in strange paper he began to dream of a row of houses with a publichouse at each end he and geordie grew quite thick and compared publichouse ideals im goin to buy a hotel said geordie theres one in trafalgar square london as ive in my mind ill fit up the bar till it fair blazes with golden bottles he borrowed the mates clothes and had a roaring time and then they came into the channel picked up a tug and went round the foreland into london river ill bet lawyers and so on will be down to meet me said geordie theyll be full up with gold to think of it and to think i hit my poor old uncle with a brick he mourned over his brutality he wasnt half a bad chap he said and i dont see what call my dad had to call him a bloodsucker after all they docked in the southwest dock and sure enough they had not been alongside their berth five minutes before old tysers usual london agent and a very legallooking person came on board let me interduce you to the new owner said the obsequious skipper as he led up geordie who had a smile on him large enough to cut a mainsail out of oh said the lawyer then this is mr potts thats me said geordie have you brought any money with you i owes mr ware five thousand and mr brose fifteen the lawyer smiled im afraid theres some mistake mr potts your uncle left a will after all geordies jaw dropped and so did wares but broses fell as falls the barometer in the centre of a cyclone and medid he leave me nothin roared geordie oh yes said the solicitor mr gray will you kindly give me that cashbox you are carrying and the agent handed him the cashbox he left you this said the lawyer and in this sealed envelope is the key and geordie grabbed the box eagerly its heavy he said its tolerable heavy and putting it on the rail he opened it with the key there was half a brick in it the order of the wooden gun bertie fortescue was twentythree he weighed twelve stone was rather fatter than he should have been and wore an eyeglass his father was good to him his mother spoiled him he had not been to a public school and had never had a thrashing in his life he believed in himself in clothes and money and imagined he was born to rule men he was trying it was for the first time in the steamship pilgrim of tons register owners fortescue and son of liverpool bound from new orleans to cape town with a cargo of mules and horses for the british government the pilgrim was three days out from the mixed mouths of the mississippi and already there was the devil to pay and no pitch hot

goin to come with us to manage these blighted orsekeepers i knewed cyclones would be nothing to the ructions that was in sight and look at the old man he appealed to his shipmates to look in their minds at the skipper and say what they thought of him wadd objected to captain scantleburys white hair to his meek manner to his way of walking which was a waddle to his religion to everything that was his sings ymns dont e said wadd scornfully preaches dont e and dont drink neither oh no reads the pilgrims progress a reglar childs book gahn its a logbook he wrote hisself about this packet said green as they sat in the focsle in the second dogwatch with the rest of the men listening youre an ignorant man green replied wadd id fair despise to argue with you about books owsever ere we are out to sea and the skipper and mates dunno where they are with this oly crowd of orsekeepers and dear young bertie walkin about among em with his revolver out and his eyes starin and usin delicate language to em theres trouble right ahead and hany moment there may be bloodshed for once a foremast growler hit the situation off to a t and no one else did except some of the mixed gathering who had shipped in the pilgrim one to every seventeen horses to look after them on their way to the war its almost peaceful nowsaid the skipper it was a great and blessed relief to send the carpenters ashore their hammering drove me mad how are you getting along with the horsekeepers mr fortescue bertie fortescue nodded drily ive got em to rights he said they see already they cant impose on me i let em see right off that i carried a revolver and meant to stand no nonsense with men of their class its no use being soft sawdery is it old scantlebury might be soft but he was not quite a fool or without experience i wouldnt be too hard on em mr fortescue he said anxiously theyre a very tough lot ill show em im tougher said bertie firmly as he stuck his eyeglass in his eye theyll not impose on me they respect me already i can see it the holy gang that respected him were shrieking forard at that very moment over mr herbert fortescue of messrs fortescue son for as it happened there were several humourists among them as well as several who ought to have been hanged and the jokers leavened the whole lump so that there was peace at present if the row was to come later hell said arizona bill did

job if they hadnt been moored so close for the pilgrims fifteen hundred mixed rakings and scrapings of texas included many able equine gymnasts many supremely skilled kickers many that looked for some

like battered fiddles some with rumps like ancient hatstands some were blind some walleyed some were fat and some thin some worth dollars others worth cents but all costing gold because the british empire was in the market shouting for horses and yelling ill take all youve got but if the horses were mixed brutes the men that looked after them were no less a marvellous collection of terrible uniques old bob wadd reckoned them up theres texans ere and some from arizona and half a dozen bleeding mexicans and three real dutchmen and two danes and a finn and some real spaniards and a oneeyed

bertie and these shinin gems out of the joolcase they calls noo orlans will be aving awful arguments on the main deck i smells trouble afar off like as i said afore from a gasworks or a candle factory the two mates said the same they said it to themselves they said it to the old man the first mate groaned to the second greaser and even to the third forder i opine there will be serious difficulties yet between this young fortescue and these horsekeepers mr white always opined it was as favourite a word with him as exploit is with a socialist orator or as transpire is with a thirdrate journalist i opine there will be serious difficulty repeated the chief would you mind sir if i told you my opinion of mr fortescue asked the second not in the least said mr white then i think hes the biggest ass i ever set eyes on said the disgusted forder and i hope some of that bally gang will take away that glass eye of his and his revolver and throw em both overboard i opine it would do him good said mr white pensively im darn well sure it would sir said forder i could have put up with old mr fortescue though i never knew any good come from havin owners on board but his son and heir gives me the hump its bad enough havin a cargo of horses and worse havin these pit scrapins to tend em but mr bertie makes me tired if he gets into trouble with these texans forard the old man can read him out of it with hymns and the pilgrims progress for all i care ive been in the west and i know he cant bulldoze this crowd oh he makes me weary when there is trouble in a ship theres trouble for all hands and trouble was certainly breezing up to windward because the pilgrim struck in on a southern edge of a cyclonic disturbance coming up from the eastward on its way northwest and the westerly gale that played with them made matters extremely lively for every one it was the purest misfortune for all on board the pilgrim that bertie was not sick though he had never been in bad weather before it increased his good opinion of himself which stood in no need of any increase he swaggered as if he were an old salt and had been pickled in the year of trafalgar all these brutes forward are sick captain scantlebury said bertie haughtily they are a lot of useless scumaw those that arent ill dont know a horse from a mule and those that know a mule from a horse are too ill to know themselves from a bale of hay dont be too hard on em sir urged the old skipper this wont last long and when they get over bein sick theyll be all right if i was as softawas you want me to be said bertie theyd walk over the lot of us ive just booted three to work and ill boot the rest in about three minutes or ill know the reason why confound them he went forward along the main deck and interviewed some of his men among them he interviewed one arizona bill who was in a state of collapse to which he had long been a stranger as he explained later seasickness was an illness which resembled the results of drink combined with cholera and a few other very fatal diseases and it took all the stiffening out of a man get up and get to work said bertie pitilessly not much said poor arizona im dyin oh he said oh several times get up or ill kick thunder out of you said bertie even in collapse a gleam came in arizonas eye dont you kick me bertie or ill kill you when im well he said and forder came along just in time to prevent bertie doing what he said forder grabbed him by the arm you dont know what youre aimin at sir said forder do you reckon theyll be sick the whole passage mr fortescue if you want to kick any one go and kick a dutchman bertie wrenched his arm loose confound you sir let go my arm what the devil do you mean by interfering with me sir ill sack you in cape town the very moment we get there hehe called me bertie sack be hanged said forder and did he call you bertie well you are bertie arent you but youre green too or you wouldnt threaten to boot an american of that sort you dont know who youre talking to said bertie furiously for two pins id knock you down forder walked forard oh go to bed he said contemptuously but in less than ten minutes he was interviewing the old man and explaining how he had saved mr fortescues life the skipper abused him severely i shall be compelled to take the very severest steps with you mr forder piped the old man you cant do worse sir than send me forard and fire me at cape town and mark me dr said forder in the civilest tone and im ready to shift my dunnage forard right now sir but i tell you that mr fortescue wont get to cape town at all if he plays up with those chaps forard i can take care of myself roared bertie and i dont require your advice youll get no more of it said forder there there said the skipper of course youll get no more of it mr fortescue mr forder says you wont that will do forder i am exceedingly displeased outraged annoyed but as you have apologised you can go forder opened his mouth shut it again scratched his head looked at bertie sighed and went down the port poop ladder very slowly when he reached the deck he walked across to his own berth put his head inside and swore vigorously after this relief he went forard again i dont care what trouble there is he said so long as it aint bloody trouble ill have a yarn with this arizona chap as soon as he stops sayin oh so bad i aint bin in texas myself flat footin it over the ties without knowin the breed he did know them and it is very possible that his hardearned knowledge turned a tragedy into a comedy and helped to make a man of the owners son instead of a very goodlooking corpse for it must be owned that bertie was not a badlooking young fellow and had the makings of a man in him under his conceit the wind took off that night for the centre of the cyclone moved steadily to the northwest while the pilgrim was heading more to the south of east with trinidad on her starboard quarter forders watch below that night was from eight to twelve and he took the chance of seeing arizona bill who had now ceased to say oh and was saying ah with a sense of deep relief as he lay on a hay bale and wondered what folly had brought him to sea when there was so much solid prairie in arizona how are you makin it asked forder arizona sighed why sir im of opinion i shant actuly die this time but ive a mighty strange feelin of a void within that ive no reklection of experiencin since i was three days without hash in the neighbourhood of the californian mountings thishyer seasick business is a holy terror and some new to me id admire to see my enemies takin a hand in the game while i stood out tomorrow youll be as fit as a fiddle said forder itll do you goodscrape out your limbers so to speak arizona shook his towzled head well sir id ruther be done good to more gently for if thishyers a cure for indigestion as the cook reckons it should be a root cure and no fatal error and now i reklects it was you as stopped that boy bertie from doin suthin hed ha bin mighty sorry for sir i thank you i was mighty sick at that moment and i felt near my latter end and was helpless as a babe forder grinned excuse my smilin partner he said but somehow i cant help it when i think of people bein seasick arizona sighed grin my son i aint complainin it makes me smile to see a tenderfoot tackle a buckin horse i reckon im a tenderfoot at sea do you know fort worth asked forder do i know my dear yearthly home from the cold clouds of heaven asked arizona contemptuously i know fort worth like ez if it wuz my pants wuz you ever thar ay said forder i was flat bust there and slung hash for a month at canadian petes arizona held out a limp hand shake pard he said and forder shook i reckoned as there wuz somethin not so green about you ez the others said arizona havin been in texas is a great deal oh its a great deal towards an eddication but arizona i was in arizona too said forder at tombstone im dodbusted cried arizona quite forgetting he was ill squat alongside and tell us what you wuz doing over to tombstone this is real pie aint it i yearns strangely over the plains of arizona shake again tombstone waal im doggoned did you know red pete no but or apache adams him without ears geronimo earmarked him ive seen him said forder and they let right into a yarn about arizona and the apaches and adams and red pete and ginger simpson and twothumbed thompson till the stars came out but about this mr fortescue said forder when the well of reminiscence was about dry i want to know what the trouble will be arizona bill looked exceedingly disagreeable he would have impressed a member of the peace society very unfavourably berties goin to die i reckon he said simply he caynt survive long if my opinion is worth a cent he kicked three of the boys though one dont count bein a dutchman and he used language which the governor of no state could pardon to ben wilkins forder nodded damn young ass he said but arizona let him down light if any one shoots him hell be hung this is a british ship and hell be tried at cape town not in tombstone if he fell overboard said arizona theres seventy of us here to try he dont know what dynamite hes monkeyin with thats so said forder he dont know and might be taught youre the top dog in this crowd aint you i might be said arizona cautiously and youd oblige me if you could i would youre a white man said arizona even if you are an englishman forder who thoroughly understood the western attitude towards englishmen took no notice of the last part of arizonas declaration then treat him like the baby that he is eh what smack him for instance said arizona eagerly anything you like except kill him my son i see said arizona take his gun from him and so on im givin no advice replied forder thats all hunky i tumble to the racket said arizona i reckons he sets a high value on that glass eye of his eh it looks like it said forder well kapsualla it as bc bob says and give it to the major he let on hed worn em once he wuz in your british army and now hes the toughest hoodoo on board oh give it the major then said forder and he went off he met bertie on the main deck and they passed as if they were strangers in the strand oh go to bed said forder to himself but he knew he had done a good deed haw bumptious ass haw said bertie who had no notion how grateful he ought to be to the man who knew texas and arizona and the pride of those who grow upon the high plateaus of the southwest he didnt know for several days and the reason for his remaining ignorant was the comic spirit that endures in man in all the strange places of the world and sea and makes laughter flourish on the barrenest soil there were twelve hundred horses and mules on board and though they were packed a bit overclosely there was plenty of ventilation and at least half the men in charge knew a horse from a harmonium as the men who knew were naturally the bosses by birth and education having been mostly born in texas and educated on the prairie the unlearned learned because they had to it was not an unhappy ship for the horses even though bertie knew as much about them as he did about men what was due to arizona and ben wilkins and half a dozen others he put down to himself and he was much surprised at the peculiar change which came over the whole horse crowd as soon as they ran into good weather and went along on an even keel for the first ten days every one had been sick and sorry and savage and now the main deck and the tweendecks fairly rang with laughter aw theyve come to their bearings said bertie who liked sea terms which he sometimes used quite accurately i think captain scantlebury that the men are very amenable after all my severityawwith them when they were complaining of seasickness did them good that fellow they call arizona bill has a very good idea of handling horses and i can see he now thoroughly understands that i am not to be scared or imposed upon the skipper was obsequiously glad to hear it ah sir i always said to your father that you knew whats what even as a boy dear dear me to think i remember you when you weighed no more than half a hundred going through life is a strange pilgrims progress sir and here we are in the pilgrim goin straight ahead in a calm sea all so peaceful and so happy that i could sing a hymn all the way to cape town with horses oh but wars a sad sad thing old ass said the brutal forder whose watch on deck it was which is the biggest the old man or bertie tires me to calculate id rather work out lunars with a monkeywrench than try to take the altitude of these asses hes got em down fine has he sing hymns all the way to the cape eh oh my stars well be hard and fast ashore on a reef of woe in a twinkle the horsecrowds devilish merry this night and so they were for after their supper the unholiest gang of them all was gathered on the forehatch on the orlop deck and they made the horses who twisted their necks round to see what was going on wonder more than ever what strange animals men were arizona lay on the hatch and with him was ben wilkins the major who indeed had been an officer in a crack cavalry regiment chewed tobacco while resting against the coamings seth evans and missouri jack were among the crowd so were the mexicans though they sat aloof manuel the oneeyed blackguard from venezuela was there too and in the background were the dutchmen who included real hollanders danes a swede named hans and a finn known as tubby when he was called anything a dozen lanterns cast a glimmering and unequal light on this party in tophet arizona had the floor so to speak he was very fluent boys said arizona air we all in this to bee sure said ben wilkins the man that aint goes out with the muck next muckingout if im any authority on the doings in this ole packet dont discourage any of us said arizona ben youre too fiery ive known men thatd die sooner than be encouraged your way your talk inspires a sperrit of rebellion in the brave let us confine ourselves to the programme which is entitled as a drayma the takin down of bertie bertie boys is the boss boss o blazes said ben oh shucks said arizona do dry up and let me orate am i the orator or aint i if im the orator let me orate in peace if i aint ill stand out and be as silent as the grave i was talkinawabout dear bertieawwho walks round with a new silvery gun a fortyfive frontier pistol in his nice clean hands in order to reduce this unholy crowd to a proper sense o their subordination who is it carries a nice new gun boys bertie carries a nice new gun said the crowd shrieking with laughter berties paw owns thishyer horsepacket and is some sick in new orlans right now went on arizona but if his son wholl own this pilgrim when he paysses in his checks was to be filled up with lead the ole man would be some disgruntled whos sick paw would be some disgruntled if bertie was to stop lead boys berties paw would be some disgruntled answered the crowd does we the kind and peaceful crowd that looks after horses need guns to subdue our bloodthirsty instincts asked arizona far from it boys we come from the calm prairies of texas and sunny arizona where peace flourishes for ever and no man dies without askin for death except in some fatal instances that may be looked on as accidents we are all sorts here texans arizonians californians henglishmen kanucks mexicanos but all serenely devoted to the cause of peace whos the disturbing influence here waltzing round with a gun boys bertie is said the crowd unanimously who is it that says aw to freeborn citizens of the united states to men from chihuahua to downtrodden subjects of the king of england and the emperor of prussia bertie does affirmed the crowd and looks at sons of the prairie and the mountain through a piece of glass which the major here discarded years ago who does that and the crowd said that dear bertie did i calls all freemen with a clarion voice to say nothin of a bugle to rise and put him down said arizona we can endure much and can endure it long but the worm turns at last and dear bertie is doomed boys who is doomed dear bertie said the crowd dear bertie is doomed he is doomed to have his gun taken from him and his eyeglass if the major wont have it shall be destroyed by the heel of freedom boys i have done bully for you said the major ill take the eyeglass and the ingenious orator went on deck with his fellowconspirators to take the evening air and commune with the genial and gentlemanly stokers the cindershifters owned with much amazement that the most promising whitechapel hero with the firerake was not a patch on the chief ruffians from louisiana and texas they admired arizona wonderfully were marvellously civil to ben wilkins who was a murderous devil in his heart and sat at the feet of mizzoura jack and seth graves his partner neither of them could go back to missouri and they said they didnt want to at least jack said so seth was as silent as a cemetery ive a notion said arizona when he was through his second pipe ive a notion as itll be best to decorate bertie for his doins hyar id decorate him with a bowie but for youre sayin youll regard it as a favour if i dont said ben wilkins youre ever too ready with the knife my son said arizona but if youll stand aside with me ill furnish your barren and uninventive genius with a harmless job for your weepon that you keep in your boot which will amuse bertie worse than wounds lets climb up on what these gentlemen from the fiery depths calls the fiddley deck and ill breathe an elegant scheme into your starboard earhole which is ships palaver for right ear they climbed up and presently ben climbed down and went hunting for a piece of board termorrer is the fatal day said arizona jokin will be the death of me but oh dear bertie would almost make seth graves smile and as for me who was born with a rich endowment of fun i kin no more keep off him than a bear off honey the whole ships company was down on bertie they were down on his eyeglass on his nice khaki clothes on his revolver on his voice which subtly implied that they were nothing and much less than zero and every one on board with the exception of the skipper and the chief officer and the chief engineer who came from paisley and was probably a brother of the man who owned to coming from there but urged in extenuation sure as deeth i canna help it knew that something was brewing among the aristocrats who looked after the horses which boded bertie no good forder of course knew it and said nothing the third officer knew it and said a good deal to the steward who hated bertie worse than poison for telling him how to run his business bob wadd and green and the rest of the deckhands smelt it they smelt it like bob wadds gasworks and rubbed their hands joyously the firebrands down below used most horrible language on the subject and wished that they could have bertie in a bunker for a watch to show him what running cardiff coal in an iron barrow was like blimy and strimepink but i fair ytes to ketch saight of im said the boss of the whole gang of stokers thet vice of is syin aw aw maikes me feel saimes i did first taime i was blasted fool enough to come to sea i wunner wod them blokes of orsekeepers as put up for im i opes its somethin thatll larn im he smote the burning fire with his rake as if he was preparing a place for bertie and slammed in a few shovels of coal vengefully but then stokers are stokers and hard nuts to deal with and few men know them and those who do often wish they didnt its no soft job in a stokehold when the thermometer marks and what little wind there is is a following breeze and bertie walked round quite unconscious of his doom but he was conscious somehow that every one smiled at him old wadd grinned and so did green as he went along the alleyway and by the ashshoot the stokers taking air in that agreeable locality showed their white teeth and made remarks audible but unintelligible as he passed oneeyed venezuela grimaced like a damaged idol and said something blasphemous but humorous in south american spanish some of the deckhands said what cheer let her scoot as they passed him arizona said to ben something about being knocked as high as gilroys kite and ben said aw hell aw what the insolent and debauched major who was only saved from dying of drink by going at intervals where he couldnt get it put a penny in his left eye when he saw bertie and a boy from new orleans an elegant young ruffian of the hoodlum type yelled out bertie from an obscure corner of shadow in his heart bertie began to wonder whether he had the crowd down to such a fine point as he had imagined but he hardened his heart and said aw and flourished his gun his nice new gun and talked horse till ben wilkins said insolently aint mr fortescue a smart aleck and bertie thought it was a compliment termorrers the day of judgment said arizona as he lay on a bale of hay and squealed with laughter he went round the tweendecks and told the horses so rubbing their muzzles and pleasing the poor things very much for he understood them as he did men and loved them perhaps a trifle better aint it a pity horses that you warnt endowed by a genrous providence with a just sense of the ridiklous if by a special dispensation you was so endowed youd smile to know that bertie who talks horse like a burro will be showed his real rank in nature and decorated with the newest thing in orders he shook his head and again addressed his equine friends boys youre goin to the war and will see many jackasses in high places but not a burro among em equal in jackassery to mr bertie fortescue did you say youd hev a bit of hay my son here you are then and good night to you everything went on wheels next day and save for one little uproar caused by berties not understanding what a spaniard said there was no trouble bertie talked severely to the unintelligent ass who didnt understand english and a row was only saved by arizona who could yap mexican wauwau like a native of the country the spaniard said something not to be written beginning with mucho and bertie said he accepted the apology and put away his gun were getting along firstrate aw said bertie and so the whole ships company said when night fell and the stars came out and looked down on the pilgrimage of the pilgrim on a calm sea with just enough breeze from the east of north to make the windsails worth their positions in the general scheme of things and at pm the men took their grub having watered and fed the eager and impatient cargo and ben wilkins said the order was ready what order asked the rest eagerly tis between me and arizona said ben and all ill say is that its for dear bertie wait and youll see at three bells in the second dogwatch they watered the horses again as the weather was rather more than warm and at eight bells they gave them hay for the last time till the morning bertie went his rounds and at halfpast eight was down on the orlop deck which was so badly lighted with electric light that the men supplemented the electricity with lanterns though there were fewer horses there than on the tweendecks or the main deck there were more men down on the orlop deck than on any other and they were obviously much amused at something what it was the owners son did not know till he came right forward on the starboard side having begun forard on the port side and walked aft he found quite a gathering on the forehatch of no hold a lot were sitting and the rest standing about in two groups with ben and arizona in the midst good night bertie said some one from the background who the devil said that asked bertie he turned to arizona was it you no bertie said arizona it warnt me dear i wouldnt think of takin such a liberty with so fine a lookin young man was it you ben ben shook his head not me bill would i call a nice young boy like him by such a horrid insultin name no it warnt me that called him bertie bertie gasped hawhaw and the crowd said awaw and then the young fellow who certainly did not lack courage made a bolt for the biggest gang and naturally caught the slowest of the lot who was a very harmless dutchman he knocked him down and pulled out his gun there was a dead silence for a moment and then arizona stepped up to him what are you producin that very fine weepon for he asked and bertie roared this is mutinymutiny dont get excited sir said arizona dont get flighty or flurried with a tough and horrid crowd like this always keep cool we wants to know unanimous what your purpose is in wearin that weepon and pullin it out and flourishin it permiscus for were very peaceful and worships peace and hates to die gogo to the devil said bertie confound you let me pass for now there were at least thirty men round him and some of the stokers who were off duty stood in the background roaring with laughter make him hand over his gun bill said ben edging closer wed like to look at it to see if its a real gun sir said arizona with a very taking air of simplicity some of us reckons its real and some says your dad heeled you with a wooden one to scare a timid lot of boys from arizona and texas and louisiana please let us look at it sir do dear bertie said the rest and what happened then no one quite knew some said bertie meant to shoot some said he made a break for the brow which was the horsegangway at the main hatch and some say that ben grabbed him for about ten seconds there was a roughandtumble on the forehatch in which three lanterns were finally expended and then from the rumpus there emerged a pale and desperate bertie without a gun in the grip of ben arizona and the silent seth graves jack from missouri had the gun boys the verdict of this expert is that this is a real gun said jack a real fortyfive frontier pistol loaded with real cartridges and if you pulls the trigger hard its likely to go off there dear bertie see what youve been monkeyin with said arizona mizzoura knows a gun well you might have killed one of us poor boys mostly orphans too owin to similar accidents happenin to our paws but the speechless son of the owner found his tongue let me go ill kill some of you what the devil do you mean he struggled frantically and found his struggles entirely vain for seth graves had him from behind in a clutch that it would have taken a small and healthy grizzly bear to get free of ill tell you what we mean said ben dusting himself carefully we mean to give you some healthy advice mebbe you remember kickin this child in the ribs when he was sick and me said seth who spoke for the first and last time and you let on that you would kick me boy said arizona and nothin but the second officer interferin saved you from it now were goin to investigate your case and decide what kind of immejit death will be joodishal boys put a bale on the forehatch and ill appint myself judge with a view to strict impartiality for if i dont ben wilkins will and he caynt be impartial as he said las night hed decided to hang the prisoner if he was appinted judge he climbed on the bale boys the court is now sittin no one that the prisoner hez kicked can be on the jury them as he hez pulled his gun on aint disqualified or there wouldnt be no panel bein sworn at aint no disqualification neither the jury was formed after several bitter quarrels it was composed of a louisiana man called buckeye joe a canadianfrenchman known as french pete a young californian originally from mendocino county but later from the san francisco house of correction a finn a dutchman from amsterdam an englishman who had been born at sea and brought up in australia and the major who in the struggle had annexed berties eyeglass and was now wearing it with the curious effect of making him look almost like a gentleman again and several others who came from countries between patagonia and hudsons bay our verdict is guilty said the foreman buckeye dont be previous said arizona he is guilty of course we all know that but weve got to act impartial and hear some evidence and ive to sum up you look out for my summing up bertie itll make you squirm or im no trueborn impartial citizen of the united states ben take the stand and lay your complaint against this bobtail burro the helpless prisoner shook his head feebly he was entirely done for and seriously alarmed there wasnt a kick left in him seth graves job was now a sinecure and he let him go this lopeared leper kicked me said ben wilkins who had been adding to his already extensive vocabulary of picturesque abuse by consorting with the stokers he said get up you lazy loafin scumpot and do your dooty and with that he booted me in the ribs if i was on the jury id bawl for death and its only because you asked me to let him off arizona that i didnt slay him when i could stand boys your verdict if just will be death this was irregular and arizona said so you aint addressin the jury ben said the judge youve no call to either ill do that you can stand down i hevent hardly cleared my throat to begin with urged ben ive a deal more to say oh a deal more oh dry up said arizona whos running this court you or me wheres the oneeyed galoot from caraccas the oneeyed galoot from caraccas testified to having been smitten on the side of his head by bertie bill translated the evidence without editing it oneeye said he hadnt killed bertie because he was too sick to do it he addressed the mexicans on the jury with much fervour and though reproved by bill did not cease his oration till ben who was jealous pulled him down a dutchman spoke afterwards but did not meet with great sympathy from the judge cut it shortsaid bill a dutchman dont count anyhow hardly moren a nigger this was rather hard on three coons grinning in the background and lighting up the darkness with their teeth however dutchmen and negroes are never really troublesome unless they are in the majority and no protest was made after that arizona refused to hear any more evidence thatll do the palaver he said its as clear as the missouri in floodtime that bertie is a gone coon he struck citizens of the united states with a british shoe and he smote caraccas over the cabeza with a british hand the jury can consider their verdict while the judge considers his sentence aint the prisoner to be allowed no defence asked old wadd who had been given the tip there was something on to bee sure said bill bertie can you say anythin to prevent your bein found guilty right off go to the devil said bertie ill have you all in gaol for mutiny at cape town thats contempt of court said bill but we pass it by secure in the dignity of our high office is there any one who can testify on behalf of poor doomed bertie before the verdict is announced not a soul volunteered what no witnesses ez to character asked bill would the seafaring gentleman in the background who threw some reflections on me just now by inquiring if the prisoner warnt to hev no defence like to speak on behalf of bertie bob wadd shuffled uneasily but green egged him on his old dad aint a bad sort said wadd at last with all that trepidation which paralyses an englishman in his first speech his old dad so far the court is with you said arizona but the evidence is what lawyers justly calls irreverent his old dad has our sympathy but the griefs of the prisoners parent caynt interfere with the course of justice have you anythin else to allege on his behalf well the grubs good in this packet said wadd desperately and old mr fortescue oh give us a rest said the judge you tire me my son by your continued irreverence the fact is you caynt rake up the least thing in favour of this benighted burro and you slide off on the matter of the chewing just as if the old mans notions of hash could help the criminal i see before me gentlemen of the jury what is your verdict guilty said buckeye joe and we all say it and you might as well have heard us first as last do you all say guilty demanded bill ignoring the foreman yep si oui ja yes said the jury by crimes we do all of us todos tous the hull crowd unanimous and we sentences him to death rise up the prisoner said bill and the jury can sit down and hold their blamed tongues this isnt lynchin this is a court with a joodishul jedge if witherin sarcasm warnt lost on the lot of you id tell you what i think of your trespassin upon my rights rise up the prisoner and seth graves rose him up let me go you damn fool said bertie how dare you youve no right to do it to make a fool of me help help im not going to stay here and be jeered at dont you touch me and he foamed at the mouth even seth graves found him hard to freeze to hold on said arizona now without a smile mr bertie fortescue mebbe you think this is a joke well so it is in one way but not in the next do you reckon it a joke no said bertie through his teeth youre right said the judge for at the bottom my son its tolrable serious while weve been takin the evidence ive been considerin my sentences i reckon one sentence aint enough so ill do my best to put a few together for the sentence of this court is that you are to be told briefly and with a rasp what i and the rest think of you my son silence boys theres somethin actual afterwards and im goin to hev peace while i orate or a few of you will go on deck in a horsesling arizona stood up and there was a look in his eye which produced order he turned again to bertie you miserable young jackass said the impartial and just judge you miserable young jackass listen and larn weve been good to you ive been good to you and by my orders your life hez been spared you kicked seth graves you hoofed ben wilkins in the ribs you threatened to kick me and if it hadnt bin for a friend of yourn on board this packet youd ha bin shot and thrown overboard i wonder if you understand my son that youre no one that youre ignorant that youre as green and juicy as grass in rain mebbe you never saw men before were a rough and tough crowd weve lived our lives seen men die and taken chances ourselves though i own some of us are little better than hoboes or tomaytocan vags and you come along flourishin a gun thishyer gun that you caynt shoot with and shoot off your mouth at us by the great horn spoon its a marvel boys aint it thats so said the crowd seriously do you believe me bertie when i tell you straight that if i hadnt interfered youd hev been dead by now asked bill as he sat down again no said bertie ben wilkins got up and walked close to the prisoner dont you asked ben his eyes were like furnaces dont you stand back ben said bill my son dont you think you kin persuade yourself i speak the trewth there was a strange short silence speaksaid bill yees said bertie bill nodded ah i thought youd see it my son its true its truer than most gospel as preached why you miserable galoot what we thinks of you is below words what do you know you know nothin you reckon you know horse let me tell that does that you dont know horse nor mewel nor even jackass your knowledge of horses is equal to your knowledge of men mebbe thisll teach you some your clothes dont make you a man nor your eyeglass you talked a while back about mutiny waal i aint an expert in mutiny but my notion is that the only authority such as you possess is the authority natral to a man youve got none you said youd hev us all in gaol at cape town some of us hev assaulted you eh well you assaulted some of us is your opinion of yourself ez high ez it was at suppertime or hev you come to the conclusion that youve suthin to larn i dont press for an answer for i reckon one aint required youve been taken down some and weve done it serious and without violence because youre a boy and may be made a man of yet i aint down on englishmen like some is out west i know good men englishmen real good but your kind when green would rise the dander of a peaceful cow the order of this court is that your gun shall be throwed overboard and that youll wear no real gun while were here to take care of you ben break up berties nice new gun and do it now ben wilkins smashed the stock of the sixshooter on the iron coamings of the hatch and then broke the trigger he threw the disorganised weapon into a muckskip whose nice new gun has been taken away and bust up asked ben baby berties nice new gun has said the crowd and now said bill to take the sting out of these proceedings we propose to present you with a gun that caynt do no harm produce the gun ben and ben produced a piece of wood shaped roughly in the form of a sixshooter we invests you with the order of the wooden gun said bill and our advice to you is that you will treasure it and put it up in your cabin and look at it daily till you come to understand why we presented it from the way youve took these proceedings since your last fight to down seth which no man on board can do this court and the rest of the crowd hez hopes of you boys do i voice the sentiments of this educational meetin on the orlop deck o the pilgrim belonging to messrs fortescue and son when i say we all believe that this collegiate course will eventuate in makin a man of mr fortescues son and heir you do said the unanimous crowd we hev high hopes of him release the prisoner said bill and this court is dissolved into its constituent individuals and bertie rose from the hatch not knowing where he was or what he was or who he was but of one thing he was quite certain he was not the young man who came below an hour before he walked away perfectly quietly not knowing that the wooden gun was suspended from his shoulder by a string ah said bertie he went through the crowd as if he didnt see them walked up the brow to the tweendecks and presently found himself outside his cabin on the spar deck he nodded and said ha and found the order of the wooden gun he dropped it inside the cabin and went forard to the bridge old scantlebury waddled to him aint it a lovely heavenly night sir said the old man and going along so peaceful while the stars shine on us are the horses all right and the men theyreall right said bertie he seemed so silent that the skipper said no more i wonder who arizona meant when he said a friend of mine thought bertie illill ask him he went down below on the main deck and found arizona leaning on a breastrail and rubbing a big greys muzzle arizona said bertie yes sir said arizona what friend of mine did you mean just now arizona looked at him the electric light was strong there and fell on berties face it seemed quite different from what it had been arizona looked him full in the eyes as if nothing whatever had happened it was the second mate mr forder sir why did he interfere asked bertie well sir said arizona he hez bin in texas and in arizona and he understands things bertie turned away he understandswhat us i reckon said arizona simply thanks said bertie and he went to the second officers room and tapped at the door forder opened to him for he was reading yes he said what is it if he spoke without any audible tone of respect it was only what bertie looked for im sorry we had that trouble the other day said the owners son ive had a talk with arizona dont mention it said forder its a beautiful night mr fortescue it is said bertie good night mr forder good night sir said the second officer and bertie stood for half an hour by the rail looking into the sea damn said bertie i dont know but arizona said there were hopes of him captain balaam of the cormorant captain balaam of the cormorant was an ignorant old fool captain benjamin wood of the scanderbeg said so he was also obstinate ferocious blatant bigoted and given to liquor captain benjamin wood said this too the crew of the cormorant agreed with the crowd in the scanderbeg that their skipper was a disagreeable personality they phrased it differently they said he was an adjectival blighter and yet for all that there was jealousy between the crews of the two ships just as there was jealousy between the two skippers the only difference between them was that the scanderbegs believed in their ship and their skipper and the cormorants believed in the cormorant only both vessels hailed from the same port of registry they both traded to australia and mostly to melbourne they were owned by related rivals and manned for the most part by men who knew each others home affairs it was no wonder that when the cormorant was remasted as she had been previously undersparred the scanderbegs crew was very greatly excited up to the present time their ship had made the best passages and now balaam had announced that he meant to lick the scanderbeg by a ruddy ensanguined crimson month youre an ignorant old ass and cant do it said captain wood im an ignorant old ass am i retorted balaam who was slow at repartee ill show you i expect you will said wood i know you balaam you know me do you said balaam do you know anything against me i despise you wood i despise you you shortened sail mighty quick that time we was in company off the leuuwin oh yes you anded that foretaupsl mighty quick and i eld on to mine youll not do it now the cormorant has some real spars in her retorted wood you know according to your own account you could never put enough on her to do her any harm in a cyclone i never said balaam but anyow this time ill lick your ugly ead off it dont foller because a mans full of scientific talk that es a seaman great circles and double haltitudes and star hobservations make me sick theyd make you sick to work em out said wood when you got your ship resparred you might have got a new set of brains balaam and he left balaam foaming at the mouth as an old timber drogher foams under bluff bows with a whole gale behind her they left london river the same day and lost sight of each other in the chops of the channel but since destiny was playing with them they lay close together under the line for the best part of a fortnight in a dead calm the cormorant was the first to draw away in a series of light flaws which were really the northern edge of the southeast trade and balaam signalled to wood ill report you confound it shes a wonder in light airs said wood but what shell be in bad weather will settle it i dont give in not much they ran across each other once more to the south of the cape and both ships had a firstclass opportunity of showing what they could do in heavy weather ill run her under before ill shorten sail said wood blimy said balaam before i shorten down ill ave the new sticks out of her mr briggs the chief mate implored him to go a bit easy shes new to it sir and were not settled down and set up the way she should be yet ill show you said balaam if she aint what she should be its your fault youre the mate aint you but if the mate is responsible for the rigging the skipper is responsible for trying it and balaam drank hard and tried it high id rather fetch into hobsons bay under jury rig than let that swine lick us said balaam thickly mr briggs hist that maintgallnsl over the reefed taupsl and let her scoot if they hadnt once more lost each other in a screaming southeaster the catastrophe might have come right then it was only when the scanderbeg was swallowed up in thick weather and the night that balaam got so drunk that briggs ventured to shorten sail i wish hed keep drunk said briggs bitterly to the second greaser ah his bein only squiffy is very tryin sir replied mr creak it strikes me sir that the men are gettin disgruntled at the way he keeps things goin theyre beginnin to want a lot of driving then drive em said briggs shortly he was being driven himself the crowd forard were really very sore about everything they had no particular grievance that is they only had seamens grievances the vessel was undermanned well all british ships are whats the good of an englishman if he cant do more than any one else they were of course badly fed that was nothing nothing even that it steadily grew worse what hurt them was balaams way of looking at them an italian might have said he had the evil eye they didnt mind his evil tongue the truth is that balaam was sand in their bearings they got hot to think of him they compared him with captain wood thats a man said charlie baker a real one youre over young to go so large about men my son remarked smith a greyhaired veteran who had served his time in the western ocean but i allow that capn wood is all there when he was launched he was classed a and no mistake with a broad a for iron and a maltee cross for built under special survey added tom paddle who hailed from newcastle and had worked in a shipbuilding yard i never heard of no maltee cross connected with ships said old smith this raised an argument which lasted for the best part of an hour and ended in paddle being put down by a unanimous vote though he shouted as loudly as possible you must be wrong urged his particular mate dont you ear were all agin you ill fight on it said paddle fiercely ow could a scrap settle it asked smith contemptuously suppose you and baker fot over it and you knocked charlie out would that make black white then ow the devil is a man to know the truth of anything said paddle pathetically it was the first argument of his that the rest owned had some sense in it but the row blew over as rows do in the focsle and they abused the skipper till eight bells but if the row blew over it was more than the gale did it lasted for fortyeight hours and was followed by another the way balaam carried sail made every sober man shake that year and at that season running down the easting was no joke and as balaam knew the scanderbeg would go as far south as possible on the composite great circle track he did likewise gawds treuth said charlie baker who was a joker ive eard tell of the brave west winds but these ere are puffectly reckless eroes old balaam stumped the weather side of the poop or hung on to the weather mizzen rigging and bawled let her scoot what she cant carryhicshe may drag mister briggshicshake out a reef in the main taupsl i smells the cookin on board the scanderbeg what ho good lord said briggs and mr creak said so too well be crawlin into hobsons bay yet under a jury rig both mates agreed they prophesied sadly gloomily and they prophesied right the scanderbeg will lick us by months they said here they prophesied wrong for the scanderbeg was a hundred miles only to the southard and the same gale that was destined to whip the sticks out of the cormorant was worse the further south it blew they were then in latitude s and longitude w and the crozets were on their starboard quarter the real gale started at nw like a perfect fiend grew into a hurricane from the west with the centre of the disturbance to the southard and when it passed away with frightful squalls into a steady souwester the cormorant was lying head to wind anchored to part of her own wreckage and she hadnt a feather to fly with captain balaam went below and called to the steward bunting rum said balaam and bunting who was as white as spindrift with terror brought it balaam went to sleep calmly and left matters to briggs and creak the worst having come to the worst being left to themselves they proved to be men they had something to do and did it they cut all the wreck adrift and rigged a proper seaanchor and repaired damages as best they could but they couldnt repair the damage done to the provisions the whole of the front of the poop had been burst in by the sea and a big hole driven by the mizzentopmast into the deck right through the poop and main deck into the lazarette into that there went so much water that anything not in tins was unfit to eat and now all the pork and beef save that in the harness casks was found to be rotten great scott said briggs the crew of the cormorant anticipated starvation and had huge appetites but they bore up well a day ahead is enough for men of the sea charlie baker took hold of the boys and felt them all over to see if they were fat the others thought it an admirable joke the boys were not so sure that it was never mind mates said baker a boy will go a long way and we ave three but i wonder ow the scanderbeg is makin it there is something peculiarly diabolical at times in the way of the sea it was a coincidence though perhaps an ordinary one that the poor scanderbeg was just then wallowing at a seaanchor a hundred miles to the south of them with nothing but the stumps of her masts to show a rag on but it was a far more extraordinary coincidence that her crew were in danger of starvation as captain wood did not drink his steward did it seems necessary that some one shall at sea and though it is usually the skipper who has no one to control him it excites no surprise to find that the steward does this particular specimen of a hardworked individual went into the lazarette with an uncovered candle sampled some rum which was forty over proof and fell asleep to wake in a world where we are led to believe drink is scarce though smoking is permitted and the scanderbeg was on fire just when the wind from the nw and a falling barometer announced the approach of a hurricane the fire was put out and the steward dragged out but what with fire and smoke and water combined the provisions he had charge of were no more likely to do their duty than he was they put him overboard gloomily and that night the hurricane fell on them and did its worst well said poor captain wood im afraid the cormorant will beat us this time but he did not take to drink and camp in a wet bunk as balaam did he worked day and night with his two mates and made some sort of a show with a jury rig inside of twentyfour hours but he was very much troubled about the grub ships are never overprovisioned and even the stock of canned goods had been fired and fuzed id give fifty pounds for a ton of biscuits said wood it wasnt till they were under way again and doing nearly four knots an hour with the souwester behind them that an idea struck him by jove said the skipper he slapped his thigh and suddenly became cheerful mr boden the chief mate was very curious but did not express his curiosity the old man has something in his mind he told the second greaser tom hankin i wish i had something in my stomach said hankin and the skipper went below when he came up he altered the course to ene and boden having taken a squint at the chart became much more cheerful so did hankin though he tightened his belt so did the crowd forard though they tightened theirs and the next day they ran across the cormorant in that almighty waste of grey storm blimy said the crew maybe well get some toke from this ere ooker wots ad the syme misforchune as ourselves i wonder what she is so did wood and when he found out he would have been much more than human if he had not been pleased though he had not read la rochefoucauld she wont lick us into melbourne after all said the skipper he hove the poor old scanderbeg to under the lee of the cormorant and she lay wallowing comfortably under a rag of a fakedup trysail and the head of a staysail showing on her forestay wood bellowed to windward with a speakingtrumpet wheres captain balaam poor briggs was tired and cross and insubordinate in his mind in his bunk came down the wind is he hurt drunk sir said the distant voice what did he say asked wood of his mate he said captain balaam was drunk sir ah said the skipper he asked no more about balaam but inquired if they could let him have some provisions the answer he got was rather a blow but it was not so much of a blow to him as the question had been to briggs were starving already bellowed briggs forlornly to the wind and the sea and the wreck to looard of him when will you get sail on her d ye think asked wood tomorrow replied briggs make for st paul said wood provisions are stored there so i see in the directory well share em thanks said the other speakingtrumpet and then silence fell between these two partners of the sea in high misfortune shes really not so badly crippled as we are said wood and that was true so true that on the morrow the cormorant crept out of the waste of tumbling seas and the gloom of the grey dawn and wallowed past them balaam was on deck dancing licking thunder out of you you dog was his polite message of thanks to the scanderbeg crippled or all ataunto we can knock spots off of your old barge oh hes a gentleman said wood we wont reply im sorry hes likely to get to the island first sir put in his mate id not be surprised if he grabbed all there is to get sir oh no surely said wood but though he said so the notion bit into him and made him all the more anxious to get more sail on her he worked with the men like one of them and only slept two hours out of the twentyfour hes a bully old man said his hungry crew the best skipper we ever sailed with oh but aint we ungry they were hungrier yet when they sighted the crater of st paul and rounded to on the northeast coast opposite the broken entrances to the inner crater harbour they anchored in deep water and so long as the wind stayed west of south were in perfect safety but there was no cormorant in sight by jove said wood shes missed it after all im not surprised balaams no navigator called me a dog did he well ive smelt my way here and hes out of it the crew were joyful and excited this was something new something a little out of the way in the dull dead monotony of sealife which as a rule is about as interesting as running a watercart up and down a suburban road the august and awful sea is only august and awful for those who have august minds seamen as a rule havent they have only awful language blow me tight said bill waite from shadwell i sye this is a gyme sye tom lets desert and live ere for hever and make a farm oh lets said his mate fred day if its anythin like the canary bird islands itll be a fine farm for sulphur and cinders what i want is the grub and get out of it give me sandridge and a pot of sheoak they went ashore pulling in through the crater entrance and were surrounded by gloomy walls nearly a thousand feet high taint exactly as bloomin as the isle of man said bill at least not on a benk oliday wheres the grub dye think they found out where it was very soon at least they considered they were able to deduce from the facts in front of them where it was the rude stone and lava hut in which it had been stored stared them almost in the face but it was odd they said that the door was open when mr briggs reached it he turned round and looked very much disturbed so did the hut it had been disturbed recently and there wasnt as much as the smell of a biscuit left in it the cormorant has been here and taken it all said briggs you could have knocked the boats crew down with much less than a belaying pin they collapsed upon adjacent blocks of lava and said things not fit for publication except in realistic novels the swine sighed charlie baker oh aint there nothin sir not a thing said the mate he led the way back to the boat and under the wondering eye of the skipper which was just then glued to a telescope they embarked and rowed back like a funeral procession captain balaam has taken all the provisions sir said the mate all every biscuit sir get the anchor up and make sail said the skipper he went below and when he came on deck again the scanderbeg was standing out to sea muster the men aft mr briggs said captain wood and when they came aft the old man addressed them the pith of his address lay in the tail of it we must catch the cormorant he said and the men said they would if human hands could get enough sail on their old wreck to catch the robber and scoundrel then somewhere to the east of them men and mates and the skipper took their coats off they clapped makeshift sails on every stay till the scanderbeg looked like a laundry dryingyard they got up another jurymast made of the fished halves of the main topmast they made her four knots into five into five and a quarter into five and a half and then they lay down at midnight and dreamed of eating they sighted the cormorant ahead of them two days later there she is the thief said the men as the weather was now finer and dry they wetted their rags of canvas so that the sails held a little more wind they rigged up more canvas yet by lacing it to the foot of their foresail which did most of the work they hung out their clothes to dry and tied them so that the very shirts held wind all right my sons said the crowd of the scanderbeg wait till we catch you they drew up with her at dark the weather was moderating fast the heavy sea went down rapidly the wind fell light and stars shone through the breaking canopy of clouds the scanderbeg drew up on the cormorants starboard quarter slowly it was obvious that in her present trim she could outsail the other vessel anyhow and this in spite of the fact that briggs had made good use of his spare topmast the scanderbeg had none it had broken from its lashings and gone overboard like a match out of an emptied pail when she was nearly under water and came up out of the smother like a diver the crew of the scanderbeg were on the focslehead will he run aboard of em by crimes therell be ructions said bill waite dancing oh the miserable dogs oh the scum o the seas oh the pirates dry up you ass said his mate the skippers goin to ail er cormorant ahoy said captain wood who came forard to the tgallant focsle cormorant ahoy hallo said briggs from the poop what made you take all the provisions mr briggs the captains orders sir said poor briggs who was obviously ashamed of himself and his ship i couldnt help it sir the two moving wrecks were now almost alongside clew up the foresail mr hankin said captain wood the sail was clewed up and now the cormorant drew a little ahead i want to see captain balaam said wood is he drunk now the night was suddenly dark and the figures of the speakers barely distinguishable nevertheless those on the focslehead of the scanderbeg were aware that briggs suddenly disappeared and was replaced by some one else im not drunk you swab hiccuped captain balaam it was a very obvious misstatement on his part im not drunk you miserable howler there warnt enough grub for one let alone two so i collared the lot a voice was heard from his ship which contradicted him thats a lie there was plenty for both balaam left the poop hurriedly and was heard inquiring for the mutineer who dared to put his oar in at such a time every man jack on the maindeck protested it was not he very well said balaam when i find who it is ill hammer him flat flat ill massacre him he came back to the poop and resumed his talk with wood not enough for twohicand if there was you shouldnt have it ill give you a bag of split peas the men in the scanderbeg groaned they had been living on split peas for three days bill waite signified what he thought of the offer by taking an iron belaying pin from the rail and throwing it at old balaam it was a good shot but the distance was too great it hit the rail of the cormorant and fell into the sea split peas said fred day oh lor whatll our old man say to that wood was a gentleman and he very rarely used bad language there are times however when language to do any good to the user must be bad and wood told balaam what he thought of him he ran the scanderbeg close up alongside until balaam thought he was going to be boarded and then addressed him his crew roared with applause and hissed balaam furiously they called him every horrible thing they could think of and charlie baker said hear hear from the cormorants maindeck it aint our fault maties he cried old balaams a cockeyed blighter but wood roared silence fore and aft and spoke once more will you divide the provisions captain balaam i ask you for the last time ill see you sunk burnt and destroyed and doubly damned if i will said balaam i ates you and dont hown to no obligation to you you never was polite nor friendly now youre repentin you may go to blazes by express my names balaam im captain of this ship and dont take horders from a scientific lubber like you i aint drunkhicthough you say so im as sober as a missionary quite soberhicand hif you incites my crew to mutiny ill sue you for damages and justice in melbourne mr briggs make sail crack on he retired to a hencoop and sent for the steward bunting gimme a drop o brandy and gin mixed with a dash o rum in it said balaam it was his favourite drink but in the scanderbeg wood was talking to mr boden all right mr boden said he set the foresail and let us draw ahead ill not put up with this we shall be starving in reality in three days well get even as soon as ever the sea goes down and somehow it got to the men forard that the situation was not to last they ate pease pudding with loathing and smoked heavily we relies on the old man they said oh what a blighter old balaam is they kept a mile or two ahead of the cormorant all that day and when night fell again the sea was fairly calm and the sky clear weve got three boats fit to go over the side said the skipper to boden get em ready and now its dark you can have em swung out belaying pins will do what belaying pins would do for soon appeared when the skipper had the men mustered aft men he said all the food which should have been divided is now on board the cormorant captain balaam who is no gentleman he aint no seaman neither sir said bill waite the others told him to dry up and he subsided blushing at his own audacity and i propose to board his vessel and compel him to divide it hurrah hurrah hurrah said the crowd oh aint this somethin like if there is any resistance went on wood it must be put down for that purpose each of you will take a belaying pin but you will leave your knives behind in half an hour i shall shorten sail and man the boats you will all keep silence i shall go with you myself to see that no unnecessary violence is used mr hankin you will remain on board with two of the boys as there were three boys it is unnecessary to state that there was an almost immediate fight to see who were to stay both who did were much more damaged next morning than the victim who went at midnight the foresail was clewed up and a few more of the makeshift sails furled the boats were lowered safely and in ten minutes the scanderbeg was only manned by a sorry second mate and two sore boys the vessel moved off slowly into the starry darkness looking like a huge houseboat converted into a laundry to the westward the cormorant loomed darkly she grew slowly as they waited in perfect silence this will be a lesson to balaam said captain wood across the quiet sea to boden i hope i sincerely hope that he is not drunk mr boden gosh were pirates of the deep said waite and the men in his boat chuckled silence in your boat waite said the skipper and as the cormorant drew nearer and nearer the boats divided the skippers boat and waites lay ready to board her on the starboard side boden was to rush her on the port now they heard the very lip of the seas against her bows her broken spars stood up against the sky they heard a voice aft some one struck one bell on board of her the man on the lookout sleepily said that it was all well and now her bows were above them they pulled a stroke and her sides loomed high hook on said the skipper and before the cormorant knew it she was seized by what waite called the pirates of the deep shes ours said waite as he jumped on deck and found no one to oppose him in half a minute there wasnt a soul in the boats which promptly went adrift mr briggs who was the officer of the watch was an unreluctant prisoner in the hands of captain wood i couldnt stand it you see said wood as he shook hands i aint a bit surprised replied briggs in fact i rather reckoned youd not put up with it fetch up balaam said wood and balaam was brought up by this time the two crews who were no longer jealous of each other were standing together on the main deck on the friendliest terms youre our prisoners said waite cheerfully and the crew of the cormorant laughed while balaam bellowed like a bull on the poop its piracy rank piracy roared balaam as he struggled in the grasp of boden and his enemy the skipper of the scanderbeg this is piracy and youll be ung for it they slammed him down upon a hencoop with considerable violence dry up you old thief said boden you ought to be ashamed of yourself if you dont stop kicking ill land you on the jaw he shook balaam till his teeth chattered and he called on mr briggs for help briggs turned his back to him and walked to the rail on the port side of the poop weve come for those provisions captain balaam said wood and we mean to have them youre a pirate said balaam thickly oh youre a pirate and youre a miserable cowardly thief replied wood i dont propose to argue with you mr boden when we come up alongside the scanderbeg shorten sail and well wait till daylight youre givin orders in my ship said balaam oh this is horrid its a nightmare it aint real i must be dreamin he yelled horribly and it took three men to hold him one of them was his own second mate who hated him venomously if you make much more row sir said creak theyll put you over the side i heard em say so did they mr creak whispered balaam they did said creak this is horrid creak oh creak am i dreamin pinch me sos i shall know and creak gave him a nip that drew a shriek from him youve took a piece out confound you said balaam im very sorry sir said the second greaser with a pleased smile but you aint dreamin and the pirates down on the maindeck are very savage against you id give up the grub quickly would you asked balaam i would sir said creak paddle whispered to me just now that they had fixed it up to hang you and captain wood too if he objected and balaam whose sobriety was returning under the stress lost his courage as his alcohol evaporated id beg their pardon if i was you said creak its horrid being hung yes yes said balaam tell em they can have the grub quite quiet idid like to go below creak i feel cold and creak was allowed to lead him to his cabin when he got there he locked himself in and piled all his possessions against the door he fell into his bunk shivering and when he slept he dreamed horrible dreams which were the offspring of terror and alcohol he sobbed and said nobody loves me he came near to seeing rats and in the meantime the two vessels lay alongside within a cables length of each other while waite and boden used one of the cormorants boats to pick up their own the cook of the cormorant was busy in the galley and the crew of the scanderbeg ate a square meal the first time for ten days this is much better than split peas said bill waite i shall loathe peas all my life i dont know which i despise most balaam or pease pudding mates it must be a horrid thing to have such a skipper as balaam the men of the cormorant said it was horrid hes a cockeyed blighter said tom paddle and i most willingly would see you pirates ang him and as for the grub we parts with what belongs to you comes without grudgin it was very handsome of tom paddle but he was known to be generous even when he was sober he helped to transfer the provisions to the scanderbeg with the heartiest goodwill when the transhipment was made all the officers of both vessels breakfasted on board the cormorant while balaam lay in his bunk hungry not daring to call for anything i know wood will ang me he whimpered without brandy he had to believe it while i am a pirate mr briggs said captain wood pleasantly i may as well carry it out can you spare me a coil of threeinch manilla with pleasure said briggs is there anything else sir what do you say mr boden asked wood i think we could do with half a dozen stunsail booms said boden i rather want them myself said briggs anxiously but wood was a good pirate and did not weaken i think we want them more than you do said wood with firmness and he got them briggs was sore but said nothing is there anything else you would like he asked with some natural bitterness yes said wood i think well take all balaams seastock of liquor it will do him good i havent the least objection to that said briggs and half an hour afterwards the scanderbeg made sail and forged slowly ahead of the cormorant on her way to albany well report you said wood but when he was nearly out of sight old balaam pulled down his fortifications and came on deck looking like a man who by a miracle has shaved what are known as the jimjams he sat down and wailed for bunting yes sir said bunting i think ill have some brandy and gin with a dash of rum in it said balaam the steward looked at mr briggs and grinned if you please sir you cant them pirates took it all said bunting jackallalone as it happened i was the only passenger in the steamship hindoo and i found little entertainment in the company of her officers the skipper was said never to open his mouth except upon sundays when he preached furiously to the assembled crowd and promised them hell as a reward for their labours on the deep sea he was a religious maniac much in favour with the owners because he combined religion with honesty and an unequalled degree of meanness about stores he was little and of a pallor that no sun could touch he carried a hymnbook in his breastpocket and loose snuff in a side one i found no comfort in him and even less in the two mates they were much married men with large families and were subdued by the fear of losing their billets they hung together and abused the skipper and took no interest in the sea or any of its works they pined for inland farms where they would have been pelicans in a dry desert i turned to the crew and by dint of giving them tobacco and occasional nips of liquor overcame their distrust and shyness for even though i had once been a seaman that time was so far away that i had lost all look of it and even when they knew it they took it for granted i had been an officer which put me out of their range it was only my loneliness and my low cunning with rare whisky that made me free of their company and at last loosened their tongues i often sat with them in the dogwatches and set them yarning when i could by yarning myself but only one story that i heard remains in my memory it remains not so much by its strangeness as by the strange way it was told and the difficulty i had in getting it told at all it was one of the younger seamen that put me on the tracks of the man who had it to tell why dont you try old silent for a yarn sir he said one day when i was on the focastlehead with him on the lookout he that says nought could say a lot he might open up with you with us hes as close as a watertight compartment but they do say in this vessel that he came out of one ship the honly survivor what can one do on board a lonely steamer where there is no one to talk to and nothing to read and there are so many unoccupied hours in front of one the days were grey the sea was grey and as flat as last years news i set out yarnhunting and went for old silent as they called him i went for him warily to ask him a question would be to cheat oneself of any expectation i ceased to attempt to talk with him but having fallen into his mood i added to the compliment by giving him more tobacco on the quiet than i gave any one else i called him into my deck cabin and gave him a drink of whisky without a word he drank it without a word wiped his lips scraped a sort of bow and withdrew he was a melancholy man downcast raggedbearded with a glazed yellow skin on his face and shining scales upon the backs of his hands his teeth were black with tobaccochewing his ears had been pierced for earrings though he wore none his eyes were deepset black his mouth was a mere slit his ears large and outstanding like a couple of stunsails he was obviously strong even yet but he assuredly bore the marks of certain disastrous hours upon him and his nerves betrayed him at times i saw his hand shake when he lifted the drink to his lips youve been through something my friend i said to myself i wonder what it is its not only dt life to my mind is a series of fights and one is mostly knocked out i could see that old silent had been knocked out well so had i many a time and his gloomy face appealed to me as a man of like disasters to myself i saw ay and see so many who seem to have no kind of insight into things they are mere children and one pities them as one does young recruits going to war ive known men to die without suspecting it for the most part men live without suspecting any of the dangers traps pitfalls and disasters that surround them there was an uneasy alertness at times in this old seamans eye which suggested that he knew death was close at hand i watched him keenly enough for i had a great curiosity about him what was the story of this poor inhabitant of this strange globe what had he in common with those who see through illusion who can pierce the hollow earth and see the fires who can foretell storms who can scent immediate and irremediable death this was folly no doubt i was in a bad state of mind and had disaster behind me and the shadow of it before me there have been hours in many a mans life when the thought that he could end it was his only comfort without being in that state my frame of mind was not wholly enviable and i wanted some kind of help that i could not find what was it that sent me to old silent if not the intuition that he had known worse than i we talked at last at midnight for i had found the clue to his heart in some inscrutable way beyond my knowledge perhaps he saw something in me that invited confidence oddly enough strangers have often enough opened their hearts to me when i least expected it there is some deep necessity of confession in mens hearts and in speech they compel sympathyor at least they can plead their own cause tis a black night sir said the old man whose real name was gilby tis a black enough night he was on the lookout and it was the first hour after midnight i climbed up and stood beside him close against the windlass which looked in the dark like a stiff distorted corpse covered with merciful canvas the heavens were low and there was not one star visible wind there was none and the sea was a dulled plate of pale dark steel what air blew on the focastlehead we made ourselves the cargo derricks on their platforms held watch with us they looked diabolical and all alert under the straight stem of the hindoo the sea hissed lightly like water escaping from a cock the vibration of the engines was muffled forard but it beat like a steady pulse ay its a very dark night i answered as i stood alongside him in the very eyes of her i glanced up at the masthead light and what glow came to me blinded me still more but the light was a kind of comfort and so were the side lights one could believe with the chinese that a vessel might see with painted eyes on the bow neither of us spoke a word for full ten minutes youve been a seaman sir he asked presently twenty years ago i went back twenty years and was no more than a boy now was my twenty years after my old companions were dead or lost in the years twenty years you say sir there was something strange in his voice an eagerness a sharp pain full twenty i answered dreaming when i was young it seemed as if a man would forget anything in twenty years sir there were things one couldnt forget i knew that and i knew that here was an unforgetful heart of pain my curiosity seemed most unworthy and i was ashamed of it but the old man spoke and i knew he was not old its yesterday sir he said in a low voice and this very night in novembertwenty years ago a dark night enough and yet a strange light in it did you ever play jackallalone at sea sir was you ever by yourself at sea thats the terror of the sea sir a sticky wet clammy terror for weve mates in ships even if we dont speak have you ever felt the big sea and the sky sir spread out and spread over for you alone i had spent one night at sea alone in the english channel in the fine but foolhardy game of singlehanded sailing he brought it back to me now and i sat in a little fifteenfoot cutterrigged open boat in a great and gorgeous calm to the south and east of dungeness point at sunset the wind failed and left me at the will of the tides for a long hour the golden west was a wonder of fine colour and the sky overhead a most heavenly pale blue the low coast towards romney was a faint dark line submerged in the sea elms ashore looked like massed shipping a churchtower was dark against the sunset dungeness light glared over me and i drifted on the last of the northwest curve of the tide into its red sector shining like blood on the lip of the moving water an infinite and most infinitely deep silence oppressed and purified me this was the purification of the ancient and immortal tragedy of the sea i sat in a red flood and the day died the piety of the great darkness buried the earth till midnight came i was alone and was nothing a mere fleck of foam i was all things i was the world itself then a great fishingsmack drifted to me i spoke to a dim shadow in the heavy shadow of great sails that hung motionless i lost that voice again in the drifting of the tide and in a faint light air then at last the dawn broke and the winking lights of land died down and the day and the land arose and i was no longer alone i knew it for a night i said it is the rarest thing for any seaman to know in this was his disastrous story how did it happen to you would it hurt you to tell me or would it help there was no more unworthy curiosity in me and that i was purified of it he must have felt for this was a man who could feel and remember gods great gift of forgetfulness is mostly given to the highest and to the lowest only i drifted for a moment on my own sea of memory and when i came back i heard him speaking those who have been long silent come some day to an hour of strange and easy speech i and my brothers i heard his voice catch on the word and get over it with a bitter jar as a vessel might slide over a shoal in uncharted waters yet he knew those waters of marah well we was in a rotten old steamer sir them and me jack was my elder and a fine big chap good as gold and as brave and strong as a lion a real seaman such as one dont meet nowadays he mostly sailed in windjammers but he was one of those that like to see things and he had a fancy to potter round the mediterranean once in a way hed read a lot at sea one passage in a greens ship that had a fair pile of books in her for the crowd forard and hed a fancy to see italy and greece hed talk by the hour of old romans and a strange character that was at syracuse some time back i disremember his name but he was for science and arithmetic and he knew the name of a score of roman emperors quite pat and he said once when we was at the port of athens that a hill plain to be seen was the home of the gods in the days before christianity came to the fore he was a firstclass man at whatever he took to that he was and might have been high up if hed had a chance to be properly eddicated and billy my young brother was a fine boy of quite another guess sort he cared for nothing but fun and he was goodlooking and a rare youngster with his dooks ive seen him down a dutchman twice his weight and do it laughing he was bright as the day sir bright as sunlight and there we was the three of us in this rotten old tramp built in the year one of steamships and much the shape and size of a biscuittin and not much to her that was better material and so we mucked about the mediterranean looking for cargo like the seatramps we was and every time it blew a capful of wind we had to turn her nose to it and keep bobbing for if there was any kind of a sea on the beam shed roll so cruel that our hearts was in our mouths and billys joke was always the old seajoke that she had rolled right over in the night and done it so quick that no one knew it but i own she put the fear of god into most of us and some of us got that narvous we couldnt sit quiet unless there was a flat calm and her just joggin on ahead like an old haywagon we went down from barcelona with some sort of truck to constant and there jack did talk a lot about emperors and he was pleased as punch to see things saying that history grew rank thereabouts and he would ask the old skipper about things dead and gone thousands of years so that the old man never liking to own he wasnt chockablock with knowledge used to fidget like one oclock and get that cross with dodging twas a game to hear him and then we went humping up the black sea and brought out wheat from ibrail and we got stuck down at sulina and lightered her clear and had a holy time so that jack said making history in the wheat trade was no joke and we came out from constant for home but home we never got sir and to say the truth ive never been home since and never shall go do you know the mediterranean sir did i know it even as he talked i had been thinking of crete on our starboard beam at night and of etna right ahead at dawn and the white cities of the straits of lavabound catania of old historic syracuse of the sickleshaped harbour of messina of high taormina and the day breaking in the hollows of the grey calabrian hills then smoking stromboli a cinder peak of the seas and afterwards singing roaring naples and atmospheric capri sunk in sweet blue air oh did i know it ay i know it we came up with sicily and went in by the straits to drop some truck or another at messina and then out again to the north and when we were near alongside volcano it was looking bad and grey and hard as it does when a levanter threatens the sea got up and it was short and steep and hard sir and for a while we battered among the islands and volcano smoking and i dessay stromboli too but the smother of the weather was too thick to see it and i was on the lookout as i am now and jack he was relieved at the wheel as i came up on the focslehead he laughed up at me and said this topheavy old haywagon will be doin a roll directly and just as he went below the skipper who was as afraid of her as he had a right to be turned her about and put her nose into the wind there she stayed uneasy and sawin with her ead like a swell carriageorse and they just went ahead with the old scrapengines and stayed so reckoning to ride the gale out and she rode it right enough till night and we three brothers ad supper and passed our jokes and poor billy was as bright a kid as everoh i can think of things e said now he stopped speaking for a moment and dashed his fist on the rail by god its twenty years ago sir he said choking and old volcanos smoking yet like a giants pipe in the dark puff and glow puff and glow and that mandrowning tank we was in lies a thousand fathoms deep to the west of volcano he didnt speak for a while and when he did his voice was calmer dont think sir that id ha complained of the common fortunes of the sea men are drowned they go overboard silent it may be or they drop from aloft howling awful and in the smother of a wreck when the seas a wild beast its the lot of men to go ive seen fire at sea sir and death in many shapes sudden and slow killing and fever but the way my brothers diedwhy sir i held their hands and couldnt save em held their hands and could see their faces jackallalone seamen say i was jackallalone while they cried out to me you can reckon sir that such a craft such a rotten shaky scrapheap hooker such a thing that oughtnt to have been outside a river wasnt over well found and those that had the finding of er ad to make a bit of stealage alf the skippers and engineers of such takes their lives in their ands not for the pay but for the bit of a make and yet id not think it possible for the engineer to ave bin in the oil racket that came out that night they was short of oil in constant and got some aboard from a rotten levantine greek with a harmenian for partner and it was bad oil enough to be sure but the worst was that some o the drums was a quarter oil and the rest water and i being on deck after supper caught on to what the chief engineer said to our skipper he came up running and went on the bridge capen most o that oil was water and the oils that bad the bearins are overwarm cant i stop er stop er says the old man i knew that voice e was that narvous of his old tank why man if we stop er shell roll over the seas was eavy my word considering where we was she plunged and shook and creaked like a kicked tin can im edgin of er in under volcano says the skipper i want more steam not less by god you cant ave it said the engineer as desperate as you like play the ose on your blasted bearins pipes the skipper with a voice like a bosuns whistle im playin it says the other then you know what to do squeaks the old man and the engineer comes down tearin is very beard and i was took with a kind of a shiver which was curious seeing that mostly sailormen never gives a damn what appens till the worst opens its mouth for em i went down into the focsle and looked at jack fast asleep and billy under im there was only four of us forard and they two was the starboard watch that was the last time i saw more of em than their ands i went on deck again never wakin em and then i eard the engineer on deck again ill ave to stop my engines he cried or if i dont theyll stop theirselves theres three bearins sizzling and the white metals running and the enginerooms full o steam from the ose playin on em you cant stop said the skipper and the wind blew like a blast out of a pipe it squealed and she stopped amost dead give us a quarter of an hour says the old man and he puts the second mate alongside of him call the ands and rig up a seaanchor and that was too late for there was a crack below and a man screamed and the engineer bolted for his hole but the engines stopped right there and the nose of er paid off and she lay in the trough of the sea and rolled once and rolled twice and she went over to windward till youd ear everything crack and then she rolled to looard would she ever stop i see the old man slide away down the bridge squealin and the second mate pitched off his feet and i gave a yell and climbed up on the weather rail and old volcano glared red over us to the norard and she was crank and was never meant for the sea and she ad eavy useless spars and derricks that overweighted er and her grain was in bulk and not too much of it and the wind got hold of her and she never stopped i eard the old man yell again and the sea rose up against him and the sleeping mate was screamin in his berth with a jammed door and then i was jackallalone scramblin with bleedin fingers up a rotten wet iron slope and i stopped when i ad old of er very keel and then i eard an awful rip and a tearing and a boom under my feet and i reckoned the ole of er engines dropped through her deck and may be the boilers exploded for she gave a eave on the sea that made me sick and i ung on with my nails and i found myself cryin out billy and jack and i was mad that hour ay i was mad and i beat upon the black and weedy iron of the plates underneath me i was warm to think i was saved and i was a coward and i shook and trembled and nigh slipped off as the old scow wallowed twas most orrible to be earin warm and livin men speakin one moment to be among em and them talkin and to see the warm light and to ear the thump thump of the engines and the crackin and creakin of the old red star and then to be all alone jackallalone sailing and in and with death ove up not on an alf tide rock as the thing beneath me looked but a rotten old steamer turned turtle and like to slip away from me any moment and as i owled to myself and saw the white water run up and lip at me like openmouthed sharks i saw the red light of volcano away high up and the light was like the wink of a lightouse blinded in a fog and the sight of the land or where the land was maddened me and i cried like a child with weakness twas most orrible sir and weakness took me so that i slipped and nigh lost old of the keel but i climbed up again desperate and findin a bolt worked out i itched my belt to it and ung on and then i eard a sound that made my eart stop beatin twas as if some one was usin an ammer on iron and i knew that there was some one alive inside of the red star cooped up under er keel and shut into a tomb and i cried you cant get out you cant get out mates so that my voice made me afraid for twas a scream and like no voice id ever eard but i scrambled along the keel and came to where the ammerin was and then i knew that they was jack or billy or maybe both and i beat with my fists on the plates and i bled but didnt know it and i prayed all the plates was as rotten as we believed but they wasnt that bad and they was iron and iron bolted and id nought but a knife and what they was workin with inside i couldnt tell and they was in foul eavy air and in the blackest dark i prayed and i cursed and i beat again and some one eard for they knocked three times regular and three times again and to answer i beat with the eft of my knife and then they worked awful and there was bitter times when they rested and in all the cold of the levanter and the wetness of the flyin spray i sweated like a bull and then i was as cold as ice and in an our or more there was some sign that what they did was tellin on the plate they worked on for all of a sudden i eard a strange sound like the issing of steam blowin off twas the compressed air inside that kept the wreck afloat comin sharp out of a bit of a crack and i knew that every second shed sink more and more and i seemed to see that unless the plate came off quick they only die the quicker for tryin to escape and i called to em but they eard nothin only knowin that a man was above em and i got my knife under the plate and the blade broke i worked sobbin and all the time i was talkin twas madness plain and to be eard and then i felt a smash into the iron and the end of a splice bar came through it and the air screamed up under me and i knocked again three times and they knocked three times and i screamed out billy jack and the poor chaps eard me jacks voice came to me like a voice out o the grave thin and eager and all of a scream tomtom that was me oh the sea at my cold feet and the sound of the wind and the red pulsin of volcano and the round ump of the red star ove out o the sea like the bulk of a dead whale and under me my brothers theres brothers dont love each other i screamed workwork and the sea crawled up to me or so it seemed and the thick air spurted up at me that was their life and they broke out a bit more and twas an ole a mans and could come through and they stopped so that i cried again to em i eard jack plain im about done lad wheres billy i beat on cold and jagged iron hes here said jack but the airs too bad for him i bade him give me the bar and i worked outside like a mad one but theyd struck the only rotten spot and i couldnt get edge or claws of the bar under the plate the waters risin said jack he put is poor and out and i took it sir i didnt think there was a god then and the sea lipped at me and the red star wallowed and there was red on the edge of the lipping waves from a big glare of volcano ive no purchase to get an old out ere i said and still the ot thick air came up foul as could be and jack took the bar and dropped it theres a strange weakness comes over one breathin such air i eard is voice again the bars deep in water i cant feel it then e lifted billy and billy put is and out shes sinkin tom said billy e spoke like a chap in a dream and the water was to my feet as i sat across the keel and i felt the boys strength give and i eld is and tight but neither him nor jack spoke again and the boy struggled dreadful and presently er bows was deeper than er stern and i felt water inside of er and i knew they was dead and i ad an old of the boys and and me cryin and shriekin out i dont know what then e slipped away and i was all awash and i floated off and took old of a big bit of gratin and the old red star eaved up er stern a bit and then went down and i lay till dawn on the gratin no sensible man but crazy and old volcano winked at me like a red flare in a fog and i dreamed of sailin in a ship with jack captain as e meant to be some day being given to larnin and at daybreak a fishin craft took me into messina i walked the deck of the focslehead with him for many long silent minutes then some one struck two bells aft and he struck it on the big bell at the break of the focslehead then he walked forard alone he called to me after a minute do you see a light on the port bow sir he asked me i see it gilby thats volcano sir he reported it to the officer on the bridge the mutinous conduct of mrs ryder although watchett of the battleaxe and ryder of the star of the south were cousins there was no great love lost between them and all unprejudiced observers declared that this lack of mutual admiration was in no way due to captain ryder that they remained friends at all was owing largely to his infinite goodnature and to the further fact that mrs ryder pitied mrs watchett i wonder she goes to sea with him at all she said if you were onequarter as horrid as your cousin will i should never go to sea till you came ashore but she always went to sea with will ryder it was their great delight to be together and there were few men married or single who did not take a certain pleasure in seeing how fond they were of each other he was a typical seaman of the best kind he had a fine voice for singing and for hailing the foretopsail yard his eyes were as blue as forgetmenots and his skin was as clear as the air on the cordilleras which peeped at them over the tops of the barren hills which surround the bay of valparaiso and mrs ryder was just the kind of wife for a man who was somewhat inclined to take things easily if she was as pretty as a peach she had like the peach something inside which was not altogether soft her brown eyes could turn black she had resolution and courage you shall not put up with it was a favourite expression on her tongue and there were times to use his own expression when she made sail when he would have shortened it in that sense she was certainly capable of carrying on both vessels were barques of about tons register and if the star of the south had about twenty tons to the good in size she was rather harder to work it is the nature of ships to develop in certain ways and though both of these barques were sister ships it is always certain that sister ships are never quite alike but as they belonged to the same port of london and were owned by two branches of the same family all of whose money was divided up in ths according to the common rule with ships they were rivals and rival beauties but unlike the more respectable ladies who owned them both the vessels were fast and it was a sore point of honour with ryder and watchett to prove their own the faster if she only worked it a little easier i could lick his head off said ryder sadly but there was the rub the star of the south needed more beef in her than the battleaxe she wasnt so quick in stays by the time ryder yelled let go and haul the battleaxe was gathering headway on a fresh tack and instead of having two more hands than we are allowed we are two short said his wife bitterly if i were you will id take these greeks not by an entire jugful replied captain ryder i remember the lennie and the caswell my dear i never knew valparaiso so bare of men and were sailing tomorrow said connie ryder angrily and youve betted him a hundred pounds we shall dock before him its too bad i wonder whether hed give us another day but ryder shook his head and youve known him for years hes spending that money in his mind but not on his wife will said mrs ryder if we win im to have it id give him twenty to let me off said ryder but connie ryder went on board the battleaxe to see if she could not induce her husbands cousin to forgo the advantage he had already gained before sailing she found him dark and grim and as hard as adamant a bets a bet and business is business said watchett we appinted tomorrow and bar lying out a gale from the north with two anchors down and cables out to the bitter end ill sail his wife who was as meek as milk suggested humbly that it would be more interesting if he waited i aint in this for interest im in it for capital said watchett grinning gloomily the more like a dead certainty it looks the better i shall be pleased mrs ryder darkened i dont think youre a sportsman said she rather curtly i aint retorted watchett im a seaman and him thatd go to sea for sport would go to hell for pastime you can tell bill ill give him ten per cent discount for cash now as mrs ryder knew that he never called her husband bill unless he desired to be more or less offensive she showed unmistakable signs of temper if i ever get half a chance to make you sorry i will she said let it go at that said watchett sulkily i got on all right with bill before you took to going to sea with him he was too soft with you said bills wife and a deal softer with you than id be said watchett oh please please dont cried mary watchett in great distress i thought you were a gentleman said connie ryder not you replied watchett you never and you know it im not one and never hankered to be im rough and tough and a seaman of the old school im no sea dandy im jack watchett as plain as you like youre much plainer than i like retorted his cousins wife very much plainer and though she kissed mary watchett she wondered greatly how any woman could kiss mary watchetts husband if i ever get a chance she said but there how can i she wept a little out of pure anger as she returned to the star of the south when she got on board she found the mate and second mate standing by the gangway is there no chance of those men mr semple no more than if it was the year and this was san francisco said the mate who was a hoaryheaded old seadog a great deal more like the old school than plain jack watchett why doesna the captain take the greeks maam asked mgill the second mate who had been almost long enough out of scotland to forget his own language because he doesnt like any but englishmen said connie ryder and scotch of course she added as she saw mgills jaw fall a little ive been trying to get captain watchett to give us another day all our ship and cargo to a paper bag of beans he didnt said semple ii hate him cried connie ryder as she entered the cabin shes as keen as mustard as red pepper said semple if shed been a man shed have made a seaman ive never sailed wi a skeepers wife before said mgill who had shipped in the star of the south a week before in place of the second mate who had been given his discharge for drunkenness is she at all interferin mr semple old semple nodded she interferes some and it would be an obstinate cook that disputed with her she made a revolution in the galley my word when she first came on board some would say she cockered the crew over much but i was long enough in the focsle not to forget that even a hog of a man dont do best on hogwash which was a marvellous concession on the part of any of the afterguard of any ship seeing how the notion persists among owners and even among officers that the worse men are treated the better they work she seems a comfortable ship owned mgill and so every one on board of her allowed though she is a bit of a heartbreaker to handle said the men forard but for that she be a daisy and to think that the bally battleaxe goes about like a racing yacht it made them sore to think of it but it also made the men on board their rival sore to think how comfortable the star of the south was in all other respects the old man ere makes up for any ease wiv wich we ploughs the briny seas declared bill gribbs who was a cockney of the purest water with a turn for reciting poetry and playing the concertina for two pins id desert im too merry for old watchett ill make a new chanty for im speshul exteree speshul same as i did for the cook comin out and it took the doctor the best part of a month to get over it and do the ash alf proper agin said the rest of the crowd sadly poetry and music will be your undoin gribbs it dont pay us forard to guy them as is aft and didnt the old man stop my playin my concertina on sundays asked gribbs and all because i dont know no ymn tunes as they says out ere it tires me to think of it ill be gettin even wiv im some day ill commit susancide and aunt im owsever wots the odds for its ome deary ome its ome i wish to be and were sailin in the mawnin owing to the fact that the battleaxes crowd was sulky the star of the south got her anchor out of the ground and stood to the northwest to round point angelos a good ten minutes before watchetts vessel was under way thats good said connie ryder i know theyre a sulky lot by now in the battleaxe and our men work like dears it was with difficulty she kept from tailing on to the braces as they jammed the star close up to weather the point for the wind was drawing down the coast from the norard and valparaiso harbour faces due north she was glad when they rounded the point and squared away for if there was any real difference in the sailing qualities of the rival barques the star was best with the wind free and the battleaxe when she was on a bowline and with any real luck said mrs ryder we may have a good fair wind all the way till we cross the line it was so far ahead to consider the northeast trades which meant such mighty long stretches on a wind that she declined to think of them were doing very well will she said to her husband when the starboard watch went below and the routine of the passage home commenced its early days replied will ryder i fancy the battleaxe is in her best trim for a wind astern but mrs ryder didnt believe it and if she is she maynt be so good when it comes to beating she knew what she was talking about and spoke good sense its going to be luck said ryder if either of us get a good slant that the other misses the last will be out of it but i wish id had those other two hands the star wants beef on the braces mr semple as soon as possible see all the parrals greased and the blocks running as free as you can make em and semple did his best as the crew did but mrs ryder had her doubts as to whether her husband was doing his for once he seemed to think failure was a foregone conclusion i think it must be his liver said mrs ryder ill see to that at once but instead of looking up the medicinechest she came across the pacific directory i never thought of that she said hes never done it now he shall she took the big book down and read one part of it eagerly i dont see why not she decided and she went to her husband with the request that he should run through magellans straits when he came to it not for dollars said will ryder when im skipper of a pacific navigation boat ill take you through but not till then but look at all you cut off urged his wife if you get through and how you are cut off if you dont retorted ryder when i was an apprentice i went through in fine weather for the straits and id rather drive a bus down fleet street in a fog than try it she said he had very little enterprise and pouted suppose the battleaxe does it ryder declined to suppose it john wouldnt try it if you guarantee the weather i know him you never take my advice said his wife i love you too much replied will ryder he put his arm about her but she was cross and pushed him away this is mutiny said the captain smiling well i feel mutinous retorted connie i wanted you to steal two of your cousins men and you wouldnt im sure they would have come for what the battleaxe owed them and you wouldnt and now i want to go through the straits and you wont the very very next time that i want to do anything i shall do it without asking you why did you bet a hundred pounds if you werent prepared to try to win it well win yet said the skipper cheerfully weve only just started the two vessels kept company right down to the horn and there between ildefonso island and the diego ramirez islands the star of the south lost sight of her sister and rival in a dark souwesterly gale with the wind astern when they squared away with cape horn frowning to the norwest the star was a shooting star as they said forard if we could ony carry a gale like this right to the line wed ave a pull over the battleaxe maam said silas bagge an old focsleman who was mrs ryders favourite among all the crew he was a magnificent old chap with a long white beard which he wore tucked inside a guernsey except in fine weather but we cant therell be the trades said the captains wife dolorously ive picked up the soueast trade blowin a gale maam before now said bagge years ago in or thereabouts i was in the secunderabad and we crossed the line bound south doing eleven closeauled and we carried em to south latitude theres times when it is difficult to say where the trades begin south too mebbe well be chased by such a gale as this nigh up to south its hoping too much said mrs ryder hope till ye bust maam said silas bagge nothins lost till its won if we can only get out of the doldrums without breakin our hearts working the ship theres no knowing whatll appen twas a pity we didnt get them other two ands though and there she agreed with him me and bob condy could ave got gribbs and tidewell out of the battleaxe as easy as eat said silas regretfully twas a lost hopportunity and there you are the honourable conduct of his skipper in vetoing this little game seemed no more than foolishness to bagge when we comes to the hequator and its square away and brace up every five minutes till ones ands are raw twill be a grief to every mothers son aboard said bagge as he touched his cap and went forard but now the star of the south went booming on the outside of the falklands with a gale that drew into the sousouwest and howled after her she scooped up the seas at times and dipped her nose into them and threw them apart and wallowed the men were happy for the focsle didnt leak and the galleyfire was kept going every night to dry their clothes at midnight every man got a mug of cocoa and those that rose up called mrs ryder blessed and those that lay down agreed with them the star was a happy ship there was no rule against playing the concertina on a sunday in her focsle and the men were not reduced to playing blind swaps with their oldest rags for amusement as they were in the battleaxe and yet every man in the star knew his time for growling was coming on with every pitch and scend of the sea oly sailor buy a knife and ave a shackle to it said bob condy who was the lightesthearted of a happy crowd but when were pintin all round the compass in the doldrums wont my pore ands suffer ive a notion well go through the orse latitoods flyin were carryin a good gale and shell draw into the eastward by and by and there he was right for they picked up the trades in nearly south with only a few days of a light and variable breeze and the trades were good but wheres the battleaxe asked mrs ryder she kept a bright lookout for her and deeply regretted that her petticoats prevented her going aloft to search the horizon for john watchett she rubbed her hands in hope i do believe will that we must be ahead of him she declared after the southeast trade had been steady on the stars starboard beam for a week not much ahead replied will and just then bob condy who was aloft on the foretgallant yard cutting off old seizings and putting on new ones hailed the deck theres a sail on the port beam sir take a glass aloft and have a look at her mr mgill said the skipper no never mind ill go myself as youve never seen the battleaxe at sea i know the cut of her jib and no mistake so will ryder went up on the main topgallant yard and with his leg astride of the yard took a squint to looard he shut up the glass so quick that his wife knew at once that the distant sail was the battleaxe as he came down slowly he nodded to her it is rather said ryder im sorry weve no stunsails were carrying all weve got and all we can and to think hes as good as we were on our own point of sailing said his wife with the most visible vexation cant you do anything to make her go faster will and when will said he couldnt unless he got out and pushed mrs ryder sat on a hencoop and very nearly cried for if the battleaxe had done so well up to this she would do better in the dead regions of the line and the star would do much worse there the want of a few more hands would tell the star was no good at catching catspaws shorthanded she worked like an unoiled gate if id only done what silas bagge wanted she said wed have been all right to think that the want of a couple of hands should make all the difference it was cruelly hard but when vessels are undermanned at any time less than their complement means pull devil pull baker with the devil best at the tug of war for days there was nothing to choose between the vessels save that the unusual strength of the trades gave the star a trifling advantage every night watchett took in his royals this ryder declined to do though he often expected them to take themselves in what did i say maam said old bagge i told you it could blow quite eavy in its way in the southeast trades and thus it happened that what the star lost by day she pulled up by night and presently the battleaxe edged up closer and at last was within hailing distance watchett stood on his poop with a speakingtrumpet and roared in sombre triumph im as good as you this trip on your best pint ryder tell him to go totothunder said mrs ryder angrily nevertheless she waved her handkerchief to her enemys wife who was standing by plain jack watchett youve done mighty well said ryder in his turn but it isnt over yet jack watchett intimated that he thought it was he offered to double the bet he also undertook to sail round the star of the south in a light wind he offered to tow her and made himself so disagreeable that mrs ryder who knew what became a lady went below to prevent herself snatching the speakingtrumpet from her husband and saying things for which she would be sorry afterwards but ryder though he was by no means a saint kept his temper and only replied with chaff which was much more offensive to watchett than bad language and dont be too sure he added i may do you yet not you said watchett im cocksure they sailed in company for a week and gradually as the trade lessened in driving power the battleaxe drew ahead inch by inch and as she did mrs ryders appetite failed she looked thin and ill dont feel it so much chickabiddy said her husband i cant help it sobbed connie i hate your cousin oh will if youd only let me entice those two men from him bagge was sure that gribbs and tidewell would have come it wouldnt have been fair said ryder ii wwanted to win replied connie and itll be calm directly and you know what that means it was calm directly and very soon every one knew what it meant for it was a real fat streak of a calm that both vessels ran into and as luck would have it the battleaxe which was by now almost hull down to the norard got into it first the star of the south carried the wind with her till she was within a mile of her rival for a whole day they pointed their jibbooms alternately at africa and south america to the north pole and the south what little breeze there was after that day took them further still into an absolute area of no wind at all this is the flattest calm i ever saw said ryder in such a calm as this he has no advantage they boxed the compass for the best part of a week and lay and cooked in a sun that made the deck seams bubble at night the air was as hot as it had been by day the men lay on deck on the deckhouse on the focslehead this is a bally scorcher said the crews of both ships lets whistle they whistled feebly but the god of the winds had gone a journey or was as fast asleep as dagon and day by day the two vessels drifted together at last they had to lower the boats and tow them apart watchett was very sick with the whole meteorology of the universe and being a wholesouled man incapable of more than one animosity at a time he found no time to spare from damning a heaven of brass to damn ryder at the end of the week he even hailed the star and offered to come on board and bring his wife i dont want him said connie ryder i wont have him and as she said this she jumped as if a pin had been stuck into her whats the matter asked her husband nothing said connie but let him come she went forard to interview the cook so she said but she really went to interview silas bagge when she came back she found watchett and his wife on board if she was a little stiff with watchett he never noticed it as a matter of fact the whims and fads and tempers of a woman were of no more account than the growling of the men forard he was too much engaged in cursing the weather to pay her any attention this licks me he said in a week we aint moved were stuck ow long will it last bill it looks as if it might last for ever replied ryder weve struck a bad streak the women had tea and the men drank whisky and water although watchett didnt know it two of his hands left the boat and were given something to eat in the galley by mrs ryders orders it was bagge who conveyed the invitation with the connivance of the mate for whom the word of the captains wife was law ave some marmalade and butter said bagge does they feed you good in the battleaxe gribbs hogwash said gribbs with his mouth full aint it tidewell tidewell who was a youngster of a good middleclass family who had gone to sea as an apprentice and run from his ship agreed with many bitter words as i told you we lives like fightincocks ere said bagge when youre full to the back teeth well ave your mates up we likes to feed the pore and ungry dont we doctor the cook to whom bagge had confided something said he did his best his humble best the stars an appy ship he added we know what your ship is the other two men came up in their turn and were filled with tea and biscuit and butter and marmalade till they smiled this is like home said wat crampe who was from newcastle it wass petter much petter said evan evans and ass for the captains wife she iss a lady whateffer that evening ryder and his wife returned the call and were rowed to the battleaxe by bagge bob condy and two more of the men bagge and condy went into the focsle they lost no time in blaspheming the battleaxe and in lauding their own ship this eres a stinkin ooker mates said silas bagge why our focsle is a ladys droringroom compared with it and as for the grub ask them as came on board us this afternoon what d ye say gribbs toppin said gribbs its spiled my happetite ere it wass good said the welshman it wass good whateffer bagge took billy gribbs aside on the deck and had a talk with him oh lord said gribbs eh what straight talk replied silas she said so do you mean it do i mean it returned silas with unutterable scorn in course i mean it it will sarve them right as it sarves right gribbs held on to the rail and laughed till he ached its the rummest notion i ever eard tell on not so rummy wot cried gribbs not so rummy well it aint so rummy im jiggered ill think of it do it and tell your mate tidewell if i tell ned ell do it for sure es the biggest joker ere then tell him said silas that evening ned tidewell and billy gribbs acted in a very strange way on board the battleaxe without any obvious reason they kept on bursting into violent fits of laughter the poor blokes is gone dotty from the eat said the pitying crowd weve eard of such before why shouldnt i laugh asked gribbs im laughin because im a pore silly sailorman and my life aint worth livin if id died early id ha bin saved a pile o trouble i was thinkin of my fathers green fields as i looked over the side this afternoon was you really asked the oldest man on board then you take my advice quick and go and ask the skipper for a real good workin pill of the largest size wot for asked gribbs because you hobvus got a calentoor said the old focsleman and chaps as gets a calentoor jumps overboard oh but thats well known at sea by them as knows anythin but gribbs laughed the worst is as its catchin said his adviser anxiously its fatally catchin ive eard of crews doin it one hafter the hother till there warnt no one left in eat it was and in calm gammon said gribbs but he was observed to sigh are you ot in your ead asked the anxious and ancient one i feels a little ot and rummy said gribbs but what i chiefly feels is a desire to eat grass the old man groaned then its got you mates we ought to tie gribbs up or lock him in the saillocker or is clothes will be auctioned off before long but gribbs kicked at that and just then eight bells struck im turnin in said gribbs and im all right but at six bells in the first watch he was missing as was discovered by old brooks the authority on calentures he waked up ned tidewell who was extraordinarily fast asleep wheres gribbs not in my bunk returned ned who with gribbs was one of the few who still dossed in the focsle then es gone overboard for sartin said brooks in great alarm there was the look of it in is eye and in yours too youngster these long calms is fataler than scurvy ill go aft and report it he reported it to mr seleucus thoms the second mate who came forard and roused the scattered watch below from the deckhouse and tgallant focsle when all hands were mustered it was certain that gribbs was missing this is a terrible catastrophe said seleucus thoms who had a weakness for fine language derived from his rare christian name of which he was extremely proud my name is not seleucus thoms if he hasnt gone overboard e was most rampagious with laughter in the second dogwatch sir put in old brooks and e talked of green fields the which i ve eard is a werry fatal symptom of calentoor humph said mr thoms theres something in that and when he went forard old brooks was as proud as a dog with two tails though he usually spent the second dogwatch daily in proving that thoms was no sailor this endorsement of his theory flattered him greatly ive been mistook in the second he said as thoms went aft hes got orse sense after all i shouldnt be surprised if ed make a sailor some day and thoms reported the catastrophe to watchett drowned himself roared the captain drowned himself and whos responsible if you aint he came on deck in a great rage and scanty pyjamas and mustered the crew aft and raved at them for full ten minutes as if it were their fault when he had relieved his mind he asked if there was any one who could throw light on the matter and old brooks was shoved to the front he explained his views on calentures never eard of em said watchett and i thinks sir as tidewell ere as the symptoms i havent said tidewell indignantly wild laughin is a known symptom sir and tidewell was laughin orrid in the second dogwatch insisted brooks id put im in irons sir but watchett was not prepared to go so far in prophylaxis if any of you as any more symptoms ill flog im and take the consequences he declared he went below again unhappily for he wasnt quite a brute after all this is a mighty unpleasant thing he said to poor mrs watchett who cried when she heard the news its a mighty unfortunate affair gribbs was the smartest man in the whole crowd and worth two of the others but still the great and terrible calm lasted and the morning was as hot as yesterday and the sea shone like polished brass and lapped faintly like heavy oil against the glowing iron of the sister barques at dawn which came up like a swiftly opening flower out of the fertile east the vessels were just too far apart for hailing and watchett signalled the news to the star of the south lost a man overboard said ryder thats strange i wish to heavens wed found him when he told his wife she seemed extraordinarily callous serves him right she said and it was wonderful how the crew of the star took the news they had never seemed so cheerful they grinned when watchett came aboard this is an orrid circumstance said watchett i never lost a man before not even when i was wrecked in the violet and this a dead calm your men arent happy said mrs ryder and you dont try to make em if i give you three sevenpound tins of marmalade and some butter will you serve it out to them but watchett shook his head angrily ill not cocker no men up he declared not if they all goes overboard and leaves me and the missis to take er home and whats marmalade against eat like this he mopped a melancholy brow and sighed it will help them to keep from gloomy thoughts said mrs ryder the star of the south is a home for our men and two run in valparaiso retorted watchett and i lost ony one he took a drink with his cousin and went back on board the battleaxe and put the horrid day through in getting a deal of unnecessary work done and still no flaw of lightest air marred the mirror of the quiet seas early in the first watch the boats were lowered again to tow the vessels apart at midnight when the watch below came aft and answered to their names in the deep shadow of the moonless tropic night ned tidewell did not answer to his name tidewell cried thoms angrily and anxiously and still there was no answer but a groan from old brooks wot did i tell you he demanded i seed it in is eye they searched the battleaxe from stem to stern they overhauled the sails in the saillocker they hunted with a lantern in the forepeak they even went aloft to the fore and maintops where once or twice some one who sought for coolness where no coolness could be found went up into what they jocosely called the attic but ned had lost the number of his mess more clothes for sale said the melancholy crew as they looked at each other suspiciously ooll be the next brooks declared to the other focsleman that the next would be wat crampe or taffy as they called the welshman theres an awful orrid look of the deep dark knowledge o death in their faces declared old brooks they thinks of the peace of it and the quiet and smiles secret next morning watchett hailed the star and told the latest dreadful news and at the end he added in a truly pathetic roar send me them tins o marmalade aboard and the butter and when mrs ryder superintended the stewards work getting these stores out of the lazarette she smiled very strangely she said to her husband if he loses another hand or two the battleaxe will be no easy ship to work will i wouldnt have believed the matter of a hundred pounds would have made you so hard said ryder and connie ryder pouted mutinously and her pout ran off into a wicked and most charming smile im not thinking so much of the money as of our ship being beaten she said and poor watchett was now beginning to think the same of his ship like most vessels the battleaxe required a certain number of men to work her easily and her luck lay in the number allowed being the number necessary with two hands gone amissing she would not be much superior to the star in easiness of handling and if more went a week of baffling winds now or later when the northeast trade died out might give the star a pull which nothing but an easterly wind from the chops of the channel to dover could hope to make up he began to dance attendance on his crew as if they were patients and he their doctor and the curious thing was that they all began to feel ill at once so ill that they could not work in the sun a certain uneasy terror got hold of them they dreaded to look over the side lest in place of an oily sea they should look down on grass and daisies daisies draws a man and buttercups draws a man said old brooks dont said crampe with a snigger you make me feel that i must pick buttercups or die do you now asked brooks do you now and he sneaked aft to the skipper who was turning all ways as if he were wondering where windward was im very uneasy about crampe sir he said with a scrape as he crawled up the port poopladder is mind is set on buttercups the devil it is cried watchett and going down on the maindeck he called crampe out whats this i ears about you ankerin after buttercups he demanded very anxiously i did feel as if id like to see one sir said crampe dont let me ear of it again began watchett angrily but he pulled himself up with an ill grace but there go in and lie down and you neednt come on deck in your watch i cant afford to lose no more mad fools and you shall ave butter instead of buttercups and marmalade sir suggested crampe marmalade is yellow too yellow as buttercups say the word agin and ill knock you flat said the skipper but nevertheless he sent the whole crowd marmalade and butter at four bells in the first dogwatch ho but it iss fine said efan efans thiss iss goot grup whateffer and moreover yess they scoffs the like in the star day in and day out said crampe if i cant roll on grass id like to be in her and that night both crampe and evans disappeared i believes i eard a splash soon after six bells said old brooks mates this is most orrid i feels as if i should be drawed overboard by a mermaid in spite of myself and watchett went raving crazy he blasphemed his mate till the man was ready to jump overboard too he turned on thoms and slanged him until the second greaser walked to the port rail of the poop and discharged a number of silent curses which would have done credit to the skipper of a barge if they had been spoken aloud at dark lock the lot up in the focsle said watchett and not a soul comes out till daylight if this goes on longer well stick in the doldrums till the day of judgment ryder came on board the battleaxe as soon as the latest news was signalled to him mrs ryder declined to go but she gave him a timely piece of advice dont let him off the bet will or ill never forgive you i wont do that said her husband hastily as if he hadnt been thinking of doing it and if he asks for a man or two you know were shorthanded already tell me something i dont know said ryder a trifle crossly even his sweet temper suffered in in the shade i dare say i could said his wife when he was in his boat i dare say i could watchett received his cousin with an air of gloom that would have struck a damp on anything anywhere but the equator this is a terrible business he said i never eard of anything like it every night a man and last night two ryder was naturally very much cut up about it and said so will you have some more marmalade he asked anxiously marmalade dont work said watchett sadly it dont work worth a cent nor does butter id give five pounds for some green cabbage a brilliant idea struck ryder why dont you paint her green all the inside of the rail and the boats shed be a holy show like a blasted timberdroghing swede said watchett with great distaste but dye think itd work you might try replied ryder and now youve got the bulge on me sighed watchett with two ands missin from both watches shell be as ard in the mouth as your star you might let me off that bet bill no said ryder a bets a bet but fairness is fairness urged watchett there should be a clause in a bet renderin it void by the act of god or the queens enemies there isnt said his cousin and you forget you wouldnt help me about those two hands i wanted oh if you talk like that thats the way i talk said ryder remembering the wife he had left behind him im sorry damn your sorrow said watchett but ill lose no more and taint your money yet will you and mary come on board to tea asked ryder i wont tea with no unfair person with no sympathy returned watchett savagely and when ryder had gone he set the crowd painting his beautiful white paint a ripe grass green watch if it soothes em any he said to seleucus thoms if it seems to work ill paint er as green as a childs noahs ark and that night there was no decrease of the battleaxes sad crowd in spite of the fact that he did not keep his word and lock them up in the stuffy focsle for soon after midnight the mate mr double felt one side of his face cooler than the other as he stood staring at the motionless lights of the star of the south then lying stern on to the battleaxes starboard beam eh what jerusalem said double then he let a joyous bellow out of him square the yards for there was a breath of wind out of the south both vessels were alive in a moment and while the battleaxe was squaring away the stars foreyard was braced sharp up on the starboard tack till she fell off before the little breeze then she squared her yards too and both vessels moved at least a mile towards home before they began fooling all round the compass again them hands missin makes a difference said watchett gloomily less than enough is starvation as they fought through the night for the flaws of wind which came out of all quarters the short watches of the battleaxe found that out and cursed accordingly but it was a very curious thing that the star of the south was never so easy to handle that foreyard goes round now said old semple as if it was hung like a balance this is very surprising so it is he mentioned the remarkable fact to mgill when he came on deck at four in the morning and so long as it was dark as it was till nearly six mgill found it so too and both watches were in a surprisingly good temper for nothing tries men so much as brace up and square away every five minutes as they work their ship through a belt of calm but as soon as the sun was up the star worked just as badly as she did before its maist amazin said mgill during the day the calm renewed itself and gave every one a rest but once more the breeze came at night and the amazing easiness of the star showed itself when the darkness fell across the sea ryder and semple and mgill were full of wonder and delight the character of a ship will change sometimes said semple its just like a collision that will alter her deviation this calm has worked a revolution because of this revolution the star got ahead of the battleaxe every change and chance of the wind she got ahead with such effect that on the third day the battleaxe was hull down to the southard and when the fourth dawn broke she was out of sight this meant much more than may appear for the star picked up the northeast trade nearly four days earlier than her rival and a better trade at that for when the battleaxe crawled into its area it was halfsister to a calm while the star was doing eight knots an hour and as there was now no need to touch tack or sheet there was no solution of the mysterious ease with which she worked in the dark how long the mystery might have remained such no one can say but it was owing to mrs ryders curious behaviour that it came out she laughed in the strangest manner till ryder got quite nervous those chaps that jumped overboard from the battleaxe laughed like that he told her in great anxiety and she giggled more and more shall i try marmalade she asked then she sat down by him and went off into something so like hysterics that a mere man might be excused for thinking she was crazy theyre not dead she cried theyre not dead who arent dead asked her husband desperately and remembering something which had been told him years before he took her hands and slapped with such severity that she screamed and then cried and finally put her head upon his shoulder and confessed was it mutiny of me to do it she asked penitently will ryder tried to look severe and then laughed until he cried whatever made you think of it it wasnt a what it was a who said his wife it was silas bagge the devil it was said will and with that he went on deck call all hands and let them muster aft he said to mgill who much wondering did what he was told the watch on deck dropped their jobs and the watch below turned out call the names over said ryder sternly theyre all here sir said mgill the skipper looked down at the upturned faces of the men and singled out silas bagge as if he meant to speak to him but he checked himself and going down on the main deck walked forard to the focsle the men turned to look after him and there was a grin on every face which would have been ample for two ryder walked quickly and pushing aside the canvas door he came on a party playing poker he heard strange voices i go one petter moreover said one of them i see you and go two better said a man with a newcastle burr in his speech then ryder took a hand and i see you he remarked they dropped their cards and jumped to their feet what are you doing here he demanded and there wasnt a word from one of them they looked as sheepish as four stowaways interviewing the skipper before a crowd of passengers get on deck said ryder and much to mgills astonishment the addition to the crew appeared with the captain behind them divide this lot among the watches said ryder leaving mgill to tumble to the racket he walked to the mates berth and explained to him that henceforth the star of the south would go about as easy by day as by night then theyre not dead cried semple not by a jugful said ryder nodding this is very lucky sir said the mate smiling its devilish irregular too replied the skipper as he rubbed his chin are you sure you knew nothing of it mr semple me sir why id look on it as mutiny said semple rank mutiny it was mrs ryders notion semple you dont say so sir shes a woman to be proud of so she is replied ryder so she is he went back to his wife youll win the hundred pounds now will i believe i shall said ryder and ill spend it cried his wife coming to him and kissing him i believe you will said ryder it was a happy ship the comedy of the oriana if the oriana of liverpool was a comfortable ship and every one who was in her said so captain joseph ticehurst was no fool he worked his crowd reasonably but saw that they did work and if any of them shirked or malingered the result was unpleasant for the one who tried such a game on with the quiet and gentlemanly skipper and his mates took their time from him to put it on no higher level said captain ticehurst it pays to make a ship comfortable when she visits the pacific coast of north america for as things are now if we lose the crew in portland we shall have to pay the boardinghouse masters at least a hundred and fifty dollars a man and as like as not every man we took will be worth two and a half dollars at the most i know the pacific and you dont for both his mate and second mate were with him for the first time is that the bloodmoney one hears of sir asked mr gregg the second greaser thats it said ticehurst and last voyage i had to pay a hundred dollars each for six men to healy the boardinghouse master and i own i lost my temper i swore id never do it again and healy grinned in my face and said that hed see i paid more next time the scoundrel seems to have the whole city in his hands and half the newspapers oh i tell you the pacific coast is an eyeopener to a man who has never been on it i tell you that the oriana was then running north with a fine southwesterly breeze the coast of oregon showed up clearly with good glasses it was possible to see mount shasta on the starboard quarter its snows gleamed in the westering sun and to the north was the range of the siskyous we shall be off the mouth of the columbia by noon tomorrow with any luck and if the breeze holds said ticehurst to himself and in the morning ill have a talk to the men if i could only knock a little sense into a sailor id try to do it as one cant ill try talk he leant his back against the weatherrail and took a broad view of oregon different ship different fash as the dutchman said when he went aft to haul down the jib thought the captain and its the same with countries i know im in for trouble with my friend healy hell move heaven and earth and the other place to get the men out of my ship ill fight him to a finish this time and rather than pay him for men ill take her to sea by myself and drift her home he rubbed his smoothlyshaven chin and took a thoughtful pull at his port whiskers as if he were checking in the weather braces after all the men would be crazy to quit theres hardly one of them with less than fifteen pounds to take i think i see how to manage it ill try anyhow that night he had a long talk with the mate he astonished mr williams considerably for williams by nature belonged to the school which considers a sailor in the light of a punchingbag it had required one or two private interviews with his skipper to induce him to relinquish practices to which he was wedded well sir this is a revolution he declared rather glumly im a radical said ticehurst and believe in revolutions when required ill speak to the men tomorrow when theyve had their breakfast im no believer in coddling men mr williams but if i have to ask you and mr gregg to carry them hot shavingwater every morning while we are in portland river in order to do this healy i shall expect you to carry it oh very well sir said williams and he retired to his cabin in some dudgeon its the principle im thinkin of he declared as he turned in the principle he believed in was that sailors should expect nothing and that he was to see they got it his prejudices broke through his discretion when he turned out at midnight to take the middle watch has the old man bin letten you into his sailorcockerin scheme for doin this healy in the eye he asked no replied gregg his notion is to feed em on the fat of oregon and give them hot whisky and water before they turn in and you and i have got to tuck the dears up and bring them shavinwater in the mornin who are you getting at asked the incredulous second greaser youll see said the mate its as near that as a toucher and therell be a dance on board every night and private theatricals every other day and every day sunday with no work in between and though his imagination did run away with him the skippers notions as he expounded them to the assembled crowd next morning were certainly novel ive sent for you men to tell you that tonight we shall be in portland river he began the men stared at him eagerly they wondered what kind of a game was up and ticehurst leant over the rail at the break of the poop how many of you have been in portland before five men held up their hands and how many more in pacific coast ports such as frisco or tacoma three more said that they had the skipper nodded i want to know how many of you left your ships there speak up and tell the truth the eight men shuffled about a bit and finally a seaman called jacobs opened his mouth yes jacobs said ticehurst i reckon we all more or less skipped out sir said jacobs and no one contradicted him i thought so said the skipper and ill tell you what happened you left a ship and left from ten to twenty pounds behind and you went to healys or to sants at tacoma and were drunk on bad liquor for a week and then found yourselves without any clothes to speak of in a homewardbounder with an advance of thirty dollars to work out didnt you thats about it sir said the shamefaced jacobs yes sir said the rest and when you got home you had two months pay or thereabouts to draw less what you paid for clothes out of the slop chest that is you spent six months at sea and a week ashore for about ten pounds and a bad headache whereas if you had stayed by your ships you might have saved yourselves the headache saved your clothes and have got back to england with a payday of twenty pounds jacobs what is the worst kind of a fool you know and jacobs answered promptly if you please sir its a sailor i dont say that it is always your fault if you desert went on ticehurst after he had drawn the reply which was the moral of his tale i know some of you may have been run out of your ships and i know that some captains are too careful about giving the men any of the money due to them but this is a comfortable ship it is said the men with a unanimous hum and i propose to keep it so said the old man and what i want is to keep you on board im going to take no precautions against your skipping im going to treat you like men im going to allow you a pound a week each out of your wages for the month we shall be in portland and at six oclock every manjack of you not absolutely required can go ashore and stay ashore all night so long as you turn up in the morning this was williamss revolution the mate gave a disgusted grunt and walked away to the lee rail but the men raised a cheer the skipper lifted his hand i know this is going a long way beyond the custom of any ship he said and i dont mind owning im doing it partly to prevent the biggest boardinghouse master in portland getting hold of you its true that so far as ive worked it out your staying by the ship will save the owners in wages about five pounds a man but thats not the reason im doing it im on this lay because i shall have to pay healy muffled groans from the men a hundred and fifty dollars a head for every fresh man i ship i had a row with him last voyage and dont propose to put money in his pocket again and if he gets so much from me as you know hell get your advance note besides think it over thatll do and the watch below went forward the old man talks sense said jacobs and as for healy hes a most notorious daylight robber as lives on sailormen and the pisonin of em i stayed in is ouse for ten days and was oofed fair oofed on board of a most notorious american ship where we lived on belayin pin soup and was tickled with andspikes tickled just to death ill stay by the old hooker what d ye say mates and they all swore that no enticements should prevent their sticking to the most comfortable ship that sailed the seas a little after noon they picked up the pilot and in a couple of hours were towing up the columbia past astoria and word went on the wires to portland that the oriana captain ticehurst was on her way to the willammette thats all right said mr healy now well see he gritted his teeth twisted his ugly mouth and gave a nod sideways as if he were bidding farewell to the finally discomfited skipper of the oriana for ticehurst so far had been the only man with sufficient sand in his composition to buck up against the most outrageous system of crimping and extortion which exists in any part of the world san francisco called frisco by those who have not lived there might be tough and so might shanghai smith whose name was cursed on all the seven seas but portland o the big wheat port in the smooth and deep willammette with mighty mount hood in the background was the hardest and toughest and roughest city in the west and mr healy jim healy the sandyheaded irishamerican to whose native brutality a certain low cunning in diplomacy was added stood out in blackguardism and general toughness far above his peers well see said healy this will be a skin game a real freezeout bully for you mr ticehurst he called a quiet informal meeting of the genial bloodsuckers who regulate the price of sailors in a socalled civilised city and the crimps assembled in his back parlour where many scoundrelly schemes had been hatched hes come to fight said healy and what i propose is to give him so much of it that hell sicken and quit the first thing right now is to put prices up i vote we make it a hundred and sixty dollars a man he proposed to charge the skipper of any merchant ship a head for any man he shipped he also proposed to take the entire orianas crew out of her in which case he would have to supply eighteen men all told when she was full of wheat and ready to sail in other words it was his idea and on such ideas he lived to charge for a crew and as men were scarce they must of necessity be drawn from another ship to which the crew of the oriana would presently be sold it was a great scheme and much honour must assuredly be given to the men who originated so easy a manner of getting a living it amounted to charging two shipmasters a fee of for swapping crews this is the way the crimps of portland live even unto this day in the year of civilisation there are pickings besides for as john jacobs ab in the oriana had said when his skipper asked him who was the biggest kind of a fool if you please sir its a sailor on consideration however it might appear that the state of oregon which allowed its trade to be hampered by such means was collectively even a bigger fool than a sailor the proposal of the one hundred and sixty dollars price was carried unanimously and healy grinned sardonically as he spoke further to his friends last time this ticehurst and me came mighty close to trouble and i want to get even and i mean to be now what i want is this any men you boys get off of her i want transferred to me when i ship them ill settle with you and moreover if he comes to you for men send him on to me ill talk to him the low down swine ill talk to him like a father the prospect of speaking to ticehurst like a father fairly made him purr with joy a pretty thing was it not to have ones honest business broken up by any infernal englishman he had a talk with his runner and laid his plans mebbe hell give us trouble but i rely on you tom said jim healy get em away at any price load em up with the best liquor and give em as much pocketmoney as they wants all i ask is to get em and tom gilson who had a name for persuasion which would have made the reputation of a lawyer stuck his tongue in his cheek when did i fail asked tom and when he went down to the wharf he found to his utter surprise that ticehurst greeted him quite amicably youre mr healys runner arent you i am sir said tom please go on board my ship said the skipper have a look round where are your other friends oh here they come now this is nice and kind of them he greeted the runners from the other houses with equal cordiality and invited them on board it was then almost six when four bells struck ticehurst told williams to knock the men off as soon as they were in the focsle ticehurst went to the starboard door and called to jacobs jacobs yes sir said jacobs coming out in a hurry the skipper pointed to the runners these gentlemen have come down to see you said the captain they are runners all of them and want you to leave this ship in order to put money into their pockets and the pockets of mr healy they have another ship for you in about a week probably a nice american ship dont forget what i said and when you are ready come aft for some money good day gentlemen my compliments to mr healy damme the old man is luny said williams if i had my way id have her boomed off into the stream and id kick the runners overboard but with such methods tom and his friends were familiar the new tactics of the orianas skipper took them all aback they stood close together and stared at each other say what sort of a game is he playin they asked each other the derned ratty old hoosier said tom hes tryin to go to windward of us at the start this is quite a new thing this is the old galoot has been goin in for bein popular with his crowd but if i know sailors it wont work he started for the focsle and put his head in what cheer boys and how goes it what kind of a passage did you have long but easy said jacobs coolly as he pulled on a guernsey over his head no work to speak of and fine weather the other runners gathered round their prey grants man went inside and sat down he produced a bottle will you have a nip just had a tot said jacobs the old man sarved it out when we came in sight of the city well whos for the shore boys put in tom gilson youll be ready for a good time now and portland is a daisy of a place i tell you the best of grub and good liquor and the prettiest gals running around here whos with me for healys he gets up the best table in the city and i dont care who sets up the next best the second mate came forard the captain is ready with your money men is he goin to pay you off asked the runners lord bless you no said hillyer who was jacobss chum hes only ladling it out in easy goes just to let us have some fun here five dollars a week think of that it was certainly unusual and the runners stared five dollars sneered gilson why every man of you that comes ashore with me shall have ten right off and a ship next week said jacobs drily i know ive been there i was in portland and in your house mister three years ago but i wasnt here then and things are changed sailors have it all their own way now and we guarantee a month ashore and thirty dollars a month when you ship talk as he would and he did talk he had struck a crowd that for a time would have nothing to say to him they were quiet and sober and knew in american parlance that he was not on board the oriana for his health he was there for dollars the men went aft one by one and the skipper talked to them we shant turn to till eight in the morning he said and dont forget that the men ive let on board are not here for your good its for their own heres a dollar for you ive made up my mind to let you have a dollar a night if you sleep on board it will be all the better for you and the men went out feeling that for once they had a captain who understood men a little there was not one of them who did not make up his mind to keep sober and stay by the oriana and as a crew is a crowd and with the obstinate affections of a crowd the initial direction given to their thoughts persisted long the runners were given the cold shoulder and every suggestion they made was looked on as a trap the men followed jacobs and hillyer who both had some knowledge of portland its my belief this will work said ticehurst as he watched them go well sir if you find half of them here in the morning ill eat a catblock said the mate well see replied ticehurst and he interviewed the steward while were here he said the men are to get soft bread and fresh meat and vegetables three times a day if it costs what it will it will be money in the owners pockets he went ashore himself and found his way to the house of the british consul whom he knew pretty well for it was too late to go to the agents mr sedgwick was a bright man and sturdy but he was rather pessimistic over the orianas prospects this healy is cunning as well as mean and venal and brutal he said i know he has it laid up for you dont have anything to do with him personally the law here is pretty much what it is made by the people who want to use it to make money hell bribe your men off ill have them arrested said ticehurst sedgwick shrugged his shoulders theyll have to be found and judging by what happened to the heather bell if the united states put them on board the state of oregon will take them off there are two sets of laws here and state law has the pull and healy has the pull on the state law as administered by elected judges well see said ticehurst who thought he knew a little he was about to learn more well see so you will said the consul at any rate four of my men are teetotalers said ticehurst and some of those who are not are not quite such fools as most sailors i believe ive fixed healy this time but in the morning he was four men short and the comedy began yet ticehurst did not lose his temper he was as cool as the top of mount hood to the eastward work the men easy mr williams he said work em easy just keep em going remember this is going to be a game and the counters are men a hard word may spoil me and i want you to be popular do you understand the mate sighed to be sure to be sure sir if you desire it and the skipper went to see mr sedgwick again sedgwick i lost four men last night the devil you did so healy scores first blood whats to be my next move then you mean to fight by the lord i do and i want your help if its only to make such a row that the board of trade at home will hear of it and sedgwick said hed do his best nevertheless and he sighed like the mate though for different reasons together they went uptown and found the united states marshal you want a warrant to get the four arrested asked the marshal and you shall have it but you know the game theyll play sedgwick did and ticehurst didnt theyll work the state of oregon against me said the marshal and itll be a fight thats what im here for said the skipper of the oriana he quoted general grant ill fight it out in this line if it takes all the summer how is it you let healy and his gang run the port i cant help it replied the official of the united states i dont think you englishmen understand that being a united states official here is pretty much the same as being a foreigner theres folks here that would rather do me up than drink however well get the warrant and arrest these men tonight if they can be found they tried to arrest them that night and healy got word of course about what was coming all right said healy ill fix you he sent for gilson take these men back to the oriana eh what said gilson are you going to quit already roll up a blanket or two of mine with their dunnage you fool said healy and the runner laughed well you are a daisy and when the marshal appeared healy interviewed him come right in and look for em theyre not here and of course they werent theyre back on their ship said healy with a grin and whats your game asked the marshal youll know tomorrow said the boardinghouse keeper and the marshal went down to the oriana to see ticehurst they came on board and swore they never meant to desert said ticehurst whats the meaning of it well have to wait but they knew in the morning when the police of the state of oregon came down on board well what do you want asked williams he knew when the four men were arrested for stealing blankets from healys house they were taken away and clapped in gaol by the lord this is a game said ticehurst thats a point to healy he went to sedgwick and told him about the new move and sedgwick nodded what he doesnt know isnt worth knowing ill come down to the court with you and the judge who happened not to be one of those in healys pocket saw through the game when ticehurst took the witnessstand this is a conflict between me and mr healy said ticehurst and i dont believe the men stole the blankets we didnt said the men unanimously they looked very sorry for themselves and justice smith smiled as he fined them twentyfive dollars smith said that he was inclined to be lenient and later in the afternoon he remitted the fine on condition the men went on board they agreed to this very humbly well we score said ticehurst sedgwick shook his head its not over yet and so it proved for ticehurst met healy in main street that evening you think youve bested me said healy but you havent nor you cant say you have till you get to sea with your men there seems some law to be had here after all mr healy replied ticehurst oh smiths no good well have him out said healy if these judges wont do as we want them well have others that will he cocked his hat and marched on by jove said ticehurst i wonder now he went after the boardinghouse keeper oh mr healy healy turned round scowling lets fight fair said ticehurst id like to know if you consider this conversation private private be damned said healy its what you like and ticehurst smiled i think ill fix him he said but healy grinned he grinned more widely than ever when ticehursts letter in the sunday oregonian gave the whole conversation between himself and healy this was followed up next day by an interview in which ticehurst expressed much more astonishment than he felt at the ways of pacific coast ports one would have thought him quite a child in such matters but even ticehurst who had not consulted sedgwick was a little surprised the following morning he was arrested by the deputysheriff at ten oclock its for libel said the police officer and he read the warrant the information on which the warrant of arrest was issued read most cheerfully the said john doe ticehurst on the th day of august in the city of portland county of multnomah state of oregon then and there being did then and there maliciously and feloniously by means other than words orally spoken cause to be published of and concerning another to wit john healy certain false and scandalous matter in the sunday oregonian to wit if we cant get these judges to do as we want we will have judges that will with intent then and there to injure and defame the said john healy youll come right along to justice haynes court east side said the deputysheriff he was let out again at eleven oclock on putting up five hundred dollars cash bail i reckon ive got him said healy chuckling well tie his old hooker up and she getting ready for sea again and well get the whole crowd out of her i have been coming to the conclusion of late years that going to sea was tolerably dull said ticehurst to sedgwick as they walked through the crowd of loafers outside haynes court but portland is not dull even i dont find it so said the consul but of course this is to keep you here youre nearly ready for sea i shall be in three days and your crew so far ive got them all sedgwick shook his head theyd rather die than let you go like that how in thunder have you kept them and ticehurst explained his wonderful theory ive really tried to make them comfortable and ive treated them like men i give them all they earn while theyre in port but what am i to do ill think of it said sedgwick he thought to some purpose for it was commonly stated in portland that many masters of merchant ships paid the boardinghouse masters to induce the men to desert when the amount of wages due to them from the ship was more than the bloodmoney which had to be paid for a new crew i think thats the line said sedgwick he got a reporter to go and interview mr healy and healy being more than halfseas over and in high delight at having held up ticehurst and the oriana let himself go curse the lot of em said healy they talk as if a boardinghouse master was necessary a scoundrel ay they do and theres them lying in the willammette now as have come to me winking the eye and saying now mr healy how much do you want to take my crew out of my ship why ive done it as low as ten dollars a head and have had a hundred a head for putting a new crowd in and then its been money in the pockets of the shipowners and the captain as it stands to reason it would be if the ship owed the men more than a hundred and ten dollars besides saving the grub for a time when the men are doing little but ticehurst didnt do this healy smiled and was incautious to be sure he didnt but he would if it paid him if hed come in here after a long voyage instead of a short passage out from liverpool hed have been in my back room with dollars and next day this was in the papers sedgwick smiled and ran down to see ticehurst whose ship was lying in the stream with a united states marshal in charge of her to see the men stayed on board and were not taken off by healys pirates and a multnomah county official to see that ticehurst stayed more or less in sight now said ticehurst havent i got him you can try said sedgwick so ticehurst filed a complaint in the united states circuit court in a damage suit against healy laying his damages at ten thousand dollars it will make him sick said sedgwick and it did healy fairly howled and by way of immediate revenge sent one of his ruffians to catch the reporter who had caught him sock it to him good joe said healy dont leave him a feather to fly with stamp on his right hand and kick his ribs in ill teach him to come down here with a pencil and a notebook and lay traps for inoffending citizens so i will and joe went off to do up the reporter as it happened and it was unlucky for joe the reporter was a man of his hands and not at all an unsuspecting person it was joe who went to the hospital and not the man with the pencil and the notebook nevertheless as he understood how things shaped themselves in oregon and in pacific ports generally this particular reporter thought it healthy to go elsewhere what joe had failed in jack might do and healy had a very long memory as many injured men could tell what i like about oregon is its climate and its general uncertainty said ticehurst it makes me feel young again of course i shant push this libel suit sedgwick if you do youll be like vanderdecken when its finished said sedgwick to try to beat to the westward of the cape horn of law here will make an ancient flying dutchman of you id try to get to sea im going to try replied ticehurst it will be quite enough of a victory for me to have come into portland and go out with the same men i brought in its never been done yet said sedgwick and if you get through youll make a record and the next day ticehurst shifted his quarters from the ship to the oregon hotel in the city he explained that he did so because he understood it would take some time to finish the cross suits then in progress the mans a fool said healy rejoicing well keep the oriana here till she goes to pieces like a rotten scow on a mudbank but ticehurst was no fool he sent the oriana down to astoria to wait until the suits were done with and was seen to be much occupied with legal matters all day long at night he sat in the hall of the hotel and denounced healy with much severity ill stay till i get his scalp said ticehurst but if he meant what he said it is odd that he reckoned up what he owed the hotel and put the requisite amount of dollars in an otherwise almost empty portmanteau it might also have seemed strange to healy if he knew that his enemy went for a walk late that night and got as far as st johns on the railroad to the north there he boarded the last train to kalama that deserted township which once had a boom of which the bottom fell out and went down the columbia in the telephone but healy tumbled to the whole thing in the morning when it was found that ticehurst had not slept in the hotel the portland authorities at healys request went down to astoria next day bright and early and boarded the oriana mr williams the chief mate received them at the gangway where is the captain in portland said williams sourly treating the men according to ticehursts prescription was getting on his nerves he skipped from portland last night and we believe him to be on board said the marshal you can look said williams shortly if as is probable he knew that ticehurst was not in portland he also knew he was not on board the oriana the most careful search failed to find him why dont you take us alongside and discharge the wheat said gregg savagely perhaps hes under two thousand tons of it the second mate was almost as cross as williams as he said afterwards the way the marshal acted a fullsized english skipper might be concealed in a sextant case at last the intruders gave up and went ashore you neednt trouble to come on board again said williams im skipper now and shall take her to sea but if that was true it is odd that ticehurst was not to be found in astoria he had disappeared the united states marshal who was still on board the oriana laughed for he had no great sympathy with the state officials of oregon i guess your skipper has a head he opined as he lounged against the rail and ejected tobacco juice into the bluegrey waters of the great columbia river tell me where he is i wont give you away but even williams did not know he went to sea next morning and was towed across the bar by the tug comet the oregon people came on board again and made another search oh come to sea with me said williams with a savage eye he had a notion that if they did there would be part of the crew that captain ticehurst would leave at his mercy dont get rowdy young fellow said the marshal its a waste of natural energy better used in learning how to be civil to your superiors but youre licked said williams youre fairly licked lifes a game said the state marshal philosophically as he went over the side with his united states rival and if we won always we should get swelled head he looked up from the boat say he called yes said williams if were licked and i own it where is the captain ill send word from europe said williams but as a matter of fact he sent word by the skipper of the tug for it was captain ticehurst who steered the old comet over the bar with the oriana behind now what i want to know is said the captain to his mate what i want to know is whether it isnt better to treat men as men and best that crowd in portland williams looked melancholy well sir it may be on a pinch he owned but its the principle im thinkin of and his principle was of course that sailormen were to expect nothing while his duty was to see that they got it with any amount of suitable sauce the end printed by t and a constable printers to his majesty at the edinburgh university press
