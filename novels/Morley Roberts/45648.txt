war correspondent he wrote with a red picturesqueness which was horribly attractive jimmy carew ara he was the best looking of the whole horde the earl of pulborough clever but indolent lady penelope chapter i all the absurd birthday celebrations were over and penelope was twentyone she declared that her whole life was to be devoted to reform she meant to reform society to make it good and useful and straightforward and simple and utterly delightful she let it be understood that men were in great need of her particular attention they were too selfish and selfcentred too extravagant too critical of each other too vain they acknowledged it humbly when she mentioned it for lady penelope bradings beauty was something to see and to talk of major and minor poets agreed about it artists desired to paint her and failed as they always do when true loveliness shines on them she had the colour of a titian the contours of a correggio the witchery of a reynolds and under wonderful raiment the muscles of a young greek athlete she wiped out any society in which she moved when sweet eclipse showed herself the rest were nowhere the other girls did not exist she even made married beauties quake as for the men they endured everything she said and worshipped her all the more she was strange and new and a tonic she had no sense of humour whatsoever she could not understand a joke even if it was explained by an expert on the staff of punch this made her utterly delightful her beautiful seriousness was as refreshing as logic in a sermon she believed in clergymen in politicians in the deceased wifes sister in all eminent physicians in the london county council in the city of westminster in the british constitution in herself and hygiene she read the times the athenaeum the encyclopaedia britannica herbert spencer mr kidd and the late mr drummond she used sandows exercises and cold water she was opposed to war she admired the leader of the opposition and the lord mayor she subscribed to a society for establishing a national theatre to play mr bernard shaws tragedies and to the nearest hospital she was the most delightful person in england and was against vaccination she had money and lands and houses and ideas we ought all to do something to be something said lady penelope brading it was an amazing statement a shocking statement and clean against all class tradition when she interpreted it to the alarmed was it not to be something if one was rich let us say was it not to do something if one spent ones money on horses and sport and dress and bridge heaven defend us all if anything more is asked of man or woman than killing time and killing beasts hands went up to heaven when penelope preached not that she preached at length her sermons lasted five seconds by any clock save at the times when she warmed her ankles by the fire with some pet friend of hers and took into consideration how she was to use her power for the regeneration of the world which was hers now she was with ethel mytton a remote relative of the celebrated mytton who drank eight bottles of port a day and was a sportsman of the character which makes all englishmen prouder of sport than of their history ten thousand on a football field would put him higher than sir richard grenville sidney was a fool to him her father was a cabinet minister but ethel was meek and mild and followed penelope at a humble distance modelling herself on that sweet mould of revolution so might a penny candle imitate an arclight so a glowworm worship the big moon but youll get married dear said ethel of course youll get married penelope was pensive there are other things than marriage said penelope oh are there sighed ethel she did not think so for she was in love penelope loved theories best which of them will you marry asked ethel which what silly them said ethel what the duchess calls your horde i dont know replied penelope im like diogenes and im looking for an honest man oh honestyyes of course i know what you mean but there are plenty of them pen dear boo said pen so the other greeks said to the man in the tub ethel sighed what greeks and what man in what tub she inquired plaintively and penelope did not enlighten her darkness for in came the duchess of goring her aunt whose christian name was titania she weighed sixteen stone in glittering bead armour and had a voice exactly like rose le clercs in the duchess of bayswater she rarely stopped talking and was ridiculously moral and conventional and except for her voice she might have been a shopkeepers wife in any suburb my dear penelope said titania im glad to see you again you look positively sweet my darling after all these parties and carryingson and what not and now at last you are quite grown up and yourself and your own and twentyone i wish i was i was nine stone then exactlynot a pound more oh and its you ethel i hope your dear papa is not overworking himself now hes a cabinet minister cabinet ministers will overwork themselves ive known them die of it tell him what i say will you but of course he will pay no attention and in time will die like the rest its no use advising men to be sensible ive given it up ah here at last is lord bradstock titania flowed on wonderfully she flowed exactly like the twisting piece of glass in a mechanical clock which mimics a jet of water she turned round and never advanced but augustin lord bradstock was as calm as a millpond as a mere in the mountains he was tall and thin and ruddy and whitehaired at fifty he had been twice a widower why at last titania he yawned as he stood with penelopes hand in his he was still her guardian in his heart though she was out of tutelage i say at last augustin because you were not here before me cried titania and i expected you to be here before me from what you said this morning i told you i meant to come in and speak quietly and seriously to penelope and you said you would come too penelopes eyes thanked her guardian and they smiled at him halfsecretly saying as plain as any words what a dear you are to come in and dilute aunty for me yes said bradstock i think i said i would prepare her ive not had a single chance lately to say a word for her good cried titania what with this person and that person and the horde i think it is time now penelope that you reorganized your amazing circle of acquaintances mostly men by the way while augustin was responsible for you of course you were obstinate but now you are in a position of greater freedom you will see the advisability of being guided by your aunt im sure im positive of it now the real sore point with the duchess was this matter of the horde it was the only picturesque phrase she ever invented in her life and without any doubt it did characterize in some measure the remarkable collection of men who were pretenders to penelopes hand and fortune out of the entire the entire caboodle said bradstock suggestively the duchess shook her head like a horse in flytime no augustin not caboodle pray what is caboodle out of the entirelot penelope there are hardly three who belong to your class i entreat you to go through them and dismiss those of whom we cant approve i and lord bradstock dont drag me in said bradstock they are all very good fellows i approve of them all tut tut said titania is this the way you help augustin you are a hindrance i believe it is entirely owing to you that penelope has these strange and alarming ideas yes my dear im afraid it is he is not the kind of man who should have been your guardian i ought to have been consulted i knew a bishop who would have been admirable most admirable hes dead dear man and the present one is a scandal to the protestant church what with incense and processions and candles and confessionboxes but as i was saying i do hope you will dismiss some of these men and i hope you will be sensible and not say shocking things no one should say shocking things till they are married and even then with discretion socialism and reform and marriage dear me you really must not talk about marriage but you must get married to a suitable person im sure augustin we should have no insuperable objection to let us say young bramber hell be an earl by and by and you mustnt talk about reforming society my dear love it is quite impossible to reform society without abolishing it my pet ethel darling many cabinet ministers have owned as much to me with much alarm almost with tears its no use trying tell your dear father so ethel i forgot to mention it the other day when we discussed the london county council and its terrible extravagance compared with the economy of the government we talked too about the war office and i told him that it couldnt be reformed without abolishing it which was not to be thought of for an instant what should we do without a war office as we are always fighting he sighed deeply poor man dr lumsden griff says sighing is cardiac in its origin and i wish your father would see him ethel hes the first doctor in london for the ventricles of the heart so every one says but about your ideas penelope good heavens aunty i havent any left said penelope this was not in the least surprising for titania reduced any ordinary gathering to idiocy at the shortest notice oh but you have said titania and society cannot endure ideas my love anything but ideas darling well well sighed bradstock what is the use of talking to her titania pen is pen and theres an end of it i wish there was cried the duchess but she rails against marriage and shes only twentyone dear dear me she pays too much attention to you married women said bradstock hows the duke by the way as the duke was engaged in running two theatres at the same time not wholly in the interests of art or finance bradstock might have asked after his health at some other juncture titania ignored him she rails against marriage lamented titania i dont said penelope you do said her aunt its only the horrible publicity said penelope and the way things are done and the ghastly presents and the bishops and the newspaper men and the horrible crowd outside and the worse crowd inside and all the horrid fluff and flummery of it if im ever married ill get it done in a registrars office oh penelope wailed ethel but titania became terrible you shall not be penelope she cried i could not stand it as your aunt my dear oh my love i knew some one who was married in that way and it was a most shocking affair and of course it turned out that he had been married before and was a bigamist the scandal was hushed up and the first wife who was the sweetest girl and died of consumption shortly afterward at her fathers vicarage in kent or yorkshire near pevensey or pontefract at any rate it began with a p and the man though a villain was a gentleman for he married the second one all over again in a foreign place with a chaplain officiating much better than a registrar who can marry you im told in pajamas if he likes though not like a bishop which one might have expected in his case you all knew him slightly at any rate never my dear get married at a registrars its better than the open shame of a cathedral and a bishop said penelope being married is ones private business and its nothing but horrid savagery to have crowds there bravo said bradstock and titania turned on him did i not say all this was your fault augustin you were no more fit to be her guardian than you are to be archbishop of canterbury am i a savage penelope and did i not get married in a cathedral a most beautiful cathedral all gothic and newly restored at a vast expense my dear i am amazed and horrified and shocked to think that you should not perceive the quite exquisite fitness of being married in a piece of lovely gothic architecture to the very loveliest music breathing over eden and so on while all your dearest friends shed tears of purest joy to see her got rid of said bradstock and even ethel mytton laughed augustin ethel mytton how can you say such things and laugh its wicked its indecent yes said penelope thats what i say theres nothing to choose between your way and the american way the millionaire women have over there when they hold a flowershow in a gilded room and get married under a bell of roses at the cost of a hundred thousand dollars id rather be knocked down by a nice savage or run away with by a viking or caught by a pirate i wont be breathed over in eden by a stuffy crowd ifif oh if what gasped titania if i ever do get married said penelope ill never tell any of you beforehand good heavens said the duchess you wont tell us i wont youll let us find out shall i know nothing of the marriage of my brothers child till i read it in the times it shall not be augustin does she mean it augustin lighted a cigarette and walked to the window which looked down on the traffic of piccadilly i give it up said augustin when could i answer riddles do you mean it pen and penelope rising up stood on the hearthrug and looking like the descendant of a viking and some fair venetian declared that she did mean it and she further went on to say in great haste and with a most remarkable flow of words that it shouldnt be in the times or any other paper and she said that if titania duchess of goring was her aunt it couldnt be helped and that her principles were more to her than any ones approval though she loved her aunt and her dear sweet guardian these same principles were even dearer than they were and she said that they had no principles not even guardy dear and that they only thought of a demon thing called society which was at once a fetich and a phantom and she became so excited that she talked like a real woman orator upon a platform and expressed her intention of using her influence to bring about reform especially in such matters and with regard to young men who did nothing and seemed to think they had been created for that very purpose and as she talked there wasnt a man in the world who would not have yearned to take his coat off and ask for a pick and shovel at the least for she was as beautiful as any young goddess fresh from grecian foam or from high olympus even bradstock sighed to think that he had never done anything for the human race which required so much help but sit in the upper house a speechless phantom and ethel mytton cried with an imparted enthusiasm while the duchess wept with horror and more than that said penelope who broke down in her eloquence and resorted to the tone of conversation more than that ill never never let you know whom i marry i mean it thatthats flat and after this damp but awful peroration she sat down with heaving bosom and poor bewildered titania shook her head till it looked as if it would come off she found no flow of words to oppose penelope with the biggest river is nothing when it flows into the sea and if titania was the amazon pen was the south atlantic not who he is said the duchess as feebly as if she were no more than a brook in a meadow i will not said penelope like a sea in a cyclone not oh i must go home piped titania augustin shes capable of marrying a chauffeur because he can drive at sixty miles an houroror a groom id rather marry either or both said pen furiously than be mobbed and musicked into matrimony with a grinning crowd of idiots looking on this is immoral said titania its very immoral you couldnt marry both ill go home bradstock and bradstock took her there youve done it titania he said as they drove shes as obstinate and as violent as a passive resister youve put her bristles up and pen never goes back from what she says you are very like a man augustin sobbed the duchess shes more like a woman than im like a man growled bradstock he had never risen to eminence and only once to his feet in the upper house and sometimes this rankled yes i mean it i mean it said penelope and i wanted to be your bridesmaid sobbed ethel you never will be and you can tell every one what i say i wont said ethel i wont and she went away and told them chapter ii in spite of what good conventional people said there was nothing abnormal in penelopes character the walking world appears abnormal to an institute for cripples good going is an absurdity and as for running the truth is that penelope by some unimaginable freak of fortune had been born quite sound and sane barring her one lack that of humour the providential death of her parents at an early age saved her from a deal of teaching bradstock saved her from a great deal more and she saw to the rest it pleased augustin lord bradstock to play with gunpowder in spite of what he said about dynamite he encouraged her to trust to herself in a way that every wellregulated woman considered highly dangerous and he used to enrage her in order to hear what she had to say to him there was a period in which she swore vigorously she learnt her language from an old stableman who adored her even more than he did any horse this was at the age of three her first interview with her aunt the duchess of goring was positively so shocking to titania who was midvictorian and never got over it that the poor thing almost fainted when penelope a shining brat of three damned her eyes with terrific vigour goring who was that very curious and absurd survival of a thousand ages known as a sportsman roared with laughter there was humanity in him there was none in titania though there might have been if she had married any one but a duke and penelope damned her eyes for saying she mustnt go to the stables without a retinue an escort a bodyguard of footmen and nurses and governesses i havent a governeth now lisped penelope i thacked the latht one didnt i bradstock lady bradstock number two was then reigning without governing as far as bradstock was concerned and governing without reigning as far as another was concerned and she paid no attention to penelope except to encourage her to amuse her guardian thus penelope grew like a tree in the open and there were no dutch gardeners to clip her at fifteen she greeted her last governess a lady of great learning and no ability with the news that she had had her luggage got ready and that there was the carriage at the door for her there is no defending such conduct pen never defended it herself in later years she acknowledged she had been a brute to miss mackarness and gave her a position as housekeeper in one of her own houses that she never visited with permission to receive the shillings some visitors paid to see a mansion like a sarcophagus with one treasure of a turner in it the trouble was that penelope was natural she had not been trained to become so she grew so there is no more painful and laborious a process than to learn to be natural in later life but to grow like it ah that was splendid and many unthinking people laughed to hear pen when she swore or cried or begged for pardon or dominated the whole little world around her the world indeed smiled on pen and now she was twentyone and splendid mobile gracious venetian strong and as rich as an american heiress and she already had as many wooers as penelope of old but the little bow of cupid was too much for them other defence was too good and now these strange notions grew up in her there was some natural shame in her heart that the crowd of duchesses and what not could not understand when he came at last riding gallantly a brave male virile strong and bold armed in shining armour should she lead him out into piccadilly investing him in a frock coat for his armour and a cylinder for his helmet and marry him in a crowd while a paid organist played something about eden oh where was eden heres romance then and in a new guise in a young woman for the true romantic age is the age of feminine desperation when one has been taught all ones best years its hard to be romantic till one wears through ones fetters at the very foot of the scaffold when its too late how many sweet women sour in creamjugs and escape the cat or some roaring lion for nothing but sourest contemplation they crowd feminine churches pens brother or rather halfbrother was ten years her senior and played a suitable part in the orchestra of the house of lords as lord brading he voted for the government when it was conservative and against it when it was liberal with perfect certainty and goodwill there was nothing remarkable about brading but the strange almost awestruck admiration with which he worshipped penelope a man even of the most absurd conservative solidity must be a radical and an anarchist somewhere and indeed he pretended to be something of a socialist nevertheless he had humour brading thought his halfsister a wonder and had no criticism for her indeed it is believed that he helped the groom mentioned above to teach her unrefinements of the english language peculiarly shocking to early and mid victorians but in his heart bill brading considered pens mother accounted for excused everything the last lady brading was an american who wallowed in money which she invested in repairing her husbands character and his castles when he died and nothing could be done for his character but suppress biographers she invested in ancient demesnes on pens behalf and bought her ratriddled and ghosthaunted mansions of historic character till there were few and among them penelope could not be counted who could tell how many of them she owned then lady brading went to a newer world than the united states and left pen to the care of augustin lord bradstock a man of brains and no voice when on his legs it is reported that he learnt a speech of his own composing by heart and when he rose to deliver it all he said was good god in an astonished whisper and collapsed struck by a form of paralysis which rarely attacks fools and which bores cannot suffer from penelope was richer than her halfbrother for her mother having paid her husbands debts rebuilt brading house and saved his life from being written after a very quiet and gentlemanly departure considered she had done her duty to the family she left her stepson five thousand pounds it is true and with a want of ostentation not peculiarly american she left another five to penelope and modestly made her residuary legatee the residue was considerably over a million dollars and then there were the houses most of them ineligible properties in ringfences fit for immediate occupation after they had been restored for poor lady brading had a passion for ruins and collected castles as some do bricabrac the two great griefs of her life were that she could not buy haddon hall and arundel castle well there is the situation plainly outlined pen was as savage as pocahontas so some said and she could an she liked wallow in money she owned property all over england to say nothing of a chateau near tours a palazzo in venice and a building in new york which brought in more than the rest cost to keep up she had a brother a peer with a voice a guardian a peer without one an aunt who was a duchess and strange ideas of her own which got up and talked on the most unsuitable occasions but then there was her beauty as clamant as a rose of fire as sweet as violet or verbena the rose can be gilded it seems like a lily and the gold was a power to her giving authority over men she who had enough to command the work of many thousands at current wages for this is money truly commanded that strange respect for power as well as love for herself her lovers were numberless so people said and there was this truth in their being beyond arithmetic that no one troubled to count them marriageable beauties of a lesser order of loveliness prayed for her extinction in matrimony mothers of the marriageable prayed for it with a fervour only equalled by the fervour of her hopeless lovers if there can be fervour without hope it is the command of true beauty that it can had not all the painters all the sculptors from pheidias down to the unselected classics of our own time met together when she rose a newer aphrodite from the sea of the unknown her loveliness was sweet and intolerable one ached at it cowards shrank from it brave men cried for her there are strange tales what a strange motley gathering she selected they had one thing in common to be discovered shortly one would think she discovered their qualities by inspection many wouldbes she drove away overcliff she knew men of many classes adored her wondering and humble one great lover of hers who was very good to horses and only reasonably bitter against motorcars was her groom timothy bunting he didnt know he loved her indeed he imagined he loved her maid but there is this quality in a great love that it asks all or nothing tim was perhaps as great as the greatest but he rode behind her even when the marquis de rivaulx or rufus q plant rode alongside her with a quiet and unjealous mind there was much in timothy as much or more than there was in the french marquis who rode well enough as tim said or as in plant who rode all over is orse as became one bred in arizona these must show themselves by and by they had the quality at any rate even tim knew it but what was it that gave permission to mr austin de vere to join the throng he wrote poetry he followed her as close as a rhyme in a couplet he never wrote her any for which she was pleased to be flatteringly thankful there are some things that cannot be set down in verse even by the greatest and the poet de vere acknowledged this humbly he had the character of being the most conceited and immitigable ass in england and when he was with penelope he was as humble as a puppy in leash there was something great in his mighty subjection not even goby late of the guards was so mitigable and so mitigated when pen was by and gobys vc was almost as much valued by him as his clothes and boots he gained it by a fit of angry rage such as had led him to pay several sovereigns at a desk in a back office at a policestation and came out of his temper to discover he was a hero so much for luck when a big man with the quality and temper of a bull gets into a row in a sangar without any police to stay his hand as for that de vere said goby why i could crush him with one hand and he could make you sore with a few words said penelope he couldnt bragged goby penelope smiled no perhaps he couldnt she said pensively and goby was pleased with her opinion of his bulls hide europa had at any rate scratched him he indicated the sea of matrimony with inarticulate bellows but of course he was really quite possible as chloe cadwallader said his boots were inspiration polished and his christian name was plantagenet he had some obscure right to it then there was lord bramber some folks said if she married any one she would marry bramber because his father was the earl of pulborough they forgot all the rest of the aristocratic mob if any title pleased her democratic soul she could pick strawberries one senile and one merely silly duke pursued her panting but she certainly liked bramber and showed her partiality for him or her unpartiality with frankness she had hopes of him though he appeared hopeless now at the age of twentyseven she maintained that men were half their age and women twice it at the least dear titania is ninety said penelope and guardy is twentyfive lord bramber will perhaps think of doing some work when he is fifteen there came with these with and not after jimmy carew who was an ara he painted portraits and talked about art with eloquence till no one even an artist could guess what he meant but he believed things with such faith that many of his fair sitters agreed with him he was the best looking of the whole horde as titania called pens adorers the horde included leopold norfolk gordon who had a house in park lane and ever so many peoples money to keep it up with as may be guessed from his name he was a jew several people with whom he could not share the money he had acquired by unsullied dishonesty said his real name was isaac levi goby who hated him bitterly consoled him when a less successful israelite called him ikey at ascot by saying its damned hard lines gordon a man may be born in whitechapel without being a jew so near may insolence come to wit when this was pointed out to goby he told the story everywhere with many chuckles but it was impossible to deny certain attributes to poor gordon whether his name was levi or moses or ehrenbreitstein for that matter penelope had no racial prejudices and antisemitism was unnatural and abhorrent to her she said things about negroes to rufus q plant born in virginia which made his flesh creep almost as badly as if he had been born in delaware so in spite of gordons looking somewhat semitic she asserted there were the qualities she required in the poor man who indeed was not bumptious or loud or peculiarly offensive in her presence he that stole millions feared a girl he polished his last weeks hat with trembling hands that had signed deathwarrants in the city when he spoke with her and to round off the horde with another sample there came in carteret williams he was the biggest of the lot and had a voice like a toastmasters or that of the man who announces the train at zurich it is worth going there to hear him by the way many good americans travel for less williams was a writer a journalist a warcorrespondent or as he said a battle vulture when he could dip his pen in blood he wrote with a red picturesqueness which was horribly attractive he belonged to a very decent family and took to his present trade by nature that gives some hint of why penelope liked him what was the secret then the secret that brought young bramber and rufus quintus plant and ikey levi alias leopold norfolk gordon and captain plantagenet goby and the versemaking de vere together with the marquis de rivaulx and jimmy carew under one tablecloth so to speak at the tattenham corner of wooing some said penelope wouldnt have anything to do with any one who was not a man it is true she abhorred those who were not men but so much depends upon a definition in the west and the east for that matter a man goes for what he is worth and is common currency as he should be and a white man is the gold to be called a white man is the true compliment and implieswell it implies what the horde implied they were men and man and white so penelope said when she had picked up the picturesque figure from rufus q plant they might be asses and some were or at least mules but they meant to run straight they were lazy or some were but the laziest lay under the delusion that laziness was their godlike duty they needed the spur they might be brutes in the way of business you should read what has been written in a new york paper about plant or hear what a certain disembowelled set in the city say of gordon who turned them inside out but they played the game they knew what cricket was even when it was played with redhot shot and not to carry ones bat meant blue ruin after saying that they were all this which implies they were men of honour each according to the code of their fellows for this is honour i shall show you how they came or how many of them came to utter grief in curious ways under very odd stresses what can a man of honour do in an entirely new position one not provided for in any code it would puzzle a jury of archangels to say have you heard asked goby with wondering eyes what she says replied gordon shade of titian cried jimmy carew well im damned said carteret williams this is romance sighed the de vere imimthats what i am whistled rufus q plant imphm murmured lord bramber sapristi shrieked the french marquis wasnt it enough to make them exclaim when it was reported all over london and in the country and in papers and cables to new york that penelope brading had sworn with a great oath that she meant to upset the holy applecart of all tradition at least since adam by never letting any one know who her husband was they knew her and knew her word was sacred now let all unwhite men all unrealities all ghosts all vain folks vanish one by one with one voice the horde exclaimed as they set their teeth well we dont care what does this say for penelopes faculties of distinguishing men from monkeys and white from gray chapter iii all that happened now only shows one how the greatest sense of modesty may end in the biggest advertisement penelope though determined to do her duty which was mainly to educate mankind meant doing it unobtrusively and there was not a man or woman in the british isles or in the united states who did not hear of her quiet intention the cables hummed with penelopes name it was whispered in the great deeps of the sea wireless telegraphists caught lady penelope brading out of hertzian waves ships ploughed the ocean laden with penelope and copy about her in two twos the notoriety hunters in london sank into insignificance professional beauties were neglected and the sale of their photographs fell off there was an immense demand for penelopes which luckily no one could satisfy until an enterprising new yorker flooded the united states with portraits before it was found out that this particular photograph was one of a young actress whom he proposed introducing to the public shortly he sold amazing quantities of them when there was one in every inquiring household from hudson bay to the gulf of mexico the real sitter for it wrote to the papers and complained bitterly she is now playing to crowded houses there are many paths to fame poor pen was at first horribly shocked she was young and yet she was human she said oh dear oh dear and swearing that she would never read a word about herself she subscribed to a newspaper cutting agency from the new york papers alone one could cull a highly coloured account of her whole history and they gave bradstocks history too not omitting his twoword exclamatory speech in the house of lords bradstock stood it like a trojan like a spartan he never turned a hair even when they said that he was going to marry penelope himself they gave a full biography of titania with a real photograph when the duchess saw it she was silent for full five minutes such was the shock it gave her then she talked for five hours and called on the american ambassador cannot you do anything for me asked titania perorating im afraid not your grace said the ambassador wearily he said it was an awful thing to be an ambassador sometimes though it had its points being discomfited for once by an ambassador she turned on bradstock and rent him limb from limb and then she went to penelope im only doing my duty said penelope with her beautiful lips as firm as grecian marble your duty shrieked the duchess and look at the papers i cant help what they say aunt ones duty they tell my weight said titania how did they know they must have guessed it said penelope i dont look it pleaded the duchess now suddenly plaintive no no dear auntie you dont said poor penelope oh its cruel of them help me then said titania get married at once in a cathedral and all this will stop ill ask the dear archbishop to officiate penelope oh my darling but penelope became pentelican marble again she froze into a severe goddess and she saw titania weep its scandalous oh and they have a list of them all said titania indeed the new york dustman had the horde set out in a row like the entries for the derby they said the betting was on rufus q plant of course they gave a short and succulent biography of them all they headed the list the lady penelope handicap they used some slang about weight for age great heavens said titania all town is ringing with it if this is the result of looking on marriage as ones private business give me publicity there would have been less of it if a prince had married a publicans daughter in st pauls and had presented the dean with a set of pewter pots and if she does what she says the only men who did not talk much about penelope were naturally those who aspired to win her every one neglected politics and sport to discuss her she became politics and sport huge sums of money were at stake as to whether she would keep her word as to the length of time she would keep the secret and as to who the man was to be there were public and private books made on the series of events and there was a penelope party and an opposition many young people who were revolutionary in their sentiments said she was right there was a penelope cave in the house of commons some of those who fought year in and year out for the deceased wifes sister backed her up it was whispered that the prince was a penelopian two princesses threatened with objectionable persons of the royal blood were heard to observe that there was something in what she said penelope was within measurable distance of becoming a national or even an international question mrs x wrote an article in the fortnightly on secret marriage in history mr z sat down and wrote a novel bristling with wit and epigram in ten days which ran into the third edition of two hundred and fifty copies in thirty it was said that questions were to be asked in the house a play on the subject was forbidden by the lord chamberlain the wittiest article on the subject was written by a mr shaw he argued that no really beautiful woman had any right to be married at all he said plaintively that it wasnt fair and convinced the ugly in two syllogisms and as the result of this penelope went away into the country though it was may with ethel mytton and mrs cadwallader who was called chloe and stood by pen remorselessly in every difficulty for pen had helped her out of an awful mess the history of which would make a whole story of itself as a result of it cadwallader was in the rocky mountains shooting and a certain young soldier was taking too much liquor and too little quinine in nigeria and chloe got her diamonds back from messrs attenborough and was eternally grateful to penelope in consequence and i shall send for them one by one said penelope they can come down by the ten oclock train from paddington and go back by the five oclock one from here and after lunch i shall explain my ideas to them and ill be with you said chloe who was as darklocked as a ravens wing oh i dont mind said penelope of course you will im too young am i not to be left alone chloe is it true chloe that the older a woman gets the bigger fool she is chloe said it was true ill ask titania to let bob come over said penelope hes the wisest person i know bob was titanias grandson and was certainly young enough to be wise as he was only fourteen he had been sent to three of the great public schools and had been taken away because of his fighting capabilities he never knew when he had enough and it is quite impossible to keep a boy at any school if he breaks out of bounds to fight some young butcher or baker in a back alley at least once a week now he had a tutor who had been an amateur boxer of great merit it began to take the tutor all his time to handle his pupil but if bob was knocked endways about three times a week it sobered him and made him do his work he did not yet know whether he wanted to be a prizefighter or the commanderinchief but he loved penelope ill send for bob said penelope and bob came with mr guthrie his tutor and titania was glad to get rid of him for a time oh pen said bob how jolly kind of you to ask me im sick of grandmother she worries me to death always says robert you mustnt i say have you read kips cat that walked by himself mr guthrie says its splendid and i say its rot but old guth likes virgil and horace isnt that strange for he can box like anything baker the groom says he can and bakers awful good with the mitts but i say pen whats all this about you in the papers grandmother wails when she sees one now i aint sure i like having you so much in the papers pen i dont like it either said penelope but i cant help it is it true that youre going to be married and never tell any one demanded bob from the bottom of a huge rockingchair as they sat on the lawn they were in one of pens habitable houses and the lawn ran down to the thames i wont if i dont want to said penelope but youre a boy bob and dont understand these things bob snorted and smiled not unsubtly oh pen dont be like grandmother i understand pretty nearly everything now grannys always saying that and its jolly rot you cant be like me turned out of three schools and not know something are you going to get married soon pen shook her head shes very savage at your knowing that jew cad gordon but grandfather isnt he says that gordon may be a jew of course but hes all right i asked him if i could get put on a board as a director and he was so mad with me i think gordons asked him to be a director and hed like to only he darent hes got none too much money you know pen but about all these chaps pen he went through the horde seriatim and pronounced upon them all with ineffable wisdom gobys an ass but a good ass pen he said as he kicked with his legs he gave me a thickun a year ago when i was in difficulties but he hasnt the brains to make a good corporal baker says that baker was a sergeant in the dublin fusiliers i like plant though pen baker says he rides in a rummy fashion more like a circus man than anything else but he can stick to a horse and theres your frenchman i say how does he come to be called rivaulx was he called after rivaulx in yorkshire or was it called after him ask him if he shoots larks in his native country all frenchmen do old guth says he says he read a book the other day in which a french priest says he never sees a lark without wanting to shoot it what a miserable rotter wasnt he but rivaulx isnt so bad though hes a gentleman at any rate though he is french i say why do foreigners never look like gentlemen dashed if i know ive often wondered because grandfather likes them through his having been an ambassador sometimes a german does though and brambers all right pen i dont think id mind your marrying him i wont marry any one who isnt a useful citizen said pen hes all right urged bob hes as strong as a bull baker says hed peel better than most prizefighters what is a useful citizen i say if you get married youll tell me who it is no said penelope i call that mean said bob id not tell any one and id help like fun im sure you would bob but i may never get married rot said bob a girl like you not get married oh i say and he continued to say for some hours and proved himself most entertaining company quoting baker who had been a sergeant in the dublin fusiliers and had been very severely knocked about by jem mace and appealing to mr guthrie who came over with him to get him to look at a book in the mornings to back him up he was really very modest and gentlemanly at the same time that he was exceedingly bumptious and arrogant after the best manner of the extremely healthy english boy and at twelve oclock he came running to penelope and chloe by the riverbank in wild excitement i say pen i say pen theres old goby coming and with that miserable rotter who makes poetry whats brought em here i asked them to lunch said pen eh what cried bob goby and that rotter austin de vere i say mr guthrie he ran off to guthrie bawling i say mr guthrie heres that poet chap austin de vere come didnt you say he mostly wrote rot and goby and de vere came across the lawn together like a mastiff and a maltese in company they made each other as nervous as cats and couldnt for their lives understand why they were asked together the clumsy brute said de vere the versemaking monkey said goby but tailors could have admired them both they were perfect and lunch was a most painful function only endurable to penelope because she was on the track of her duty and to chloe because she laughed internally and to mr guthrie who was really a clever man because he liked to study men and manners and to bob because he talked all the time owing to the silence of the others i say captain goby ive got a splendid bullpup baker got him for me cheap for a quida sovereign i mean you remember baker he was a sergeantoh i told you that just now do you like bulldogs mr de vere de vere was politely sulky bulldogs oh ah well i do not know that i do he looked at goby who was also sulky and feeling very much out of it but the subject of bulldogs appealed to him because he saw it didnt amuse his rival ill give you a real good pup bob he said goodnaturedly one that no one could get for a sovereign a real pedigree pup with a pedigree as long as your own said goby bob sighed and laid his hand on gobys i say pen isnt captain goby a real good un he asked baker says but what baker said does not come into this history as the lunch finished and they all went into the garden goby spoke to bob as they went out i say bob get hold of that ass de vere and talk to him as hard as the very deuce will you you meant that about the pup said bob of course bob ill talk his beastly head off said bob and this was why penelope spoke confidentially to captain goby before she did so to the poet she was exceedingly pale and very dignified but she lost no time in getting to the point captain goby she said you have asked me to marry you at least three times goby sighed is it only three he demanded and he added firmly it will be more yet and i said no because i had no idea of marrying any one that was rot said goby for if you married no one else you would marry me certainly not as you are retorted penelope i want you and all men that i know to reform goby was not astonished at anything penelope said i reformed long ago he said as soon as i saw you i said id reform and i did it was a great deal of trouble but i did it oh youve no idea how i suffered but i said plantagenet my boy if you are to be worthy you must buck up this was encouraging im glad ive had so much influence said pen who didnt quite know what his reforms had been but there are other things this is merely negative what are you doing to be useful to the state are you loafing about on your money do you do any work are you educating yourself goby gasped i say come lady penelope ive done all that education why i had a horrid time at school and at a crammers do you read asked pen severely why of course said goby what goby rubbed his cropped hair with two fingers papers anything said pen well i read the sportsman and the pink un at least i did before i reformed and the referee said goby books not many said goby but i will what do you recommend i think tennyson and shelley would do you good said pen but you had better ask mr de vere and do you do anything useful de vere oh lord cried goby anything useful why i was in the army and now you do nothing well said penelope i think you had better begin at once any man i know has to do something useful you must go to the war office and ask to be made something again i think a colonelcy of a militia regiment would suit you and i am going to ask mr de vere to take an interest in your reading the devil said goby i say my dear lady penelope i cant stand him why you may have seen we are barely civil to each other i shall speak to him firmly said penelope and its for his good too he leads an unhealthy indoor life i want you to change all that you row a great deal still dont you since i reformed i began again said goby he felt the muscles of his right arm with complacency take him out and make him row then said pen and while he rows you can read poetry to him and so on it will be good for both of you but said goby yes if i do this will you marry me penelope shook her head if you do it ill think whether ill marry you oh said the soldier and if i just cant hit it off with that poet then i wont think about it replied pen ill never never consider the possibility of marrying any one who isnt leading a useful life and educating himself and living on less than a thousand a year can you do that too dashed if i see how it can be done said plantagenet goby but ill try oh yes ill try now you talk to chloe said penelope and she went away to the rescue of the poet for bob had got him in a corner illustration captain plantagenet goby vc late of the guards who was ordered to read poetry i say mr de vere wasnt that ripping of old goby to say hed give me a real pedigree bullpup he knows a bullpup from a windowshutter as baker says you dont like them no but you would if you had one i feed mine myself and i wear thick gloves sos not to get hydrophobia when he bites hes a most interesting dog and not so goodtempered as most bulldogs when he sees a cat oh my its fun look here when goby gives me the new pup with the pedigree you can have mine if you like cheap i know you have a place in the country and you must want a bulldog will you buy him good heavens no said the poet humph cried bob who of course had quite forgotten that he was doing all this for goby and was just enjoying himself why what do you do in the country without a dog do you ride no said de vere well of alli say mr de vere what do you do do you walk about and make poetry and do you like making it old guth i mean mr guthrie hes my tutor and hes over there talking to mrs cadwallader he reads a lot and some of yours too oh does he said de vere who began to take some interest does he oh a lot of yours he says most of it i think and does he like it bob put his head on one side well he says its not bad some of it de vere flinched at this faint praise indeed and what does he like best he asked oh the beastliest rot returned bob browning and shelley and i say do you see that bulge in his pocket thats catullus he reads him all day but here comes pen i say wont you have my bullpup ill let you have him for half a sovereign i got him for a sovereign at least baker did i think your poetrys very fine sir mr guthrie lent me some but penelope came across the lawn and de vere forgot bob and the bullpup and fell down and worshipped and the goddess took hold of him and stripped a lot of his poetry away and set a few facts before him and made him gasp i heard a very strange rumour lady penelope he said when he was once more standing upright before aphrodite i heardoh but it was absurd i cant believe it then it is probably true said the goddess breathlessly for i mean to have my own way and to initiate a reform in marriages mr de vere i have been reading the accounts of some fashionable weddings lately and they made me ill what you have heard is quite true the poet shook his head i have had the honour to beg you to believe a thousand times that i am devoted to you three times i think said pen who was good at arithmetic is it only thrice but do i understand that if i were to have the inexpressible delight of winning your love lady penelope that the marriage would be a secret one that no one would know of it i mean that said penelope enthusiastically it is a new departure an assertion of a just individualism although i am a socialist i abhor ceremonies and will not be interfered with i have stated with the utmost clarity to all my relations that i shall not consult them or let them know until i choose and i shall only get married if i ever do on these terms i agree to them said the poet lady penelope will you do me the inexpressible honour to be my wife oh dear no said pen why certainly not mr de vere i dont love any one yet and perhaps i never shall but what i say is this ill think as to whether i shall marry you if you do as i wish about this matter and about others my blessed lady said the poet is there anything i would not dare or do ive told captain goby exactly the same thing said penelope thereby putting her pretty foot upon the sudden flowers of de veres imagination and what i want of you is to be more an outofdoor man you live too much in rooms hothouses mr de vere and in your own garden i was in a garden i a poet with one who was oh and is an angel said de vere but now i dwell in arid deserts shall i say the desert of gobi what have i to do with him shall he dare to pretend to you dear lady hes a very good chap said pen quite shortly and i think it would do you good to associate with him more ive told him so and he agrees i want you to make him read a little and exercise his imagination and he can take you out rowing and shooting perhaps and i think a little hunting wouldnt do you harm you might ask him to stay with you and hell ask you and i want you to go out in motorcars good heavens said de vere i know it will be hard said pen consolingly but you know what i want its not enough to be rich and write poetry mr de vere i think you might read statistics statistics are a tonic and i want you to be a useful citizen too there are things to be done just look at my cousin bob now hell be a splendid man he wanted to sell me a bullpup murmured the poet hes a good boy said pen affectionately and his instincts are to be trusted i think a bulldog would do you good perhaps and i shall expect to hear you have asked captain goby to stay with you and dont forget the statistics ill do it said the unhappy poet for while the one hope i have exists and until vain desire at last and vain regret go hand in hand to death i am your slave and as he went away he called bob to him ill give you half a sovereign for that bulldog he said bitterly oh i say but baker says hes worth two sovereigns cried bob ill give you two said the poet and bob danced on the lawn chapter iv if penelope had had any sense of humour she would have deprived the round world of much to laugh at in sad times when laughter was wanted but thanks be to whatever gods there are some folks have no humour and some have a little and a few much and thus the world gets on in spite of the spirit of gravity which as may be remembered by students of philosophy nietzsche branded as the enemy pen went ahead bent on cutting her own swath in the hayfield and she cut a big one goby and the poet must stand as exemplars of her clear and childlike method it was pens short way with her lovers she got rivaulx who was nationalist and antisemite to his manicured fingertips and had been mixed up in the dreyfus case and set him cheek by jowl with gordon alias isaac levi she made them dine together in public and the poor marquis being head over heels in love with the earnest creature who was so beautiful submitted like a lamb very well i will said rivaulx there were almighty shrieks in the paris press the journal had an article that was wonderful the affair woke up antisemitism again rivaulx had been bought by jewry france was once more betrayed the bottom of the world was falling out pen with no sense of humour had a native capacity for discovering every ones real weakness as the frenchman would rather have died than dine as he did so gordon would almost prefer to die suddenly than to run the risk of it he had wonderful brains and was a power in finance he could risk a million when he hadnt it or when he had it as coolly as most men can risk a penny on the chance of a slotmachine working but physically he was timid rivaulx went ballooning he intended to rival santosdumont you must go with him mr gordon said penelope gordon nearly fainted but pen was firm as firm as a rock gordon offered to subscribe to all the hospitals in london if she would let him off he offered to build a small one and endow it he even suggested that he would build a church but the poor man had to go it was now thoroughly understood that any man who refused to do exactly what she told him was struck off the list the comic papers were almost comic about it on the day that gordon went up with rivaulx in an entirely nondirigible balloon the crystal palace grounds were crowded with all the frenchmen and all the jews in london the balloon came down in a turnipfield fifteen miles from anywhere and gordon got back to london and went to bed he was consoled by a telegram from penelope who congratulated him on overcoming his natural cowardice and suggested he should do it again ill give her up first said gordon knowing all the time that he could no more do it than give up finance he went out and robbed a lot of his friends as a compensation for disturbance and found himself a hero in about fortyeight hours the sensation of being looked on as a man of exceptional grit so pleased him that he adored penelope more than ever he was as proud of having been in a balloon as rivaulx was of having dined teteatete with him in the open she sent for rufus q plant and she introduced him to lord bramber plant was a big american with the common delusion among americans that he had an entirely english accent but he hated aristocrats bramber had an oxford accent balliol variety and disliked americans more than getting up in the morning he was a finelooking young fellow with a good skull who did nothing with it he had the tendencies of a citizen of sybaris and got up at noon plant rose at dawn bramber loved horses and hated motorcars plant had a manufactory of motors pen sent them away together on a little tour and hinted delicately to plant that his english accent would be improved by a little oxford polish and as for you lord bramber when you come back i hope you will be more ready to acknowledge that you dont know everything mr plant will do you good and will teach you to drive a motor she had never been so beautiful she showed at her best when her interest in humanity made her courageous and brutal the colour in her cheeks was splendid her eyes were as earnest as the sea if bramber choked he submitted though he blasphemed awfully when he got alone go at once said penelope she paired off carteret williams with jimmy carew ara williams knew as much about art as a hog does of harmony jimmy thought the war correspondent a howling philistine as indeed he was and believed anything that could not be painted was a mere byproduct of the universe youll do each other good said pen clasping her beautiful hands together with enthusiasm jimmy wanted to draw her at once williams wished for an immediate invasion so that he could save her life and write a flamboyant article about it show him pictures mr carew beginning with turner and whistler make him understand that art isnt everything mr williams she sent them away together and was wonderfully pleased with herself they are all fine men she said thoughtfully but it is curious that every man i know thinks every other man more or less of a fool or an idiot or a cad they are dreadfully onesided when they come back they will be much improved this is my work in the world and i dont care a bit what people say people said lots though after a bit the fun died down except among her own people and even they laughed at last at least every one did but titania and she had no more sense of humour than penelope herself indeed she had less for penelope could understand a joke when it was explained to her carefully and titania couldnt and in after years pen came to see the humourous side of things she even appreciated a joke against herself which is the crucial test of humour but titania died maintaining that life was a serious business and should be taken like medicine i never heard of more insane proceedings said titania never the notion of sending that poor jew up in a balloon with that mad frenchman balloons at the best are blasphemous and to make captain goby read with poor little de vere im sure there will be murder done before shes married and now its an understood thing that she will marry one of them and brading laughs if he is only her halfbrother i consider him responsible and augustin smiles and smokes and smokes and smiles and chloe cadwallader whom i never approved of and never shall backs her up of course one of these days i shall tell chloe cadwallader what i think of her i say granny what do you think of her asked bob never mind said titania there are things that you know nothing of robert oh are there said bob i say granny i aint sure of that ive been expelled from three schools and baker says oh bother baker cried his exasperated grandmother i think mr guthrie might keep you away from baker he cant said bob cheerfully old guth and i have made a treaty i do what he tells me between ten and twelve and what i like afterward if we are reading latin and the clock strikes twelve i say mr guthrie dont you think latins rot and he says oh is it twelve i thought it was only eleven i get on with guth i tell you and he was very thick with goby who had given him the pedigree bullpup mr de vere now owned the interesting one which had to be fed with gloves on and loathed it with an exceeding hatred only exceeded by his hatred for goby i say pen you go it said bob theres heaps of fun in this they all tip me now like winking but pen did not see the fun it was a serious business she looked after her lovers with the greatest care they brought her reports they complained of each other she smoothed over difficulties and explained what they were to do how the devil am i to live on a thousand a year said goby but he tried it and found it quite exciting it exercised his selfcontrol wonderfully he went into the war office once a week and demanded some kind of job and was put off with all kinds of regulations he sent a telegram to penelope the first week saying that according to his accounts he had spent no more than l she wired congratulations and received another wire have made a mistake forgot to include a few bills will be more careful in future goby plant said what a thousand a year thats easy i can live on thirty shillings a week my dear lady penelope ive done it on half a dollar a day ill show you he took one room in bloomsbury and sent in his bills and accounts to her weekly she suggested he should find out if his great success in the united states had ruined any one in particular and if so that he should compensate them this cost him a hundred thousand dollars almost every other day she got a telegram something like this have found another person i ruined am cabling five thousand dollars to widow and orphans man is dead or another find man said to be a lunatic but perfectly sane except on point of trusts have cabled for his transfer to more comfortable asylum or widow refuses money with insults have settled it on daughter and have given son job or man in question has given amount cabled to republicans of new york has recovered and has started a trust himself this was very satisfactory penelope saw she was doing good in the middle of her joy she received a wire from goby may i stop poetry with de vere doctor says i am overdoing it goby she also received one at the same time from de vere if i could have a week to myself to write satire should be eternally grateful doctor says rowing may be carried to excess the bulldog is well de vere the marquis de rivaulx after a fortnight with gordon asked to be allowed to go over to paris to see his mother but he acknowledged that gordon was not a bad chap though he was as white as a sheet in the balloon and he told me my dear lady what to buy he knows very well what to buy and what to sell he is immensely clevair oh yes and may i go and see maman she let him go but not before he promised to take no part in any further antisemitic proceedings she told gordon not to brag so much of having been in a balloon you know you were afraid she said the marquis said you were of course i was said gordon but i went didnt i that was unanswerable she had an at home once a week it was understood that no one but her own relatives and members of the horde were to call on that day she then issued any directions that she thought of during the week bradstock was now openly and recklessly on her side i believe youre doing good real good said augustin im proud of you dont mind my laughing pen oh but you are wonderful he gave her advice kick young bramber into public life he said hes got brains lord bramber said pen you are to go into parliament at once speak to lord bradstock about it and ill talk to mrs mytton on your behalf i expect you to be an undersecretary of state at once damn this is worse than plant said the obedient bramber nevertheless he owned that plant was a man and a real good sort i go to see him lady penelope in his room in bloomsbury hes living on about half a crown a day iohyes im coming down to the thousand by degrees and of course if you want me to go into the house ill go carteret williams was there and was put through his paces by pen about art he had learnt something about it by rote the academy is composed of painters he said mechanically but there are few artists in it i quite agree with carew who had his pictures chucked before they made him an associate through fear turner is a very great artist he shows how near the sublime can get to the ridiculous whistler is also great he shows how near the ridiculous can go to the sublime art is a combination of the material and the spiritual so carew says he showed me a lot of blake and he says that the beauty of blake is that you cant understand him by any ordinary means such as the intellect im not up to blake yet the old masters are very fine i admit it velasquez is dry but wonderful rembrandt appeals to me because he is very dark i think he would be better if he were darker we go to the national gallery every day and then i take him to the press club where he hears about real life when carew came he owned that williams wasnt a bad sort and hes doing his level best to understand said carew with enthusiasm he stands before a picture of mine every day for an hour while i explain it he sees something in it at last and hes reading about art and is beginning to see why a photograph isnt the last word of things hes led a wonderful life lady penelope and when he gets on what hes seen and done i feel almost ashamed to live as i do thats right said pen every artist should and every man who is not an artist should be sorry that he is not we are far from perfect yet how beautiful she looked thought carew she lives in the world of the ideal and so do i i am very much pleased with everything said pen at large to the assembly and de vere who was having a holiday for his satire was pleased too and goby was delighted at being let off poetry for awhile not but what theres something in it i admit said goby critically robert lindsay gordon is a fair snorter at it i cant say im up to shelley yet de vere read me the episomethingorother epipsychidion said pen thats it a regular waterjump of a word said goby and he took it in his stride while i boggled on the bank however im coming up hand over hand with him im reading keats with him hes all right when you get to know him lady penelope and rowings doing him no end of good hes a wellmade little chap and getting some good muscle if im not dead by the time i can take the epiwhatshisname ill make a man of him rivaulx who had come in with gordon on his return from seeing his mother in paris was very proud of himself a year ago i should not have had the courage to show myself with a jew said rivaulx triumphantly lady dear lady i thought i should have died when i asked him to dinner but now i like him he is wonderful when he says buy i buy and heigh presto the shares go up like my balloon and when he says sell i sell and they go down like a barometer when you go up oh yes and all your aristocracy admire him i saw seven great lords with him the other day and they said what company am i to be a director of gordon and he said hed ask his clerk but i have refused to be a director i should not like maman to know i know him she is very dreadful against jews owing to the affaire in france and that was the celebrated afternoon that penelope who found that she was doing good in every way to all mankind by obliterating all class and professional jealousies raised passion and curiosity to its highest point by saying with the sweetest blush very well then i promise to marry one of you chapter v penelope was the swan and all her relations were the ducks the noise they made was simply unendurable for besides titania she had cousins and other aunts or people who were in the position of aunts and she had friends who had been friends of her mother and they came down on her like the assyrian they objected to publicity especially for other people and for a young woman to become a public character was something worse than immorality nothing but penelopes entire singleness of character and her humourous want of humour enabled her to meet and overcome them and even she felt at times that flight was the only thing left she sent to her solicitor for a list of all the houses and mansions and castles that she owned and she took her motorcar and her pet chauffeur and having borrowed bob from his grandmother she set off on a tour she disappeared for a week at a time then she disappeared for two weeks she was even lost for a month she ought to be in an asylum said titania and i have to let bob go with her he is some kind of a safeguard how do i know she isnt married already bob dear bob has ceased to confide in me when i interrogate him he puts me off i get nothing out of him the only thing that i can congratulate myself on is that now instead of baker says it is pen says and i doubt i own i doubt and i cannot help it whether bob is not being done serious harm to considering that he will one day be a duke a duke should be brought up properly goring was brought up badly i deeply regret to say he laughs at penelopes behaviour and says girls will be girls i say they will be women and he says thank the lord and i dont know what he means but as i say this wretched girl may be married by now it is already months since she said in my hearing to a whole crowd of men i promise to marry one of you was there ever an aunt in a more unfortunate position i feel as if i should become a lunatic augustin do you hear me i am rapidly becoming insane oh ah said augustin who always knew more about pens actions than any one else she wrote to him from a hundred places keep your eye upon mr gordon she said and what are people saying about lord brambers speech i shall be up in town in time to see mr carews new picture i got a letter from mr de vere saying that captain goby was learning wordsworths ode on the intimations of immortality in childhood by heart mr de vere says he is doing what i told him and is keeping his eye on mr roosevelt i told him to model himself on the president of the united states he says he rows and has bought a sandow exerciser and he says it does not make him so tired now mr williams told me when i was last in town that he was thinking of writing a guide to dulwich gallery if war didnt break out i am afraid he hopes it will mr plants last weekly accounts were only s d i advised him to see a doctor if he thought it was doing him harm the marquis has written a very good article in the revue des deux mondes against antisemitism i am greatly pleased with this i hope mr carews picture is intelligible i told him it was no absolute sign of genius to be entirely incomprehensible he took it very well i think mr williams will have a good effect on him i have visited ten mansions seven castles two with moats mother used to love moats because there are none in america and several other houses of mine most need repairs i shall be home next week tell aunt that bob is very well and brown and is learning to drive my car at full speed down a narrow road with sharp turns in it smith says he will be the best driver in england when he is grown up if he goes on and doesnt have his nerve broken up early by an accident but i think his nerve is good though i cant always tell as i shut my eyes when we go very fast goodbye now dear guardy your loving penelope p s i am sure i am doing good bob was very sure of it too i say pen old guth will be lonely wont he but hes all right if he has a bally catullus in his pocket and he draws his screw just the same granny is very decent to him take it all around and i like him because he likes dogs i must wire to baker to hear how captain is getting on i called him captain because old goby gave him to me i say pen dont you think smith is a ripping good driver he says that hell be my chauffeur when im a duke if you dont want him he says him and mell win every bally race id like to do that i begin to think horseracing is rot you see three or four people cant ride a racehorse and the responsibility of driving you fast when the roads crooked is the fun every time i miss a cart pen i feel as happy as if id hit rhodes for four every time he sent a ball down to me that would be fun baker saysno i mean smith says that all other sports are rot of the worst kind he says if hes ever rich hell go through the city every day as fast as he can he hates the police and some of them hate him he rode over a sergeant in the kingston road once but he didnt hurt him much when shall we leave this castle and go to another one i hope the next is a long way off smith says he wants a good road to show what shell do when shes out to the last notch and it must be downhill and in town while pen was going about the country peoples tongues ran as fast as any motorcar it is nonsense said one shes married already i know shes not i paid a shilling and looked it up at somerset house thats nothing said a barrister they could have been married under wrong names that wouldnt be legal yes it would its only illegal if a false name is used and one of the parties doesnt know then the one who is deceived can get a declaration of nullity said the barrister oh well but who is it its no one i dont believe shell marry at all shes a crank its madness i hear the duchess of goring has taken to her bed well goring hasnt i saw him at the frivolity who is it now i dont know her name but wheres lady penelope no one knew but bradstock and even augustin was behind by a post or two none of the horde knew and they began to get suspicious of each other goby watched de vere and de vere kept his eye on goby it was obvious from the newspapers that bramber was in the house gordon was seen at his club and then carteret williams was missing carew hunted for him in vain at the press club and at the office of the morning hour there was no war yet though there were rumours of it in the balkans as usual it got about that she had married williams though he had only run away from carew for a week the very worst of the lot wailed titania i knew it would be williams hes hardly a gentleman though he comes of a good family being a war correspondent makes a man brutal i knew i knew i knew it was williams and now i shall never speak to her and he will beat her in time i know it and there will be a horrible scandal and what oh what can she have done with bob augustin go at once and find where bob is i knew it would be williams didnt i always say it would be williams i could have forgiven her any one else gordon came to ask bradstock if it was true and bradstock had a sense of humour if pen had none my dear sir he said how can i tell she liked him very much took a great interest in him she told me he was writing a guide to the art of dulwich gallery do you think that a bad sign gordon groaned it looks bad lord bradstock but i dont believe she takes much interest in him she takes an interest in me my lord why i went up in a balloon all on her account i went with that madman the french marquis and as sure as my names le i mean gordon theres not another woman in the world id have done it for dont you think that going up in a balloon when youd rather die than do it ought to touch a womans heart i give you my word that she as good as said go up in a balloon and ill well or words to that effect i tell you what lord bradstock i know you aint a rich man not a very rich one that is but if youll be on my side ill put you on to a good thing the best thing in the market its going up likeoh like a beastly balloon sirmy lord i mean im making it go up and ill tell you when to sell oh lord im very unhappy my lord i love the ground she walks on id like to buy it at the price of a city frontage come in with me my lord and you shall have a tip that half a dozen dukes are dying for theres a room full of bally dukes waiting to see me now and i gave them the slip will you come in with me do do he was a lamentable object and there was a spot upon his hat which did not shine he worked at it eagerly with his sleeve and stood waiting for a reply i dont mind telling you said bradstock that my income is only five thousand a year poor beggar murmured gordon but i only spend four and if i had more what could i do with it give it me said gordon eagerly and ill make more of it for you man alivemy lord i meani can make it millions there was a faint suspicion of the millionth in the word i can make it millionth said gordon ive put a pound or two into that frenchmans pocket i can tell you though he did take me up in a balloon and ill put fifty for one into yourth so help me i dont want it well you can give it away shrieked gordon theyll make you a duke if you only give away enough if there wathnt a faint thuspithion of jewish blood in me id be a baron now at leathth give it away to hospithalths build a lunatic asylum finanth your party and if that dont thucktheed go into beer or biscuits and youll be made anything you like if they would make me thirty id do it said bradstock thirty dukes asked gordon in bewilderment thirty years old said bradstock illustration leopold norfolk gordon some said his real name was isaac levi gordon advanced on him and took him by a button my lord he said solemnly money ith youth and strength and everything except lady penelope if you had a million youd feel twentyfive when i had a measly hundred thousand i was thin and always going to doctors when i got two i got fatter and gave em up now im worth two millionth but bradstock said brutally no mr gordon i dont want money and i dont want you to marry lady penelope if i had a million id rather lose it than see her do so did you tell her that asked gordon i did im damned glad said gordon if you want a cat to go one way pull its tail the other tut tut said bradstock and gordon went away sorrowfully for he had great riches and saw no good in them without pen bradstock had to interview all the lovers one after one they came to implore his vote and interest he saw rivaulx whose great desire was to look like an englishman and act like one rivaulx adopted a stony calm which sat upon him like a title on a jew but did not stick so tight he ended a talk which began most conventionally in a wild and impassioned waltz around bradstocks room with despair for a partner he tore at his hair but having had it clipped till it was like a shaved blackingbrush he could not get hold of it i must wed her he howled i told maman so or i shall perish i will become an englishman mon dieu i am sad i am fearfully mournful i weep exceedingly have i not done all i have eaten largely in public with mr gordon i have bought his shares and have sold them but in my heart i cannot when i return to paris i shall fight duels because i have written for dreyfus with tears in my eye and my tongue in my cheek for sorrow where is she lord bradstock tell me where she is i will go to her and say i have done all and can no more de vere tackled him too my dear chap said bradstock i dont know her mind she knows her own said de vere with much bitterness and so does that boy bob i bought a bulldog of him because she said she thought one would do me good i dont know why and now bob sells me dogs by telegram and i darent refuse em great scott said his host but why that young ruffian has an influence over her mourned the poet he is always with her he is capable of saying i am a rotter yes a rotter a dozen times a day if i refuse and to have him doing that would be more than i can endure i want her to love me and so i buy his dogs i have a bulldog which hasnt done me any good all he has done is to tear my trousers and trample over my flowerbeds i have an irish terrier who is now being cured of bulldog bites by a veterinary surgeon ive a retriever who howls at night and makes the bulldog unhappy i have a borzois with bronchitis and no hair on his tail bob wrote to say the hair would grow if i put hairwash on it myself he said men couldnt be trusted to do it and then ive goby on my hands i speak in confidence lord bradstock of course said bradstock then i own i loathe goby said de vere viciously he has less brains than my bulldog and i think the bulldog has less brains than the retriever he reads poetry because she said he was to and he makes me explain mine to him explain it and he makes me row every day hes with me and he says im not imitating roosevelt if i dont she said i was to imitate roosevelt why should i i loathe republicans she also told me i was to imitate sven hedin on inquiry i found sven hedin was an ass who explored deserts and went without water for many days goby can do that as my winecellar can testify he says he only tastes water when he cleans his teeth and then it makes him sick and though i keep wine for my friends i am a waterdrinker how can i do without it i am very unhappy i should chuck goby and give it up said bradstock i wish i could said the poet but my nature is an enduring one we learn in suffering gobies and bulldogs what we teach in song a dog may be the friend of man but a bulldog is a tailors enemy and i believe they gave goby the vc to get rid of him do they ever give decorations to get rid of people bradstock said he thought so and wondered what he could give de vere and then the poet sighed and rose i have to meet goby and lunch with him and afterward we read shelley together and then he will teach me billiards at his club i loathe billiards it is the most foolish game on earth except keeping bulldogs and gobys friends are not sympathetic they are sportsmen and ought to be hunted with bulldogs he went away sadly and bradstock lay on a sofa and laughed till he cried pen will be my death and the death of a dozen he said and as for bob no sooner had de vere departed than young bramber was announced conceited young ass said bradstock but bramber was in the house and was supposed to be doing very well he had brains no doubt and the manner of oxford balliol variety as aforesaid sat on him well he made speeches and mr mytton congratulated him on one of them nothing but his passion for penelope prevented him being as conceited as bradstock supposed him to be but it must be remembered that bradstock couldnt make speeches i thought id come and look you up said bramber i thought you could tell me something about lady penelope i cant replied bradstock i spend all my afternoons in saying so ive had rivaulx and austin de vere and gordon here already and after you go i dont doubt that goby or plant will turn up how do you get on with plant do you know bramber i believe plant is the best man of the lot of you bramber frowned he has an accent that can be cut into slabs to use his own dialect said bramber your own accent is equally disagreeable to an american said bradstock who had been in the united states several times i have no accent said bramber haughtily oh returned bradstock and how do you get along with plant bramber was obviously more jealous of plant than any one but he made a tremendous effort to be fair hes a very able man he said at last but theres no man i should find it so hard to get on with he says just what he thinks in the most awful way and because lady penelope said he was not to spend more than twentyfive pounds a week he is living on ten shillings out of bravado i hate bravado he made me dine with him in soho and our dinners came to elevenpence each where is lady penelope i dont know said bradstock i didnt see plant yesterday said bramber uneasily the devil you dont think i dont know what to think said bradstock wickedly i hear that jimmy carew hasnt been seen for days either bramber fidgeted on his chair she cant marry carew hes a thorough outsider women dont understand the word my dear chap how are you getting on in the house and have you been motoring with plant yes said bramber we killed three fowls and a dog yesterday and plant was fined ten pounds a week ago he said he would wire to lady penelope to know if that was business expenses i believe he wants to break my neck i shouldnt be surprised said bradstock has he gone out alone today do you think i suppose you know penelope is doing a lot of it now the devil she is said bramber i think ill go and look up plant bradstock got some amusement out of the situation if titania didnt chapter vi penelope came back to town about a week later and saw every one i wonder whom i love said pen for im sure i love some one and they are all so kind and sweet and good im sorry i shall have to hurt so many of them for the poor dears all adore me it was marvellous how they had developed in a short time under pens system which was evidently sound as bradstock declared plant under his tenandsixpenceaweek scheme had lost a stone weight and was as hard and fine as a coil of wire his search after the people he had ruined gave him a peace of mind to which he had long been a stranger for american millionaires in business have no peace of mind i feel good said plant meaning it both ways and my endurance of young bramber has stiffened my moral fibre whether i marry you or not mr plant said penelope i am awfully pleased with you and how has lord bramber behaved hes been death on what he called my accent said plant a little bitterly and it is notorious ive none to speak of and for that matter his own you could cut with a knife however i think hes a good boy and will discover he has brains ive talked to him straight lady penelope i told him you meant me to i said he might be a lord and the son of an earl but that he was a lazy loafing scallawag and that if hed been my son id have cowhided him that did him good it made him sit up i tell you oh he fairly fizzled and felt like going for me but he knew better he has brains and ive talked with members of your legislature who say hell do well put this down to me lady penelope credit me with this ive looked after him like a baby and ive hustled him around in my motor till he cant help going when hes out of it you and me together my dear young lady could educate the entire universe if youll only marry me ill start a university on these lines of yours the idea was a pleasing one but of course pen pointed out to him that it was his duty to do it whether she married him or not duty is duty said pen im doing all this out of a sense of duty dont marry out of a sense of it retorted plant i just want to be loved im going around feeling i want to be loved ive never been loved properly all my life and i begin to hanker after it wildly and if you do marry me lady penelope i want you to understand right here and now that i dont want you to do your duty by me if you begin to do that ill take a colts fortyfive and scatter my brains out i want love thats what i want i want it straight without water in it i see what you mean said penelope i think you are a very noblehearted man mr plant and away went poor plant to draw up a scheme for a university i think i could almost love him said the pensive penelope i couldalmost her contemplations were interrupted by captain goby he was a little paler than usual and perhaps a trifle more intelligent and he was more in love than ever ive done everything you told me he said as he sat down and eyed her wistfully ive gone into poetry like a bull at a hedge lady penelope i begin to see what it means old austin poor old josser has taken the deuces own pains over me hes read the lady of the garden to me seventeen times he wrote it ten years ago he says he wonders how he did it and so do i ive been trying to write poetry to you do you know that showed me there must be some special gift in it for i never did anything worth the horrid trouble and ive been worrying the war office like a bulldog they say theyll think of me and havent gone any further and talking of bulldogs bobs bulldog bit austin de vere and he swore like a man i was surprised but if i were you id tell bob to stop sending him more dogs hes very kind to them but they worry him bobs prices are very high too how is bob oh by the way im living on ten pounds a week need i reckon tailors bills in do you think oh yes this bulge is the golden treasury i take it out and read a lyric between meals the chaps at the rag chaff me like blazes but i dont mind so long as i improve i want to improve so as to be worthy of your intellect lady penelope the poor dear said pen when he was gone i think i could almost love him as luck would have it bob and austin de vere came in almost at the same minute for now titania couldnt keep bob away for the matter of that she did not want to bob was to be penelopes safeguard he was much better than chloe cadwallader said titania however de vere came in first he held penelopes hand no longer than a poet should as poets naturally hold girls hands rather longer than other people you are looking really well mr de vere said penelope when she was free i am well said the poet exceedingly well in a way my dear lady of the beautiful garden i owe all that to you at first i was afraid of captain goby i told lord bradstock so the other day im afraid i left him under a false impression as to my feelings to goby by the way im quite proud of goby he says i am really a powerful man and he made me row till i was worn out and then he insisted that i should use sandows exerciser i own i did it with reluctance i pointed out to goby that i did not wish to look like mr sandow goby always stopped by the posters in which mr sandow is lifting ten tons or so and pointed out certain muscles to me as ideals i was recalcitrant for although i admire mr sandow immensely i think muscle can be overdone however i used the machine which is ingenious and elastic and only dangerous if the hook comes out of the wall and ive found i rather like it i should miss it now i think it imparts a certain vigour to verse if not overdone oh for in came bob he rushed at pen and kissed her hair and then bounced at the poet i say is it true the bulldog bit you i saw goby yesterday in the park and he said so asked bob in great excitement it is true said the poet penelope shook her head at the late owner of the dog oh bob mr de vere im very sorry so was i said de vere where did he bite you asked bob anxiously was it the arm or the leg and did he hang on like a proper bulldog baker says that if a bulldog once gets hold you have to use a redhot poker to make him let go did you use a redhot poker he only snapped and fetched blood said de vere ah cried bob i always thought he wasnt a real good bulldog at any rate he bit the irish terrier said the poet i mean the one you sold to me for three pounds im glad he did sir that irish terrier though hes splendidly bred baker says has an awful temper and is very troublesome does rollo the retriever howl much at night sir oh not so very much said de vere its only when the moon is near the full that he does his best i never thought of that said bob but now i remember that it was very moony when i sent him over to you baker said youd like him his kennel is next to bakers house im much obliged to baker said de vere but the tail of the borzois is still bald bob bob opened his eyes wide oh dear i thought you would have cured him by now and how about his bronchitis thats better i hope and trust said the poet and penelope who was very greatly touched by his kindness to all these dogs sent bob into the library its so good of you to be kind to bob she said bobs a dear and he adores me he says that hes going to live with me always even when im married illustration austin de vere he wrote poetry and abhorred bulldogs and motorcars oh gasped de vere we were talking about goby i think when dear bob came in youll find him much improved im sure my dear lady penelope he has read a great deal of shelley and keats and browning with me he was especially struck with sordello i read it to him and he sat with his hand to his forehead taking it all in and every now and again he said great scott which is his way of expressing wonderment and admiration i do not know its origin ive written to doctor murray to ask him if he knows and goby oh yes youll find him improved ive done my best with him and ive really struggled hard any improvement you notice is i really believe under you and providence due to me and when he went penelope sat thinking the poor dear how nicely he took the bulldog bites and the howling of the retriever i thinki think i could almost love him and that afternoon and evening she saw bramber and carteret williams and jimmy carew and gordon and they were all most marvellously improved bramber was alert and bright and began to show that he had some ambition in him and if he did not tell penelope his exact mind about plant he did show some little appreciation of the americans qualities associating with him has done you good said pen i see it has you lived far too much for yourself lord bramber i cannot endure selfishness im not selfish any more i think said bramber i rather like plant he seems a man take him all around he is abrupt perhaps and brutal i own ive found him trying and he says things one finds it hard to forgive yes he told me said pen delightedly oh he told me he said you ought to be beaten severely and he said you took it very nicely did you bramber bit his lip i did thats right said pen oh im improving you all so much youve no idea how much improved you are mr mytton said hed make something out of you lord bramber did he really oh yes he said he made fair successes out of very much worse material hes quite a dear she sighed when he was gone but before she could add that she might almost love him carew and williams came in together and before she could greet them gordon came too williams eyed him with strange ferocity for he was by nature a hater of hebrews and wanted to dust the floor with him pen who was as quick as lightning caught his glances and said to him sweetly i think you would get on nicely with mr gordon and williams blenched visibly oh i couldnt leave carew he said im deep in art very deep i adore it carew has introduced me to several academicians and i have bought a box of paints one academician took me home with him and showed me his pictures he doesnt agree with jimmy altogether and he says jimmy will alter his opinions presently his idea is that when a man is an ara he is only beginning you see he also explained to me the attitude of the ra with regard to the chantrey bequest he says that if they found a good picture not by an academician they would buy it which is interesting isnt it he was painting a picture called war and wanted my opinion i said id ask jimmy because i didnt know anything about war except what id seen i dont know why he was chuffy about it i find artists get chuffy and huffy very quick and i dont know what for do you think there will be war soon penelope didnt know and said she wanted eternal peace and happiness for every one and meant having it if it could be got by any legitimate influence war is horrible it is said carew who joined in just here after getting away from gordon who told him to buy hittites at war is horrid williams is always talking of it im not said williams angrily i want peace eternal peace and happiness for every one ah so do i put in gordon my idea is to have a peaceful life far from the roar of london in a deep green vale where i shall hear no one talking of shares and where mines are unknown and there are no chinese or crushing reports why is it that most reports from mines are crushing i wish i knew ah how sweet it would all be said beautiful penelope you could keep cows mr gordon i adore them said gordon there is a breed without horns isnt there they look incomplete said jimmy what are you painting now asked pen im not really painting im modelling in clay as you told me said the obsequious lover dont you remember saying i was to model in clay im doing williams in clay he looks very well in it im also doing a bull going at a gate when i get tired of williams i do the bull and when im fatigued by the bull i go back to williams and are they like asked penelope oh exactly replied carew and the interesting conversation was interrupted by chloe and ethel but penelope said to herself that they were all dears mr williams is greatly improved she murmured happily and mr carew looks more healthy and less engrossed in himself i was awfully glad to hear mr gordon speak like that about a peaceful life and williams slipped carew on the doorstep and went to his club he roared of war till two oclock in the morning and then got three outofwork war correspondents in the corner and told them the great story of his love but jimmy went down to chelsea and damned modelling in clay to other impressionist painters and had a real good time as for gordon of the deep green vale he went home and found a clerk waiting with a bundle of cables from all quarters of the mining globe he sent a wire to bramber to be let off an engagement to hear a debate on drains on the whole every one was tolerably happy if we do not include titania and the retriever who howled at nights chapter vii it is possible that penelope never enjoyed herself so much as she did at this period she was so busy that she had no time to worry her team took all her time she was young she was beautiful she was adored she was popular she was even notorious a dozen reporters dogged her footsteps and when they lost her they followed her lovers they haunted her doorstep armed with kodaks they invented paragraphs they hunted her men and her maids they made love to the girls and seduced the men into neighbouring bars one newspaper man who belonged to the mayfair daily got into her establishment as a footman and was discovered by the butler drawing penelope at dinner when he should have been drawing corks a search in his clothes revealed some pencils and a notebook and another book of drawings they were of such a character that the reporter was put outside into the street the butler could have forgiven the sketch of his mistress there was one of himself that no man could forgive the great desire of all these men was to spot the winner penelopes maid harriet weekes who was more or less engaged to timothy bunting the groom a sad mesalliance by the way found it impossible to go out without being accosted respectfully by a new admirer who tried to lead the conversation around to her mistress if you please my lady another of them spoke to me today i hope my lady you dont think it my fault said weekes what do they say asked penelope curiously she took great interest in the manners and customs of other classes perhaps with a view of altering them when she got time oh my lady they always say the same thing i think men are very much the same all over the world they say its a fine day even if its raining and of course it is and they say they want to walk a little way with me begging your pardon and that i am very beautiful and that they have long loved me if you please my lady and have been trying to speak about it for years and i tell em i dont want em and i dont to be sure though one hes on the piccadilly circus gazette is a very handsome man with a heagles glance dressed in gray tweeds and they wont be put off i assure you my lady men on newspapers are hextremely persevering with a fine flow of language and if being persuaded to take a little walk for they are difficult to put off by trade i do take one they begin to ask begging your pardon im sure my lady if i am your sister and im sure im as like you as a butterfly is to a beetle as mr bunting says though he adores the ground i walk on if hes to be believed which im not sure of yet and the butler is very angry with me about the whole affair and one who said he was the editor of the times which i dont believe in the least because it doesnt seem likely does it my lady that the editor of the times would do such things himself said he wanted to marry me and put me on the staff as his lovely bride i must say he spoke most beautifully and he said he knew captain goby and also mr gordon and he said they were getting thin he thought and another quite the gentleman though by his trousers poor and careful said he owned most of the daily telegraph and i couldnt help looking at his clothes he was very quick and said that was owing to the competition of the halfpenny papers would i save the daily telegraph from himpending ruin by telling him which it would be he said and i said flatly that i wouldnt i never saw such wicked impudence oh yes my lady your hairs done now and its as lovely as a dream and as miss weekes finished she wondered quite as much as any of the newspaper men who it was to be its my belief she said to timothy a little later that my lady is beginning to incline to one of em ive noticed shes quieter like and more gentle and theres a soft sadness in her eye and a colour that comes and goes there aint one of the biling worthy of her said timothy bitterly but there miss weekes there aint no man worthy of a real beautiful good lidy a fair wonder how i dares to hope that some day far off when motorcars has killed every orse youll be mrs bunting its a great come down tim said harriet mr gubbles says he wonders too if he wasnt the butler and old id plug im said timothy crossly its all right for me to wonder but he aint in it ah but class distinctions is hard to get over mr bunting said harriet you must pardon a butlers feelings even mr gubbles has his feelings and he agrees with you that theres no one but a duke ought to marry our dear lady and she demeaning herself if i dare say so with academicians and war correspondencies and jew men not but what mr gordon is very gentlemanly and generous only yesterday mr bunting he says to me when he met me outside do you read and i says yes sir being some flustered and he says you read that and it was a fivepound note and he adds something about your vote and hinfluence but i cant do it mr bunting i cant if it was captain goby i might and if it was young lord bramber i might more so and even if it was mr de vere with a duke remote in his family but for a jewish man i cant so i said thank you sir and he went off but some one is beginnin to rise up in my ladys mind i saw it plainly when i was dressing her it would be worth more than five pounds to know who is risin yes said timothy ow much would it run to do you think i believe it would be worth a public ouse beer and spirits asked timothy eagerly and a corner ouse at that replied harriet nodding her head oh arriet said timothy with a gasp you fairly dazzle me the newspaper men had dazzled harriet but indeed what she said seemed true to her and it seemed true to lord bradstock who had like the man of the circus gazette an eagles glance she has been playing fair said bradstock but one of them is drawing ahead titania good heavens who is he and how do you know asked titania its intuition said bradstock intuition combined with or founded on a little observation shes different titania she takes no interest in the london county council you dont say so cried the duchess in alarm bradstock nodded its a fact i asked her if she had read the last debate and she hadnt and when i mentioned the deceased wifes sister she yawned that looks bad said titania for only a week ago she raved about her and goring said hed vote for her if she insisted on it and she did insist and tears came in her eyes about the poor thing well i told you so said bradstock and i do hope it isnt williams im afraid of williams hes capable of knocking her down and carrying her off on his shoulder do you remember with what joy she read us the account of the savage tribe somewhere was it the east of london where they do that it made me shiver with apprehension said titania oh if she was only married safely to a good duke one not like goring is there a good duke augustin several so im informed replied bradstock and there are quite a number of good earls some quite admirable but i wish youd get hold of chloe cadwallader and find out something titania bristled like a porcupine there is no need to find out anything about mrs cadwallader she said if penelope wasnt too dangerously innocent to be single she would not have anything to do with her im sure the poor woman was only silly said bradstock havent we all been silly in our time titania didnt i marry twice and you married once ill speak to her said the duchess hastily if we can only find out who it is we can im sure prevent her doing as she says and making a secret marriage of it the scandal would be horrid oh augustin suppose she did it and had a large family suddenly i should die of it good heavens said bradstock you alarm me titania you are so gloomy she would surely acknowledge her marriage then titania threw up her hands augustin im sure of nothing with penelope i cannot answer for her she will bring my gray hairs with sorrow to cremation said bradstock she has invested money in a crematorium i thought it was dairyfarming cried titania oh but think augustin of the horror of the situation as it might be what would her royal highness say to me imagine her marrying and keeping it dark and having as i say a large family suddenly without a husband producible on the moment to answer natural inquiries imagine her saying then that her marriage was her own business and her certificate of marriage firmly withheld by a young and obstinate mother in a safe she has a safe she has a safe augustin with many keys i wish i could get at it and find things out that are in it i wish i knew a burglar a good honest and reliable burglar married and trustworthy that i could send in to break it open most girls have a desk with an ordinary key easy to open but penelope has a lord milners safe with patent things to keep it shut its not natural its wicked oh i did hope when i found out what the duke was like and what his ways were that i knew the extent of my troubles but there is no end to them and penelope begins where goring leaves off is it as bad as that asked bradstock and then theres bob by jove said augustin i believe bobs the key to the safe titania hes more likely to find something out than any one titania nodded solemnly augustin you are right ill speak to bob let me do it no no augustin he is very quick and suspicious and he loves her he adores her this requires a feminine intelligence i will work upon him quietly and she went away to work upon bob quietly chapter viii now titania believed that she was very smart and very clever and that she would do things subtly and do them better than bradstock or a barrister even if he was a kc and as it is the most invariably weak point in people that they think young people fools or at any rate easily hoodwinked she really believed that bob her dearly beloved young scoundrel of a grandson would be as easy to work on as butter and yet she had the sense to see that bob adored penelope i am very greatly troubled about penelope bob she said to him as soon as she got him alone dont you worry about pen granny replied bob cheerfully she can take care of herself why she can drive a motorcar now up to about thirty miles an hour and geordie smith says shes all there and so does old guth he had long talks with her and he says she has brains i tell you old guth knows em when he sees em titania nodded oh i know she is clever dear but her ideas are so extraordinary aint they said bob i do wonder which of em shell marry dont you indeed i do replied his grandmother have you any idea bob which she likes best bob shook his head not me i wish it was goby old goby is a ripping good sort he knows whats what does old goby goby tipped him freely and frequently and bob sold him a spavined pony aged fifteen years hes a bit of a fool of course said bob thoughtfully do you know granny he isnt the judge of horses youd think he is does penelope ever confide in you bob asked titania there was a touch of anxiety in her voice that the boy felt at once he put his head on one side and looked at her out of the corner of his eye he didnt answer the question i say granny dont you think i can have a bigger allowance now i find mine much too little if i had ten shillings a week more i could get on for a bit you shall have it said titania does she ever confide in you bob some said bob carelessly which do you think she likes best asked titania i dont know said bob but i dare say i could find out i say should you be very angry if it was gordon titania uttered a little scream great heavens bob i should die of it bob sat down and looked at her hes not bad granny not half mean oh no not at all he had given bob as much as he gave miss harriet weekes about three days before i rather like him said bob pen thinks hes much improved since she put him in harness with the frenchy it touched her his going up in a balloon i say may i go up in a balloon rivaulx said i might no screamed his grandmother oh bob you wouldnt i wont if you dont want me to sighed bob but its a horrid disappointment he says going up in one is jolly and london underneath is ripping if i dont will you ask grandfather to give me another hunter yes of course said poor titania but what do you think about penelope could you find out anything bob if i let you go and stay with her bobs eyes gleamed rather he said of course but i neednt worry about old guth if i do ive been working very hard and i think a holiday would do him good too im very much overworked do i look tired granny i always feel tired now in my head guth says a breakdown from overwork is much worse than most fatal diseases you shall go to penelope if shell have you said his anxious grandmother do you have headaches bob not headaches said bob i shouldnt call em headaches exactly theyre pains and old guth says he had em when he was at oxford they get worse he says and then the breakdown comes and you have to take a very long rest ill go on working if you like though he sighed you shall go to your cousins said titania and my dear dear bob keep your eye on penelope and tell me all you discover her ideas are very strange you know and we are all so anxious about her future so am i said bob if she married the wrong one i shall be out of it i couldnt get on well with old de vere and if she married him im quite convinced he wouldnt buy any more dogs i want her to marry goby or bramber but i think bramber is rather mean in some ways and very thoughtless of others i told him i wanted some salmon fishing at his fathers place in scotland and hes said nothing about it since i shouldnt mind lord bramber so much said titania but im afraid it wont be bramber cheer up said her grandson ill look after her but dont forget about the extra ten shillings and the horse could you give me the ten shillings for six weeks now granny and he went off to penelopes house and marched in on her pen im coming to stay with you if youll have me he said of course i will said penelope but how did you manage it im overworked said bob solemnly and sitting on chairs and learning latin dont agree with me i want more open air i think or i shall get consumption he was fat and ruddy and as strong as a bullcalf he put his arm around pens neck i say pen i do love you he said i think its rot im so young or id have married you myself grannys in an awful state about you pen she asked me if i knew who it was you liked best and she threw out hints a foot wide that i was to find out if i could indeed said pen and what did you say bob chuckled i said the best thing would be for me to come and stay with you and thats why im here but i say pen ill never sneak not even if you marry mr de vere grannys raised my allowance ten bob a week and im to have another hunter i got too big for the pony so i sold him to goby goby looked very melancholy but he said he wanted him badly for some reason and he said he hoped id be his friend always i like poor old goby i think ill go into the park pen my things will be here by and by couldnt we go to the theatre tonight theres a ripping farce with a fight in it at the globe and will you have plum pudding for dinner and ice meringues he went into the park and met williams there i say mr williams wheres mr carew he asked damn carew said williams i dont know where he is and i dont want to im staying at my cousins said bob at lady penelopes asked the war correspondent thats it said bob would you like to know what theatre we are going to tonight yes said williams eagerly bob shook his head i dont suppose i ought to tell you tell me something very exciting about some bloody war mr williams williams grunted or an execution have you ever seen heads chopped off with a sword often in china bob i say what fun said bob tell me all about it is it true they smoke cigarettes while they are being chopped and do they mind could i see one if i went out i say if youll describe it ill see if i can tell you about the theatre carteret williams described it seventeen said bob by jove ill tell this to penelope shell be greatly interested do you think i could be a war correspondent mr williams id like to be because latin wouldnt be needed im awfully sorry for war correspondents in those days when no one but the roman chaps did any fighting ive enjoyed that story of yours more than anything ive heard for years mr williams when they write about these things in books why dont they describe the blood the way you do its the globe were going to theres a ripping farce there i wish they would do an execution of pirates i say dont tell pen i told you she might be waxy with me think of something else to tell me goodbye and he went to look at the ducks williams is all right said bob i wonder if it is williams and at home pen began to know who it was and ethel mytton began to know it was some one and so did chloe cadwallader miss weekes was right there is no mistake about that chapter ix penelope was certainly on the verge of being in love to go no farther than that she discovered that certain of the horde had a curious tendency to disappear from her mind though none of them lost any opportunity of appearing in her drawingroom she was so sorry for those she didnt love that her kindness to them increased her dread of the one she began to adore forbade her to show how soft she had grown to him not even ethel and chloe together could make anything out of it which shows every one of course that they were two simple idiots or that penelope had a very remarkable character it seems to me that the latter must have been the case for chloe was no fool in spite of the folly she had shown on one particular occasion am i a fool she asked ethel mytton or is penelope the deepest darkest mystery of modern times i am convinced she has made her choice oh which do you think asked ethel with much anxiety do youdo you think it is captain goby i dont know replied chloe it may be i give it up i shall ask bob ive asked him said ethel and he wont say anything i think he knows more than we do hes a sweet boy but just as cunning as a ferret but of course bob knew no more than they did though he would never own to it he threw out casual hints that he was wiser than his elders and the only one he was in the least frank with was lord bradstock who asked him to lunch and was infinitely amused with him i say lord bradstock if youll keep it dark ill tell you something bradstock promised to keep it as dark as a dry plate all these women think i know who penelopes sweet on and i dont and whats more i wouldnt tell if i did would you certainly not said bradstock you cant think how im chased said bob ethel mytton is the worst shes dead nuts on poor goby and goby doesnt see her when pens in the room and mrs cadwallader shes always mugging up to me with chocolates or something to get things out of me and the newspaper johnnies are on me too and williams takes me out and carew i dont care for carew and i like goby best mr de vere is a rotter dont you think the marquis was at pens and he said that if pen didnt marry him hed go up in a balloon and never come back i want him to take me in a balloon dont you think i might go grannys cross when i speak of it ive always wanted to go in a balloon and i think it hard lines i cant go because she doesnt like em pen wont go either she thinks that if she did rivaulx would never let her come down again or something i daresay he wouldnt hes quite mad i think sometimes baker says all frenchmen are mad do you think so bradstock didnt know he wasnt sure of it though he owned to thinking it was possible after all bob he said when bob went at last and after all i dare say penelope wont marry any of them and of course that is what a good many people said they said it was lady penelopes fun the marchioness of rigsby who settled every ones affairs said so to titania why wasnt she beaten my dear when she was young asked the marchioness i was severely beaten it did me good it gave me sense i always used to beat my girls with the flat of my hand and now they are most sensible and married excellently although i own they are not beauties i can afford to own it now i shall speak to penelope myself she did it and was routed pen was direct she beat no one and certainly did not beat about the bush she had no fear of the world and dreaded no marchioness ill attend to my own affairs thank you said pen my dear love said the marchioness you ought to have been beaten while you were still young this conduct of yours is a scandal it is merely a means of attracting public notice and i am old enough to speak about it i will speak about it pen left her speaking and went out she is distinctly rude said the marchioness viciously i wish she was about ten and i was her mother but pen could not endure being spoken to i love him said pen and what business is it of theirs if they disapprove i shall hate them if they approve i shall hate them worse oh i almost wish i was going to marry some one who would make them die mark me said the marchioness to titania this will end in her marrying a groom has she a goodlooking one titania started oh a very goodlooking one she cried what did i say remember what i said said the marchioness darkly no really good girl could act as she does she will marry a groom she went around saying so in revenge for penelopes want of politeness the journalists took timothy buntings photograph and miss weekes was proud till she heard the dreadful rumour timothy beat a man on a paper and bob was delighted titania took to her bed and said the end of the world was at hand bradstock laughed till he cried and cut the marchioness in the park her husband was very much pleased at this and said it served her right chloe cadwallader wrote her first letter since the scandal to cadwallader in the rockies for she felt he would be the only man in the world who hadnt heard of it ethel lay wait for captain goby and asked him to kill some one there was not a soul in london who did not hear of it and then timothy quarrelled with harriet weekes he went to penelope and with a crimson face and bated breath and much humbleness asked to be sent down to the country you shall go said penelope with great decision i can trust you i know my lady you can trust me with untold gold and diamonds replied timothy bunting almost with tears i shall send you to a house of mine you have never heard of said penelope and i expect you bunting not to write to any one from there i do not wish any one to know i live there ill not tell the harchbishop of canterbury imself my lady not if he begged me on his knees with lighted candles in his and said bunting and above all my lady ill not tell it to miss weekes her and me ave quarrelled and ave parted for hever and i wouldnt trust her my lady not farther than you can sling a bull by the tail my lady ive trusted her to my rueing so i have and if she finds out hanything shell sell it to the times which ave promised her a public ouse at a corner this revelation of the methods of printing house square shocked penelope dreadfully oh i always thought the times was a respectable journal she said but timothy bunting shook his head their sportin tips aint a patch on many of the penny papers my lady but dont you forget what i says of miss weekes shes a serpent in your boodore acoiling everywhere and speaking to newspaper men outside the harea like an ousemaid not but that i knows an ousemaid far above such dirty work my lady a little encouragement might have led him to say more about the housemaid who would not condescend to talk with journalists but penelope gave him an address verbally you will go to this place tomorrow she said there are no horses now but there will be next week i trust you to do what i tell you missmy lady i mean said timothy proudly i wouldnt reveal where i was if the hemperor of germany crawled to me for that purpose all along of the ground making speeches as he went penelope smiled at her faithful henchman kindly and she wondered how it happened that he thought of placing the emperor in such an absurd position a position too which was very unlikely now are you sure you remember bunting she asked miss mackarness moat ouse near spilsby lincolnshire repeated timothy and you will speak personally to miss mackarness who will give you every instruction said his young mistress i hope you dont drink bunting never said bunting promptly at least i wont from now on till you give the word my lady but my lady as im goin from here i dont mind revealin to you that mr gubbles does mr gubbles as been very unkind to me and that will do said penelope goodbye bunting i expect to see you in about a month it may be less i opes my lady it will be much less said the groom and as he went away he nodded his closecropped head this is a damned rum start he murmured wots up i wonder this ere miss mackarness was ousekeeper at upwell castle and im a dutchman if any one of us as ever eard of moat ouse shes goin to do it as she said goin to be married and keep it dark women is wonderful strange and so to speak dreadful i thot i knew arriet weekes through and through and she turned out to be a serpent with false teeth ready to sell lady penelope to the times and my lady as turned me round er finger im kneedeep in secret hoaths and without knowin what i was doin ive swore off drink well i always did like gingerbeer but he sighed all the same and that afternoon he packed up and disappeared and no one knew what had become of him neither he nor any one of those who hunted for news had any notion of the fame which would presently be his nor did penelope see quite what she had done when this nicelooking young man suddenly vanished by her orders but penelope was in love chapter x love is a pathological state which can only be cured by one means it is a disease and robs the most humourous of their humour when rabelais was in love he no doubt wrote poems which he afterward destroyed when dante was in love he did the paradiso when he cheered up he wrote the inferno neither of these is any joke but then dante had no more humour than penelope it can be imagined or it cannot be imagined how unhumourous pen became when she found she had made her choice between plant and de vere and goby and carew and williams and bramber and gordon and rivaulx she wept at night over those she could not marry and it added grief to grief to think that the unmarried would probably relapse into their evil ways what can one poor girl do with so many she asked im sure they will turn around on me and once more follow their dreadful instincts and they have improved so much the result of her sorrow was such pity that every poor wretch of them all was convinced she loved him better and better they were quite cheerful they looked at each other almost sympathetically they grieved for each other and struggled on the hard cinderpath of duty with penelope at least a long lap ahead the amount of good they did was wonderful plant got his university started rivaulx went over to paris and asked dreyfus to dinner goby was deep in imperial yeomanry and rifle ranges bramber spoke on every opportunity in the house and voted with the insistence of a whip de vere wrote a monograph on outdoor sports with an appendix on bulldogs he also owned that poetry was not everything and went so far as to say that the poet laureate was a very good fellow gordon floated a company without any water in the capital and ran the whole affair with absolute honesty and no waiver clause carew learned to draw and spoke sober truth about the chantry bequest williams never swore in public and painted in watercolours and none of them played bridge or went into good society and when they know said poor penelope i wonder if i ought not to sacrifice him and myself on the altar of duty said pen but she was in love and the motorcar in which she was to disappear stood ready she made weekly trips in it with bob sometimes they stayed away for three days sometimes even for a week oh bob im so unhappy so happy said pen and bob looked at her critically well you look stunning anyhow he replied you get better looking every day pen old de vere said so he let on that you were a cross between a lily and a rose or some such rot you mark me pen hell go back to poetry if you marry him and give up dogs i dont want him to do that baker has some pups coming on a new kind of very savage dog and im halves in em cant you give me a tip as to whether its de vere if it is ill sell him one now cheap but pen looked beautiful and kept her mouth shut neither bob nor titania nor bradstock could extract a word from her and nevertheless the whole world grew suspicious the society papers said she had made her choice the sporting papers gave tips they said for the lady penelope stakes we give plant or bramber or at least one of them did others selected de vere and one rude man said a rank outsider would get it of course he didnt believe in pens word but then no one did and still pen kept her teeth shut and was as obstinate as a government mule to all persuasion ethel cried and said oh is it captain goby chloe laughed and laid traps for penelope saying oh by the way i saw lord bramber just now or it might be de vere or carew or williams but no one got a rise out of penelope i am entirely determined to give a lead to those who wish to be married without publicity i shall found a society presently said penelope when titania whom nothing could discourage went at her furiously bradstock smiled if she has a daughter some day we shall see the girl married in westminster abbey said bradstock but even he was very curious have you found out anything yet bob he asked that young financier im on the way said bob give me time lord bradstock i feel sure its not de vere hes buying all the dogs i offer him if he was sure he wouldnt but bradstock wasnt certain penelope might have no humour but she was quite equal to ordering de vere to buy in order to blind bob i never thought of that said bob i frankly own pens a deal worse than euclid and i never thought to say that of anything and upon a certain day in june when june was doing its best to live up to the poets ideal pen disappeared by herself leaving bob at home with guthrie who now came over each day to keep the young vagabond doing something she came back after lunch and bob found her abnormally silent she had nothing to say and there was a curious faroff look in her eyes her interest in dogs was nil she showed no appreciation of ferrets when he spoke she said oh and ah and whats that you say and bob had no suspicion whatsoever just as clever people never have when they might be expected to show their wisdom when she did speak though it was to the point i think bob it is time you went back to your grandmothers she declared suddenly and back he went in spite of all his cajoleries pen was very strange he thought and rather beastly there certainly was a change in her for she dismissed harriet weekes with a douceur which did not really sweeten that ladys departure and in the afternoon pen casually remarked to chloe that she was going out of town for three days when she said so the motorcar was at the door and geordie smith was there too if timothy bunting had known that smith was as deep in his ladys confidence as he was himself he would have been jealous but he must have been for pen said to him when they were out of piccadilly how long will it take to get to spilsby smith my lady with this new racingcar ill get there when you like replied smith firmly pen remembered that bob said smiths ambition was to ride through the city regardless of fines i wouldnt try to do it under three hours she said unless we are followed said smith if we are followed my lady may i let her go yes said penelope geordie smith nodded to himself fines be damned and legal limits ditto said smith to himself wait my darling till we get through the traffic he meant darling for his new car he adored it as much as he did his mistress he used to dream of it at night and had nightmares about it dream ruffians cut up his tires he was in the middle of salisbury plain without petrol she refused to spark he was held up by gigantic policemen with stop watches the size of a church clock but now she moved under him smooth and cosy with a vast reserve of power she was quick swift docile intelligent fearless of policemen careless of the limping law if my lady wants to go quick im the man said geordie but i wonder whats up geordie played the car as joachim plays the violin or paderewski the piano she skated she swam she shot like a waterbeetle she was responsive to his lightest touch he heard her music as every engineer does and found it as lovely as a dream song oh for a clear road said the player he found some of it clear before they reached barnet and then he fingered the keyboard as it were like a master horses horses said smith the poor miserable things aint i sorry for tim bunting here we go my lady he broke the law magnificently and with such skill that penelope wondered but only once he ran against the law in the shape of a policeman north of hatfield who saw him coming and signalled to him to stop shall i said smith no shrieked pen against the tide of wind they passed him flying and saw him run as they passed hell wire to hitchin and have us there said smith but he knew his roads oh will he he took the right fork of the roads at welwyn and roared through stevenage to baldock and found the main road again at sandy they reached huntington sixty miles from town in an hour and three quarters and ive never let her out but once said smith shes a daisy the eighteen miles to spilsborough they did at a speed that made penelope bend her head she felt wonderful she was on a shootingstar they slackened on the outskirts of the cathedral city and rolled through it delicately she looked about her and remembered the dear bishop who had christened her when he was no more than a vicar well go by crowland and spalding smith a car followed them out of spilsborough and smith going easy looked back and saw it catch us my son he said contemptuously but when they were well clear of town and he turned her loose so to speak pens nerve went or it appeared to go dont go so fast smith she commanded and smith obeyed sorrowfully they cant stand it he said none of em can stand it really they let on they can but its no go a few hot miles gives them the mulligrubs but nevertheless they were running over thirty miles an hour the car behind crawled up to them all ive got to do my lady is to ask her to shake em off and away we go and leave em he suggested oh no no said pen at spalding the pursuer if he were one was not a hundred yards behind but in the town smith got ahead he did not see penelope trembling smith had taken a look at the one behind theres power there he said savagely if he lets her out and my lady squeals im passed she did squeal the other side of spalding but not for herself the other car had to stop thats done em said smith theyre in the ditch he gained ten miles on them and penelope wept and just as they were coming into boston at an easy gait smith turned and saw the other car coming up behind like a meteor with the dust astern of her in a fume that chap can drive after all said smith wont you try to let me get away from him before we get to spilsby my lady ii dont want to said pen and five miles outside of spilsby the pursuing car drew up with them two indistinguishable monsters drove it and through his glaring goggles smith glared at them as they came alongside stop said penelope suddenly stop smith and the other car stopped too ill go on with the other car said penelope she took her place by the most unrecognizable portent of the two and disappeared in a sudden and terrific cloud of dust damned if i know who it is even now said smith chapter xi it was friday when penelope disappeared from london in a motorcar and was carried off by a motor pirate unknown to any one because he wore a peak cap a fur coat with the fur outside and gigantic goggles making him resemble a diver or a cuttlefish it was monday when she returned to town in a motorcar with geordie smith and all the way into town geordie said blessed if id ha thought it i always reckoned it would have been one of the others i lose money on this but if i do it warms the cockles of my heart to see my lady happy bless her sweet face i wish shed leave the blooming world alone and have a good time i never set eyes on such an aggravatin beautiful sweet lady for interferin with men just as if the queen herself could alter our ways women always gas that they can or mean to and theyre just like hens with men for ducks if he had been a classical scholar he might have remembered ariadne up to her knees in the sea with her lover on the deep in a boat when i saw who it was at moat house said geordie you could have knocked me endwise with something less than a steel spanner and that horsewhipping ass of a bunting was equal took aback for somehow we never spotted him as likely to make the nonstop run humph humph and he left penelope at her house just in time for afternoon tea as she lay on the sofa she handed a paper to chloe cadwallader saying i wish you would send out cards to all these people for thursday night thats very short notice darling said chloe theyll come said pen and when chloe looked at the list she found it included only pens particular friends her most bitter relations and the whole of the horde i wonder said chloe and she wondered somewhat later with ethel is it said ethel can it be cried chloe it cant be said ethel who knows asked chloe she is so plain and so simple and straightforward that there is no certainty about anything she does i understand the wicked and the weak but penelope she threw up her hands and presently wrote out the cards and penelope was trying to a degree as chloe said all monday and tuesday and wednesday and on thursday she sent for bob who came helterskelter in a hansom youll stand by me bob said pen clutching him bob put his hands in his pockets and stood straddlelegs he stared at her what was hidden from the wisdom of chloe was revealed to the simplicity of this boy pen said bob solemnly ill stick by you till death but aint you going to tell me who it is who what is asked pen feebly him said bob pen youve been and gone and done it pen the strong and mighty pen wept a little dont snivel said bob it cant be helped now i suppose unless you get a divorce do you want one oh no said pen not at all bob considered the matter for a few minutes i say what makes you cry he asked ii dont know said penelope girls are very rum baker says they are hes not married you know he says mules are easy to them he drove mules once in india he says you know you are doing all this off your own bat pen aint you why dont you chuck it chuck what dear oh this notion of not letting on baker says its the rummest start he ever knew and he says hes seen some rum things in his life especially when he was a sergeant in the dublin fusiliers cant you chuck it oh no certainly not said pen firmly its only bob that im not used to it yet you see of course not said bob being married is strange at first i suppose baker says he knew a woman who was married four times and by the fourth time she wasnt nervous to speak of but is it true pen that you wont tell any one who it is i wont said pen bravo cried bob stick to it oh it will make granny so savage has bill spoken about it to you he laughs said pen he always does laugh he tells rattling good stories said bob he told me a splendid one about a man who stole a parrot the other day ill tell it you sometime when i remember it is anything going to happen tonight pen pen shivered oh dear i dont know mind you come too bob bob vowed he wouldnt miss coming for worlds i believe youre thinking of telling em youve done it he said and pen said she was thinking of telling them you wont tell me who it is im as close as wax urged bob i cant dear said pen oh by jove i remember bills parrot story pen a man stole a parrot and when he was caught he said he took it for a lark and the man who owned it said hed make a bally fine judge at a birdshow oh said pen rather blankly but if he only took it for a lark i suppose they let him off did they let him off what whygoing to prison of course said pen i dont know replied bob staring dont you see its a joke yes i see of course said pen why the man said it was a lark and it was a parrot i think its a very good story bob and bob went away wondering whether it was or not ill tell it to baker he said thoughtfully he turned up at nine oclock that night with titania who was in a state of mind requiring instant attention from a physician good heavens what is it i wonder said titania robert i wonder what it is but what do you know i am in a tremble i am sure she will do or say something even more scandalous than she has done yet i put it all on bradstock to make him her guardian was a fatal error my nervesbut i have none i quiver like a jelly i shake i must be pale as a ghost why should we take so much trouble over anything i must think of myself i will go to bed and stay there for a week and send for dr lumsden griff but bradstock was as calm as a philosopher without anything in the objective world to worry him what does it matter he inquired does anything matter brading whom no one had seen for many months as he had spent the whole winter in a yacht down the mediterranean was perfectly goodhumoured you see shes a dear but only my halfsister after all he said to bradstock and women are so wonderful i can tell you a story by and by of a greek lady and one about a spaniard and to tell the truth i almost agree with pen im a bit of a socialist or an anarchist if you like have you read nietzsche who wrote it asked bradstock but the horde came in one by one and penelope who was dressed in the most unremarkable costume at her disposal and looked like a lily received them at the door a most awful and improper situation said titania i say ill tell you about that greek girl said brading do you think pen could stick a knife in a fellow bradstock didnt think so and listened to the story of the lady who suggested the notion right through my coat and waistcoat said brading only a very stiff piece of starch saved my life good heavens cried bradstock the room was full and bob buzzed around it like a bluebottle in an orchard oh i say he cried to every one he told the story of the parrot after he had asked brading whether he had it right he tried it on de vere and failed goby roared handsomely bramber was absentminded with his eye on penelope gordon said yes yes a ripping good story the marquis de rivaulx balked at it but was led to understand it and when can i go up in a balloon asked bob he waited for no answer but told it to williams suggesting that the war correspondent might pay for it by a story with blood and torture in it please and all of a sudden it was noticed that the hostess had slipped out of the room wherewhere is penelope asked trembling titania mrs cadwallader where is lady penelope bob ran her to earth in her bedroom and after many appeals he was let in oh dear oh dear said penelope bob let me take hold of you do i tremble rather said bob ill bet you couldnt drink a glass of wine without spilling it whats wrong buck up aint you comin in to tell em ive broken it a bit for you pen screamed you wretched boy what have you done bless you nothing to speak of said bob i only said you would make em sit up presently they think i know something and want to bribe me i say pen if you say nothing for a few days i believe old gordon will make me a director can you i want to make money and restore the family property i say do but pen paid no attention to him she groaned instead wheres the pain asked bob anxiously shall i get you some brandy no no bob i must go in and tell them come on then said bob eagerly i dont care about the directorship theyre all white and shaking i guess they are in a stew but still pen did not move and when chloe came she sent her away saying in a moment in a moment then bob had a brilliant idea i say pen ill do it do what ill go in and tell em youve done it it would be a lark but pen shook her head no i must i will be brave if a woman has ideas she must live up to them i have done good so far are they not very much improved bob some i think said bob carelessly but i dare say theyll go regular muckers now come on pen i do want to see their jaws drop and pen went with him she stayed outside the door and bob went in first shes coming said bob and pen entered with her eyes on the floor bob took her hand buck up and spit it out he said in an encouraging whisper which was audible in the farthest corner of the room some of the horde turned pale titania fell back in her chair bradstock leant against the wall brading put up his eyeglass and then told bradstock pen reminded him of a girl who had once tried to smother him with a pillow she had penelopes straightforwardness and never gave in just like pen said brading thoughtfully and now penelope took hold of her courage so to speak and opened her mouth ssh said bob who looked on himself as the master of the ceremonies ssh i say and he took hold of pens hand im so glad to see you here tonight said the reformer for i am so much interested in you all you see and youve all been so brave hear hear said bob so brave in different ways about balloons and motorcars and curing yourselves of your weak points went on penelope thats what i hoped my influence would do i said i was only a girl but even a girl ought to do something and i knew you all liked me very much for you all said so and i said what can i do for you and i did my best and you did yours im sure for ive heard from every one of you all about the others this made many of them look rather queer as no doubt it might and months ago i saidi said go ahead pen whispered bob you mean you said youd marry one of em i said idmarry one of you titania groaned in the corner of a vast settee bradstock and brading whistled or it seemed so but the other poor wretches stared at penelope and saw no one heard no one but her and i wanted you to come tonight so that i could ask you all to go on in the path of rectitude and simplicity and courage balloons and hard work and healthiness and thought for others even if i was married said pen with a gasp will you oh will you we will said the crowd goby leading with a deep bass voice and tears in his eyes oh im so glad said penelope for i shall not have lived in vain even if i died tonight and nowand nowi have to tell you something great heavens said titania in an awestricken and penetrating whisper what is she going to say now i have kept my word said penelope with her eyes on the floor i have kept my word whatwhat word asked the collapsed duchess and pen tried to say what word she had kept speak up said bob speak up pen and she did speak up forfor gasped penelope for you see i have married one of you titania uttered a scream and promptly fainted the men looked at each other furiously and suspiciously while pen was on her knees beside the poor duchess at that moment a message was brought in for gordon and an urgent note from the whip for bramber brading stood in a corner and whistled bradstock shrugged his shoulders and bob buzzed all over the room like a wasp in a bottle by dint of water and smellingsalts and the slapping of hands titania was brought to and when she had recovered consciousness to the extent of knowing what it was that had bowled her over she uttered words on the spur of the moment which were almost as much of a bombshell as those penelope had spoken i dont believe shes married at all said titania chapter xii to talk about the grounds of certainty is to talk metaphysically and metaphysics being the highest form of nonsense becomes sense in that altitude as it must be if hegel is to be believed but in the conduct of life the grounds of certainty are an estate beyond the rainbow if penelope believed any one thing with more fervour than another it was that her truthfulness must be selfevident the course of events after the evening on which titania fainted and recovered so sharply showed her that nothing was certain not even selfevident truths for though she said she was married few if any believed her titania who believed in her intuitions as all rightminded women must because reason is only an attribute of man declared that penelope had lied to put it plainly she invented an hypothesis to account for it she found out she didnt want to marry any of them and her courage to say so failed her this notion of hers gives her time and of course my dear as you see from what i say shes not married in the least bradstock who was a philosopher disagreed with her and agreed with bob not married in the least eh said bradstock what is the least degree of marriage which would meet with your moral approval titania dont talk nonsense augustin replied titania tartly i cannot help it said augustin the situation is so absurd and so it was for every one but the duchess and penelope who did not understand a joke even with illustrations and they undoubtedly had the illustrations there were leading articles in several papers on the subject of marriage with discreet allusions to penelopes case there was a long and rabid correspondence in the daily turncoat a new halfpenny paper to which every lady with a past or a future contributed the editor of the dictator wrote a moral essay with his own hand obvious to every student of his immemorial style which proved that another such case would knock the bottom out of the british empire and bring on protection he showed that marriage open and unadulterated in a chapel at the least was the minimum on which morality could exist and he pointed out with sad firmness that the ethical standards of the true briton were the only decent ones at present unfurled in the universe and that they were in great danger of being rolled up and put away as every one knows all he said was undoubtedly fact the true briton is the only moral person in the world as a result penelope felt that she wasnt a true briton and it made her very mournful as it should have done nothing but her native obstinacy which was imperial if not british made her stick to her ideas when her halfbrother came to her and asked her crudely to chuck it for though he was humourous it was past a joke now and his admiration of pen was tinged with alarm i say old girl chuck it said bill i cant i wont said penelope nobody believes you penelope couldnt help that ive spoken the truth why even the other men dont believe it said her brother why i met three of em today and they all said oh yes we understand i say pen this is too much chuck it once for all dear i wont said penelope much as i dislike this publicity i see it is doing good i get letters every day from scores of people saying that i am doing good three today declared that they were following my example in a registrars office and three more are thinking of it one lady writes saying she hopes i would go in for abolishing marriage altogether when public opinion was prepared for the extinction of the race i dont agree with her but she was enthusiastic and enthusiasm is a great thing i shall go yachting for a year said bill i wish you would dear bill replied penelope it will do you good you look quite pale and i dont like you to do that have you any cough damn it no said brading crossly and he went yachting again without publicity but with a lady he was no true briton and never read the dictator his departure took one thing off pens hands but none of her lovers departed titanias words had sunk deep in their minds shes not married they said and if she says she is it is only to try us they all interviewed bob and made things very pleasant for that rising statesman if he believed pen was married there was no reason to say so openly am i old enough to be a director do you think he asked gordon what i want is to make pots of money and rebuild goring which is a bally ruin you dont answer my questions said gordon oh about pen said bob shes queer i dont know mr gordon i cant tell she may be for all i know shes so clever i dont know that she hasnt married you and put you up to coming and asking me questions gordon couldnt help grinning i think youll be a director of something some day said he i cant make you one now but if you have a hundred pounds ill invest it in something for you my son that will make your hair curl like yours asked bob curiously and gordon flinched well went on bob without waiting for an answer i havent a hundred pounds but ive an idea how to get it yes said the financier whats your idea bob its a safe and a certain investment is it why of course replied gordon then ill tell you what you lend it me said bob brightly and invest it for me damned if i dont cried gordon bob when you are twentyone ill make you a director and ask your advice and youll come and tell me if you find out anything about lady penelope bob looked at him and shook his head i say youre so clever i dont know how to take you i dare say its you the flattered financier smiled oh by the way said bob rather in a hurry i suppose i should get nearly as much if i invested ninety pounds as if i put in a hundred nearly said gordon who hoped to be let off a little only ten per cent less thatll do me said bob then you can give me the tenner now mr gordon and put in the rest for me i wish i had a boy like that said gordon he went away ten pounds poorer but with a great admiration for bob who was determined to restore the faded splendour of goring hanged if i know who it is said bob it may be gordon after all and every one but de vere and bramber have been at me is it one of these he had a remarkable list of all those who had pretended to penelopes hand for he was very curious like all the rest of the world he was also a little sore with pen for not confiding in him i told her id find out he said and i will this was his list and a curious document it was written in a big round hand that old guth could never get him to modify his spelling was almost ducal in its splendour plant it isnt mr plant because he said would i like to go out in a motor a new one ninetyhorse power and i said rather if hed let her rip and he looked anshious i thought he tiped me goby it isnt goby goby says hell always be my friend he said had i another pony not sound to experiment with he stamped up and down some he tiped me williams it isnt williams he took me to lunch and told me lots of things about the chinese that his paper wouldnt print they were orful he said if id keep in with him he knew worse he didnt tip me this time because the lunch was so much i had turtell three times rivaulx it isnt the frenchy because he tore his hair and said i could go up in a baloon any day at least he didnt tear his hair its too short he keeps it up with gordon too but looks horrid he tiped me carew it isnt him hes very anxshus and says he cant paint says the crittics are right he was a sad sight to see walking around in his studio he said would i sit to him for an angel he stops walking and tries to do pen quick i think its muck i wouldnt like a tip from him for if an artist cant paint through grief what becomes of him do the others buy him for the chantrey bequest thats the lot so far said bob and he added to his notes gordon it isnt gordon he lent me a hundred pounds to invest in something to make hair curl i said make it ninety and give me ten now and he did he didnt tip me but i dont think him mean on that account that leaves only de vere and bramber said bob and she never seemed much stuck on either to my mind but if they dont say anything to me i shall begin to suspect he said so to bradstock who called him a young devil but about three days later bob added to his notes bramber it isnt bramber i met him in the park he took me to the house and gave me a beastly lunch but he didnt notice it as he couldnt eat and looked very pale and savidge he tiped me de vere its not the poetry rotter he wants me to stay with him and look after the dogs he said if i had a sick one hed rather have it than not he said he was desprit i dont know why but suppose its pen he tiped me now where am i at he said blankly ive written down it isnt any of em and thats what granny says but i dont believe her he chewed his pencil till it was in rags and then a sudden idea struck him ill buy all sherlock holmes and read him right through said bob thats the way to find out anything i wish i knew the man that wrote him i wonder if de vere knows him ill ask baker to get a sick dog from the vets and ill go down and stay with de vere if i can make granny say yes i wonder why old de vere wants a sick dog though i cant understand poets it was no wonder gordon wished he had a boy like bob chapter xiii it was all very well for bob to declare that his grandmother was altogether off it when she said that penelope wasnt married at all for little by little after furious discussions in ten thousand houses in the court the camp and the grove that came to be the general opinion titania expressed the general opinion she is mad of course what can one expect when her mother was an american all americans are mad bradstock assures me there is a something in the air of the united states oh even in canada which makes one take entirely new views of everything and that of course is madness my dear madness undoubted and dangerous he assured me poor fellow that six months in that absurd country made him tremble for his belief in a constitutional monarchy he adds that he has only partially recovered by firmly fixing his eyes on what a limited monarch might be if he tried yes she was an american and adored our aristocracy not knowing what we are poor thing and yet where penelopes ideas come from i do not know i firmly believe bradstock is the cause of them when she was a little girl he would take her on his knee and pour anarchism into her innocent ears you know his way he runs counter to everything though now comparatively silent and penelope was always ready to go against me though she loves me this was an early idea of hers augustin owns that he suggested it humourously to her years ago there is nothing so dangerous as humour it is always liable to be taken seriously mr browning the poet said so to me at a gardenparty he said he was a humourist and he said mr tennyson oh yes lord tennyson lacked humour while he himself had too much of it he explained sordello to me and made me laugh heartily but as i was saying penelope took up the idea and gave it out and now is sorry and not having the courage to say so she has taken refuge in what i am reluctantly compelled to characterize as a lie and it is a great relief to me the scandal will blow over already the halfpenny papers are tired of her i expect she will marry by and by oh no of course she isnt married and as penelopes ideas were in every way absolutely contrary to what one has a right to expect it is only natural that proof of the contrary being lacking the whole world began gradually to come around to titanias opinion a duchess has a great deal of influence if she only likes to use it and the public is no more proof against her than the public offices are and pen set her teeth together and ignored every one and had very little to say to society her apparent passion was for motorcars and she went out in the sixtyhorse panhard almost every day and every end of the week she disappeared coming back on monday or tuesday i could tell em something said geordie smith couldnt i old girl the old girl he referred to was the machine he loved next best at least to lady penelope me and bunting could wake em up some he said id like bunting if hed only get rid of the notion that horses are everything i hope to see the time when there wont be any except in parks running wild like deer it was an awful notion and it was a wonder that he and bunting got on without fighting my lady uses your bloomin tracking engine said tim contemptuously but she loves orses you cant give carrots to your old thing and it aint got no smooth and silky muzzle to pat faugh the smell of it makes me sick give me the ealthy hodour of the stable smith find me a horse thatd carry her and me a hundred and twenty miles in three hours and damn the expense in fines replied smith and im with you my lady loves this car amost as much as i do who can catch her and me flying along let em come let em try and ill put her out to the top notch and let her sizzle you come out and try tim one drive and youll be another man looking on horses as what they are mere animals and not up to date my ladys up to date and beyond it when i go in your bally machine hitll be by my ladys horders said timothy and itll be tryin my hallegiance very ard come and ave a drink if you haint too advanced for that ave you been chased lately as you brought my lady ome i thought i was replied smith but i shook em off im egging her on to get a ninetyhorse in case that young cousin of hers let on to me that shell be followed up some day and i told her shell do it i wonder whats her game said tim blowed if i hunderstand so fars i see replied smith its a general notion that a partys private biz is their private biz and the others says it isnt and theres where the trouble begins i agree with her in a measure dont you i agrees with my lady hevery time said tim shes a sweet lady and my word if i didnt id get the sack which i dont want what she says she sticks to bein in that different to hany woman i never met thats what the trouble is that and reformin lovers and husbands and law and so hon but the real trouble was that what she said she stuck to she began to care much less for reform and now never read herbert spencer and the greater philosopher who has discovered that man doesnt think so much of yesterday as he does of tomorrow she forgot the deceased wifes sister and ignored the london county council and didnt read the times except on great occasions she spent the days in dreaming and except when she was devouring the space between london and lincolnshire she lay about on sofas and read poetry or listened to bob and looked ten thousand times more beautiful than ever like the eastern beauties of whom one reads in the arabian nights returning from the bath she was wonderfully affectionate to bob who was a most considerate boy and didnt worry her when he had once discovered that asking questions was no use he told her of his vain efforts to find out whom she had married and was very amusing he began to have great ambitions mr gordon says ive a great future before me pen he thinks no end of me he says being a duke by and by is all very well but i agree with him there are greater things than merely being one he says the men with power are the rulers of the world he told me how he and rothschild stopped a war in a hurry he didnt say which war i asked him why he didnt stop the south african war and he said that was different i asked him did he bring it on then and he said no but i think he did somehow will you ask old sir henry if he did i dont like sir henry though do you he went on to tell her about sherlock holmes im reading him through again pen and when i go down to de veres i shall ask de vere to invite the man that wrote him im going to de veres to take him a sick dog he said he wanted one and ive got one from baker baker says he must want to vivisect him and he doesnt like the idea bakers a very kind man to animals but ive given my word that the dog shant be vivisected you dont think a poet would do you did you tell him to learn to be a vet or anything if you did that would explain it ive been through the whole list pen and though i wont worry you ive come to the conclusion so far that i dont know which youve married if i find out i wont tell youre a dear said pen languidly ive got a notion how to find out though said bob at least i shall have when ive finished sherlock holmes id rather be sherlock holmes than a duke it seems to me that unless you are the duke of norfolk or the duke of devonshire you are out of it being a common duke is dull but being holmes must be very exciting one thing that he told her made her think furiously not one of em really believes you pen and theyre much more jealous of each other than they were i believe theyll be fighting presently dont talk nonsense said pen anxiously bob shrugged his shoulders a trick he had caught from the marquis its not nonsense i can see bloodshed in their eyes the marquis looks awfully ferocious and williams too of course i dont say that gordon would fight much and i should snigger to see old de vere in a duel shouldnt you but if bramber and the marquis and williams and goby get together i shouldnt be surprised if they fought with swords or guns i think rivaulx would like that he would stick them all and make em squeal i can tell you hes a whale at fencing he took me to see him once and when he stamped and said haha like a warhorse i wondered the other man didnt run if they had a duel any of them i shouldnt speak to them again said penelope i abhor duels and warfare and weapons and think they should be abolished in universal peace and as i am married now bob i hope you will do what you can to make them believe it you can make em believe it at once said bob i do think this is absurd and dont you see its funny too pen no said pen its not its right and what is right cant be funny bob reflected well theres something in that it aint much fun generally and he returned to sherlock holmes i wonder what he would do said bob to himself pensively there aint any footsteps or blood in this i suppose hed take a look at pen and then have a smoke and go out in a hansom and come back very tired ive looked at pen a lot but smoking still makes me sick and i dont know where to go in a hansom and i think holmes would think it mean to follow her when she goes off with smith in her car besides a hansom cant catch a sixtyhorse panhard unless it breaks down i think he would get at it by looking at the men that put him on the track of a dreadful scheme a most wicked and immoral scheme that his hero would have disapproved of i believe i have it said bob starting up in wild excitement if i go around to them all and say that im sure shes not married but that she loves the one they hate most they will jump and be in a rage wont they i should be i know and the one that doesnt jump will be him i dare say de vere wont jump but hes not a jumping sort but hell cry likely rivaulx will snort if it isnt him he sat and pondered over this lovely scheme but if she loves one of em why dont she own it to him and why this mystery theyll ask that of course oh but that doesnt matter theyll do the snorting first and besides i could let on that not all of them are in earnest aint it possible that the one she loves wont ask her now and shes covering up her disappointment that would make rivaulx fairly howl i know hes a real good chap and between howling and weeping he says he wants her to be happy ill do it he went off to do it at once ha ha my beautiful boy said the marquis of rivaulx whom he found in his rooms in piccadilly have you come with news for me the devoted and despairing well i dont know marquis returned bob soberly ive been thinking about it and im in a state of puzzle and i am in a state of the devil himself replied rivaulx i suspect every one i am enraged i suspect you bob my boy bob shook his head i suspect you too ive never got over thinking that it may be you he said for you are all just like each other and its obvious some one is telling me lies rivaulx smiled a deep and dark french smile which was agonizing to behold it puzzled bob dreadfully there he said you smile and so does pen and you all smile but i believe ive discovered something about who or which asked rivaulx is it about that goby he might loathe gordon but he was jealous of goby he promenaded the room and was already in a rage yes said bob boldly i believe shes not married and i believe she likes him best the hound the vile one the unmeasured beast roared rivaulx it cannot be if she loves him no i cant believe it why does she not wed him i shall slay him is she unhappy does she weep i adore her but if she loves him he shall marry her or i will stab him to the heart i dare say hes not in earnest said bob and the marquis ground his teeth and foamed at the mouth and again tried to tear his closecropped hair without the least success notoh sacred dog of a manhalet me kill him he tore around the room and knocked two ornaments off the mantelpiece and upset a table which bob laboriously restored to its place after he had put it back three times he gave it up and cowered under the storm i shouldnt be surprised if this was put on said bob rather gloomily i know he can act like blazes pen says he can she said he was finer than irving or toole in a tragedy i dont think it has the true ring of sincerity and making his escape from the cyclone he went off to see goby who was hideously jealous of carteret williams i hope he wont be as mad as the marquis said bob that table barked my shins horribly the last time it fell i wish frenchmen wouldnt shout so when theyre angry im nearly deaf there was the devil to pay with goby he announced his intention of assaulting williams at once oh i say you mustnt cried bob in great alarm shell never forgive you that williams said goby i always did hate war correspondents i dont believe it but it looked as if he did i dare say you are putting it on cried bob i dont know where i am goby said he didnt either but that if this turned out to be true he would wring williamss neck in the park the first fine sunday in june he would have acted just the same if he was married to her and thought she loved williams best after all said bob to himself ill try bramber and williams and then give it up bramber was in a furious temper and when bob assured him that penelope loved gordon best of any one he swore horribly as he rarely swore this was very impressive and bob almost shivered i say you mustnt kick gordon he urged after all i may be mistaken i wish you were dead said bramber and you will be if you dont get out bob got out and when he was in the open air he sighed i dont think ill try williams he said thoughtfully hes much bigger and stronger even than goby and they say hes a terror when hes very angry my scheme doesnt seem to work theres something wrong with it but there was nothing wrong with it and it worked marvellously the report that bob said positively that pen wasnt married carried much weight goby and rivaulx both gave it away and all the men now loathed each other openly rivaulx cut goby and goby cut williams and bramber sneered at gordon and there was great likelihood of there being the devil to pay pen tried to patch up peace among them and failed and wept about it seeing so much of the good she had done melt like sugar in warm rain at last she announced her intention of leaving them and the world alone i almost think ill give up reform she sighed and the season went by and the autumn came and titania found herself at goring in october with a large houseparty which didnt include penelope she is of course somewhat ashamed of herself said titania happily this comes of having ideas and foolishly attempting to carry them into practice now that i am certain she is not married and that she only says so i feel quite different i no longer abhor the poor foolish men who are so much in love with her i see plainly for i too am naturally a democrat of the proper kind that they have fine qualities i have marked my sense of this in a way which appears to amuse lord bradstock for some reason that i do not followbut then i never could follow augustin poor fellowby asking them all down here i dare say they think penelope will come for they have all accepted i am delighted for i really admire them mr carew is the handsomest young man in london and will paint my portrait between meals i wonder whether i shall try to get thinner by eating less or will it be better to tell mr carew to make me thinner in his picture that seems the easiest course for if penelopes conduct has not made me thin what would neither hot weather nor despair has the least effect upon me i shall trust to mr carews idea of what is right and proper i wish i could rely with equal confidence upon poor dear misguided penelope there was much discontent in the camp when the lovers learnt that their beloved was not one of titanias houseparty they were not civil to each other and with difficulty were civil to titania confound the old harridan said goby this was wicked for titania was very sweet and retained much more than a trace of her youthful beauty she belonged to the modern band of those who sternly refuse to grow old great scott said carteret williams the others made equally appropriate exclamations they damned goring in heaps and looked at each other like a crowd of strange dogs owing to penelopes influence they all came in motorcars even de vere turned up in one which was guaranteed by age and its maker not to go more than ten miles an hour there wasnt room to get them into the temporary garage out of the wet but the marquis did not come in a balloon or a flyingmachine that was something at any rate though bob growled about it bitterly pens request that he should do his best to make the world believe she was married was entirely forgotten without quite meaning to say so he practically asserted in every word that she was not after all said bob i believe she is capable of deceiving even me for she is a woman horace in his odes seems to think that it seems to me that classical authors had a very poor opinion of women he went to rivaulx crossly i say i think you ought to have come in a flyingmachine why didnt you pen will be mad he introduced de vere to baker who had been a sergeant in the dublin fusiliers and left him with him discussing hydrophobia and bulldogs baker says he has a great admiration for you sir said bob he has lots of pups for you to look at theres a very queer spotted one that pen said she was sure you would like its very cheap for a spotted dog of the kind baker says but they were an unhappy crowd and even the shooting which was fairly good for a poor dukes place hardly consoled them at night the women who all gambled naturally were very cross it appeared that not one of the men would play bridge because penelope had made them swear off there were only three men in the house not in love with penelope titania had a dreadful time and much regretted her hospitality carew was furious of course and his notions of colour were very morbid and he appeared to see the duchess as she was in spite of the hints the poor woman threw out to the desperate painter who looked at her sorrowfully and sighed as he shook his head being painted is an ordeal she said not one of the others consoled her de vere wept with her in the drawingroom williams wrecked her orchids in the hothouse plant and gordon quarrelled in the smokingroom and bramber who was only there for four days looked horridly sorry for himself and sneered at every one the marquis went around the park in a ninetyhorsepower racer seventeen times between breakfast and lunch the chauffeurs quarrelled furiously they even fought in the stable yard with baker as umpire and bob as timekeeper at the dinnertable was the only time of peace and then it was too peaceful nobody but bob and ethel mytton and titania did any talking bob spoke of very little but penelope which was natural but awkward he told them what baker said till they all desired to go out and strangle baker bradstock encouraged him for bradstock was the only man there who had any apparent desire to be amused the rest of them played with the soup toyed with the entrees fooled with the roasts choked over the birds and went out and oversmoked themselves then they met in the big hall and the drawingroom and titania had to assure them all one after the other that she was certain penelope was not married then why does she say she is they asked bitterly it must be to try you said titania augustin dont you think it is to try them bradstock made that sound which the english write as humph and the scotch put down as imphm it means a great deal but is intelligible to the intelligent yes it is to try you said titania she is a dear sweet thing but has ideas which do not commend themselves to me i understand them of course but regret them it may be of course that she does not love any of you and is trying to get out of it by and by you will find out if that is so she is enthusiastic and impulsive oh these impulses of youth how well i remember the delightful impulses of youth when one feels as if one could fly with wings even now i get impulses poor penelope ah dear i wish she would come i have written again and again to ask her but im afraid she will not and indeed no one at that moment knew where she was unless indeed it was timothy and geordie smith and miss mackarness and the pirate in goggles of the motorcar who carried her off titania and bob between them at any rate accomplished one thing no one pretended to assign a satisfactory reason for pens conduct but every one except one perhaps believed she was still single they were sure of it and grew surer every day as a result they recovered some little peace of mind they quarrelled less and ate more and shot straighter rivaulx only went fifteen times around the park before lunch de vere bought more dogs plant agreed to go into some scheme of trust robbery with gordon who assured the rest of them that he had rothschild up his sleeve williams stamped less on flowerbeds and swore half as much as usual goby and bramber went out walks together with bob and ethel mytton titanias barometer went up and her size went down in carews picture he saw her less yellow and did not insist on her wrinkles augustin sat in the library and read books which were of so humourous a character that they compelled him to put them down and laugh continually it was certainly a most amusing houseparty i thought there would have been duels in the park said augustin i wonder what the deuce pen would think of them if she saw them now and then one day something serious happened it was on a sunday and on sundays the post came in at halfpast ten just at the time they were all having breakfast before going to church they were just about as happy as they could ever hope to be till penelope married one or all of them bob who was especially greedy that morning was eating against time and winning only ethel was sad for goby seemed quite cheerful when he was mournful she was happier always titania flowed wonderfully augustin was saying the kind of thing he could say when sitting down goring himself was eating as if he was in rivalry with bob he never said anything but looked like a duke which is a very fine thing when a man is a duke and can afford it with care gordon was eating bacon as if he had no great appetite for it oh heres the post said titania augustin took saturdays times and opened it i wonder whether dear penelope has written to me said titania the horde looked up they hoped even yet that penelope would give in and come at last any news grunted goring i dont see any replied augustin what are jack sheppards united asked gordon slipping a piece of bacon into his pocket and augustin made his celebrated speech over again his single speech in the house of lords good god said augustin and he turned almost as white as the times paper before it went through the machines every one stared at him what is it screamed titania bob jumped up and deserted a pigs cheek just as it was showing signs of utter defeat itsits said augustin and he stammered vainly i say lets look cried bob granny its something in the births marriages and deaths good heavens speak augustin implored titania the band of lovers went as white as augustin they stood up simultaneously i see it i see it said bob and he actually snatched the paper from lord bradstocks hand is she married is she dead asked titania no no said bob sputtering and aflame with wild excitement its bradinglady penelope brading on the th of a son chapter xiv there are blows which stun this was of course one of them titania did not shriek or faint at the awful intelligence conveyed by the thunderer of printing house square she nodded her head as if she was partially paralyzed and at last murmured in a dry whisper of a son of a son bradstocks eyebrows were as high as they would go and he stared at titania and then look around on the circle of men and women ethel squeaked a little squeak like a mouse behind the wainscot and was silent ohof a son said goby sighing and looking at the floor of a son said plant eyeing the ceiling un fils shrieked rivaulx gordon said damnation de vere shook like a stranded jellyfish bramber went as scarlet as a lobster and then as white as cotton carteret williams looked blue and carew looked green and bob said my eye there is something organic in any given number of people acting under the same shock or the same impulse what one thinks another thinks and now all the room fixed their eyes on titania whose lips moved in silence this is dreadful said titania to herself i dont believe shes married at all one of these men is a scoundrel a ruffian a seducer no one heard what she said but as she thought it the men looked at each other with awful suspicions and then titania whose mind was whirling said feebly wewe must hush it up and there lay the times hush it up indeed and bradstock recovered some of his equanimity nonsense shes married as she says he remarked with comparative coolness but no one believed it the men drew apart from each other de vere moved his chair because goby was looking at him like a demon carew shrank from carteret williams gordon went livid under plants eyes bramber looked at them all as if he would die on the spot rivaulx rose up and waltzed around the room it was a happy chance that he did so it is possible that he saved immediate bloodshed bradstock and bob caught the frenchman in their arms and led him outside to the lawn where there was ample room for a frantic pas seul steady old chap said bradstock steady her husband must acknowledge now who he is oh no said bob in immense delight not much if shes married at all shes sworn him not to she told me shed swear him not to and she said if he broke his oath shed never see him again great heavens said bradstock so she did i remember now she did speak of oaths dreadful oaths rivaulx danced over a flowerbed came in contact with a fence fell over it and uttered a howl which brought every one into the garden he tumbled into a ditch fortunately a comparatively dry one and lay there using the very worst french language the gloomy crowd lined the ditch and listened and wished they understood as a matter of fact only bradstock and bramber knew sufficient decent french to guess what rivaulx said and they shivered in the background titania and ethel hung to each other and wept old goring remained inside sucking at an unlighted cigar the terrible terrible disgrace said titania she believed the very worst at once is it the marquis is he smitten with remorse rivaulx got out of the ditch on the wrong side and walked out into the park where he addressed a commination service to a nice little herd of jersey cows after five minutes of this exercise he returned toward the house and climbed the fence then he shook his fist at the others one of you is a scelerat he howled a scoundrrrel i challenge you all to fight ha ha bradstock took him by the arm and led him away one of us is a hound said goby yes said the others yes they glared at each other horribly and clenched their fists bob ran around them in the wildest excitement look here i say captain goby oh mr de vere i say mr plant if you want to fight come into the stables granny says you mustnt fight here he grabbed several of them and was hurled into space at once he finally laid hold of de vere who wasnt capable of hurling a ladybird off his finger you shall fight goby if you want to he roared illustration the marquis de rivaulx antisemite to his manicured fingertips but i dont want to shrieked the poet what shall i do my heart is broken oh what rot said bob i dont understand what the row is about pen said she married and shes got a kid it will make her happy for she always loved kids but then the notice in her maiden name was it not awful horrible brazen peculiar antisocial against all law it was wicked immoral indecent behind it there must be a dreadful story by god said bradstock speaking at large to all but rivaulx who was breaking up a cane chair at a short distance i do think oaths or none that the man who is married to her should tell the duchess in confidence but rivaulx heard in the intervals of destruction and stayed his hand ha ha he said aloud i love her i am a man i love her what shall i do he threw the fragments of the chair into a fountain kicked over a flowerpot and ran again into the park taking the fence in his stride i believe its remorse said titania i begin to suspect the marquis but everybody suspected everybody and yet at the very height of their rage what bradstock said sank into their hearts pen had selected them with care for their inherent nobility they said to themselves that they would show how noble they were with one accord they straightened themselves up and an air of desperate resolve was upon every mans face i will think it out and make up my mind this afternoon said each of them they walked away in different directions and in five minutes not one of them was in sight but the marquis who was knocking his head against a sapling in a way that caused the herd of jerseys to revise their estimate of humanity even he gave up at last and went off into the distance with great strides i say said bob i dont know what to make of this where are they going and what are they going to do i wish i knew where pen is id send her a telegram the rest of the party said nothing titania wept old goring asked bradstock for a light and at last got his cigar going he said nothing whatsoever ethel mytton was in a fearful state of nervousness and shook with it bradstock walked up and down whistling the men who were not in it gathered in the billiardroom and said they thought they had better have urgent calls to town they wanted to discuss the scandal in their clubs they knew that there wasnt a house in england that would not consider their presence in the light of a tremendous favour considering all that had occurred at goring while they were there they went and regretted it afterward for much occurred that very afternoon that no man could have foreseen not a soul came in to lunch but bob and bradstock and the old duke augustin my boy said goring these are surprising events very surprising events i thought i understood something about women but i find im as ignorant as a twoyearold what the devil does penelope mean bob intervened i believe grandfather that she wants to make you all sit up he said eagerly shut up bob said the duke eat pie and hold your tongue augustin is she married or isnt she im sure of it said bradstock but i think its a damn silly business said the duke i cant remember any parallel except when miss wimple who was a devilish pretty girl fifty years ago married prince scharfskopf morganatically and kept it dark in spite of twins there was a devil of a fuss but it was kept quiet no announcements in papers and so on the emperor boxed scharfskopfs ears in court when it came out for it upset his diplomatic applecart as scharfskopf was to have married princess hedwig of wigstein she was virtuous and particular and made trouble being thirtyfive do you think penelope has married any damn prince for instance bradstock didnt think so was any prince sneaking about eh oh i say cried bob who was listening eagerly there was the rajah of jugpore good heavens said goring so there was i say bradstock what have you to say to that id like to have a look at the infant damme its a wonderful world and this bore its fruit afterward in scandal and conjecture for bob threw out hints about it but in the meantime they could only talk and presently they saw the marquis coming across the lawn he kept on stopping and looking up at the sky as if for help or a balloon and he smote his breast repeatedly in a very peculiar fashion queer cuss rivaulx said goring takes it hard give me a light bob look at the johnny smiting himself in the chest whats he thinking of now looks as if he was bound upon a desperate deed dear me i hope there will be no bloodshed bradstock im too old for bloodshed now i wont have duels in the immediate neighbourhood of the house bradstock mind that all right said augustin still looking at rivaulx gesticulating violently in front of a large laurestinus bob give me those glasses through the glass rivaulxs face was plain to see damn said augustin to himself whats up hes going to do something something desperate he is looking like a hero on a scaffold he has an air of sad nobility oh pen pen rivaulx advanced on the house with his head up he came in and sent word to the collapsed duchess that he desired most humbly an audience with her bob listened he wanted to see granny said bob let him said the duke i dont i want peace titania sent down word that she would see him poor sad penelope poor mournful penelope said rivaulx ha but i will save her from further woe he found titania on a sofa and he kissed her hand this pleased poor titania it reminded her of her youth oh marquis i am in despair she cried despair not said rivaulx as he stood up and smote his forehead despair not all is not lost but for me i stand between two dreadful alternatives and i have resolved to do my duty there was an air of tragedy about him that covered him like a robe titania shivered what is it what have you to tell me ah what cried rivaulx but i shall do it i shall do it at once immediately if not sooner as your poet says you wont kill any one at least not here shrieked titania far from it replied the marquis oh but it is terrible for i have to smash to break an oath i swore not to reveal what i am about to reveal good heavens said titania oh what is itcan it beno yes yes cried rivaulx it is true i own it own what marquis he smote his breast and looked above her i am the man oh what man squealed the duchess i am the husbandandandthe father said rivaulx with a gulp as if he were swallowing an apple whole of my penelope yes yes said the marquis say nothing it is a secret full of oaths why i know not but she the dear insists and what am i titania lay and gasped the relief was tremendous three hours ago she would have refused to think of rivaulx as pens husband now she welcomed the notion she sighed and almost fainted rivaulx muttered strange things to himself can i announce it no said the marquis it is a secret but it is all right i go take my blessing said titania go to her quickly poor dear and implore her to let me come to her and bid her tell all the world what is her address i cannot give it said rivaulx pallidly it is a secret but i go i hasten adieu duchess i am distracted oh my mother and my country he fled from the room and leaving his man to bring on his things went away at an illegal speed toward london well well said titania with a gasp i cannot understand anything but after all the marquis is a fine man and of a good family i could almost sleep a little but just as she was composing herself to rest mr plant sent up word that he wished to see her for a few moments on urgent business before he went back to town let him come up said the duchess when plant entered he stood bolt upright in front of her with a strange air of determination i shall surprise you i reckon he said in an american accent as thick as petrol fumes i know i shall no you wont said titania nothing can surprise me now i assure you i shall surprise you maam said plant and youll have to own it prepare yourself and remember that what i tell you is in the nature of a secret i can stand it no longer i have to let it out to hear lady penelope whom i adore spoken of as i do makes my blood boil she may have made some mistakes but ive made some too i am going to surprise you no you are not mr plant said titania ii am lady penelopes husband said plant desperately fixing his eyes on space you are what shrieked titania her husbandandthe parent of the announcement in the times said plant firmly am i mad asked titania no but i am said plant who was as pale as a traditional ghost im mad both ways i want to kill you mustnt cried titania feebly i dont know where i am what did you say oh say it again he said it again and before she could say anything further he rushed from the room and bounded downstairs she heard him turn his motorcar loose and knew that in twenty seconds he was a mile away whats wrong with everything and me and them asked titania i wish i was a dairymaid in a quiet farm and had no relations am i mad did the marquis say it or did i dream it lord bramber was announced oh oh oh said titania yes ill see him bramber came in fuming and like the others fixed his eyes over her head he was nervous and abrupt i cant stand any more duchess he began i cant stand much said titania its a secret of course said bramber and im breaking my word are you the husband of penelope asked titania ii am replied bramber and the cause so to speak of the notice in the times i thought so said titania look at me ronald do i look mad does my hair stand on end do i seem wild and wandering no of course not said bramber im telling you this because i feel i ought to now im going to her at once this last news was rather unexpected of course goodbye stay shrieked titania but she was too late bramber was downstairs and bounded into his motorcar and let her rip whats the matter with everybody wailed titania the marquis made me happy but now im confused very sadly confused and i cant think shes married them all gordon was announced and in about three sentences he told her that though the affair was a secret he was penelopes husband i knew you were said titania when i heard you wanted to see me i knew you were coming to say so oh goodbye ask lord bradstock to send for a doctor goodbye mr gordon go now and gordon went just as de vere came in you have come to say you have married penelope i know said titania i feel sure you have i have a heart for sorrow for disgrace for all things lovely ii am responsible for everything even the times said de vere who was as pale as plaster leave me said titania go and see her at once settle who it is go and when he had gone carteret williams and carew came one after the other with the same confession and she received them sadly and appeared to wander when the house was empty she sent for bradstock augustin dear augustin she said you wont let them put me in an asylum have me taken care of at home wont you dont let goring give me cruel keepers i am quite gentle and broken down i wont let anything beastly be done said bradstock but my dear child whats the matter and titania told him by the lord said bradstock they are damned good chaps but where the devil are we he went downstairs when the doctor came and told everything to goring and goring told bob for titania forgot to mention to augustin that all the husbands had insisted it was a dead secret i say said bob of all the larks ive ever heard of this takes the cake i wonder what i ought to do i think ill ask baker and he asked baker and in less than twentyfour hours the world knew all about it chapter xv but when it is said that all the world knew of it penelope herself must be excepted she knew nothing for some time and whoever her husband was he certainly never acquainted her with the horrible details of all the good men who sacrificed their honour in the noble attempt to save her from the results of the terrible misfortune they believed had happened to her it was indeed miss mackarness who told her about it and miss mackarness was the old governess whom penelope had once sacked and sent away the poor woman was in a terrible state of mind about the affair and in that was no different from all the rest of the world to her went timothy bunting with the strange story if you please maam geordie smith as just brought in a paper wiv a true and perticler account of ow all the gents that was courtin our lady told the duchess of goring as ow they as married er what said miss mackarness a true and perticuler account as ow they ad hall married our lady sayin as they ad concealed it till they could no longer repeated timothy more loudly good heavens said miss mackarness trembling very much i fear it will upset lady penelope to say nothing of the infant do they all claim the infant bunting i presume so maam said bunting it looks likely under these circumstances bunting cried miss mackarness i feel it is my duty to communicate the facts to our lady give me the paper bunting bunting said he would get it and came back with a hatful of fragments if you please maam this is hall i can rescue of the details the cook and the parlourmaid and the two ousemaids ave fought over it in the servants all and are now in tears not aving read a word and miss mackarness took the hatful up to penelope who sat with her nurse and the cause of all the trouble in a south room overlooking the moat in the name of all that is wonderful whats in that hat asked penelope it is timothy buntings hat my lady replied the mackarness so i perceive said penelope is a bird in it oh no my lady its the bits of a newspaper replied the housekeeper as if she served up the times in a grooms hat every day its timothys hat but a clean new one but why do you bring it and why do you put newspaper in it asked penelope if you please my lady i cannot help it the cook and the parlourmaid and the two housemaids fought over it in the servants hall and are now in tears not having read a word of it to all appearance the housekeeper had lost her senses though this was no wonder penelope wondered at it well she said at last i see whats in the hat but whats in the newspaper if you please my lady according to timothy bunting and smith who appear to have read it it contains the true account of what happened at goring house the other day when all the gentlemen staying there hearing from the times that your ladyship had a fine boy on the eighteenth and no husband named by your ladyships particular directions all got up one after the other and requesting private interviews with her upset grace the duchess declared upon their oaths though in secret that they had married you themselves she recited this in a strange mechanical way which would have been extremely effective upon the stage as a picture of hopeless conventionality wounded to death and at last dying in sheer indifference to all things dear me said penelope dear me it furthermore appears my lady begging your pardon for mentioning it and i have reproved bunting bitterly for daring to do so though i havent read the fragments in the hat that no one believes your ladyships word at all as to your being married oh how shameful said penelope why heres baby the nurse coughed and hid her mouth with her hand yes my lady so he is said miss mackarness there doesnt seem any doubt whatsoever about that but and penelope sighed suddenly her face lighted up ah she said i see why they said it to aunty how very very noble of them i knew they were all splendid men men of the highest character and attainments and possibilities will you have telegrams written out to all of them saying your conduct is noble and i am deeply grateful yes my lady replied the housekeeper and how will you sign it sign it penelope brading said penelope and tell smith to take his car as quickly as he can to spilsborough and send them from there she lay back in her pillows they are noble fellows she said i have done them an immense amount of good a year ago not one of them could have risen to such heights of abnegation such love such tenderness i shall see them bringing in a new era yet leopold gordon will inaugurate a new and pure finance the dear marquis will abolish antisemitism and duelling in france de vere will write poems of a purity appealing equally to brixton and belgravia and my dear friend carew will vindicate the royal academys policy of showing that charity begins at home and the restah me poor dear aunty how i love her and by the time that she had pondered over a renewed world geordie smith was sending off the wires from spilsborough with wonderful results i like this said smith this is what i like theres nothing dull about it i wonder whatll happen now ill lay five to one i can guess he guessed right as to some for in about four hours rufus plant arrived in spilsborough on his racingcar and put up at the grand hotel i guess she must be somewhere in this neighbourhood said plant and here i stay till i find her and by the tail of the sacred bull whatever happens ill marry her right here in this hyer noble pile of a cathedral and if shell do it ill restore it for the authorities free of charge till its as gawdy as a breastpin and right up to date he ran against gordon and the two men fell back in horrible surprise you you oh yes said plant im here on business connected with the cathedral and im to see thebishop who will join the board on allotment mumbled gordon and then goby roared into town on his motorcar the others saw him and he saw them and ignored them palely he too put up at the grand but never spoke to them and de vere came in while they were at dinner and sat down opposite to goby he said oh and rising at once bolted from the table im damned said goby and he lost his appetite how many more of us they asked themselves they looked up at every one who entered bramber will be in any moment said plant poor de vere sat in his bedroom and was ill if i look out into the corridor i know i shall see that beast williams he sobbed wheres that french fool rivaulx asked gordon they all believed the other was the scoundrel of the dreadful drama and then the evening papers came in they declared in big lines that there had been a fracas in high life they added that it had taken place in the row at four oclock that very afternoon they went on to say that lord bramber and the marquis de rivaulx well known as a great sportsman and a balloonist had fought in a flowerbed and had been torn from each others arms and a big rhododendron by two dukes three earls and a viscount they further declared that it was a matter of public notoriety that all the trouble rose out of the mystery connected with the times and lady penelope brading they promised more details in later editions theyll fight said gordon savagely i hope theyll kill each other but especially i hope that the marquis will be killed first and most and about eleven oclock rivaulx turned up with his chauffeur and a bad black eye he shall fight me here said rivaulx this is a quiet town no one will think of spilsborough he does not know that she sent me a telegram from here he put up at the angel and escaped seeing the others for the time on his way up he had sent a defiant telegram to bramber desiring him to come to spilsborough and fight there with swords or pistols or any weapon that commended itself to him this telegram bramber never got for on reaching home and washing away the traces of the struggle in hyde park before all the loveliness of london he had found his telegram from spilsborough sent by geordie smith after looking in the abc guide and finding no good train he pelted off in his motorcar leaving a note for rivaulx saying that though duels were absurd and illegal he would not refuse to meet the marquis in france or belgium if he desired to make a bigger fool of himself than he had already done in the park curse and confound them all said bramber who was horribly cross and exceedingly sick of the whole world even including penelope i wonder what she means by this telegram i wish i was dead is she at spilsborough just in the middle of spilsborough he met rivaulx and pulled up short not having the least notion of course that he would meet him there but rivaulx grinned a ghastly smile and raised his hat as bramber stopped ha i am pleased to see you said the french marquis you have come quickly it is a fine night there is a moon and close by here under the shadow of the cathedral there is a most beautiful piece of grass there we will fight i have brought swords with me or have you brought guns i havent brought guns said bramber who was entirely stunned and at a loss for a word the marquis bowed we will fight with swords my lord i think this hotel is good the lady is amiable there are rooms to spare when the moon rises ha i will call you forth and bramber went to the hotel to think what he should do the ass the lunatic how did he get here i cant get out of fighting him he sat outside in his car no i wont im damned if i do he said he went in and wrote a note for rivaulx who was out in the cathedral close picking what he considered a good place for a duel the spot he chose was not far from the deans house i wish it had been mr plant he said of bramber who is a young ass i am not jealous but of plant i am horribly jealous and he is a bad man if i met plant i would say fight me at once now and i will put off lord bramber till another day and going around the corner he ran right into plant who was raging about the town wondering where penelope was and how everything was going to end the scoundrel is that marquis said plant and he ran into the scoundrels arms and just while bramber was shaking the dust of spilsborough from the tires of his motorcar bob himself came into the town in a hired daimler full of the most extraordinary news and titania was having a series of fits down at goring with dr lumsden griff in attendance chapter xvi it cannot be imagined that titania who had survived so many shocks was ill for nothing when bob discovered what she was ill of he stood outside on the lawn with his hands deep in his pockets and with his legs wide apart i must tell em this at once said bob gloomily if i dont tell gordon hell forget hes invested a hundred of mine in something to make hair curl and i shall lose the money i mean to make money to keep up goring by and by and he said hed make me a director too for the sake of the family i cant neglect him or de vere either or any of em butbut i never thought it of pen with his pockets full of money derived from the sale of dogs to de vere he rushed off to the station and caught a train for town when he reached london he sent a wire to old guth im in town on important business break it to grandmother between fits i hope to be back tomorrow he rushed off to park lane to find gordon mr gordon has gone to spilsborough sir said gordons man d i mean confound it said bob he went to plants mr plant went to spilsborough in a great hurry this afternoon sir said plants landlady the american millionaire still lived in bloomsbury though not on ten shillings a week oh said bob i wonder what this means theres a secret here he drove in a hansom to find bramber a very ingenuous piece of humanity in buttons told bob that lord bramber came in about four oclock torn to ribbons and found a telegram waiting him and off he went in his motorcar where asked bob i dont know said the buttons but on bobs going to brambers room he found the abc open on the table at the page with spilsborough on it sherlock holmes would say he has gone to spilsborough cried bob and if gordon and plant have gone there too ill bet all the rest have gone ill go too but there was no train for three hours im done said bob no im not ill hire a motorcar he went to the nearest place in regent street and hired one very well sir said the man but its rather expensive you know bob pulled out a handful of sovereigns take as many as you think fair he said grandly and dont forget i want a speedy one and a man that can drive and ill pay the fines of course that was how he came to spilsborough just in time and about the hour when the moon was to rise he passed a motorcar in the ditch about ten miles out of the cathedral city and did not stop to find out what was the matter he thus missed the discovery that bramber and his chauffeur were both sitting upon the wreck using very awful language to each other on the subject of losing the way and coming bolt down a side road into the opposing hedge it is astonishing how an accident at thirty miles an hour brings owners and mechanics down to the same human level when bob reached spilsborough he was covered with dust but was as spry as a grasshopper and awfully full of his news you can drive said bob to his man im very much pleased with you stop at this hotel he went into the angel and staggered blithely to the office is mr gordon here or mr plant or the marquis of rivaulx he demanded he thus discovered the marquis he drove off to the grand and found plant and goby and de vere and gordon were there they were all in bed but plant and plant had gone to see the cathedral by moonlight all right well put up here said bob and ill see if i can find plant i say i wonder what baker will think of this it beats me he got to the cathedral precincts just about an hour after rivaulx and plant had run into each others arms much had occurred since then for rivaulx started back from plant and almost forgot the existence of bramber you are a scoundrrrel said rivaulx rolling his rs in the most fearful manner you are a lunatic replied plant coolly when did you escape i have not escaped i am here snorted rivaulx but you shall not escape i meant to kill lord bramber upon this spot but i prefer to keel you i let him go he is nothing you are the scoundrrel oh dry up said plant crossly you tire me you fatigue me very much i am exhausted by looking at you go home or i will break you in three pieces and eat them rivaulx foamed at the mouth do you refuse to fight me sare certainly not said plant take your coat off and hang it on a tombstone and ill leave nothing of you but a smear i do not fight with fists said rivaulx contemptuously i fight with swords with steel with guns or pistols plant shook his head ive none of em about me my son at the hotel i have swords cried rivaulx eagerly i brought them to kill bramber who punched my eye in the rotten row and we rolled in bushes but i will first fight you wait and i fetch the swords he ran violently into the darkness and plant sat on a railing what am i to do am i to wait and fight a lunatic or shall i go back to the hotel i think ill go back if that raging idiot is found prancing about here with swords they will run him in but he did not know how fast the marquis could run and how near the hotel was before he had made up his mind to go rivaulx came back again he flung the swords at plants feet take one and let us begin he said i think on the whole ill have both said plant suiting the action to the word now go home marquis like a good little boy and come to the grand hotel in the morning and tell me why you want to be hanged in england he put both the weapons under his arm you will not fight said the marquis gasping like a dying dolphin what kind of a galoot do you reckon me asked plant quite unintelligibly ha said the marquis i know not what a galoot is but i will fight you here and leave your body on the grass neither of them had observed the approach of a portly and pleasant gentleman behind them he was now leaning upon the railing watching them with a great deal of kindly curiosity i think gentlemen that the dean will object he said at length and they both turned around suddenly you must not interfere said rivaulx we do not know you illustration rufus q plant born in virginia to be sure to be sure replied the gentleman who was dressed very curiously as rivaulx noticed i hate interfering especially with anything belonging to a dean deans gentlemen are very touchy about matters connected with their cathedrals now dean briggs gentlemen takes the very greatest care of that grass on which you both are now illegally trampling and i understand that he has made a rule never to have duels upon it he is very firm on that point do i mistake you if i say that it looks to an unprejudiced observer as if you were going to fight a duel rivaulx bowed i do not know you sare and i do not want to i want to keel this man who is a scoundrrel the stranger addressed plant and are you equally anxious to break this very rigid rule of the deans he asked suavely certainly not replied plant i want to go to bed i am delighted to hear it i am intensely gratified to hear it if one duellist having possession of both deadly weapons desires to go to bed i cannot see anything to hinder him unless indeed he wants to lie down on mr deans grass you see gentlemen i am a bishop and a bishops first desire is to be on good terms with the dean if mr dean heard that i encouraged any one to break his rules about duelling or going to bed in the precincts of this cathedral i should not be on good terms with him i assure you i do not understand said rivaulx i want to fight that is all i want to do stay said the bishop mildly if the somewhat excited gentleman who is i gather not an englishman will accompany me a few yards we will go to the deans with whom i have been dining and will refer the matter to him of course said plant that is the right thing to do marquis his lordship the bishop suggests the only course open to gentlemen i trust you will accept his offer and if you do i undertake to fight you if the dean gives his permission stay sare my lord the bishop said rivaulx one moment sare the bishop is this dean of whom you speak a gentleman certainly certainly replied the bishop hastily he is of the highest breeding and in his youth he fenced like a fencingmaster then he understands the code of honour sare the bishop absolutely for a dean replied his lordship then i agree sir lord cried rivaulx ha we will go to his house then said the bishop if you will step over this railing but stop here one moment and observe the moon rising over mr deans cathedral is it not a peaceful pleasant spot gentlemen it beats thunder said plant it does it does nodded his lordship many americans who admire this cathedral immensely have made the same acute observation may i ask your names gentlemen i am the bishop of this diocese my name is plant rufus q plant and my friend is the marquis of rivaulx indeed returned the bishop is the gentleman the french nobleman who is interested in balloons yes said plant dear me i am delighted said his lordship i too am interested in balloons i saw one go up once you like them asked rivaulx warmly that is good i will take you up in one we will talk of it later said the bishop rather hastily for a man of his gentle flowing speech but this is the deans house if i knock at this window he will put his head out he knocked at the window and mr dean did put his head out i am so loath to disturb you mr dean said his lordship but as i was leaving you and taking a little stroll before retiring i met two gentlemen one from the united states and one a french marquis who were engaged in a warm discussion on a point of honour i am ignorant of the exact point and i dare say there is no necessity for our knowing as a result of this discussion the french marquis desired to fight a duel with swords you will observe them under the arm of the gentleman from the united states and i ventured to intervene as the duel was to take place upon your grass humph indeed said the dean in great astonishment and what did you say i said that it was against your rules to allow any one to fight duels there was i not right rather said the dean i should say so and on the other hand continued the bishop the gentleman from across the atlantic wished to go to bed then why thewhy doesnt he asked the dean it seemed to me that the gentleman from across the water wanted to go to bed upon your grass said the bishop i pointed out to him that there was a very old and strict rule dating from the time beyond record which forbade this was i not right you were said the dean i never go to bed on the grass myself and do not permit others to do so i never fight duels there either and do not allow it you see gentlemen said the bishop but before he could add another word bob rushed right upon the group outside the deans windows and saw that plant made one of them he saw the swords also and then recognized rivaulx oh i say said bob you were going to fight a duel about pen ive come in time its no good she has married timothy bunting her groom chapter xvii it was such an awful shock to plant and rivaulx and for the matter of that to his lordship the bishop of spilsborough that they all gasped dreadfully plant took the bishop by the sleeve rivaulx lay down upon the grass under the deans window and howled as he tore at the turf the dean said ill come out this is becoming serious he came out and as he opened the door the light of the hall lamp fell upon bobs face good heavens said the bishop i thought i knew the voice is that you robert goring bob said it was but added that he didnt know the bishop boy i christened you said the bishop is all this trouble about penelope brading whom i also christened yes replied bob shall i tell you about it let us retire a few paces and you can tell me said the bishop in the meantime mr dean i beg you to exercise patience with the french nobleman on the grass come bob well its awful rot you know said bob speaking very rapidly we dont know where we are in the family and grandmother is lying on a sofa screaming why bob you must have heard of it the bishop had heard a great deal but not all pen says shes married and has a kid said bob and she wont say who it is and all these jossers including plant hes the american over there and the marquis chewing the grass said they had married her themselves do you see sirmy lord i mean i see said the bishop putting his fingertips together it was i think very noble of them but granny said it was very trying and it made her ill for she wasnt any further than before unless pen had married them all and grandfather who kept cool said that was unlikely it certainly seems unlikely said the bishop but when you came to us you made some very astonishing remarks about a groom one bunting i think now what is there to know about him weekes said that the beast cried bob who is the beast weekes asked the bishop bob told him who miss harriet weekes was and not an hour after these had said they were married to pen this weekes woman came in black and in a cab and said she must see granny and granny saw her and is now in fits with the doctor feeling her pulse and giving her brandy for weekes was very solemn i listened and she said your grace i shall reveal the truth which lies upon my bosom like a tombstone her ladyship treated me cruel and gave me the sack moreover and ive no call to be silent no more avin diskivered the truth she talks like that weekes is an uneducated beast and why pen ever had her as a maid i cant tell and granny was confused with the others having said they were all married to pen and she waggled her head awfully i shall surprise your grace said weekes and granny said she wouldnt and she said i shall surprise your grace for ive to reveal that i know the man the serpent that her ladyship as married and granny smiled very curiously and said weekes who do you say it is and then weekes cried the crocodile and she said that penelope had married timothy bunting the groom and that timothy had been engaged to her and had as good as told her that he was looking high and despised a publichouse at a corner i dont know what she meant and she was so solemn and furious that granny believed her and went off into fit after fit most awful my lord and they sent for the doctor and i came away for i knew the others would fight when they learnt that all of them had said the same thing and i believe it is timothy myself dear dear me said the bishop this is even more remarkable than i anticipated from the very strange reports in the papers but i think you have done well robert and i do not regret having christened you by any means which is more than i can say for some of the aristocracy let us return to the dean who is i am afraid having some trouble with the french marquis he is not accustomed to foreign noblemen and to americans except when they come here to see his cathedral they turned toward the deanery where rivaulx was still rolling on the grass do you think it is timothy asked bob the bishop shook his head gently i do not see what grounds we have to go on robert here we have an american who states if i understand you rightly that he has married my poor penelope and a french marquis of high repute who also states the same and there are others five or six said bob and there are five or six others who commit themselves to the same statement and then a ladys maid says she knows that penelope has married a groom i do not see what logical grounds we have for concluding anything more than that some one has told a lie or that penelope has been breaking the law by marrying more than one man at a time speaking a priori i think this latter alternative unlikely and as a matter of probability i am forced to believe that only one at least out of seven is it seven gentlemen of unblemished reputation has told the truth it was all very sad but there were practical details to be attended to though the marquis had ceased to raise the echoes of the stilly night to say nothing of the echoes of the cathedrals west front he was still in a fearfully mournful condition he was now weeping in the deans arms and the dean was endeavouring to soothe him as best he could when the bishop came back mr dean seemed much relieved dont you think you could get them to go away bishop he inquired pathetically this kind of thing is beyond my experience and i am extremely fatigued by it i will do my best replied the bishop turning to the marquis he said get up marquis i will walk with you to the hotel mr plant please follow with robert and be good enough to take care of those lethal instruments which are i rejoice to say little understood in a quiet cathedral town it appears to me we are all in a state of mind which needs repose on the morrow after i have slept upon it i shall be happy to receive you all and give you the best advice in my power now marquis i am waiting for you the grass is damp and they walked to the hotel leaving the dean staring openmouthed this is very unusual sighed the dean i cannot recollect anything exactly like it in my long experience no more could the bishop plant was in the same state of mind rivaulx wept silently bob was in the seventh heaven of delight in spite of bunting he thoroughly believed in what harriet weekes said neither plant nor rivaulx knew that he knew they both claimed to be pens husband this story of bunting is a goldarned lie said plant hoarsely bob did not reply he was sorry for them all and relied on the bishop what he relied on him for he did not know all he did know was that the bishop seemed fully equal to the situation how many more of you are there mr plant he asked at length gordon and goby and de vere replied plant miserably i must see mr gordon said bob and then they came to the angel by this time rivaulx and the bishop were great friends for rivaulx was a clerical in his heart of hearts and if there wasnt a catholic bishop to lean on a protestant one was a good substitute he stopped weeping and held the bishops hand you are a good man sare bishop he said i wish i was a good bishop but i cannot life is a very terrible thing i wish i could cut my throat i am weary i should go to bed said the bishop and ill look in and see you in the morning bed is the best place when one is weary i assure you that i am not wholly ignorant of the world or of the desire to cut my throat but i find that after a good nights rest the wish to do so evaporates and one determines to live for another twelve hours at least but before you go i hope you will give me your word that you will cut no one elses i give it said rivaulx the desire to kill mr plant has left me i am no longer furious even with bramber i am simply sad and fearfully mournful i thank you sare good night good night said the bishop stay marquis i think mr plant has the weapons the marquis waved them off i have no need of them i give them you sare bishop take them and when the bishop had bidden plant and bob good night and had arranged to see bob in the morning the curious sight might have been witnessed of a great ornament of the episcopal bench walking through the precincts of the cathedral to his palace with a couple of duellingswords under his arm this has been a very interesting evening said the bishop i very much wonder what ridley will think when he sees me come in a butlers mind is naturally limited he went in and gave the swords to ridley take these said his lordship yes mlord said ridley stolidly i think you can hang them up in the diningroom ridley yes mlord they are trophies ridley so i perceive mlord said ridley what are trophies ridley these mlord said ridley exactly so said his lordship and while he was taking off his gaiters and thinking of penelope bob was sitting on the edge of gordons bed and telling him all about it why are you here asked bob she sent me a telegram said poor gordon i say what about sayin i wath a noble character and so on replied gordon miserably and i came here at onth becauth the telegram came from here as the sleep went out of his eyes he talked less hebraically i thought she might be here he added shaking his curly head bob thought very hard i say this is awfully mixed mr gordon because i know you told granny you were married to pen gordon gulped something down it was probably very bad language soso i am he said sternly without looking at bob rivaulx says so too the devil cried gordon and so does goby and rivaulx and bramber and de vere and all of em gordon fell back on his pillows so you see said bob were no further than we were except that weekes who used to be pens maid came to granny this afternoon and told her the beast that pen had married timothy bunting gordon bounced out of bed in his nightshirt who the devil is timothy bunting he roared bob told him its a liea lie of course it must be if youve married her as you say said bob but perhaps im disturbing you would you like to go to sleep very much indeed replied gordon i should like to go to sleep and stay asleep i wish youd go and serve goby and de vere as youve served me im so sorry said bob but you always said you wanted any news and thats why i told you first gordon held out his hand and bob shook it warmly by the way he asked what about the hair restorer what hair restorer asked the astonished hebrew the one you put ninety pounds of mine in sir it wasnt in a hair restorer what makes you say so well replied bob i thought it was you said it would make my hair curl how much did it make whatever it was a glow of pleasure spread over gordons sad countenance making money was something even in despair my boy i bought you amalekites at half a crown five hundred and sixty of em and now theyre at l dear me said bob how much does that make why its l less commission agreed the financier by jove thats a very very good beginning said bob do you think they will go up more mr gordon gordon looked at him and sighed they might but dont you think it would be safer to get out now bob bob shook his head ill follow your advice sir of course if it was only myself id take the money but im thinking of goring when my father and grandfather and uncle die what i want is fifty thousand at least grandfather often says that is the least that can put the house on its legs again let me see l is eight times four times l thats thirtytwo times l whats thirtytwo times l seventyone thousand six hundred and eighty replied gordon promptly that would do very well indeed said bob please go on sir till its that or shall i take half and ask mr plant to do something with it he offered to help me certainly not replied gordon angrily plants a reckless speculator and a liar and hell wake up some day worth half a million less than nothing ill do my best for you and goring bob im sure you will sir said bob good night mr gordon im sorry if ive worried you and he went off to worry goby gordon walked up and down the room weeping if i only had a boy like that he cried by moses and all the prophets ill put amalekites up skyhigh and squeeze the bears till they howl oh pen pen chapter xviii by breakfasttime or a little later goby and gordon and de vere and rivaulx knew not only what was said about timothy bunting but also that every one of them had told the duchess of goring that he was married to penelope when the bishop looked in to see the marquis he found him exceedingly difficult to manage he wanted the duellingswords back in order to fight every one his especial desire now was to put cold steel through gordon and this led to a general evacuation of spilsborough i say mr gordon said bob rushing in upon the financier while he was shaving ive just met the bishop and he wanted to know if i knew you and i said rather and he said would i ask you in the interests of peace to go back to london because the marquis wanted to cut your throat with swords hanging in the bishops diningroom i say will you go or stay and fight gordon cut himself and then as bob said cut his stick and went back to town shaved on one side and not on the other as a result of this several men in the city sold bears of everything that gordon was interested in and they got left most horribly especially on amalekites never afterward did they venture to think that any financier was on the borders of ruin if he came into the city partially shaved in fact three very shady jews with some wildcat stock to boom played the trick successfully and through not being shaved themselves they shaved others but this is all by the way and it only shows that a real financier in love or in despair is just as dangerous as at other times bob and the bishop talked the situation over in spilsborough while gordon was going to town and the result was what might have been expected all we know is that penelope poor dear penelope is near spilsborough said the bishop and that shes married said bob we infer that from general grounds our knowledge of her character said the logical bishop strictly we cannot be said to know it it is not a primary datum of consciousness nor is it a judgment or a purely rational conclusion bob oh said bob well perhaps not i think said the bishop that i shall write to her where to to everywhere said the bishop and ask her to come and confide in me and in the meantime as the others have gone and your presence here is no longer necessary i think you should go home and console your grandmother and apply yourself to work all right said bob i dont think its interesting here any more but are you glad i came in time to stop the duel i am glad said the bishop but to tell the truth robert i should not have allowed a duel on mr deans ancient grass and under his immemorial elms without a remonstrance even a physical remonstrance within the memory of this portly and admirable pillar of the church to which the british empire owes all its greatness and to which it pays a great deal of its money were many fierce encounters at oxford that haunt of ancient peace and modern progress would you have knocked em down asked bob eagerly certainly said the bishop i would have knocked them as flat as a flounder and bob bade him goodbye i think hes a ripping good bishop said bob ill ask mr gordon to help restore the cathedral he got back to goring to find titania no longer suffering from fits fits were not equal to the situation all her friends were writing to her to condole with her on the marriage of penelope to timothy bunting they came down in droves to condole and to get the latest intelligence while gamekeepers and grooms were keeping journalists out of the grounds with guns and pitchforks for the world was absolutely certain that miss weekes was right and pens cidevant maid was making the salary of a star at the empire by according interviews to those halfpenny papers which are englands glory and her hope the editors endeavoured to interview the lovers but they were stern and savage they would not speak to each other and avoided strangers but it was no secret now that they each claimed to be lady penelopes husband as the acutest journalist of them all remarked this was hardly possible the only theory that held water or at least good water as the baboo pleader remarked was the bunting theory but if bunting was the man where was he and why this mystery a journalist solved it or said he did bunting was a very handsome man there was no doubt of that but he was an uneducated man that was quite certain if a lady of penelopes standing married a man of buntings what would she do the answer was easy she would send him to oxford to acquire the accent and the aplomb and the insolence which have rendered oxford men the idols of the mob and have put them into every position where tact with inferior races is a sine qua non this is what the journalist said he ought to have known as he had been brought up in the yorkshire dissenting college and dissented from all other codes of manners except those popular with the nonconformist conscience which equally with the church of england has made the empire what it is and what it should be but this journalist knew his market the eyes of the civilized world once more turned to oxford if its bunting ill kill him said all the lovers who were not married to penelope she has made a mistake if its true and he must be got rid of now was the time of the marchioness of rigsbys glory did i not tell you she had married her groom she demanded of titania penelope was extremely rude to me i am almost glad she has married a groom if he is a nice groom he may improve her manners she hasnt married any groom cried titania furiously i am perfectly certain it is the marquis of rivaulx she was certain of nothing bradstock was certain of nothing they both asked bob what he was certain of and bob replied all the lovers were in such a state of mind that it couldnt be any of them and then at last titania hit upon a certain truth whoever it is would be just as miserable as all the others she said hell be sorry now that he agreed to it and hell be asking her to give in and she wont and theyll quarrel youre right titania cried bradstock slapping his thigh bob i believe the most miserable of them all is the man which is the most miserable bob thought gordon cried a little ha said the duchess but rivaulx cried a good deal said bob oh said the duchess but which do you think it is robert i think its timothy bunting said bob and i want to go to oxford to find out if hes there baker says do you discuss these matters with baker demanded his grandmother haughtily he knows a great deal about the world said bob and about bunting you know baker says you may go to oxford cried titania and i will go to bed and stay there i am a most unhappy woman and goring does not care so bob went to oxford all by himself and called upon an undergraduate who had just come up from harrow one of the schools which bob had been requested to leave on account of pugilism jack harcourt was four years bobs senior but could not fight so well in spite of that and there was much more equality between them than would seem possible at first sight but then it is almost impossible to feel very much superior to a boy who has knocked you absolutely senseless as bob did harcourt and bob was one of those boys who make all the world equal he was familiar with princes and said baker says to cabinet ministers and if his uncle didnt marry he was bound to be a duke dukes are very important people somehow and the fact that bob never showed any side was much in his favour over and above that important fact i say is there a man up here called bunting asked bob and harcourt after consulting a calendar said there was timothy bunting asked bob jumping as if he were shot thomas said harcourt oh hed say thomas i dare say said bob and he told harcourt all about it do you think shes married him asked the undergraduate who knows what girls will do said bob dont you remember the blackeyed one in the pastrycooks at harrow who wouldnt look at you and was in love with that beast black harcourt did remember but changed the conversation as quickly as possible this fellow is at all saints he said i dare say theyd let a groom in there lets go and find him said bob poor old bunting will be sick to see me im very sorry for him if he is a presumptuous beast it will be very awkward for the family but we must know the uncertainty is killing my grandmother and baker says its always best to know the worst at once bakers the best judge of dogs and horses i know he was a sergeant in the dublin fusiliers oh i told you that and when they got into the high street they ran right into plant who smiled a sickly smile and said he had come up to have a look at oxford i say mr plant whats the matter with your clothes asked bob have you fallen downstairs plant murmured something unintelligible and hurried away leaving bob staring thats one of em harcourt he said to his friend hes a millionaire then i think he might afford a hat without a dint in it replied harcourt bob shook his head i cant make it out hes very particular he said but lets get on around the next corner they bumped into gordon who also announced that he had been struck with a wild desire to have a look at the ancient university city bob shook his head i say mr gordon you want brushing badly do you know you look as if you had fallen downstairs he asked gordon said do i and bolted i cant make this out said bob this has all the appearance of a mystery harcourt it has said harcourt as they entered all saints they saw a man run across the grass and disappear under the far archway which led out into the turl that looked very much like de vere said bob very much only i never saw him run except that time when the bulldog chased him and then he ran differently but of course it cant be de vere after asking two reverendlooking members of the university who looked as if they knew all about the subjective world and a scout with every appearance of a deep acquaintance with the objective one they discovered mr buntings rooms i think hes havin some gents to lunch though im not his scout sir and they seems to be enjoying themselves now very much said the scout mr bunting is readin ard so i ear but hes relaxin a little today just now i see a gentleman drop hout of is window sir and youre the third lot ive directed there this is is staircase gents first floor thank you sir im sure ill drink your ealth and here harcourt said he thought hed leave bob so bob went up about six dark steps by himself and then he stopped whoever he is hes making a devil of a row said bob pausing a devil of a row i wonder if it is bunting i think harcourt might have stayed but he never did like fighting or rows he climbed up another step or two and heard a mighty uproar i think they must be having a boxing party said bob and then he heard a door open on the landing above him confound you sir to the devil with you sir said a voice that he certainly did not recognize then he heard a noise which was presently explained by the fact that carteret williams fell down the stairs turning a crooked corner most wonderfully in company with a very large liddell and scotts dictionary of that beautiful language greek oh is that you mr williams asked bob williams appeared rather confused yes bob he said as he hugged the dictionary ii think so why have you fallen downstairs asked bob that damn groom threw me down said williams at least he threw this book at me and i came down illustration carteret williams war correspondent he wrote with a red picturesqueness which was horribly attractive what is it really bunting roared bob eagerly he says his names bunting replied williams but hes very difficult to handle oh tim can box said bob but is he our bunting whichever bunting he is you are welcome to him said the enraged war correspondent i must go up and see said bob do you think he threw mr plant and mr gordon down too i met em just now and they looked as if he had im sure hes capable of it said williams bitterly here take this book with you i dont want it and bob climbed up hugging several pounds weight of greek with him he stood at the door and listened and heard a man inside snorting violently and slamming things about as if he was very much disturbed in his mind bob knocked at the door and it was opened suddenly the man who opened it was in deep shadow it isit is no it isnt said bob quite aloud are you another of em asked the occupier of the rooms oh it isnt said bob and choking down his disappointment his politeness returned is this your greek dictionary he asked courteously i found it lying on mr carteret williams on the next landing and he said he didnt want it the man named bunting seized the dictionary and then took bob by the shoulder and led him in bob went like a lamb for this mr bunting was six feet high about three feet across the chest more or less and had a grip like cliphooks on a bale was that man named williams he asked yes said bob you know him why of course said bob i know em all all ive thrown downstairs this afternoon i think so said bob modestly at least i met mr plant and mr gordon who looked very much as if they had fallen downstairs and i think the little gentleman you dropped out of the window on the grass must have been mr austin de vere oh said mr bunting sit down boy and look at me do i look mad bob looked at him and then at the room the room looks mad he replied and it certainly did that was the last one said mr bunting he was very troublesome hes a war correspondent said bob but why is your name bunting how the devil do i know asked the other in reply perhaps as you seem to know them you can explain what it all means i will try sir if you will tell me what occurred said bob first of all said the outraged member of all saints the american person knocked and came in and he said is your name bunting and i said yes confound you for your infernal impudence and what is yours and he said what the devil do you mean by saying you have married her and i said id said nothing of the kind and i said if he didnt get out in two shakes of a lambs tail id throw him out and he was furious and couldnt and wouldnt explain so i did throw him out and as he tumbled downstairs he said hed married her himself and he went away and i sat down to read thucydides hes under the sofa now somewhere and then the jew came and he said you mutht contradict the report of your being married to her at onth and that made me very cross and i said i wouldnt and that made him very wild so i said i was married to her just as he said he was oh said bob and are you oh dear i am so confused are you really really married to pen i shall drop you out of the window in a minute said mr bunting i said it to annoy him and it did and he said i was a liar so i opened the door and took him by the neck and dropped him downstairs and he howled awfully and i said to him over the bannisters i am married to her and have been married for years to her and she loves me very much and we are going to acknowledge it as soon as ive taken my ba and he went away holding his neck and then the little man came in did you say he was a poet a very good poet too said bob and i sell him bulldogs oh said mr bunting blankly you do do you why because pen thought they would do him good mr bunting shook his head thicksides is lucid compared with this he murmured but patience patience and i shall construe it yet and what did mr de vere say asked bob the same thing he stood there and said i must contradict it and he said of course it was very kind of her to have me educated but that if i had a spark of decency i should know that a man who had once occupied the position i had couldnt possibly marry her and by the way what position had i occupied in regard to her a groom said bob you were supposed to have been a groom dear me said mr bunting how interesting and remarkable still no light no real light and of course i said i had married her and i asked him did he think i would desert the lady now and he went scarlet why did he go scarlet do you think i know said bob it must have been on account of the baby mr bunting smote his forehead so it must he said i never thought of that what a fearful complication and then he too said i was a liar so i took him by the collar and led him to the window and i opened it and dropped him out and then the one you call williams came and he also was indignant and said i was to deny it and i wouldnt of course and then we fought and the furniture was much disarranged and thicksides went under the sofa and at last i got him outside and finished him with liddell and scott and now you know all in your turn you can explain what it means i beg you to do it and then we will have some tea and bob explained the whole story you might have seen it in the papers said bob i dont read em said bunting except to turn a times leader into greek but it seems a complicated situation doesnt it it is very complicated sighed bob and my grandmother is very ill about it and now she will wonder if its you after all dear me so she will said bunting have some tea they had tea and bob rose to go will you write to the times and say you havent married her he asked certainly not said mr bunting didnt i say to the others that i threw downstairs that i had married her so you did said bob but of course you havent bunting smiled goodbye when you come to oxford again come and see me i must crawl under the sofa now what for asked bob for thucydides of course replied mr bunting and when bob was in the train for london he turned very pale good heavens he said how do i know it isnt this bunting after all chapter xix after this things by no means cleared up as they should have done considering the amount of trouble that all the world took to find out the truth every one said something different from some one else bob gave horribly imaginative accounts of his adventures at oxford and threw out suggestions that pen was really married to a bunting if not to timothy bunting but when he appealed for corroboration to gordon that gentleman shuffled and prevaricated dreadfully as he did not like to acknowledge he had been thrown downstairs there was a very curious scene in which gordon and bob had the best part of a row before titania who came up to town to be near dr lumsden griff who knew all about the left or right ventricle of her heart as his jealous confreres said he knew nothing else perhaps he did however that is by the way tell it me again robert said titania bob told her again he said he was married to her he said he said so to mr plant and mr gordon and williams and de vere said bob gloating over the details of the row and he slung em all downstairs hes about six feet six high and as broad as a billiardtable and as strong as three sandows i should say i am much confused again said titania plaintively i had come to the point where certain news of her marriage to a groom would have been a relief to me where are we now as she asked gordon was announced bob rushed at him i say mr gordon tell us how he threw you downstairs and what he said he didnt throw me downstairs said gordon quite crossly i threw myself downi mean i slipped tell us how you slipped then and why said bob but gordon wouldnt oh i say said bob titania begged gordon to tell her but then he told me he had married pen she said to herself what is the use of asking any one anything how did you find him asked bob i looked him up said gordon why did you look him up because i wanted to find him out returned gordon sulkily but i didnt come to be crossexamined by you bob in spite of the large sums of money which gordon owed bob bob was on the point of an explosion but trouble was averted by plants entrance before he could say a word a telegram was brought to titania and she read it at once and uttered dismal groans what is it chorused the two men and bob its from penelope please read it out bob read it for his grandmother am exceedingly displeased with latest reports and news contradict at once am not married to bunting who is much upset by report and can hardly look me in the face penelope bunting is with her said titania which bunting asked bob hei mean the one at oxfordtold mr gordon and mr de vere that he was married to her gordon groaned and seizing his hat fled from the room he came back again where does the wire come from from spilsborough said bob granny i wonder if the bishop is in it gordon groaned and went and went a little too early for another wire came it was a very long one titania looked at the signature first and she sat up its from penelopes husband she cried who is he really shrieked bob its signed penelopes husband i mean said titania and he seems very unhappy the telegram read am in great distress penelope is furious because told you confidence that was married to her she has heard this and has learnt that others lying scoundrels said they were too she says their noble conduct saved her and will not speak at present though holding out hopes of reconciliation later to her and infant which is doing well if i say nothing and do not fight with others but do my duty which i find hard under peculiar circumstances hence am precluded from confirming what i told you and can only communicate anonymously as penelope threatens to have divorce or equivalent being headstrong as you are aware and i am in distress about it wire reply penelopes husband hes mad said titania how can i wire reply to a man i know nothing of she turned to plant you told me in confidence mr plant did you send this plant turned all the colours of the rainbow yes he said desperately and he bolted from the room and the house and disappeared while bob gasped and titania nodded her head in a most aweinspiring manner get some telegraph forms she said and when bob brought them she dictated telegrams to all the horde in the diplomatic form of identic notes have received sad telegram signed penelopes husband recognize under painful circumstances he cannot reveal himself am much composed and have given up hope it appears it cannot be bunting though bunting is with her contradict this also the rumour that it is the rajah of jugpore titania goring send them she said and let me rest i presume that the right one will get it the only trouble is that six of the wrong ones will too goby will go insane said bob i know he will i cant see how this will end without murder and titania laughed dreadfully she laughed so queerly that doctor griff was sent for and refused to allow her to see de vere and goby and bramber and gordon and plant and williams and carew the last turned up first in a hansom cab with a large palette knife in his hand he had forgotten to put it down as hansom after hansom came up and discharged one furious lover after another at the steps of titanias town house it looked as if bobs foreseen murder would occur there and then it is possible that nothing but the timely arrival of bradstock saved london from the desirable news of a murder in high life and belgrave square he got hold of the men one by one and sent them away as they went a telegraph boy came to the house with another telegram addressed to titania i shall open this bob said bradstock it was another from pen have just learnt that you and others have been trying to discover my whereabouts if i am pursued i shall leave and go elsewhere this is final penelope from spilsborough bob said bradstock shes heard that i and goby and rivaulx and the others were there said bob do you think the bishop knows where she is i wouldnt trust a bishop said bradstock i daresay he does it is said that bishops steal elzevirs and umbrellas bob i think i shall go to spilsborough myself have you seen the evening papers bob bob had seen none of them some say now that she is married to jugpore and others say it is a morganatic marriage to the mediatized prince of bodenstrau oh i say pen will be mad cried bob isnt he a real bad un the very worst said bradstock and are you really going to spilsborough lord bradstock i really think so said bradstock i begin to think i must do something he stood pondering may i come with you bradstock declined the honour if i dont succeed you may go again if you like he said and that very afternoon he went to liverpool street and took the train for spilsborough to call on the bishop my dear bradstock i am delighted to see you said his lordship i presume you too have come here about penelope i have said bradstock every one does did young bob tell you all about the peculiar occurrences which took place here only lately they were quite remarkable bradstock agreed that they were remarkable a duel on the deans grass now who would have thought of that but a frenchman have you seen the marquis lately and that very agreeable financier the american i was much grieved not to be able to ask him to dinner owing to his sudden departure he showed considerable skill in grasping the essentials of the situation for when the marquis who was literally foaming at the mouth offered him the choice of swords in a violent but perfectly gentlemanly way he chose both of them and put them under his arm it is not every one who could have displayed such readiness in preventing violence one would not have expected it in an american for i understand disorder and disturbances leading to bloodshed are quite common even in washington i have frequently seen most bloodthirsty duels behind the capitol during the sessions of congress said bradstock gravely ah so i understand replied the bishop but is there no news of dear penelope come bishop let us be frank said bradstock have you no idea whom she has married the gentle bishop looked much surprised i my dear bradstock i havent the least idea but i gather that both the gentlemen i interrupted the other day claim to be her husband to say nothing of many others whom i have not yet set eyes on and you have no notion where she is the bishop lifted his hands i think she must be near this place he said i consider there can be no doubt of that owing to matters with which bob made me acquainted by the way i think this young bob a very remarkable boy bradstock so do i bishop said bradstock a very remarkable boy the dean who saw very little of him came to that conclusion he said he would be an ornament to the house of lords or the biggest young rip that ever disgraced it your dean must be a clever man said bradstock do not call him my dean replied the bishop he is the cathedrals dean and very difficult to handle however he is said to be clever and i dare say is clever especially about grass and a choir and things material but as i was going on to say i consider it quite easy to find out where penelope is provided we go about it skilfully i cannot but remember that i christened her and i still take an interest in her how do you propose to discover her whereabouts asked bradstock she sends telegrams from our spilsborough postoffice does she not yes said bradstock then some one should watch the postoffice for her messenger it seems probable that you would know him as she is not likely to confide in strangers who can say that the very man she has married does not send them that was easily disposed of for to bradstocks certain knowledge all the lovers were in town when the last wires came well i suggest you watch the postoffice said the bishop it is i opine a perfectly legitimate thing to do bradstock objected that she mightnt send any more for weeks a brilliant idea struck the bishop send her one which requires an answer bradstock where to asked bradstock tut tut said the bishop how foolish of me stay i have it put something in the times which requires an answer i will said bradstock and send for young bob to watch said the bishop it is time that this scandal was stopped i am exceedingly grieved with penelope for getting married in a registrars office i will offer to marry her all over again in this very cathedral and now you shall come and have lunch and i will show you the swords given me by the marquis after lunch and an inspection of the trophies in the diningroom bradstock and the bishop drafted an advertisement for the times imploring pen to telegraph to bradstock saying how she was as there was a rumour afloat that she didnt feel well this was sent by wire to town and was accompanied in its flight by one to bob asking him to come up in a motorcar at once i think said the bishop that i should like to go in a motorcar there must be something delightful in speeding through the country feeling that steel and petrol do not suffer any of the strain that comes on horses i shall ask young bob to take me out he will be delighted said bradstock im sure he will be delighted they say he is an enterprising driver for his youth i love enterprise murmured the bishop i am surprised now to think of my own i entered the church meaning to be a bishop and i am a bishop i love enterprise all curates seem full of it deans i regret to say are seldom vigorously enterprising archdeacons too have a tendency to take things easily too easily what do you think of the higher criticism asked bradstock ha said the bishop ha i thinkoh i think a great deal of it that is i think of it a great deal i do not think all enterprise is praiseworthy would you like to know the dean they spent the afternoon in the deans cathedral and walked on the deans grass and about six oclock bob rolled into the cathedral close in a fifteenhorsepower daimler and drew up in front of the bishops palace have you found her out he demanded eagerly of bradstock no but you shall said bradstock chapter xx the bishop was very kind and amiable to bob some people say that bishops are always kind and good to people who will be dukes by and by one never knows what a duke can do for one later and of course a bishop wants to be an archbishop that is only natural even a cardinal wants to be pope although he almost always says he is sorry he became one when he finds himself at the end of his tether the bishop was a human being but a nice one and he really liked bob who suggested youth and strength and the future all of them agreeable things to those who are not young and see their future behind them so he talked to bob almost as if he was one of the bench of bishops he was familiar and jovial and told some good stories of other bishops and even one of an archbishop and he suggested to bob that he rather wanted to see what a motorcar was like there is a prejudice against them here said the bishop perhaps a natural prejudice among those who own chickens and dogs and children but providence works in a mysterious way and i should be the last to hasten to blame even the gentleman known as a road hog i begin to perceive an unwonted sprightliness in the villagers as the elimination of the unfit the rheumatic the undecided and the foolish proceeds apace a young man who told me that he had in the course of his career as an owner of cars killed nearly a thousand dogs two thousand five hundred fowls several aged persons some idiots and a policeman said that he noticed nowadays an air of bright alertness in his immediate neighbourhood which was at once a pleasure and an encouragement he asserted that the dogs who remained were of a higher type of intellect than the others and he said that even the fowls now stood sideways in the road and used their natural advantage of looking both ways at once there was too a great improvement in village children and even in policemen oh yes i think much may be said for the motorcar i should very much like to take you out in one my lord said bob the bishop smiled graciously you shall my boy as soon as this matter of penelope is settled i shall greatly enjoy passing rapidly through the country i think of buying one for purposes of my pastoral visitations perhaps i may wake up some of my more somnolent clergy i may even raise their general intellectual average which is low really low bobs chauffeur put up at the angel but bob himself had a bed in the palace and dined in state with the bishop and bradstock they discussed penelope all dinnertime even before ridley for as the bishop explained ridley took no interest in anything whatever but wine i believe said the bishop with a chuckle that i might venture in his presence to advocate the disestablishment of the church or to give vent to heretical or even atheistical sentiments without his being aware that i was doing anything surprising improper or unusual by all means let us talk before ridley how do you think bob should proceed bradstock he must stay in his car near but not too near the postoffice said bradstock if bob is properly goggled this george smith whom we suppose to bring pens letters and telegrams will not notice him shall you know him bob rather said bob he walks very queerly i could tell him a mile off very well then bradstock continued when he goes you will follow him at a distance he must not be lost sight of i much underrate our young friends enterprise if he loses him said the bishop there are occasions when exceeding the legal limit becomes a duty bob rather said bob oh ill do it they calculated that the times would reach pen about noon as they believed she must be within twenty miles of spilsborough bob accordingly arranged to take up his watch at the postoffice before one oclock and perhaps tomorrow night the mystery will be solved said the bishop it is really remarkable i am not at all able to follow penelopes mind bob explained it to him they ragged her he saidby they meaning titania and othersand she loves peace and hates showing off and shes as obstinate as a pig and grandmother said she was to be married in westminster abbey by a bishop and that put her back up oh pens easy to understand i think you have no idea whom she has really married asked the bishop not much said bob i give it up ive thought it was all of em and every one has done or said something that could be taken both ways i was sure it was goby and then i was certain it was bramber and then i fairly knew it was rivaulx and i could have sworn it was plant and im very much worried by what occurred at oxford this new bunting was very surprising the bishop had not heard of the new bunting and listened to bobs story with great interest the world is a very surprising place said the bishop with emphasis a very surprising place indeed we do not need to go to africa for new things we are surrounded by the unexpected by the marvellous bobs delightful story makes me feel that no one can reckon with certainty upon anything i am halfinclined to think that this new bunting must be a relation of the other bunting and that penelope has met him been struck with him and has married him and lives in temporary retirement while her husband struggles with thucydides under a sofa but after tomorrow we shall know more i hope so said bradstock i feel sure of it said the bishop and bob went to bed do you know bradstock said the bishop as he stroked his leg which was a very reasonable leg for a bishop i wonder you didnt think i had married penelope good heavens said bradstock have you certainly not replied the bishop but it is odd she should be near spilsborough isnt it she must be somewhere said bradstock rather irritably hang it the girl must be somewhere when you think of it she must said the bishop yes yes you are right still spilsboroughyes its odd but not remarkable as you say she must be somewhere i hope its not the jew bradstock so did bradstock it looks very much as if she was ashamed of him but im incapable of judging not having been married said the bishop ive been married twice said bradstock and pen is a woman which means she resembles no other woman in any respect whatever as regards her ways manners customs and thoughts you say that coolly asked the bishop icily replied bradstock the bishop shook his head you surprise me said the bishop and i think i will go to bed bradstock went to bed too i shouldnt be surprised if she had married the bishop and was under this roof now said bradstock nothing would surprise me unless i discover shes married to rivaulx or bramber i dont think i should mind either of em and next day at halfpast twelve bob and his chauffeur took up a position near the postoffice as geordie smith knew bradstock he kept quietly at the palace but the interested bishop who had not married penelope kept bustling about the neighbourhood in quite an excitement i wish i was coming with you bob oh do said bob i almost think it would be advisable said the bishop what i said would have weight with penelope i believe i rather wish youd come cried bob it would be fun and you said youd like to go in a motorcar so i did said the bishop but ive never been in one no one has seen me in one i fear a crowd would assemble at any rate my lord you might get in and sit down a minute the bishop looked around i really think i will he said and he entered the car this is really comfortable bob very comfortable quite like an armchair is your driver a good one a ripper said bob the best they have where i got the car its not mine but when i get all the money that gordon owes me ill buy one the chauffeur got down and did something inexplicable to the machinery with a spanner and the spanner broke ill just run across and get a new one sir said the chauffeur its getting late said bob dont be long and before you go start her up the driver set her going and the bishop caught hold of bob youre not off this is very surprising it makes a very curious noise there wont be any to speak of when we get her moving said bob you see the engine is going and when we like we can start at once he was happy bright and eager theres a motorcar coming whispered the bishop bob jumped i say its yellow like pens big new one he said and the car stopped in front of the postoffice ten yards away bob grabbed the bishops arm thats geordie smith he said thats geordie getting out i could tell his legs a mile off wheres my man but the man didnt come and geordie was back in his car he went off sweetly the north road said bob im sure hell take it hes going quick we cant wait for my man he grabbed the steeringwheel shifted the lever and the car moved off on the first speed illill go a little way with you said the bishop youll have to unless you jump replied bob ill keep in sight if i die for it this encouraged the bishop very much of course and it is possible that he might have jumped if he had not caught sight of the dean and a minor canon who were staring hard at him with their mouths as wide open as the grotesque muzzle of a gothic gargoyle ill not jump said the bishop and he waved his hand to mr dean no ill not jump before the dean if i die for it before he knew it they were out on the road and the dust of the yellow car in front was like the pillar of smoke to the hebrews in the desert bob let her out to the second speed and the bishop gasped we go very quick he said oh not at all replied bob i dont want to go fast if geordie thinks hes being followed hell go sixty miles an hour and i dont think i can do more than fortyfive in this cant you asked the bishop im almost glad you cant is this the great north road asked bob no said the bishop its the road to crowland and spalding ive often driven on it but never so fast as this geordies car drew ahead and bob put his car on the third speed bob cried the bishop as he clutched the sides of his seat bob yes isnt this an illegal speed rather said bob i cannot aid and abet you in going at it then said the bishop as firmly as he could i must request you to be legal bob kept his eyes ahead please dont talk he roared or i shall have an accident you must remember im not at all experienced what could the poor bishop do he groaned and sat very tight indeed and seeing the landscape eaten up by this monster at the rate of thirty miles an hour came to the conclusion that there was nothing stable in the universe not even theology and about a mile ahead of them rose a pillar of dust this is a remarkable situation thought the bishop a situation which requires some firmness of mind i am a bishop and i am no better than half my clergy who break the law regularly this must be nearly a hundred miles an hour i wish i almost wish penelope had died soon after i christened her this bob is an infernal young ruffian his manner is not respectful i should like to cane him but how can i stop him i do not understand these strange brass things i could as soon play the big organ in the cathedral that i wish i was in if i pull bob he will have an accident if i speak to him i may divert his attentionoh they executed a fowl which had not learnt to stand sideways and slammed through a village scattering several ancient inhabitants who were enjoying a gossip in the middle of the road as a matter of fact they were damning geordie smith in heaps when the pursuing bob fell upon them they passed a church and the bishop saw a clergyman staring over the wall the village fell into the category of things which had been and slid away behind them we are stopping still and the world slides said the bishop but that was griggs i know and he knew me he has eyes like a hawks i am much surprised at myself i have seventeen engagements this afternoon ridley will be alarmed the deanoh they slammed a barking dog into the middle of the week after next that was a near shave roared bob exulting ive seen a smaller dog than that capsize a bigger car than this may i speak now implored the bishop righto said bob heres a good straight bit what is it he was the superior he was a big bird and the bishop was a beetle he was the head master his lordship of the see of spilsborough was a new boy the bishop felt small terrified amazed humiliated are we going a hundred miles an hour asked the bishop rot said bob were only doing about thirty they scorched through quiet crowland please put me down implored the humble bishop i cant stop said bob im afraid hes getting ahead sit tight bishop im going faster now you mustnt you cant said the bishop bob stooped for an answer and turned on the fourth speed the bishop felt the machine sailing underneath him he fell back and lost all ordinary consciousness it is true said his mind deep inside him it is true that all things are illusion i have sometimes suspected it we are a mode of motion we are affections of the ether i believe professor osborne reynolds is right i am a kind of vortex spinning in piled grains of ether bob is a vortex we are in a vortex we are straws in ether we are shadows i have a real nonexistent pain in my real imaginary nonexistent stomach i am not alive and i am not dead i am brave i am a coward i am a bishop this is very wonderful i shall preach about it when i return to earth is that a hedge did i see a cowa strange elongated horned lowing permanent impermanent possibility of sensation and milk in a field made of matter which is energy which is an illusion i become calm motion is relative i almost enjoy it i become a hegelian i see that being equals nonbeing that pain becomes pleasure if you only have enough of it i no longer pity those who suffer sufficiently there is apparently too little pain in the universe torquemada did his best to remedy it oh was that a dog i quite enjoy myself i wonder if he can go faster if he can i wish he would we are going slow too slow and as geordies dust showed up much nearer bob put his car again at the third speed and the bishop gasped how do you like it asked bob as they spun through spalding the bishops face was a fine glowing crimson his bloodshot eyes glittered like opals he was intoxicated with movement and with new lights on philosophy ii should like to go a thousand miles an hour at night said the bishop i think it is wonderful bob are you bob and i a bishop where is spilsborough is there a spilsborough steady on said bob i say youre excited i am replied the bishop i am excited i feel peculiar i think i can originate a new philosophy why are we doing this we are trying to find out where penelope is said bob penelope penelope said the bishop penelope is a vortex yes she is a vortex men and women are vortices i shall study mathematics and apply it to theology hello said bob and he stopped almost dead for geordies dust had suddenly died down ill bet he has a puncture said bob and the bishop sighed and stared about him as if he were just awakened where are we he asked blessed if i know said bob but you ought to know i dont said the bishop and he got out and stood on the dusty road he reeled and the dean would have said he was intoxicated and so he was geordies off again said bob come jump in i wont said the bishop certainly i wont that machine is a kind of devil it undermines the strongest convictions i am afraid of it i shall have to resign my bishopric if i ride another mile oh rot said bob arent you coming i cant wait take the devilish thing away cried the bishop anathema maranatha and all the rest of it without another word bob pulled the lever and sailed off up the road leaving a trail of petrol vapour behind him mentally and physically i dont know where i am said the bishop i dont know who i am either from my clothes i conclude i am a bishop but to come to that conclusion i have to assume that i have the right to wear them i have had a remarkable experience yes i am a bishop this is the earth and very dusty it is hot and i am miles from anywhere he looked up the road and saw a far cloud of dust under that dust is bob said the bishop as i said penelope is a vortex everything is much more remarkable than i thought much more remarkable i shall write to the professor to discover what he means it is dreadful that what may be called a mere physical experience should incline me to look on some of my fellow bishops and the higher criticism with a more lenient eye i dont see how any dogma can survive a hundred miles an hour but bob has not treated me altogether well he plumps me down somewhere between spalding and spilsby or boston or some other dreadful locality under the ghostly influence of my brother of lincoln and disappears in dust and smell he was distinctly disrespectful he said sit down bishop in a very authoritative manner he told me i was excited i own i was but i resented being told so by a boy because he was a boy or was it because i am a bishop an unaccustomed bishop in a motorcar is plainly nobody compared with an experienced boy in one i wish penelope was a sensible person or that i had never known her or that she hadnt been born i wonder what i am to do i must walk i may be overtaken by a cart and get a ride in one i anticipate much talk in spilsborough about this i wonder what ridley will say ridley is a stoic perhaps he will say nothing i wish i was near ridley i am thirsty this road is dusty it also appears long and interminable i am as dry as convocation i much resent bobs treatment of me i wish bradstock was here and i was where bradstock is bradstock is in my library in my chair with a book in his hand and a whiskey and soda by his side he takes things with great calmness i wish he was here to take this with calmness and he walked south for three hours and got back to spalding and there took a train for spilsborough chapter xxi i dont think i quite understand the bishop said bob as he left the dignitary of the church stranded long miles from anywhere he looked very queer but i suppose theyre made bishops because they are queer unless its on account of their legs i can understand the gaiters but the apron licks me ill ask him about it some day but i wonder where we are and how much longer geordie will go on its luck ive had no puncture and no breakdown i thought it was all up when i sent that dog over the hedge he did fly i wonder whether any bobbies have spotted my number i dont care gordon owes me a lot of money by now whats thirtytwo times two thousand odd oh i cant remember im getting rather tired but he stuck to geordie like a burr to a sheep and between the two of them they stirred up more ancient peace and the haunts of it than any other two cars in the united kingdom they fairly bounded through sleepy old boston and a policeman waked up from sleep by geordie was wideawake enough by the time bob came through to call on him to stop i wouldnt stop for an army of policemen said bob recklessly i dont care ill catch geordie if i die for it gordon will pay my fines i wonder how the bishop is this is the spilsby road is it i wonder whether pens at spilsby will she be very cross with me oh that was a hen i do think hens shouldnt be allowed in a road a dog stood in the middle of the way and barked in the middle of his second bark the front wheel caught him he ended his bark in the ditch and was very dreamy about the whole affair for some time afterward that was a dog said bob i do think dogs shouldnt be allowed in a road he missed a horse by a hairbreadth a mile farther on and felt very cross he said horses shouldnt be allowed in a road he said the same of carts and of a carriage of children and agricultural labourers they were so slow for now geordie was going pretty fast and bob had to go on the fourth speed which is highly illegal and wicked and very dangerous he had never enjoyed himself so much before and he was undoubtedly the happiest boy in the three kingdoms geordie doesnt know im after him he said ill bet hes riding along easy that car of pens can go like lightning if he lets her out he will be mad when i come up and suddenly he perceived down a long white road that geordie was going more slowly this must be spilsby said bob he saw geordies dust go off at a right angle toward the right ive done it said the exultant boy we must be near pens now for to turn to the right in the neighbourhood of spilsby means to go toward the north sea bob ran into spilsby quite meekly on the second speed and turned after geordie a mile farther on bob saw a house in some trees and all of a sudden there was no more dust from geordies car bob pulled up in the middle of the road by jove ive done it i know said bob and now i feel a bit nervous i wonder what pen will say and whether her husband is there and what the kids like well heres for it she cant do more than eat me and he drove on till he came to the house which was an ivycovered building like a square barrack and would have been hideous without its creepers there was a moat around it and big elms hid it from a distance the gate was open and by the front door stood geordie and his car bob gave a viewhalloo and twisting through the gate came to a standstill alongside pens big yellow racer and penelope herself came to the door and saw not only geordie whom she recognized simply by the fact that he was in a car she knew but an undistinguishable stranger also oh said bob eh said geordie who said penelope and bob staggered out of his machine and fairly reeled when he stood upright he had no notion that no one not even titania could have recognized him he forgot his goggles and he forgot he was so dusty that one might have planted cabbages on his cheeks he did not know that he weighed several pounds more than usual owing to the amount of lincolnshire that he carried on him he had no idea that he was awful hideous a goggled dirty portent he smiled and the dirt cracked upon him and penelope shrank back oh i say pen are you mad with me he asked and penelope shrieked and ran to him and falling upon him embraced him with horrible results to her clothes oh bob bob is it you she cried its me right enough said bob i say can i have a drink im dying am i dusty yes so i am oh pen its come off on you i say i do want a drink its such a warm day and geordie would go so fast i followed geordie geordie looked horribly disgusted but neither pen nor bob paid the least attention to him followed up by a boy groaned geordie and in that thing he regarded the mean fifteenhorsepower concern with great contempt well im blessed oh come in bob dear bob said pen are you glad to see me oh ive been dying to see you upon your honour asked bob yes yes said penelope i want to ask you so much and ive got so much to say but tell me tell me quick does any one else know where i am bob shook dust out of his head not a soul unless its the bishop he replied what bishop the bishop of spilsborough replied bob i left him on the road oh gasped pen is he following you not much said bob he got scared and got out and wouldnt get in again and he talked such rot i thought he was mad for a bishop so i left him and suppose hes walking home again pen almost shook him but what was he doing with you he wanted to come part of the way in my car so i let him and he was awfully funky i dont think much of bishops if theyre all like him though he did stop plant and rivaulx fighting with swords in the cathedral fighting with swords oh what said penelope to be sure i forgot you very likely didnt know ill tell you by and by bradstocks at spilsborough wheres my drink pen i say did you hear of mr bunting at oxford that was fun he threw de vere out of the window and knocked carteret williams down with liddell and scott what mr bunting they thought he was timothy bunting but he wasnt i had tea with him afterward ill tell you by and by do you know grandmother had fits about it all penelope knew nothing or very little and as the results of her fatal conduct were thus revealed to her in dreadful incomplete chunks her heart almost failed her and she halfforgot her own terrible troubles am i mad or is bob she asked oh the bishop and guardy and duels and fits and mr bunting and windows and liddell and bob having tea she ran for a drink herself and poured it over bob in her eagerness for more news i say pen be careful that went down my neck said bob and outside it too i say whove you married tell me wheres the kid may i see it i say pen you look splendid but sad somehow and rather worried i feel better now i dont mind what went down outside ill have a bath soon wheres the kid they do talk a lot about it in town they say some of em that youve married the rajah of jugpore the little beast and that the baby is black or partly black is it i know it isnt oh oh said pen how horrible of them she rushed at the bell and when the servant came she commanded the instant appearance of the baby and the nurse you know they said you married timothy bunting said bob penelope flushed crimson it was wicked of them that beast weekes told granny you had she said she knew it thats how i had tea with mr bunting at oxford after hed chucked plant and gordon downstairs they were sick oh oh is this the kid pen took the precious infant in her arms and told the nurse she might go and have tea when she had disappeared pen burst into tears heshes all ive got she said sobbing bob started i say what do you mean you dont mean you arent married at all no no said penelope i meanoh its terrible oh baby i love you she kissed the baby who was certainly a very fine baby and wept again bob inspected the boy with great interest i say i rather think its like plant he said pen gasped but in this light its rather like gordon oh said penelope and its forehead is like de veres a little i say wont you tell me who youve married penelope hugged the baby and howled i cant i cant weve qquarrelled she said and hes furious and im ffurious with him why asked bob still inspecting the baby for signs of his male parentage why oh i say sideways he reminds me of williams and rivaulx and upside down hes a little like carew and goby but why have you quarrelled pen pen explained with tears how it had happened you see i said he wasnt to tell she said and he went to your grandmother and told so did all the rest said bob and that was where granny got very confused i listened i know it was a sneak thing to do but i was thinking of your interests and she said to the last of em i know youve come to say youve married dear penelope it was very pathetic pen i never thought granny could be pathetic before she usually makes me pathetic instead or she used to but was he one of em he was sniffed pen and he broke his solemn oath the others were noble i sent them telegrams to say they were noble thats why they all went to spilsborough where you sent the telegrams from said bob and thats why plant and rivaulx fought with swords under the cathedral till the bishop and the dean stopped them i tell you the dean was mad oh dear dear said penelope i wish they wouldnt did they hurt each other not much i think replied bob i didnt see any blood but when i told em youd married timothy bunting rivaulx lay on the grass and tried to bite it and howled dreadfully poor marquis said pen but why did you tell them so dreadful a story bob shook his head im sorry pen but i believed it weekes said she knew and granny had fits theres something about fits that makes you believe almost anything but you havent told me who it is i say with the light sideways on that baby he reminds me of bramber but who is it weve pparted said penelope he came and said hed told and i was very ffurious and we had a rrow and he was so cross and mad because without me he couldnt prove it for we were married in other names and i wrote my name in another handwriting and i said i would deny it and he flew into a passion and into a motorcar and went away and ive only my ppride and bbaby left and im so sorry for every one and how did you find me bob told her how he had done it and told her of bradstocks advertisement and told her about the bishop and more about mr bunting of all saints oxford who was the strongest man he had ever seen carteret williams was nothing in his hands and now ive told you everything wont you tell me who it is no said poor penelope it would humiliate me to tell now and i wont but they must know here said bob only three replied penelope miss mackarness and geordie smith and timothy and timothy was so unhappy when he heard he had married me that i sent him away to upwell where there are more horses but hes back now and miss mackarness and geordie smith have sworn not to tell and i expect you not to ask them bob snorted a little at this oh all right but i shall have to say where you are when i go back to spilsborough oh you wont said pen i must said bob bradstock is terribly worried about it now and thinks youve treated him badly and the bishop is very curious and he asks questions in a way that its difficult not to answer somehow and besides theres granny and all the rest i say do you know gordon has been speculating for me and has made seventy thousand pounds for me you dont say so cried pen i think it must be gordon said bob when the shadows on that kid he looks rather like gordon if you can think of gordon as a baby which is hard but when im a duke i shall rebuild goring and pay off some of the mortgages whoever youve married im very grateful to you pen about gordon and de vere de vere bought the spotted dog i told you of i found goby weeping with ethel that made me think it wasnt him but now you say youve quarrelled with him im not sure again i say im very sleepy may i stay tonight of course said penelope and then a brilliant idea struck her bob you do love me dont you what rot of course said bob then stay here altogether for a time said pen by jove what fun cried bob ill send em a wire and i will can geordie go somewhere else but spilsborough and send one certainly said penelope and it was arranged that geordie should go to lincoln to send it from there this is the telegram bob sent to lord bradstock i have found penelope she wont say who it is because she has quarrelled with him and she wont let me come back yet i will take care of her tell grandmother and guthrie she quarrelled with him because he said he was married to her but the baby is not black and bradstock swore the bishop was too tired to swear perhaps but he was very cross so were all the others including her husband chapter xxii they had relied greatly upon bob the bishop though rather bitter on the subject of bob tried to be fair to him and said he was a very promising boy i think it most remarkable said his lordship when his fine but tired legs were beneath the mahogany once more that he should be able to drive these dreadful machines with such skill he missed a great many things that he might have hit but as he said he boosted one dog over a hedge in a most skilful way he said boosted a very peculiar word i must write to doctor murray about it but i do not think he has been brought up with care he was not altogether respectful to me bradstock i much regret it said bradstock but what can you expect at goring on the whole his manners are not so bad perhaps you annoyed him he does not like being annoyed indeed said the bishop indeed well i may have worried him in a way that i do not quite understand but i have to own that for a boy to put his hand on my shoulder and say sit down bishop in a most authoritative way made me a little cross and when i refused to enter the motorcar again i think he might have given me more time to reflect on the fact that i was a very long way from anywhere he was very short and peremptory with me it was most curious and i regret i did not go on with him for i am extremely anxious to put an end to this scandal one never knows what will happen the duel in the moonlight under the cathedral was most remarkable i wonder when bob will return so do i said bradstock drily why do you say so in that tone asked the bishop because i doubt whether he will return at all if he finds penelope replied bradstock good heavens cried the bishop but he went for the very purpose of discovering her you dont know pen said bradstock and he worships her if she doesnt want to be discovered she will keep him i am certain of it this showed that bradstock though a silent peer was a very sensible one the bishop frowned and smote the table i shall be extremely angry with bob if you turn out to be right he said firmly i shall be extremely angry with him much he will care about that said bradstock you ought to have gone on with him i believe i ought to have done so yes you are right bradstock it was an error of judgment i was a coward i was afraid to die i did not like the idea of being boosted over a hedge i am ashamed of myself never mind said bradstock consolingly i have seen heroes quail in a motorcar i myself have quailed in one the bishop shook his head nevertheless i blame myself i ought not to have been afraid even though i felt peculiar and unwonted sensations in my gaiters he murmured he smote the table again i will make amends bradstock i will devote myself to the task of finding penelope at any speed that is necessary i cannot quite reconcile myself to the notion that i am a coward i will find her if bob deceives us you cant said bradstock rather gloomily i can i will said the bishop i will use my brains it was a happy thought the bishop mused there was a knock at the outer door it was a double a telegraphic knock from the duchess asked the bishop from bob or i am a bishop said the peer and ridley gave him a telegram bradstock read it slowly lifted his eyebrows rubbed his handsome white head and handed it to the bishop from bob bishop a very remarkable bobbish document the bishop read it it certainly is a remarkable document a very remarkable document indeed said his lordship i see it was handed in at lincoln she wont say who it is because she has quarrelled with him with her husband that is to say she will not let bob come back she quarrelled with him because he said he was married to her very remarkable somewhat confusing but it is a relief to hear that the baby is not black bradstock bradstock was pessimistic it may be halfblack he said mournfully which half asked the bishop with alarm if it is i hope it will not be the top half absurd said bradstock i mean it may be dun or yellowish let us trust not replied the bishop i am inclined to think bob would have said it was not very black if it had been at all coloured i think we may dismiss the jugpore legend i trust we may said bradstock i have an idea said the bishop i have a luminous idea let us go to the library they adjourned to the library and bradstock lighted a cigar what is your idea he asked i will tell you in a few minutes said the bishop as he laid a big atlas upon his table bradstock watched him curiously the bishop opened the atlas and laid a flat ruler on it he shifted it once or twice nodded his head said ah and nodded it again i believe i have it said the bishop it will be worth trying at any rate what is it asked bradstock come and look at the atlas said the bishop and bradstock did as he was asked the bishop put his fingertips together and began bob was following this person named smith and went north did he not let us say north i believe it is technically north by east he put me out or to be fair even to bob i got out and was asked to return very casually north of spalding in the boston road miles from anywhere this smith was going back to penelope for while bob and i were away you got her telegram dated spilsborough sent to london and retelegraphed to you here saying that she was well in reply to your times advertisement obviously penelope lives somewhere north of the spot where bob left me without time for argument do you follow me certainly said bradstock it is all as clear as quaternions now we get this very remarkable document from lincoln we do bishop it is obvious she doesnt live at lincoln she has sent this very fast smith there to send off bobs telegram is that not so of course said bradstock let us imagine that lincoln is nearly as far from where she is as spilsborough is let us imagine it said bradstock i am willing to imagine it what conclusion do you draw asked the bishop bradstock shook his head really bradstock said the bishop i am surprised at you if she is between spalding and lough as im sure she is an equal distance from her to lincoln and from her to spilsborough would place her about boston or perhaps farther north now if on inquiry we find she is not near boston she must be near a decent road fit for motorcars to lincoln do you follow me i do said bradstock then if she is not near boston where is she bradstock studied the map i should say burgh or warnfleet or spilsby right said the bishop i am almost sure of it for if she had been farther north she would not have chosen spilsborough to telegraph from in the first instance what do you say to that i say that i am not surprised that you are a bishop though i may wonder why you are in the church said bradstock what do you mean by that bradstock asked his lordship nothing nothing at all replied bradstock hastily i agree with you what shall we do the bishop eyed him a little doubtfully but returned to his muttons i want to bowl out bob he said a bishop is a human being after all thought bradstock he might have reasoned with me said the bishop i am quite free the day after tomorrow and we will go to boston and make inquiries if they fail we will try warnfleet and spilsby and burgh we will said bradstock i think this idea of yours exceedingly clever bishop you do certain i do i forgive your recent gibe said the bishop it was clearer than quaternions to me and much clearer than bobs rudeness which i continue to find inexplicable and now i think the duchess should be informed of his telegram it will console her i am sure to learn that this fatherless infant is not black not very black insisted bradstock and the bishop sent a wire to titania saying that bob had disappeared into space but had telegraphed saying that he had found penelope with a normal infant after all he only said it wasnt black sighed bradstock but the bishop would not listen to him so he went out and sent a wire to titania himself i should like to make bob black and blue the bishop said for his legs still ached chapter xxiii next morning the bishop had an hysteric telegram from titania it was obscure and of great length do not understand anything but have hopes your telegram arrived before augustins you say normal he says roberts words do not convey anything but negation of extreme blackness jugpore going back to india owing to scandalous conduct at musichall india office furious secretary of state in bed rumour now affirms infant not penelopes says adopted have just seen plant and gordon and carteret williams and expect the others they say they knew it all the time say they gave her the infant am confused but hope you and augustin will clear up details and find penelope am exceedingly vexed with robert de vere has just come weeps but seems pleased bramber wires wishes to see me but father is ill at pulborough doctors three giving up hope goby just left will come to spilsborough myself today if doctor permits owing to palpitations keep me informed dear me said the bishop this seems quite a new development a very surprising one but i am sorry to see bradstock that you sent another telegram without consulting me i didnt want you to give her too much hope replied bradstock you were so certain your telegram was not logical what is not black is not necessarily white for notblack may be green or blue or magenta you are a pessimist said the bishop however i forgive you what surprises me is this adoption story i dont believe it bradstock was fractious well i dont know bishop she always said if she had none of her own she would adopt one nonsense said the bishop it is not nonsense said bradstock why dont you say they are twins demanded the bishop what are twins it said the bishop really bradstock dont you see you are unreasonable you will believe anything and this from a bishop murmured bradstock why should i say it was twins if she adopted one she might adopt two said the bishop that is ridiculous i never heard of twins being adopted cried bradstock besides bob says the baby well well said the bishop do not let us argue passionately about a detail i do not see that twins can be called a detail said bradstock crossly very well call them what you like said the bishop hastily but i expect the duchess will be here any moment bradstock said he shouldnt wonder if she was she will insist on coming with us tomorrow he said the bishop started bradstock we will go today i will put off my business and go at once the duchess is a remarkable woman but she talks too much and such was his lordships energy that they started by train for boston in less than half an hour i rather enjoy this said the bishop this is an unusual event in a life like mine bradstock i wonder whether we shall succeed and i wonder what the young rascal will say when he sees me he will be rather abashed i fancy do you fancy that asked bradstock is imagination necessary by the way for the clerical or episcopal life it is highly necessary but rare said the bishop so i should imagine said bradstock what do you mean by that asked the bishop a little warmly bradstock said he meant nothing by it except that he was glad it was necessary nevertheless the bishop looked at him sternly for some minutes and he felt rather uncomfortable i should not be surprised if titania was now at the palace he said to change the conversation ridley and my housekeeper must deal with her said the bishop ridley deals with every one calmly kings and curates come equally and easily within his powers ridley may most distinctly be called an adequate butler he will offer her my best spare bedroom or arrange for her sojourn at the grand i do not believe an archbishop in a fit would throw ridley off his balance i rather wondered whether it would disturb him to see me come in with two duellingswords under my arm upon that memorable occasion of the duel but ridley was as calm asas an adequate butler i rejoice in ridley if we fail today i think i will ask his advice he is a sound and solid thinker i hardly think i should have been a bishop today but for ridley when i was a vicar of st marys at ray pogis he came to me then deeply engaged in smashing harnack into dust and said sir the prime minister is staying at pogis house i knew if he was at pogis house he would attend new pogis church the incumbent at new pogis was one of those men whom it would require much courage to make an archdeacon of and he was under great obligations to me i spoke to him he fell ill most opportunely i preached a sermon which had every appearance of spontaneity though i had spent months upon it keeping it by me for some such occasion as it dealt with the duties of men in high position and three months later i was offered spilsborough but for ridley i might still be a vicar this i believe bradstock is boston they left the train and began to make inquiries just about the time that ridley was dealing with the duchess he knew all about her all about the duke all about penelope all about bradstock and all about the horde he had read all the telegrams those which were sent and those which he had picked out of the bishops wastepaper basket yes your grace said ridley his lordship the bishop was called away early with lord bradstock on important business he wrote a letter which his lordship has probably taken away in his pocket and desired me to ask your grace whether you would prefer to stay here or at the grand the grand is comfortable but this is quiet i will stay here said the duchess i should like to lie down at once and when she was comfortable ridley crossexamined her maid about everything and was soon on firm ground you may rely on his lordship said ridley with me at his back he will be an archbishop yet no certainly not the baby is not black if his lordship says so but they do say shes not married and it isnt hers said the ladys maid shaking her head they say now that she has adopted it when i hear of young ladies adopting infants in obscure parts of the country i know what to think said ridley lord mr ridley but i cant believe it of her urged the maid i am alleging nothing against her young ladyship said ridley she states it is hers i said that if she stated that she had adopted it i should know what to think when she states it i will tell you what i think and in the meantime i may say that i expect every one connected with this unseemly business to be here shortly i am a man of some discernment this adoption rumour will encourage these poor gentlemen who are all mad and they will follow her grace here or i am a mere footman in a poor family and my names not ridley it apparently was ridley for there was a very loud knock at the door mr ridley will you see this gentleman said the footman handing the butler a card on which was engraved the name of leopold norfolk gordon he seems very excited i think hes a jew a jew said ridley by the looks of im a jew said the footman and her graces maid gave them a few details of mr gordons career oh yes of course said ridley i remember let him wait johnson he can wait in the little room as a christian i confess to feeling bitter against jews especially as i once borrowed money from one this is a very nice one though said the ladys maid and mr robert is quite fond of him i cannot stomach the idea said ridley i thought better of the boy but i suppose i must see what he wants though i can guess he interviewed gordon in the little room i want to see his lordship the bishop said gordon his lordship the bishop is absent on important business sir said ridley he added to himself as the butler of a christian bishop i object to calling him sir but as a butler in the habstract i must where has he gone asked gordon do you know he has gone to look for her young ladyship sir ah i guessed it with lord bradstock yes sir with his lordship which way has he gone i dont think sir that i should be justified in mentioning which way sir said ridley oh yes you would said gordon he put his hand in his pocket i do not think so sir at least i have doubts said ridley with modified firmness gordon took out a sovereign and scratched his nose with it which way boston way said ridley thank you sir but i do not think you can find him or catch him could i assist you in any manner sir things are mixed sir have you heard the news that mr robert sent what news asked gordon i ardly think i should be justified in repeating it sir said ridley oh yes you would said gordon as he put his hand in his pocket and ridley told him all about everything gordon knew very little beyond the fact that bob had sent a telegram to bradstock who had sent it to the duchess who had published it on the wires that the infant was not black and of course he knew the fresh london rumour that penelope had adopted it her grace the duchess of goring is now in the palace sir said ridley and between you and me sir i should not be surprised if all the other gentlemen came i suppose you heard of the duel sir what duel asked gordon i do not think i should be justified in saying which duel sir said ridley oh yes you would said gordon thinking that a christian butler was a very expensive person to deal with and ridley told him youll send me word to the grand when his lordship comes back said gordon i should hardly be of course you would be said gordon very well i will sir said ridley gordon went back to the hotel and ridley went back to the others hes not at all bad for a jew he said contemplatively not at all bad i only hope that the christian gentlemen whom i expect every moment will be as reasonable before the evening was over he interviewed with varying results mr rufus q plant mr de vere captain goby and mr carteret williams he knew that lord bramber couldnt come on account of the illness of the earl and he heard that carew was down with influenza and delirious on the subject of penelope he told the others what he thought of them all mr plant is a man i should like to meet often said ridley i have heard people say unpleasant things of americans it may be true that they know little of cathedrals i myself have heard an american speak of our best norman harches as vurry elegant gothic i have known one voluble with hadmiration of a beastly bit of late perpendiclar but a man may know little of harchitecture and be a very worthy person for all that this mr plant has ways that ive heard described as befitting a nobleman my own opinion is that very few noblemen have ideas befitting an american millionaire dukes are often mean earls also i am acquainted with one viscount who is viciously careful mr plant is a gentleman far above the others even above captain goby who has a generous mind mr williams is peculiar but for a poor man not mean his second cousin lord carteret when i knew him was as fine an openhanded swearing nobleman as one would wish to meet mr austin de vere is peculiar mad i think about dogs especially young mr robert told me he collected bulldogs he said it with a wink which i did not understand i wonder where his lordship is now his lordship the bishop and lord bradstock were both cross they had drawn boston blank and found it too late and too hot to go on to spilsby and waynfleet and burgh well said the bishop we have proved a certain amount she isnt at boston nor at windsor or manchester or bristol or plymouth said bradstock whose temper was rapidly going i am surprised at you said the bishop who felt it necessary not to be cross when bradstock was we have also proved that a yellow car comes through here very often mostly without disastrous results she is farther north we will go to spilsby tomorrow i think i think i will stay at home replied bradstock or at your place and ill read theology the bishop raised his eyebrows it will do you good if you can understand it he said a little tartly i do not expect to understand it said bradstock then why read it only to see if the theologians understand it replied bradstock it was quite evident that events were proving too much for bradstock it was also evident that bradstock was proving too much for the bishop as a layman you had better stick to paley said the bishop tartly but let us return to spilsborough i own my temper is a little touchy today bradstock bradstocks heart softened bishop i apologize for touching it he said penelope is rather too much for me she is too much for all of us i fear said the bishop they took the train for home and as they moved out of the station a man in the waterproof clothing of a chauffeur came on the platform he was not wearing goggles bishop said bradstock that man is geordie smith do you think he saw us how do i know i didnt ask how you could know i only asked what your opinion was said the bishop my opinion is worthless said bradstock dear me said the bishop blandly chapter xxiv england was excited and london was more excited still but spilsborough was the most excited of them all how it came out no one knew but the fact that the bishop was hunting for lady penelope brading who was married who was unmarried who had an infant which was black which was white which was adopted was blazed all over that quiet episcopal town dean briggs was very much annoyed for the cathedral was no longer the centre of interest in the place the clergy and the choir and the beadles and the tradesmen all discussed lady penelope they stood in knots and fought and wrangled and argued till they were metaphorically black in the face the lovers were pursued by gangs of boys who knew their names and expected them to fight when they met and followed them around in the hope of making a ring for them all the world was aware that the duchess was at the palace as a result every one called there who was on terms with the bishop it is not at all surprising that rumour ran fast east and west and south and north it is not every day that a quiet cathedral town is the centre of a vast social cyclone boston and spalding had their eyes on spilsborough boston knew that the bishop had made an unepiscopal visitation there with a whitehaired peer spilsby heard of it and was jealous spilsby talked of it and began to wonder who the young married lady at the moat house was spilsby wondered slowly in lincolnshire things move slowly lincolnshire is not fast folks there are rooted to the soil they consider matters firmly and stolidly and of course it has to be remembered that they belong to the see of lincoln and do not think very much of spilsborough spilsborough was all very well no doubt but lincoln was older and finer and much more wonderful nevertheless though the lincolnshire folks are slow they get there at last it was all very well for penelope to call herself mrs bramwell the spilsby people began to see through the matter in another month they would have solved the problem and would have given away the solution by calling mrs bramwell your ladyship but this was not to be for when geordie came back from boston he went to bob at once mr robert the gaff is pretty nigh blowed he said earnestly is it asked bob safe as houses said geordie ive my suspicions that the whole show is up the spout or very nigh up you dont say so said bob blimy but i do say it replied geordie i saw that gaitered josser the bishop at boston this very afternoon her ladyship will be spoofed and smelt out some one is givin the game away i dont trust that bishop no more do i said bob hes very mean geordie he encouraged me to follow you so that i could tell them where my cousin was bah said geordie and they call him a bishop her ladyship wishes not to be found out and she shant beby a bishop i own i dont understand her ladyships idea i do said bob suppose some one said you couldnt do something geordie a hundred miles an hour for instance geordie shook his head id show em and that you wouldnt after you said you would id show em repeated geordie and that you shouldnt shouldnt be damned beggin your pardon mr robert id show em thats my cousins idea said bob and a dashed good idea too said geordie i hate interferin folks worse than policemen id tell her ladyship about this here bishop and lord bradstock was with him sir the devil said bob and he ran to penelope bawling i say pen youll have to go he roared bursting into the room where pen was lamenting over her many griefs the bishop is after you geordies seen him and bradstock too and i feel quite certain that all of em will be at spilsborough now i wont go sniffed pen oh but you must said bob you cant be caught here now by the whole lot i dont seem to care said penelope oh what rot cried bob you wont break down now pen just in the middle of the game i mean in the middle of your idea just think how theyll crow over you and the baby that roused penelope theythey shant well they will unless youve got the one you are married to here said bob or are you going to tell me who it is pen snuffled sadly how can i when weve qquarrelled she demanded then well start at once said bob ill tell miss mackarness and tim and all of em and well get your car and mine and well go somewhere else but where asked pen what rot said bob youve got heaps of houses any of em that are deserted upwell castle will do so it will said penelope helplessly but we cant go today bob baby is always asleep at this hour cant it be tomorrow bob shook his head its very dangerous with the bishop on our track he said its very dangerous hes very determined except in motorcars in motorcars going fast hes not at all determined but out of em hes a terror id go today no no tomorrow said penelope weeping and bob went away i wish baker was here he said baker is quite as determined as the bishop and his advice would be very valuable i wish i knew how to treat gordon im afraid hell be angry if hes angry he may keep my money well i dont care he told miss mackarness to pack up and miss mackarness said she would miss mackarness remarked that the world was not what she had imagined it when she was young it had in fact come to an end she said she was not surprised at anything and never would be again she said she had never been in a motorcar but wanted to be in one because death seemed quick and easy in a motorcar she also said that if she escaped and lady penelope was killed she knew of a good opening in a lunatic asylum for a woman without nerves who could not be surprised and had been accustomed to the ways of the highest society oh yes yes well be ready said miss mackarness and bob went away to instruct geordie and timothy bunting and he spent the whole afternoon covered with dirty oil dancing about the two motorcars while geordie put them into firstclass trim we aint going to be run to ground by a bishop said bob not much we aint sir said tim id sooner go in one of these machines so i would it was the first time he had ever said as much and geordie paid him a compliment from under the car thats the first sensible remark ive ever heard you make tim said the concealed chauffeur thank you said timothy i always said you were a good chap geordie even if you was wrapped up in muck and grease and an idea came to bob i know what ill do about gordon he said ill write something about this now sos to show it him afterward he wrote pen is very sad i fear she has quarrelled with gordon im sure she has married gordon i wish she would let me send to him to come but she has sworn me not to i think the baby is very like gordon it is clever like him only being younger not so clever i dont mind if it is gordon gordon has been very kind to me knowing how poor the family is i wish i was as clever as he is he read it over carefully hes more jealous of rivaulx than any one ill put something in about him he added i think rivaulx an ass because of balloons that will please gordon said bob as he stowed his notebook away but i do wish i knew who it is women are very fond of secrets they seem to like babies and secrets best pen likes both together and its very confusing to any one they started next morning in the two cars for upwell castle taking the whole household bob installed an old villager and his wife as caretakers he had selected them himself on the ground that they seemed the stupidest people in the village bob was very clever if not so clever as gordon i think weve spoofed em pen said bob penelope hugged her baby and wept why are you crying asked bob i dont know said penelope then dont said bob it makes me very uncomfortable they devoured space and timothy held on to the car and to miss mackarness miss mackarness said it altered her ideas tim said it didnt but then he was very conservative now let em all come said bob chapter xxv titania fell on bradstocks neck when he came back with the bishop she very nearly fell on the bishops neck too which alarmed him very much indeed though he had all that confidence with women which marks the celibate clergy especially when they are beautiful my dearr augustin said titania i came at once i felt i had to i felt i must there is no sympathy at home for me in my troubles the duke laughs laughs in my face and says penelope is damn fine sport tut tut said the bishop who was loath to think that dukes could use bad language i very much regret to hear it titania waved her hands at large but i do not care i am wrapped up in woe and in robert where is he show me the telegram he sent they showed her the telegram not black oh augustin that might mean anything so it might what did i say bishop asked augustin nonsense said the bishop i do not believe it is even dark this is all waste of time time cannot now be wasted this scandal grows ridley tells me all these unfortunate gentlemen but lord bramber and mr carew are in the town i have had telegrams from both of those asking for information most excited telegrams mr carew says he is delirious with fever and i believe him lord bramber says his father is delirious which i much regret i think the son is also delirious though he does not say he is he implores me to remember that he is entitled to know first where penelope is as he is her husband this is the telegram augustin and titania read it if we could only believe it said titania we cannot said the bishop ridley declares they all say the same they also say the infant is an adopted one i do not remember in the course of all that wide experience which comes to a country clergyman in a place like ray pogis any situation equal to this as a bishop with a wider experience i have seen nothing so absurd even in the conduct of my clergy who are indeed hard to beat in stupidity i regret we did not go on to waynfleet and spilsby bradstock so do i said bradstock eyeing titania we will go tomorrow said the bishop i have an intuition that tomorrow we shall find her i feel sure of it i will come with you said titania i must i must i cannot help fearing augustin that the very worst may have happened i have now no confidence whatever in dear misguided penelopes morals i do not feel sure that the child is not black or that it is adopted good heavens said augustin good heavens echoed the bishop i havent affirmed titania dreadfully no such thing has happened in our family since the time of charles the second which was lamentable but natural and has long since been forgiven i mistrust the general attitude of all these men bishop i mistrust it certainly they seem in great distress said the bishop titania rose and looked awful only upon one supposition can i account for it bishop this is their remorse they are remorseful they have treated her badly and she has fled from them in her shame and will not see them ha said the bishop there is something in that a great deal in it boomed titania in her deepest tone of tragedy it explains everything but bradstock said infernal nonsense titania bishop i am surprised at you they cant all be remorseful why not demanded titania why not augustin of course not interjected the bishop hastily why not i ask repeated the duchess oh well you know said bradstock when you come to think of it wouldnt one be enough to be remorseful for having behaved like a scoundrel the duchess collapsed dear me so it would she said weakly now i come to think of it one would be sufficient nothing is explained or can be explained till we find penelope the same feeling of desperation inspired the lovers in the various hotels their hopeless passion grew upon them the sense of mystery deepened they were sorry for penelope for the others for themselves what did she mean by it they were all agreed now about the adoption theory though they stuck to it manfully that they were married to her each one believed the infant was adopted while he nobly claimed it as his own they were really noble creatures and showed themselves worthy of a better fate a peculiar feeling of sympathy grew up among them as it does among the unfortunate who are yet strong enough not to be overwhelmed they spoke to each other again goby took de veres arm and walked about with him i wish i could tell you all the truth old chap sighed goby ah so do i said the poet a great passion is a wonderful thing goby so it is old chap said goby do you remember the happy days we spent in your home when we read browning and shelley together and you explained your poems to me austin de vere sighed ah they were happy days when my nose peeled on the water and my hands were blistered by rowing do you remember the bulldog asked goby ah and the terrier he bit and the howling retriever and the bald bronchitic borzois said de vere with enthusiasm i bought them all of bob because she loved him i didnt like you then austin old chap said goby austin gripped his arm plantagenet we will be friends always now i can confess that i loathed you i told bradstock so i said you were an ass so i am said poor goby i admit now i cant understand browning austin looked about him my dear chap no more do i he said in an alarmed whisper hes a much overrated man i never overrated him myself said goby sagely look here austin you know of course that im married to penelope of course said austin and you know that i am well quarrel about nothing now tomorrow well look for her ridley the bishops butler told me bradstock and the bishop were going to spilsby tomorrow i gave him a sovereign so did i said austin lets go in to dinner im glad we are friends plantagenet so am i old chap said goby at a near table to them were rivaulx and gordon farther off plant was with carteret williams plant regretted that bramber wasnt there williams sighed for the artistic company of the delirious carew not one look of envy or hatred or malice passed between any of them marquis said gordon gloomily will you come tomorrow with me to find myi mean penelope i will my dear gordon replied the marquis to spilsby how did you know ridley the bishops man said it he told me too i gave him five pounds said gordon i gave him four ill bet hes told em all said gordon i say marquis those were jolly happy days before this misery came on when you and i dined together and went up in balloons said the marquis gordon shook his head well yes even the balloons do you know marquis i hated you then i dont now i think you a real good chap the marquis held out his hand and gordon shook it gordon i used to despise you it was a great trial to dine with you im glad i did it now im a wiser better man for the trials i see that jews can be noble by nature just as they can be barons by creation i finally absolve dreyfus i almost love you now good old marquis said gordon when we get up to town ill put you on the betht thing in the market i will so help me carteret williams and plant got on well together they talked first of bramber and carew carews all right said williams all right for an artist i was in the ashanti war with an artist once i put his head in a bucket of water why asked plant because he was too drunk to draw said williams he hated me when he got sober and caricatured me i never liked artists afterward but when penelope put me into harness with carew i found there was good stuff in him he could work he talked awful rot but there was something at the back of it i had to own it how did you get on with bramber i thought him a damn fool said plant but i found out he wasnt theres stuff in bramber myi mean penelope knew that i say as he isnt here poor chap will you come to spilsby with me tomorrow williams started how did you come to think of spilsby he asked suspiciously the bishops butler told me i gave him five pounds said plant i gave him two said williams yes ill go with you as carew isnt here i like carew now poor carew and i like bramber poor chap said plant and now ill go and shake hands with the marquis who wanted to kill me last time i was here i wish id seen that said williams simply i like seeing fights they spent a happy evening together and talked of bob austin was great upon bob and so was gordon austin told them all about the dogs goby spoke about the spavined pony he had bought gordon told them how bob had borrowed a hundred pounds of him to be put into something i owe him fifty thousand pounds at least said gordon the boy is a financier i wish i had a boy like bob and just then carew walked into the room he looked ill but was as handsome as paint williams jumped to his feet oh jimmy i heard you were delirious he said anxiously i was said jimmy very delirious extraordinarily so im not sure that im not delirious now he looked around the room anxiously and drew williams into a corner do you know anything about delirium he asked anxiously a lot about delirium tremens said williams most of the artists ive been with in africa had it they said it was malaria but have you been drinking carew shook his head not much but i see the room is full of em full of what things visions phantasms said jimmy creepily williams looked around in alarm you dont say so yes said jimmy this influenza is awful i could swear i see the marquis and gordon and that ass goby and de vere pull yourself together said williams theyre here all right are they real asked jimmy theyre not delusions devil a bit said williams oh said jimmy then i think ill have some brandy what are they doing here illustration jimmy carew ara he was the best looking of the whole horde what are we doing here asked williams were mad oh but jimmy im dashed glad to see you said williams with a lurid string of emphatic war expressions those were happy days when i learnt about art with you and you learnt about life with me they were said jimmy but now im almost sick of art williams implored him not to say so think of rembrandt and velasquez and whistler i cant think of them i think of penelope try to think of monet and manet said williams theyll do you good to be sure to be sure sighed jimmy ill try to they talked till two in the morning and the only man missing was bramber perhaps hes chucked it said williams the last time i saw him he looked sick enough to chuck anything but i suppose the old earl is so rocky he cant get away i hate earls said jimmy jealously he added with extraordinary irrelevance but im glad she adopted him no doubt he referred to the infant chapter xxvi while pen and bob and the baby were going as fast as they could toward upwell castle pen wept at intervals and hugged the child that all the horde were glad she had adopted my only darling said pen convulsively bob shook his head i say pen i really dont understand you you know i say this is rot you mustnt cry i cant stand it and you keep on saying its your only one in a very silly way you irritate me very much pen why bob asked the desolate creature at his side you could stop all this if you wanted to not now said pen since weve quarrelled rot said bob you tell me who it is and ill bring him along but im glad it isnt timothy you know timothy was now with geordie in the other car i cant tell you said pen then dont snivel please said bob crossly or i shall drive into something and kill the baby oh said pen oh please dont i think its very hard lines said bob especially as geordie and tim know and miss mackarness if they know i ought to i had to tell them bob besides they knew him said the incautious pen bobs eyebrows lifted and he drove rather fast down the next straight bit of road i say he said to himself i ought to make something of that he thought very hard and did not speak for a mile he thought all the more tim knows em all of course and geordie may though i remember his saying he didnt but who does miss mackarness know if i can spot that i can spot the winner he went back to the time of pens youth which he only knew by hearsay as he wasnt much more than born then and went through the list one by one by jove he said suddenly and penelope started yes bob no said bob thoughtfully no im not sure what arent you sure of dear him said bob and penelope sighed after another miles silence bob spoke again by jove you said that before cried pen irritably he turned his eyes upon her and she saw them full of strange intelligence oh what is it she asked in alarm bob shook his head youve told me who it is he said i havent you have said bob pen youre a wonder i say are all girls like you penelope said she didnt know and demanded his meaning if they are theyre interesting but trying said bob you couldnt have made more fuss about it if it had been bunting pen you are a wonder well i dont mind i like him well enough hes all right i hope bill will like him you are an annoying irritating boy said pen crossly and you know nothing bar him and miss mackarness and timothy and smith im the only one that does said bob drily i know you pen you were ashamed of him after all you used to say all right dont get angry im all right ill keep it dark till you say pull up the blinds its not my business but im glad i know for granny doesnt and no one has guessed not even baker and hes had great experience with girls in all parts of the world just as he has had with dogs pen wept you are saying all this to worry me how can you know she cried ill tell you some day said bob but because you havent told me yourself and have made me find out i wont tell you who it is till i want to but one thing ill say i dont think your brother bill really likes him he whistled and let the car out till she fairly hummed pen was exceedingly cross and hugged the baby hoping that they would both be killed at once i dont know whats going to happen she said ive done my best and nothing but trouble comes of it if i had to begin again i dont think id try to reform anything ii hate reform in the meantime miss mackarnesss ideas got sadly altered she did not mind dying at first but when bob really went fast it seemed to her that she loved life better than she thought if i am to die she said i would rather die in my bed much rather i want peace and my dear lady gives me none this young wretch is no better than a murderer he laughs i cant laugh i cant even speak the wind stops my screaming i want to get out and die quietly they pulled up close to a village to let a wagon loaded with long timbers get into a side road miss mackarness seized her chance and opening the door jumped to the ground if you please my lady im going no farther i will come on later in a cart penelope remonstrated with her bob was urgent and impatient we may be caught any minute he said pen let her come on in a cart if you prefer it said penelope my lady i much prefer it said the housekeeper bob let the car go and geordie coming on behind pulled up to interview miss mackarness sooner than go in one a mile farther she said firmly i would lie down and die thats silly maam said geordie i would rather live silly than die wise replied miss mackarness i may be used to much and past surprises but i cant stomach these cars they left her in the road and now they drove fast for bob set the pace and made it a rapid one i say geordie said timothy about twenty miles farther on dont you think you could go slower how can i with the other car ahead man demanded geordie well i feels queer inside said poor timothy id rather ride a bucking maneater than go another yard set me down not me said geordie be a man tim i wont said tim set me down ill walk or come on in a cart sneered geordie why mary here dont mind do you mary mary did mind but she adored geordie and said she didnt she preferred to die with geordie than to ride with miss mackarness in a cart i dont care said tim if mary wants to die in a blazin fiery mass of petrol under a wreck i dont let me down and geordie let him down a mad bull sooner said tim and though i ates walkin bein a groom id rather walk to hell than motor into paradise but peace was established in the cars by now geordie and mary sat side by side and whenever the pace was hot she grabbed him so tightly that he remonstrated my dear id rather you hugged me when we go slow he said at last lor mr smith i wasnt huggin you remonstrated the blushing mary to an outsider it would appear so said geordie when a young lady puts her arms around a mans neck it looks like huggin mind i dont say i object but i might run into the hedge what a very amusin gentleman you are said mary ive a very small opinion of mr bunting except upon an orse im surprised he preferred to walk im not said geordie i expected it and if we went really fast youd want to walk never said mary i love goin fast theres great potry in a motorcar mr smith poetry well maybe said geordie to my mind theres more machinery and oil i wonder what the next thing will be with my lady mary ah said mary thats more than i can say shes very sweet and kind but ive give up tryin to understand er and such an usband too if i ad an usband id like to show im off if i was proud of im and i would would you be asked geordie i ope so said mary i guess youd expect him to do what you wanted like my lady said geordie oh no never said mary id do hexactly as i was told by im i loved i dont believe in a woman angin on a man and tellin im to do this or that and just then a mighty fine stretch of road opened before them and bob half a mile in front turned his car loose at the top speed geordie put his on the third and mary squealed hush your row my dear said geordie why bless me whats the matter with the girl she had him tight by the neck oh im frightened mr smith dont go so fast she screamed lemme go gasped geordie whom she was nearly strangling lemme go girl never never said mary settling on him tighter still stop stop i wont said geordie dye think ill let that young un get away from me you must screamed mary or ill get out then get out said geordie rudely oh you cruel cruel mr smith wailed mary let me down before im killed geordie wrenched himself free dye mean it he asked yes you brute said mary i does mean it he put her down there and then youre no gentleman said mary i never said i was retorted geordie with his eyes on the vanishing bob and i hate you you coward sobbed mary theres a village a mile up the road said geordie and he left her disappearing in a whirlwind oh im a sad deslate disappinted jilted woman with thin shoes and three and tuppence in my pocket said mary and i dont know where i am she sat on a pile of road metal and cried bitterly she took it much harder than the bishop did in a similar situation well it cant be helped said geordie and i dont know that im sorry shed have proposed if id kept her at the second speed i know that so perhaps im well out of it he whirled after bob and his lady and soon caught them up there was peace on that car too for bob hadnt been able to keep his discovery to himself yes youre right bob sighed penelope but what could i do after what id said and what can i do now cheer up said bob ill fix it for you somehow do you know pen i begin to think that after all women arent as difficult to understand as baker says they came to upwell in the early afternoon and were ignorant that the world was on their track bob sent a telegram to mr bramwell as soon as they got there chapter xxvii the bishop was excited there is no doubt about it nor is it any wonder for the sporting element exists even on the episcopal bench and the hunting of penelope was peculiar and choice sport the clergy of his diocese were moderately tame and when he pointed his episcopal gun at them they said they would come down just as the celebrated squirrel did when colonel crockett raised his weapon not for a long time had he felt so pleased with himself he was quite certain that penelope was to be run to earth in the neighbourhood of spilsby and when he had found her he proposed to speak to her like a father i shall certainly suggest a religious ceremony in the cathedral he said blandly oh yes i shall insist on it youll do what asked bradstock who was with him and the duchess in the early train to spilsby youll do what the bishop rubbed his hands as the one who christened her i shall insist on a religious ceremony he replied will you asked bradstock to be sure i shall said the bishop did you ever hear of mrs partington asked bradstock or of king canute or of any other celebrated character in history or fiction whose insistence did not come off i scarcely understand you bradstock said the bishop with dignity i can hardly imagine that you mean to hint not altogether obscurely that lady penelope will treat any suggestion of mine with disrespect bradstock intimated that that was what he did mean and titania who had got up too early and felt like it said that she expected nothing from penelope now but the worst i dont know why i am here or why i am going there she said i cannot imagine why any of us are doing anything but hiding our disgraced heads in the remoter parts of the country while penelope flaunts a black adopted illegitimate child in some peculiar part of lincolnshire while she is being chased on motorcars by remorseful scoundrels of whom i saw about a dozen as we left spilsborough little did i think that i should be running after her with augustin and you bishop while the duke stays at goring saying she is sport and robert is with her when he ought to be at home with mr guthrie learning to spell and as a result of penelopes being away like this that disgraceful chloe cadwallader of whom i shall always have the lowest opinion is living in her house in piccadilly and i dare say spending her money right and left the marchioness said she knew on the highest authority that this was so the marchioness always goes on the principle of believing the worst though of course she hopes the best i hope the best for penelope but im sure the worst is before us im sure of it the bishop asked her to cheer up and augustin stroked her hand to calm her but nothing calmed or cheered her i am calm she said i am even peaceful what can be worse than the worst i am cheerful for i believe there is a better world than this in which even a duchess may find some kind of rest on the highest authority i shall be glad to go there and leave you all dont say so said augustin i do say so said the duchess i say it firmly and with faith you dont dare to deny there is a better world than this augustin certainly not in the presence of the bishop replied augustin though in looking out of the windows i should not be surprised to learn that there is a more exciting spot than spilsby for they had arrived i will make inquiries said the bishop while you look after the duchess in the waitingroom i see that my wishes have been attended to i telegraphed for a carriage to be in attendance and it is in attendance i will speak with the driver he spoke to the driver who was much intimidated by the apron and the gaiters of the clerical dignitary this is the carriage i ordered i think said the bishop i want to drive toto lady penelope bradings house do you know it no sir said the driver i never heard owt of it sir dear me dear me said the bishop well well but that is easily explicable my good man for my young friend is in the peculiar position of having several names this is rare yes rare i admit but not altogether so very rare can you tell me if there is any one lately come to this neighbourhood known let us say as mrsmrs plant for instance no sir there be not as i knows said the driver or mrs gordon shall i say the driver scratched his head i never heard of her he replied how remarkable said the bishop smiling but i am not surprised indeed in this last case i am almost gratified though i withhold my reasons for saying so are you then acquainted with any one called de vere no or with a mrs carteret williams light dawned in the drivers face at last mrs williams ay sure enif she do sell sweets and tobacco indeed said the bishop indeed how remarkable but i dont think she will do have you heard of a mrs rivaulx or a mrs goby perhaps i surprise you in this part of lincolnshire but in london it is not at all uncommon for married ladies to have several names not at all uncommon no sir i never heard o none of em returned the driver thinking that this gentleman talked most remarkable catblash good heavens said the bishop this new custom is trying do you then know a mrs carew or mrs bramber again the man scratched his head and shook it what did this strange person in gaiters mean oh ah he said at last there be a mrs bramwell at the moat house indeed said the bishop perhaps that may be the lady at the moat house do you know mr bramwell ive seen un said the driver what is he like asked the bishop is he fair or dark or tall or short hes fairish to dark and betwixt and between said the driver wishing to be accurate and mostly goes in big spectacles in his engine ha said the bishop we are on the scent and what is mrs bramwell like she do mostly go in the engine with specs on too sir but my wife do say she be a very fine woman the bishop nodded i think you may drive us to the moat house he said i will bring my friends out he rubbed his hands and congratulated himself on the skill with which he had discovered the object of his search i really believe i have found her he said when he entered the waitingroom i really believe it no said the duchess yes said the bishop by a series of skilful questions and the exercise of a little pardonable deceit i have learnt that there is a mrs bramwell here who is said to be a very fine woman and goes out in goggles in a motorcar with her husband who is fairish to dark and tall and short and also wears goggles augustin nodded this looks likesomething he said hopefully bramwell perhaps really bramber titania no no said titania i expect disaster i anticipate the jew or williams but bramwellthe first syllable being bram suggested the bishop i cannot build on bram said the duchess we are an unfortunate family lord bramber may be an earl at any minute and she has married a coalheaver of course let us go at once when they got into the carriage the bishop told the man to drive to the moat house did you say moat house asked the duchess i did replied the bishop augustin do you remember that penelopes mother loved houses with moats i think the bishop may be right i tremble with nervousness she had more reason to tremble in a moment for a big motorcar shaved them and scared the horse perhaps she cried no said augustin its plant and williams and carew the duchess gasped and before she could say another word another car swept by them perhaps she cried no said the bishop in spite of goggles i recognize the marquis and mr gordon and mr austin de vere this is very remarkable and not a little annoying we shall all descend upon penelope at once and i fear it will somewhat disturb her i should have much preferred to see her quietly in order to bring her to a just sense of her peculiar and our painful position when they got to the house they found all the lovers but bramber assembled at the gates if it hadnt been for the illness of the earl of pulborough he would have been there they knew oh which is it moaned titania they all said they were married to her and i know its none of em the bishop greeted the crowd in the most courteous manner he shook hands with those he knew and bowed to those he hoped to know i think gentleman that with your permission i will go in first and see lady penelope before any one else does and while he went up the carriage drive titania glared at the lovers dont look at em like that titania said augustin like what augustin like a gorgon titania said augustin i look as i feel said titania i hate them all i shall not be able to restrain myself when i see penelope i shall shake her i shall say what i think no i wont be wise augustin i decline to be wise i am full of bitterness from her earliest youth she has been a thorn and it is your fault you encouraged her in reform in anarchism dont speak to me i shall explode and augustin got out just as the bishop rang the doorbell across the moat instead of the kind of servant he expected to see he was greeted by a bent old woman whose chief glory was her rheumatism though her claim on bob had been her stupidity is mrs bramwell at home asked the bishop with a beaming smile naw said the old lady not beaming in the least no then when will she be back i dont know replied the caretaker you dont know will it be soon she never said snarled the old lady did she go early maybe an hour ago maybe two will she be back late eh im ard of earin will she be back late roared the bishop she didnt say what did she say then nothin as i knows of where did she go my good woman she didnt say dear me how vexing said the bishop im ard of earin i tell ye said the old dame who went with her all of em so i eard who were they asked the desperate bishop all as was ere there aint one left was a boy with her to be sure a young gentleman as fetched me ere and give me a shillin what was his name e didnt say said the old woman and the bishop wiped his fevered brow and tried again was mr bramwell with her i never seed un how did they go in two engines ha sighed the bishop in two motorcars likely will they be back tonight i ope not said the woman why do you hope not asked the wretched bishop because of fifteen bob a week to be sure then mrs bramwell has gone has left aint i been sayin so this last hour asked the exasperated old person me with rheumatics standin on cold stones for hours arglin that she and all have gone in engines good heavens said the bishop she has escaped she has eluded us she has kept her word and has fled this is remarkable it is annoying i feel nearer losing my temper than i have done with any one but the dean for the last ten years i must go back and tell them he went back to the gate is it they cried this is her house said the bishop who looked rather flushed but i have discovered by a series of skilfully devised questions that she is no longer here duchess lord bradstock marquis and gentlemen she went away this morning in two motorcars with all her household leaving behind her no one but a caretaker who in my humble opinion ought to be taken care of in an idiot asylum the duchess sighed then she has kept her word finding out that we are still pursuing her she has fled from us oh i think it wicked of her wicked to all of us when i get hold of robert i shall take steps to show him what i think of him do you give it up bishop the bishops eyes flashed with indignation never he said i propose that we pursue her at once she cannot have thought we should be here so soon if we find out which road she took we may yet overtake her in what asked bradstock with his hand on the ramshackle landau the duchess sat in in this conveyance for instance the bishop looked at the two big motorcars and at their wretched owners plant and rivaulx taking my courage in both hands he said bravely i propose that we lose no time i will go in this car with the marquis if he will take me the marquis said through his clenched teeth that he would bradstock you will escort the duchess back to spilsborough certainly not said the duchess i am coming too i must and i will whatever the condition of penelope may now be it is my duty i come with you and so do i said bradstock they packed themselves in the cars and moved away from the deserted house of the moat in the village they soon discovered that mrs bramwell had gone northwest by the road to horncastle and a moment later the bishop said oh as rivaulx fairly launched his car into space even bradstock in plants car said something and the duchess losing the repose which stamps all duchesses the moment they become duchesses uttered a scream gordon consoled the bishop being very much pleased to find himself with one by saying that he had been in a balloon with rivaulx and found him careful and very trustworthy i do not think any one who goes in a balloon gasped his lordship can properly be described by any such terms williams said he didnt care if he was killed as soon as penelope had acknowledged she was married to him gordon who was desperately scared of williams said nothing but gave the bishop to understand by signs that the war correspondent was mad carew who was still suffering from influenza sat in his corner and wept at intervals in plants car the duchess and goby and de vere got on admirably bradstock sat by plant and prepared to die the duchess held captain gobys hand de vere said some poetry before the speed was very great afterward he said his prayers and wished he was at home with his bulldogs what does anything matter he asked as he clutched gobys offside and all of a sudden rivaulxs motor pulled up so quickly that the bishop was nearly precipitated upon the road a scared oldish woman in respectable and subfreak garments had done her best to get run over rivaulx swore terrible french oaths and the bishop who knew french far better than he dared acknowledge except in a literary conversation on rabelais or argot sympathized with him in awestruck silence you accursed old lady why demanded rivaulx hush hush said the bishop and leaning from the car he said it is all right my good woman i hope we have not alarmed you miss mackarness said they had it was very hard to have got out of one car and then to be almost killed by another then the car behind came up and the duchess looked at the lady who had given her a little respite the duchess absolutely screamed again augustin it is miss mackarness i remember her well who the deuce is miss mackarness grumbled bradstock but titania paid no attention to him her eyes brightened she became clever all at once i remember she said i remember she called to the stranger in the road i am so pleased to see you again after such a long time miss mackarness she said kindly are you still at upwell castle im going there now maam said the housekeeper who didnt recognize her grace are you walking asked titania kindly it is a long way to walk you dont remember me i see no maam said miss mackarness i am the duchess of goring said titania oh your grace i beg your graces pardon but of course you are gasped miss mackarness and i am going to upwell now to see my niece miss mackarness gasped again and could not speak to see mrs bramwell you know said titania sweetly of course i know all about it miss mackarness to be sure your grace replied her victim not knowing what to do or say then goodbye said the duchess i hope you will enjoy your walk miss mackarness its such pleasant weather for a walk they left the poor woman in the middle of the road an easy victim to the slowest vehicle in the county oh ive done wrong i know said pens housekeeper what shall i do now i said that on purpose said titania viciously she has known all along and ought to have told me but now we know all about it augustin what about mr bramwell asked augustin goby and de vere turned pale and the duchess threw up her hands i might have asked her she cried captain goby looked at her severely said augustin and so did de vere goby and de vere denied it never mind said the duchess this time she cant escape we are on the track they passed a man a few miles farther on and only augustin noticed him you are right titania we are certainly on the track that man was timothy bunting he said pen has been shedding her retainers all along the road i suspect bob of furious driving a few miles farther at the foot of a steep rise they saw a young and pretty woman weeping on a heap of stones i wonder if that is another of em said augustin it was mary whom geordie had deposited on the road halfway between two villages have two motorcars gone this way asked bradstock yes sir sobbed mary why are you crying asked the sympathetic peer because geordie smith is no gentleman said mary thats mrs bramwells driver isnt it i know her well said bradstock yes it is and he aint a gentleman he drove so fast he frightened me and i got out how sad said bradstock we are going on to upwell castle now can we help you i would rather walk to australia than get in another one of em said mary you are right said augustin titania you are right in half an hour we shall see penelope and i shall see bob said titania viciously but the bishop felt rather pleased with bob now he was in a car driven by rivaulx and rivaulx was desperate and when rivaulx was desperate he lacked consideration for others chapter xxviii as all antiquarians know upwell castle consists of two wings and a kind of centrepiece joining two civilizations and two divergent schools of architecture the right wing is tudor and ruined the left is georgian and habitable the centre is nondescript and pseudopalladian it cost a great deal to keep up and nothing could keep it from falling down penelopes mother fell in love with it on first sight and fell out with her husband about the price its value has fallen since then for landed property is the only stable thing which always falls there were pictures in it that connoisseurs gloated over and some that picturecleaners had restored till they were as valuable as a gothic cathedral brought up to date by a resurrected vandal there were carvings by grinling gibbons to be seen and some that were not by grinling gibbons there were some rooms decorated by adams that would have made adam ill there was an oak staircase there that a thousand intoxicated noblemen had fallen down there was another that no sober gentleman could go up it was ruinous romantic and rathaunted tapestry waved in its corridors ghosts loved its precincts there was a room stained with something that the servants said was blood and that the skeptical averred to be port wine the only thing against the latter theory was that the diningroom was not stained though some said it had been so flooded all over that nothing showed it was a delightful place and penelope never stayed there miss mackarness did but then she was a scotchwoman and didnt count bob adored it but then bob was bob and nothing could change him ill fix this all up said bob and make her happy shes silly ill blow the gaff as baker says shes upstairs now crying her eyes out and making the baby bellow he wandered about the grounds and wondered where mary and bunting and miss mackarness were silly fools said bob the idea of being afraid of going in a motorcar by jove i wonder whats become of my man at spilsborough i suppose those people in regent street think ive stolen the car what fun he explored the ruined wing and ruined it a little more and came out again into the queen anne garden by jove i do wish i knew where they all were he said i wonder what granny is doing is she having fits and dr lumsden griff to look after em i think griffs a softsoapy ass he says well how are we this morning by jove all the rest of em will have fits too they will be sick but im glad theyre out of it i wonder where lord bradstock is hell pull my wig when he sees me and the bishop well hes not a bad old boy i rather like bishops but their legs are queer by jove but its fun having skipped and done them if they ever get to spilsby and find us gone theyll be mad he walked around the corner of the house and paff came a motorcar and made him jump another one followed like a streak of light bob went quite pale for a boy with a complexion like an ancient red brick and made a bolt for the door he was too late for bradstock and the bishop stood in his way bob slowed down put his hands in his pockets and whistled i say said bob how did you find this place out i own to being surprised and disappointed with you robert said the bishop very much surprised and greatly disappointed bob wagged his head to and fro why what about he asked at your not returning sir said his lordship you treated me and lord bradstock i regret to say with great disrespect im very sorry said bob but i couldnt help it penoh lord theres granny the duchess intervened robert where is penelope bob hesitated gone totto london for paris and marseilles and australia said bob hurriedly she said she couldnt wait but had an appointment there somewhere and she said i was to say she was sorry if any one called robert said the duchess severely do not keep your eyes fixed upon the distant landscape look me in the face are you speaking the truth bob wriggled and shuffled no im not he said its a beastly lie but she did say the other day that she would go to the ends of the earth and thats australia aint it bob said the bishop this is very painful to me speak the truth like a man i wont said bob it isnt my truth i wont give pen away to any one his vision cleared and he saw the lovers ranked behind his grandmother and the bishop oh mr gordon he cried do come and help me would you tell if you were me no said gordon no of course not i always liked you said bob so i wont i command you said titania looking at gordon furiously its no good said bob rapidly pens a great way off far enough that is and i swore id never disclose the secret of her whereabouts to any one at least if i didnt swear it i said it and if i said it my lord and broke my promise it wouldnt be honourable would it i dont care began titania would it my lord asked bob im afraid not said the bishop though perhaps in the circumstances which are very peculiar well i wont said bob and thats flat goby wouldnt i know would you captain goby but the duchess waved goby into the background i mean to have the truth shall we listen to your foolish scruples now if you wont tell us where she is tell us whom she has married is it one of these gentlemen i wont give any of em away said bob then you know of course i know said bob ah sighed the duchess then she is married she says so said bob and if its true as i suppose i know who it is but pen before she went upbefore she went said i wasnt to speak bradstock smiled titania penelope is in the house let us go in he said and he marched up the steps bob shook himself free from the duchess and darted indoors before bradstock he bolted upstairs to penelope and burst in upon her like a whirlwind pen theyre all here all the gang i couldnt keep em out who are here asked pen in awful dismay all of em and the bishop and bradstock and granny oh what shall i do wailed penelope ill tell you said bob lets sneak down the back way and steal one of their cars now and get away no no said penelope it wouldnt be dignified i must be dignified bob i must be i will go down and see them no said bob i will said penelope and tell em the truth penelope started i cant i cant because weve quarrelled but i will see them i must she went red and white and red again and once more as pale as dawn she kissed the sleeping adopted illegitimate normalcoloured infant as he sprawled upon an historic bed and went to the door come with me bob ill hold your hand pen i say you shake squeeze my hand till you hurt me said pen now come she swept down the big staircase with bob in tow and found herself in the presence of the entire gang as bob had called them penelope said titania recoiling oh pen said bradstock advancing my dear lady penelope said the bishop sweetly do you recollect that i christened you at the early age of three months no said penelope no said the bishop no to be sure how could you but i did itit was very kind of you said penelope titania recovered herself and advanced gordon and the rest hung about in the distance looking as wretched as the ruined wing of the castle are you married penelope asked titania yes said penelope of course she is said bob hold your tongue robert said his grandmother and to whom i wont say replied penelope i told you i wouldnt and i wont i said she wouldnt cried bob titania pointed her hand at the shrinking horde every single one of these gentlemen to say nothing of lord bramber who is with his invalid father at the present moment came to me and said he was married to you every one of them without an exception i am very much obliged to them said pen in the circumstances i think it was noble of them are you alluding to the advertisement in the times asked titania are you aware that every one now says that you have adopted an infant what rot said bob robert cried his grandmother be silent i command you i will not be interrupted by you are you aware penelope that it is said all over england and europe and the blatant united states that you have adopted an infant penelope shook her head its the first ive heard of it said penelope who was the colour of a rose is it true do not evade my question cried titania i dont see granny what right you have to ask em said the irrepressible bob i sent you a wire to say it wasnt black and it isnt augustin silence that boy said titania but augustin shook his head dont you answer anything pen said bob no one has any right to ask you anything he marched over to gordon dont look so sad mr gordon i cant help it my boy said gordon its a horrid situation i dont care whether its adopted or not if shell marry me ill have her bob squeezed his hand i aint absolutely sure it isnt you yet he said pen hasnt told me all you know by the way mr gordon did that speculation come off not so well as i thought by ten thousand said gordon oh i say said bob but after all it doesnt matter ill make fifty or sixty thousand do youre a fine boy said gordon but bob i would like to strangle your grandmother would you asked bob eagerly i dare say pen does too grandmothers and aunts are very trying at least i find them so the duchesss voice rose now quite above the limits of social decency except when any one is playing or singing i will not be put off penelope you will say who it is and you will be married again by the bishop in his fine gothic cathedral mr deans cathedral interjected the bishop with a proper service and the usual hymns breathing over eden or i will stay here till you do steady titania said bradstock if she wont she wont but she shall shrieked titania gentlemen which of you is it i am now entirely desperate which of you is it no one said a word marquis is it you asked the duchess you said so before how can i say asked poor rivaulx she says no one must quite right said bradstock who will believe any one titania lets have lunch and be friendly and stop this im very hungry pen and lets see the baby the duchess shivered i cannot and will not see it said titania for by all accounts it is an adopted illegitimate child if penelope will send it back to the person she got it of and own the truth i will forgive her and have lunch for i am very faint i want to see the baby pen said augustin with his hand on pens shoulder you know pen they still say its rather dusky penelope was very indignant hes not she cried they shant say it any more bob tell that girl upstairs to bring him down and bob ran upstairs like a monkey up a stick i decline to see it said titania a baby without a name is a terrible object to me it is an insult to the bishop and to the church to bring one into the room i will retire into the open air and try to breathe again goby assisted her outside this is a calamity said titania its a catastrophe what is the truth captain goby are you a liar too goby sobbed how can i say he asked you know i cant he looked out into the park heres some one coming in a motor he cried they all ran to the windows but just then bob and the nurse came down with the infant who though evidently awed by the number of creatures he saw about him behaved like a gentleman and not in the least like an adopted child i congratulate you pen said bradstock the mother must be a devilish pretty woman does she miss it much pen oh pen what a queer mad darling you are i begin to see daylight but nobody else did penelope blushed and hugged the baby tenderly while bob danced around her in the wildest state of excitement i say captain goby come and look at it mr de vere i say marquis aint it a ripper and as fat as a pup and hardly a squeal out of it day or night granny dear wont you look at it no no said titania i cannot cannot bring myself to do so youll soon be jolly sorry i can tell you cried the loving grandson ill bet youll be sorry he ran to pen i say pen give the kid to me or youll drop it drop him exclaimed penelope oh bob is it likely very likely said bob if you knew that i sent a telegram to some one just as soon as we got here pen flushed scarlet but not with anger oh bob i did you aint angry oh bob i dont care said bob as he took the child i dont care a hang im ruined with all these jossers now de vere will never buy any more dogs of me i say whos that a motorcar stopped outside the great hall door and a gentleman in black got out he came up the steps rapidly and stopped dead when he found all the world in front of him i thought so said bradstock now the catalogue is complete lord bramber cried the others penelope stood in the centre of the great hall as if she were turned to marble but no marble ever had so sweet a colour illustration the earl of pulborough clever but indolent i believe it is now the earl of pulborough said bradstock gravely to the newcomer yes he replied penelope you sent for me pen fell upon his neck before them all and did not deny it and as they stood still in great amazement bob danced the baby up and down till that young gentleman made up his mind to roar as soon as he got his breath thisthis is lord bramber howled bob triumphantly now admit you feel sorry you spoke granny he gave the baby to the nurse and grabbed goby by the arm i say im awfully sorry but it isnt my fault captain goby and ethel mytton is a very nice girl and dead in love with you is she sighed goby mr de vere ive got a bulldog damn bulldogs said de vere bob seized gordon do you feel very bad mr gordon he asked sympathetically i almost wish it had been you it cant be helped said gordon gloomily i never had a chance come and see me in the city next week bob rivaulx and carew and williams took their hats and slipped from the house while bob did what he could to soften things for them ill come and see you all very often he cried goodbye now an hour later when titania had the baby upon her capacious lap and said how certain she had been the whole time that bramber was penelopes choice bob walked around the garden with the bishop and lord bradstock oh its quite easy to understand said bob after all she said you expected she would marry some outsider and you see she took the pick of the basket and of course was ashamed oh i know pen you are a wonder bob said bradstock the bishop said that upon adequate reflection he was inclined to agree with bradstock well pens all right said bob the end l c page
