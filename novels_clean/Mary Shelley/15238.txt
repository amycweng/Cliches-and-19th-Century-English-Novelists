wollstonecraft shelley left in manuscripti only one novelette mathilda be complete exists in rough draft final copy in story a in mary shelley writing there be much that be autobiographical must be hard to find more self revealing work for understanding of mary character especially a saw of attitude toward shelley toward godwin in tale be important document although main narrative that of father incestuous love for daughter suicide mathildas consequent withdrawal from society to lonely heath be not in real sense autobiographical many element in be drawn from reality three main character be clearly mary godwin shelley relation can easily be reassorted to correspond with actuality highly personal a story be mary shelley hoped that must be published evidently believing that character situation be sufficiently disguised in may of sent to england by friend gisbornes with request that father must arrange for publication mathilda together with rough draft entitled field of fancy remained unpublished among shelley paper although mary reference to in letter journal aroused curiosity among scholar also remained unexamined until comparatively recently seeming neglect be due partly to circumstance attending distribution of family paper after death of sir percy lady shelley one part of went to bodleian library to become reserved collection by term of lady shelley will be opened to scholar only under definite restriction part went to lady shelley niece in turn to heir who for time did not make manuscript available for study third part went to sir john shelley roll poet

corresponding line of text occasional passage be scored out word phrase be crossed out to make way for revision following page four sheet containing conclusion of story be cut out of notebook appear page numbered to among shelley roll fragment revised version page to follows cutiv mode of telling story in final draft differs radically from in rough draft in field of fancy mathildas history be set in fanciful framework author be transported by fairy fantasia to elysian field where listens to discourse of diotima meet mathilda mathilda tell story close with death in final draft unrealistic largely irrelevant framework be discarded mathilda whose death be approaching writes out for friend woodville full detail of tragic history have never have courage to tell in person title of rough draft field of fancy setting framework undoubtedly stem from mary wollstonecraft unfinished tale cave of fancy in one of soul confined in center of earth to purify from dross of earthly existence tell to sagesta who may be compared with story of ill fated love for man whom hope to rejoin after purgation be completedv mary be completely familiar with mother work title be of course abandoned when framework be abandoned name of heroine be substituted though be worth noticing that mary chose name with same initial letter a own be probably taken from dante there be several reference in story to

nov th since whole of mathildas story take place in england scotland date must be that of manuscript mary be in florence at time date be supported by entry in mary journal indicate that began writing mathilda early in august while shelley be living in villa valosano near leghorn on august after gap of two month from time of little son death resumed diary almost day thereafter for month recorded write by september be saying copy on september wrote finish copying tale next entry to indicate literary activity be one word write on november on th percy florence be born mary did more writing until march when be working on valperga be probable therefore that mary wrote copied mathilda between august september that did revision on november finally dated manuscript november subsequent history of manuscript be recorded in letter journal when gisbornes went to england on may took mathilda with read on journey recorded admiration of in journalvi be to show to godwin get advice about publishing although medwin heard about story when be with shelley in vii mary read perhaps from rough draft to edward jane williams in summer of viii manuscript apparently stayed in godwins hand evidently did not share gisbornes enthusiasm approval be qualified thought highly of certain part of le highly of others regarded subject a disgusting detestable saying that story must need preface to prevent reader from being tormented by apprehension of fall of heroine be if be ever publishedix there be however record of having made attempt to get into print from january through june mary repeatedly asked mr gisborne to retrieve manuscript have copied for mr gisborne invariably reported failure to do so last reference to story be after shelley death in unpublished journal entry two of mary letter in journal for october told of solace for misery have once found in writing mathilda in one letter to mr gisborne compared journey of herself jane to pisa leghorn to get news of shelley williams to of mathilda in search of father driving like matilda towards sea to learn if be to be for ever doomed to miseryx on may wrote matilda foretells even many small circumstance most truly whole of be monument of what now isxi fact not only date manuscript also show mary feeling of personal involvement in story in event of be possible to find basis for morbid tale consequently to ass biographical significance on shelley daughter clara everina barely year old died at venice mary child have gone from bagni di lucca to este to join shelley at byron villa clara be not well when started grew worse on journey from este shelley mary took to venice to consult physician trip be beset with delay difficulty died almost a soon a arrived according to newman ivey whitexii mary in unreasoning agony of grief blamed shelley for child death for time felt toward extreme physical antagonism subsided into apathy spiritual alienation mary black mood made difficult to live with shelley fell into deep dejection expressed sense of estrangement in of lyric of saddest poem in one fragment of verse for example lamented that mary have left in dreary world alone thy form be here indeed lovely one thou art fled gone down dreary road lead to sorrow most obscure abode thou sittest on hearth of pale despair where for thine own sake can not follow thee professor white believed that shelley recorded estrangement only in veiled term in julian maddalo in poem that did not show to mary that mary acknowledged only after shelley death in poem choice in editorial note on poem of year unpublished story written after death of other child william certainly contains though also in veiled term mary immediate recognition remorse mary well knew believe what be doing to shelley in effort to purge own emotion to acknowledge fault poured out on page of mathilda suffering loneliness bitterness self recrimination of past month biographical element be clear mathilda be certainly mary mathildas father be godwin woodville be idealized shelley like mathilda mary be woman of strong passion affection often hid from world under placid appearance like mathildas mary mother have died few day after giving birth like mathilda spent part of girlhood in scotland like mathilda met loved poet of exceeding beauty also like mathilda in sad year have treated ill having become captious unreasonable in sorrow mathildas loneliness grief remorse can be paralleled in mary later journal in choice story be outlet for emotion in woodville poet be virtually perfect glorious from youth like angel with winged foot beauty goodness gentleness be also successful a poet poem written at age of twenty three having be universally acclaimed making allowance for mary exaggeration wishful thinking easily recognize shelley woodville have poetic ideal charm of conversation high moral quality sense of dedication responsibility to loved to humanity be mary earliest portrait of husband drawn in year when be slowly returning to from hearth of pale despair early circumstance education of godwin of mathildas be different produced similar men extravagant generous vain dogmatic there be more of godwin in tale than account of great man ruined by character circumstance relationship between father daughter before be destroyed by father unnatural passion be like between godwin mary called love for excessive romanticxiii may well have be recording in mathildas sorrow over alienation from father loss of by death own grief at spiritual separation from godwin through what must only seem to cruel lack of sympathy have accused of being cowardly insincere in grief over claras deathxiv later belittled loss of williamxv have also called shelley disgraceful flagrant person because of shelley refusal to send more moneyxvi wonder if mary felt that like mathilda have lost beloved cruel father thus mary took blame for rift with shelley upon transferred physical alienation to break in sympathy with godwin that turned fact into story of incest be undoubtedly due to interest shelley felt in subject at time regarded a dramatic effective theme in august of shelley completed cenci during progress have talked over with mary arrangement of scene have even suggested at outset that write tragedy about year earlier have be urging upon translation of alfieris myrrha thomas medwin indeed thought that story be writing in be specifically based on myrrha that be thinking of tragedy while writing mathilda be evident from effective use of at one of crisis in tale perhaps be remembering own handling of theme when wrote biographical sketch of alfieri for lardner cabinet cyclopaedia nearly twenty year later then spoke of difficulty inherent in subject inequality of age adding to unnatural incest to shed interest over attachment dramatist ought to adorn father with such youthful attribute a must be by mean contrary to probabilityxvii endeavored to do in mathilda aided indeed by fact that situation be reverse of in myrrha mathildas father be young married before be twenty when returned to mathilda still showed ardour freshness of feeling incident to youth lived in past saw dead wife reincarnated in daughter thus mary attempt to validate situation make by mean contrary to probability mathilda offer good example of mary shelley method of revision study of manuscript show that be careful workman that in polishing bizarre story strove consistently for greater credibility realism more dramatic if sometimes melodramatic presentation of event better motivation conciseness exclusion of purple passage in revision rewriting many addition be made so that mathilda be appreciably longer than field of fancy addition be usually improvement much fuller account of mathildas father mother of marriage make of something more than lay figure to great extent explains tragedy development of character of steward at first merely servant who accompanies mathilda in search for father into sympathetic confidant whose response help to dramatise situation added word short phrase mark mary shelley penetration into motif action of mathilda father therefore mathilda doe not impress reader a being longer than field of fancy because better sustains interest with addition there be also effective omission of obvious of tautological of artificially elaboratexviii finished draft mathilda still show mary shelley fault a writer verbosity loose plotting somewhat stereotyped extravagant characterization reader must be tolerant of heroine overwhelming lamentation be after in great tradition of romantic heroine compare own weeping to of boccaccio ghismonda over heart of guiscardo if reader can accept mathilda on own term will find not only biographical interest in story also intrinsic merit feeling for character situation phrasing be often vigorous precise footnote be listed in nitchie mary shelley appendix ii pp to must be added unfinished unpublished novel cecil in
