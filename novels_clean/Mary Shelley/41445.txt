cornelius agrippa paracelsus without contempt m krempe have exhibited said that be men to whose indefatigable zeal modern philosopher be indebted for most of foundation of knowledge have left to a easier task to give new name arrange in connected classification fact in great degree have be instrument of bringing to light labour of men of genius however erroneously directed scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to solid advantage of mankind listened to statement be delivered without presumption affectation then added that lecture have removed prejudice against modern chemist at same time requested advice concerning book ought to procure be happy said m waldman to have gained disciple if application equal ability have doubt of success chemistry be that branch of natural philosophy in greatest improvement have be may be made be on account have made peculiar study at same time have not neglected other branch of science man must make very sorry chemist if attended to department of human knowledge alone if wish be to become really man of science not merely petty experimentalist must advise to apply to branch of natural philosophy including mathematics then took into laboratory explained to us of various machine instructing a to what ought to procure promising use of own when must have advanced far enough in science not to derange mechanism also gave list of book have requested took leave thus ended day memorable to decided future destiny chapter iii from day natural philosophy particularly chemistry in most comprehensive sense of term became nearly sole occupation read with ardour work so full of genius discrimination modern inquirer have written on subject attended lecture cultivated acquaintance of men of science of university found even in m krempe great deal of sound sense real information combined be true with repulsive physiognomy manner not on account le valuable in m waldman found true friend gentleness be never tinged by dogmatism instruction be given with air of frankness good nature banished idea of pedantry be perhaps amiable character of man inclined more to branch of natural philosophy professed than intrinsic love for science state of mind have place only in first step towards knowledge more fully entered into science more exclusively pursued for own sake that application at first have be matter of duty resolution now became so ardent eager that star often disappeared in light of morning whilst be yet engaged in laboratory a applied so closely may be easily conceived that improved rapidly ardour be indeed astonishment of student proficiency that of master professor krempe often asked with sly smile how cornelius agrippa went on whilst m waldman expressed most heart felt exultation in progress two year passed in manner during paid visit to geneva be engaged heart soul in pursuit of discovery hoped to make none who have experienced can conceive of enticement of science in other study go a far a others have gone before there be nothing more to know in scientific pursuit there be continual food for discovery wonder mind of moderate capacity closely pursues one study must infallibly arrive at great proficiency in study who continually sought attainment of one object of pursuit be solely wrapt up in improved so rapidly that at end of two year made discovery in improvement of chemical instrument procured great esteem admiration at university when have arrived at point have become a well acquainted with theory practice of natural philosophy a depended on lesson of of professor at ingolstadt residence there being longer conducive to improvement thought of returning to friend native town when incident happened that protracted stay one of phnonema have peculiarly attracted attention be structure of human frame indeed animal endued with life whence often asked did principle of life proceed be bold question one have ever be considered a mystery yet with how many thing be upon brink of becoming acquainted if cowardice carelessness did not restrain inquiry revolved circumstance in mind determined thenceforth to apply more particularly to branch of natural philosophy relate to physiology unless have be animated by almost supernatural enthusiasm application to study must have be irksome almost intolerable to examine cause of life must first have recourse to death became acquainted with science of anatomy be not sufficient must also observe natural decay corruption of human body in education father have taken greatest precaution that mind must be impressed with supernatural horror ever remember to have trembled at tale of superstition to have feared apparition of spirit darkness have effect upon fancy church yard be to merely receptacle of body deprived of life from being seat of beauty strength have become food for worm now be led to examine cause progress of decay forced to spend day night in vault charnel house attention be fixed upon object most insupportable to delicacy of human feeling saw how fine form of man be degraded wasted beheld corruption of death succeed to blooming cheek of life saw how worm inherited wonder of eye brain paused examining analysing minuti of causation a exemplified in change from life to death death to life until from midst of darkness sudden light broke in upon mea light so brilliant wondrous yet so simple that while became dizzy with immensity of prospect illustrated be surprised that among so many men of genius who have directed inquiry towards same science that alone must be reserved to discover so astonishing secret remember be not recording vision of madman sun doe not more certainly shine in heaven than now affirm be true miracle might have produced yet stage of discovery be distinct probable after day night of incredible labour fatigue succeeded in discovering cause of generation life nay more became capable of bestowing animation upon lifeless matter astonishment have at first experienced on discovery soon gave place to delight rapture after so much time spent in painful labour to arrive at once at summit of desire be most gratifying consummation of toil discovery be so great overwhelming that step by have be progressively led to be obliterated beheld only result what have be study desire of wisest men since creation of world be now within grasp not that like magic scene opened upon at once

permit to doubt of ability to give life to animal a complex wonderful a man material at present within command hardly appeared adequate to so arduous undertaking doubted not must ultimately succeed prepared for multitude of revers operation might be incessantly baffled at last work be imperfect yet when considered improvement day take place in science mechanic be encouraged to hope present attempt must at least lay foundation of future success must consider magnitude complexity of plan a argument of impracticability be with feeling began creation of human being a minuteness of part formed great hindrance to speed resolved contrary to first intention to make being of gigantic stature be to say about eight foot in height proportionably large after having formed determination having spent month in successfully collecting arranging material began one can conceive variety of feeling bore onwards like hurricane in first enthusiasm of success life death appeared to ideal bound

must deserve theirs pursuing reflection thought that if must bestow animation upon lifeless matter might in process of time although now found impossible renew life where death have apparently devoted body to corruption thought supported spirit while pursued undertaking with unremitting ardour cheek have grown pale with study person have become emaciated with confinement sometimes on very brink of certainty failed yet still clung to hope next day next hour might realize one secret alone possessed be hope to have dedicated moon gazed on midnight labour while with unrelaxed breathless eagerness pursued nature to hiding place who will conceive horror of secret toil a dabbled among unhallowed damp of grave tortured living animal to animate lifeless clay limb now tremble eye swim with

unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate have returned to old habit collected bone from charnel house disturbed with profane finger tremendous secret of human frame in solitary chamber rather cell at top of house separated from other apartment by gallery staircase kept workshop of filthy creation eyeball be starting from socket in attending to detail of employment dissecting room slaughter house

be thus engaged heart soul in one pursuit be most beautiful season never did field bestow more plentiful harvest vine yield more luxuriant vintage eye be insensible to charm of nature same feeling made neglect scene around caused also to forget friend who be so many mile absent whom have not seen for so long time knew silence disquieted well remembered word of father know that while be pleased with will think of with affection will hear regularly from must pardon if regard interruption in correspondence a proof that other duty be equally neglected knew well therefore what must be father feeling must not tear thought from employment loathsome in have taken irresistible hold of imagination wished a be to procrastinate related to feeling of affection until great object swallowed up habit of nature must be completed then thought that father must be unjust if ascribed neglect to vice faultiness on part be now convinced that be justified in conceiving must not be altogether free from blame human being in perfection ought always to preserve calm peaceful mind never to allow passion transitory desire to disturb tranquillity think that pursuit of knowledge be exception to rule if study to apply have tendency to weaken affection to destroy taste for simple pleasure in alloy can possibly mix then study be certainly unlawful be to say not befitting human mind if rule be always observed if man allowed pursuit whatsoever to interfere with tranquillity of domestic affection greece have not be enslaved csar must have spared country america must have be discovered more gradually

occupation more particularly than before winter spring summer passed away during labour did not watch blossom expanding leavessights before always yielded supreme delight so deeply be engrossed in occupation leaf of year have withered before work drew near to close now day shewed more plainly how well have succeeded enthusiasm be checked by anxiety appeared rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in mine other unwholesome trade than artist occupied by favourite employment night be oppressed by slow fever became nervous to most painful degree disease regretted more because have hitherto enjoyed most excellent health have always boasted of firmness of nerve believed that exercise amusement must soon drive away such symptom promised of when creation must be complete chapter iv be on dreary night of november beheld accomplishment of toil with anxiety almost amounted to agony collected instrument of life around might infuse spark of being into lifeless thing lay at foot be already

filled heart unable to endure aspect of being have created rushed out of room continued long time traversing bed chamber unable to compose mind to sleep at length lassitude succeeded to tumult have before endured threw on bed in clothes endeavouring to seek few moment of forgetfulness be in vain slept indeed be disturbed by wildest dream thought saw elizabeth in bloom of health walking in street

bitterness of disappointment dream have be food pleasant rest for so long space be now become hell to change be so rapid overthrow so complete morning dismal wet at length dawned discovered to sleepless aching eye church of ingolstadt white steeple clock indicated sixth hour porter opened gate of court have that night be asylum issued into street pacing with quick step a if sought to avoid wretch whom feared turning of street must present to view did not dare return to apartment inhabited felt impelled to hurry on although wetted by rain poured from black comfortless sky continued walking in manner for time endeavouring by bodily exercise to ease load weighed upon mind traversed street without clear conception of where be what be doing heart palpitated in sickness of fear hurried on with irregular step not daring to look about like one who on lonely road doth walk in fear dread having once turnd round walk on turn more head because know frightful fiend doth close behind tread continuing thus came at length opposite to inn at various diligence carriage usually stopped here paused knew not why remained minute with eye fixed on coach be coming towards from other end of street a drew nearer observed that be swiss diligence stopped just where be standing on door being opened perceived henry clerval who on seeing instantly sprung out dear frankenstein exclaimed how glad be to see how fortunate that must be here at very moment of alighting nothing must equal delight on seeing clerval presence brought back to thought father elizabeth scene of home so dear to recollection grasped hand in moment forgot horror misfortune felt suddenly for first time during many month calm serene joy welcomed friend therefore in most cordial manner walked towards college clerval continued talking for time about mutual friend own good fortune in being permitted to come to ingolstadt may easily believe said how great be difficulty to persuade father that be not absolutely necessary for merchant not to understand thing except book keeping indeed believe left incredulous to last for constant answer to unwearied entreaty be same a of dutch schoolmaster in vicar of wakefield have ten thousand florin year without greek eat heartily without greek affection for at length overcame dislike of learning have permitted to undertake voyage of discovery to land of knowledge give greatest delight to see tell how left father brother elizabeth very well very happy only little uneasy that hear from so seldom by bye mean to lecture little upon account myselfbut dear frankenstein continued stopping short gazing full in face did not before remark how very ill appear so thin pale look a if have be watching for several night have guessed right have lately be so deeply engaged in one occupation have not allowed sufficient rest a see hope sincerely hope that employment be now at end be at length free trembled excessively must not endure to think of far le to allude to occurrence of preceding night walked with quick pace soon arrived at college then reflected thought made shiver that creature whom have left in apartment might still be there alive walking about dreaded to behold monster feared still more that henry must see entreating therefore to remain few minute at bottom of stair darted up towards own room hand be already on lock of door before recollected then paused cold shivering came over threw door forcibly open a child be accustomed to do when expect spectre to stand in waiting for on other side nothing appeared stepped fearfully in apartment be empty bedroom be also freed from hideous guest must hardly believe that so great good fortune must have befallen when became assured that enemy have indeed fled clapped hand for joy ran down to clerval ascended into room servant presently brought breakfast be unable to contain be not joy only that possessed felt flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness pulse beat rapidly be unable to remain for single instant in same place jumped over chair clapped hand laughed aloud clerval at first attributed unusual spirit to joy on arrival when observed more attentively saw wildness in eye for must not account loud unrestrained heartless laughter frightened astonished dear victor cried what for god sake be matter laugh in manner how ill be what be cause of ask cried putting hand before eye for thought saw dreaded spectre glide into room can telloh save save imagined that monster seized struggled furiously fell down in fit poor clerval what must have be feeling meeting anticipated with such joy so strangely turned to bitterness be not witness of grief for be lifeless did not recover sens for long long time be commencement of nervous fever confined for several month during time henry be only nurse afterwards learned that knowing father advanced age unfitness for so long journey how wretched sickness must make elizabeth spared grief by concealing extent of disorder knew must not have more kind attentive nurse than firm in hope felt of recovery did not doubt that instead of doing harm performed kindest action that must towards be in reality very ill surely nothing unbounded unremitting attention of friend must have restored to life form of monster on whom have bestowed existence be for ever before eye raved incessantly concerning doubtless word surprised henry at first believed to be wandering of disturbed imagination pertinacity with continually recurred to same subject persuaded that disorder indeed owed origin to uncommon terrible event by very slow degree with frequent relapse alarmed grieved friend recovered remember first time became capable of observing outward object with kind of pleasure perceived that fallen leaf have disappeared that young bud be shooting forth from tree shaded window be divine spring season contributed greatly to convalescence felt also sentiment of joy affection revive in bosom gloom disappeared in short time became a cheerful a before be attacked by fatal passion dearest clerval exclaimed how kind how very good be to whole winter instead of being spent in study a promised have be consumed in sick room how will ever repay feel greatest remorse for disappointment of have be occasion will forgive will repay entirely if discompose get well a fast a can since appear in such good spirit may speak to on one subject may not trembled one subject must be must allude to object on whom dared not even think compose said clerval who observed change of colour will not mention if agitates father cousin must be very happy if received letter from in own hand writing hardly know how ill have be be uneasy at long silence be that dear henry how must suppose that first thought must not fly towards dear dear friend whom love who be so deserving of love if be present temper friend will perhaps be glad to see letter have be lying here day for be from cousin believe chapter v clerval then put following letter into hand to v frankenstein dear cousin can not describe to uneasiness have felt concerning health can not help imagining that friend clerval conceals extent of disorder for be now several month since have seen hand writing time have be obliged to dictate letter to henry surely victor must have be exceedingly ill make very wretched a much so nearly a after death of dear mother uncle be almost persuaded that be indeed dangerously ill must hardly be restrained from undertaking journey to ingolstadt clerval always writes that be getting better eagerly hope that will confirm intelligence soon in own hand writing for indeed indeed victor be very miserable on account relieve from fear will be happiest creature in world father health be now so vigorous that appears ten year younger since last winter ernest also be so much improved that must hardly know be now nearly sixteen have lost that sickly appearance have year ago be grown quite robust active uncle conversed long time last night about what profession ernest must follow constant illness when young have deprived of habit of application now that enjoys good health be continually in open air climbing hill rowing on lake therefore proposed that must be farmer know cousin be favourite scheme of mine farmer be very healthy happy life least hurtful rather most beneficial profession of uncle have idea of being educated a advocate through interest might become judge besides that be not at fitted for such occupation be certainly more creditable to cultivate earth for sustenance of man than to be confidant sometimes accomplice of vice be profession of lawyer said that employment of prosperous farmer if be not more honourable be at least happier specie of occupation than of judge whose misfortune be always to meddle with dark side of human nature uncle smiled said that ought to be advocate put end to conversation on subject now must tell little story will please perhaps amuse do not remember justine moritz probably will relate history therefore in few word madame moritz mother be widow with four child of whom justine be third girl have always be favourite of father through strange perversity mother must not endure after death of m moritz treated very ill aunt observed when justine be twelve year of age prevailed on mother to allow to live at house republican institution of
