heart of making for short interval worldly care object distasteful to of filling with desire of seclusion peace if be unable to enjoy resolved that at least child must not be drawn by into thorny path of rivalship ambition mother last injunction strengthened feeling duke visiting again hermit of wood induced to take charge of edmund bringing up in ignorance of real parentage to bestow such education on a must enable to fill with reputation honourable if not distinguished station in society order of thing be not changed by richard exaltation to crown on contrary danger incurred from usurpation made yet more anxious to secure peaceful existence for offspring when however legitimate son whom have created prince of wale died paternal affection awoke strong in heart must not resist desire of seeing edmund memorable visit for priest bred nursling of forest gave link with society with before have felt connexion imagination curiosity be highly excited revered friend yielding to eager demand be easily enticed to recur to passed scene of eventful life commencement of war of two rose dreadful result furnished inexhaustible topic of discourse plantagenet listened with breathless interest although be not till eve of battle of bosworth that knew how indissolubly own fortune be linked with of house of york event of few last day have given new existence for first time feeling be

sentiment with ingenuousness of one who have never be accustomed to converse with friend a spoke dark thoughtful eye beamed with tempered fire showed capable of deep enthusiasm though utter want of knowledge of world must make rather follower than leader rode on meanwhile noble cavalier gentle squire indulging in short repose intense fatigue edmund at first endured seemed to be subdued by necessity of continuance did prevent from conversing with lord lovel be anxious thoroughly to understand immediate ground of earl of richmond invasion to ascertain relative position of remaining chief of white rose where asked be edward fourth child elder of lord lovel replied lady elizabeth be by direction of uncle at sheriff hutton in yorkshire where be prince edward who be proclaimed king younger brother be long imprisoned in tower young edward died there more than year ago duke of york be supposed to have died also be sickly boy lord lovel said word in grave voice suspicion must have be instilled into unsuspecting edmund of covert meaning after short pause continued question of succession stand thus father duke of gloucester threw stigma of illegitimacy on king edward child thus took from right of inheriting crown attainder of duke of clarence be considered reason sufficient why child must be excluded from throne uncle in consequence became by right of birth king of england son created prince of wale submitted for child like edward fifth must scarcely be supported against experienced warrior man of talent sage just king at expense of much blood wound inflicted by opposing house of york lancaster be yet a late successful rebellion prof unhealed have yorkists contended among must yet sooner have lost supremacy so hardly acquired richard therefore received oath of allegiance when son died question of who be heir to crown became agitated king at first declared earl of warwick son of duke of clarence to be successor be dangerous step imprudent friend of young earl made more so to name to succeed who if be permitted at time to wear crown might claim precedence of who possessed poor warwick paid penalty of youth presumption be now prisoner at sheriff hutton john de la poole earl of lincoln son of richard sister by removal of child of elder brother heir by law be nominated to succeed uncle be now proceeding to be ignorant of conduct will pursue whether will make head against lancastrian king lincoln be noble cavalier man whom bright honour clothes be brave generous good will guide by counsel resolve appears will follow example after pause lord lovel continued after death disappearance of princely nephew king wishing to confirm title be ready to take stigma thrown on birth from brother daughter to marry niece lady elizabeth mother at first resisted prospect of seeing child restored to right to lost dignity overcame objection princess yielded willing consent meanwhile yorkists who joined earl of richmond extorted from vow that must make king edward daughter queen even lancastrian thinking thus to secure king of own be eager for union yet earl hate so cordially that be hardly brought to consent must now that have declared king evade promise child of elizabeth woodville will suffer stain of illegitimacy if marriage have place unhappy race be restored to honour right self named sovereign may find that own hand have dug pit into will fall long silence succeeded to explanation last expression used by lovel inspired edmund with wonder curiosity noble pressing horse to swifter pace did not hear observation hearing replied only by saying three hour good riding will bring to london courage plantagenet slacken not speed good boy soft ease will follow hard labour young moon in first quarter be near setting when arrived at london approached from edgware without entering town skirted northern extremity till lord lovel checking horse remarked to companion that judged fitting to delay approaching residence of earl of lincoln until setting of moon subsequent darkness secured from observation chapter ii conference yes good lord doth contain king king richard lie within limit of yon lime stone shakspeare earl of lincoln declared by richard third heir to crown did not join royal force appear at battle of bosworth distinguished prince be man of singular ability strength of mind chivalrous generosity adorned with lustre superior even to derived from high rank lord lovel be possessed of knightly courage untarnished honour gentlemanly accomplishment to military graceful quality lincoln added wisdom of statesman moral energy resulting from inflexible principle felt responsible to mankind to posterity for action be brave be virtue of time be just in comprehensive sense of word that exalted above manly feature did not so much wear stamp of beauty though like offspring of house of york be handsome a of best quality of man perception of right resolution to achieve right lord lincoln disapproved decidedly of usurpation of uncle richard third over child of edward fourth allowed that evidence be strong in favour of king former marriage consequent illegitimacy said that elizabeth woodville have so long be held queen of england child heir to crown that be impossible to eradicate belief of english people that allegiance be due to who have be proclaimed even by uncle edward fifth even if be put aside attainder passed against duke of clarence be insufficient reason to deprive son of lawful inheritance saw england wasted nobility extirpated by civil contest perceived seed of future strife in assumption of crown by duke of gloucester when son of richard third died earl of warwick be named successor superior right of nephew before reigning uncle became so eminent subject of discussion that king be obliged to recall declaration to confine young prince in castle in yorkshire earl of lincoln then seven twenty year of age be next named remonstrated with uncle privately fear of dividing

queen gave credit to tale at moment richard set on foot negotiation of marriage with eldest daughter of edward fourth lady elizabeth partizan of earl of richmond sought to ensure success of enterprise by same mean while little richard grew in health happiness in country retreat own nearest most attached relative be giving away inheritance uncle unwittingly laid foundation stone of reputation of

lord lovel edmund plantagenet entered earl of lincoln remained waiting intelligence from field in palace inhabited not far from tottenham court secluded habitation surrounded by garden high wall be irksome situation for warrior though uncle loved distrusted projected marriage with lady elizabeth must probably cause again to be father of heir to crown knowing that lincoln possessed in young duke
