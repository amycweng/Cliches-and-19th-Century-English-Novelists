mr elizabeth when heard of coronet in corner of pocket handkerchief passed away without suggesting distinct idea to mind did feel curiosity about stranger be too much accustomed to astonishment conjecture gossip of longfield to suppose that there be real foundation for surprise because wonder loving inhabitant choose to build up mystery out of common occurrence of life absence of inquisitiveness must long have kept mr fitzhenry in ignorance of who neighbour be inhabitant of longfield must probably have discovered before have not truth be revealed even before entertained suspicion that there be secret to be found out beg pardon ma'be said maid to one evening a be superintending couche of worthy spinster think ought to know though be afraid may be angry woman hesitated mistress encouraged if be thing ought to know wilmot tell at once be afraid what have happened to to ma'be la nothing replied maid be something about lady at dame nixon only commanded never to speak

lady lodore several time getting into carriage at own door have even be into house such energy be there in liberal curiosity same disinterested feeling have caused to go down to dame nixon with offer from mistress of service to lady hearing be ill went perfectly unsuspicious of wonderful discovery be about to make be thus rewarded beyond most sanguine hope by being in possession of secret known to herself alone keeping of secret be however post of honour if knowledge be confined to possessor alone mr wilmot be tolerably faithful with love of knowledge be sure must vex mistress if lady lodore strange place of abode be known at longfield mr fitzhenry be consequently first person to whom have hinted fact account detailed with great volubility mistress recommended discretion most earnestly at same time expressed doubt whether information be correct wish must go judge for ma'be said maid god forbid exclaimed mr fitzhenry god grant never see lady lodore again will go soon tell that dame nixon say be only staying till be well will go soon need never be known except to ourselves wilmot that be ever here there be dignity in eternal mystery that somewhat compensated for absence of wonder

here what can be doing mr fitzhenry asked over over again must not guess be strange be mysterious mischief be at bottom must go soon must that be already gone must be mentioned that mr elizabeth fitzhenry have left maristow castle before arrival of mr gayland have therefore knowledge of still more mysterious cloud enveloped lady lodore absence ignorant of self destroying sacrifice generosity pity be not excited feeling be against counted day a passed looked wistfully at wilmot hoping that must quickly bring tidings of lady departure in vain doctor ceased to visit cottage lady remained at once doctor visited again with greater assiduity than ever not on account of beautiful patient dame nixon have have paralytic stroke kind lady have sent for promised to defray expense of poor woman illness be truly vexatious mr fitzhenry fretted even asked wilmot question unwelcome visitor be still there wherefore what must have put so disagreeable whim into head good lady must think of motive

likelihood that have secluded there while be away may expect will not be able to stay long will come at end of week to fetch mr fitzhenry shuddered prejudice be stronger than ever experienced utmost wretchedness from idea that residence of lady lodore must be discovered family union effected seemed desecration to memory of brother ruin to ethel greatest misfortune must befal of feeling be exaggerated be on account more powerful how must avert evil remedy must be sought fixed on one desperate one in truth appeared to sole mode of saving from greatest disaster resolved to visit lady lodore to represent to impropriety wickedness of having intercourse with daughter to entreat to depart before ethel arrival violence might almost seem madness people who live in solitude become to
