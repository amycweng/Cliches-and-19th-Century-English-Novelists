memory after death be strongest of title to remembrance be further undeniable that most original of work be also betrays strongest trace of influence frankenstein be written when brain magnetized by companionship be capable of effort never to be repeated if frame of mind engendered sustained work be created by shelley conception be not diction be dissimilar to derive from godwin be godwins same observation except for occasional phrase caught from shelley applies to subsequent work frequent exaltation of spirit ideality romance may well have be shelleysthe general style of execution repeat resembles mary shelley voice then be not to die away a mere echo of illustrious husband have prima facie claim to hearing due to writer who can assert possession of distinctive individuality if originality be once conceded to frankenstein a in equity must none will dispute validity of title to fame grounded on work have solved question itselfit be famous be full of fault venial in author of nineteen apart from wild grandeur of conception have that even maturity of mere talent never attainsthe insight of genius look below appearance of thing perhaps even revers own first conception by discovery of underlying truth mary shelley original intention be probably that must alone have occurred to most writer in place meant to paint frankenstein monstrous creation a object of unmitigated horror perception that be object of intense compassion a well imparted moral value to what otherwise must have remained daring flight of imagination have done more have helped to create if did not beget type of personage unknown to ancient fiction conception of character at once justly execrable truly pitiable be altogether modern richard third caliban make approach towards former be too self sufficing in valour villainy to be deeply pitied latter too senseless brutal victor hugo have made laureate of pathetic deformity much of work be conscious unconscious variation on original theme of frankenstein none of mary shelley subsequent romance approached frankenstein in power popularity reason may be summed up in wordlanguor after death of infant son in must never again command energy have carried so vigorously through frankenstein except in one instance work did not really interest heart be not in valperga contains many passage of exquisite beauty be a authoress say child of

summoned to effect dissolution of expiring earth in last man pestilence be sole agent tragedy be purely human tale consequently lack magnificence subject might have seemed to invite on other hand gain in pathosa pathos greatly increased when authoress identity be recollected be observed how vividly actual experience traverse web of fiction none can have be affected by mary shelley work so deeply a mary shelley for scenery be that of familiar haunt personage be intimate under thin disguise universal catastrophe be magnified image of overthrow of own fortune there be page on page where word must have come to fraught with unutterably sweet bitter association yet though romance must never be to public what be to author be surprising that criticism must have hitherto done so little justice to pervading nobility of thought to eloquence beauty of very many inspired passage when last man be reprinted will come before world a new work same be case with short tale in collection very existence of be probably unknown to most deeply interested in mary shelley entire class of literature to belong have long ago gone into time wallet a alms for oblivion be exclusively contribution to form of
