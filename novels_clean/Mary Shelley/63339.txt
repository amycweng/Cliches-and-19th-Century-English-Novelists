upon throne within frame be menaced with peculiarly hot season be scarcely judged right that must expose to excessive heat of florentine summer lauretta also cousin promised to accompany if must delay journey until autumn so consented to remain although in truth felt lucca to be to a narrow prison cherished hope of finding healthful feeling slight return of happiness at florence yet joyless state be now portion be one reason why cared not to change bred within indolence of feeling loved to feed upon old care rather than upon new hope sense of duty rather than other sentiment made wish to remove believed that owed to herself to revive from kind of moral death have endured to begin a be fresh life with new expectation be such creature of habit that cling rather to sorrow have be companion of old than to new sprung race of pleasure whose very name perhaps be unknown to euthanasia loved to sit in desolate garden of palace to moralize in own mind when saw tender rose embraced choked by evil weed grew in strength about sometimes to visit tower of palace to look towards rock where castle of valperga have once stood now heap of ruin must endure to look upon formless mass have before constituted shelter home where have stood hall within whose atmosphere have grown to womanhood where have experienced joy that imagination heart storehouse of countless treasure must bestow yet

appear that value in degree deserve gift of life many wonder accompany euthanasia suffered much during summer month that heard of castruccio turned fount of wholesome tear to drop of agony have in truth become tyrant did not slay thousand like ezzelin of padua have received graft of vain glory into soul now bore fruit put to death remorselessly whom suspected must even use torture to discover other victim to satisfy desire of revenge several circumstance of kind happened during summer made euthanasia more miserable than word tear must express if saw enemy uttered deep curse on cruelty if
