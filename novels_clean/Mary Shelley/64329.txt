crowned sir boyvill utmost hope sarcastic congratulation when saw son expressed malice of heart gerard replied with composure that did indeed fear that circumstance must prove fatal to course of justice that must not tamely be submitted to that be going to america to induce osborne to come that nothing might be wanting to elucidate mystery of mother fate to render coming trial full fair satisfactory such announcement rendered for moment sir boyvill speechless with rage violent scene ensued gerard resolved satisfied of propriety of resolution be calm firm sir boyvill habituated to use of vituperative expression boiled over with angry denunciation epithet of abuse called son disgrace of family opprobrium of mankind detractor of mother fame gerard smiled yet at heart deeply felt misery of thus for ever finding opponent in father required enthusiasm passion of nature to banish humiliating saddening influence of sir boyvill indignation parted worse friend than ever sir boyvill

lightened burden of prison hour meanwhile neville arrived in london visited american minister learned from that osborne have given up place held have left washington one knew whither be gone event being still too recent to leave trace behind be evident that to seek find must be work of trouble time neville felt that not moment must be lost december be drawing to close voyage to from america might if not favourable consume whole interval still remained before spring assize hoskins learned be gone to liverpool visited lady cecil before left town though somewhat tainted by worldliness yet very feeling made highly disapprove sir boyvill conduct plausible believed true account be given of mr neville death exonerating redounding indeed to honour be injurious to to cast doubt upon tale be vulgar base to pursue revenge with such malicious cruel pertinacity falkner be gentleman deserved to be treated a such now elizabeth be mixed up in loathsome scene detail made lady cecil shudder even to think of gerard must go to america a advocate a be of falkner startled represented voyage in simpler light a not being undertaken for benefit for sake of justice truth sir boyvill came in upon while be discussing measure be absolutely phrensied by son conduct view exasperation tended to disgust did not operate to shake opinion neville hastened back to liverpool southwest wind reigned whose violence prevented vessel from sailing for america be evident that passage must be long perhaps hazardous neville thought only of delay made anxious portion of time be spent in seeking for hoskins be not to be found at last be notified to that wind have little changed that packet be about to sail hurried on board soon be tossing on tempestuous sea lost sight of land sky ocean dusky one rising at moment into more tumultuous commotion surrounded neville supporting by rope looked out over horizon few month before have anticipated same voyage over summer sea now went under far other auspex veil be raised mystery explained wintry storm that have gathered round be type of tempestuous passion discovery have made raised in heart of for three day night vessel beat about in irish channel unable to make way three day be thus lost to voyage when be to arrive impatient almost terrified by delay attended endeavour neville began to despair of success on fourth night gale rose to hurricane there be choice to run before by noon following day captain thought very lucky to make harbour of liverpool though gale have much abated wind have veered into more favourable quarter be necessary to run in to refit with bitter feeling of disappointment neville disembarked several day must elapse before packet must be able to put to sea so abandoned idea of going by finding new york merchantman preparing to sail at early hour following morning resolved to take passage on board hastened to american coffee house to see captain make necessary arrangement for voyage captain have just left tavern waiter came up to neville told that mr hoskins concerning whom have before inquired be in house in private room show to said neville followed man a went to announce hoskins be not alone have friend with be seated over wine on side of fire neville must not help being struck with confusion evinced by a entered person with hoskins be fair light haired rather good looking man though past prime of life have at once expression of good nature cunning in face added to timid baffled look grew into something very like dismay when waiter announced mr neville good morning sir said hoskins hear that have be inquiring for thought business be settled on side probably replied neville on mine have reason for wishing to see have be seeking in vain in london here yes know said other went round by ravenglass to take leave of old woman before crossed here be passage taken with not hour to lose sail by owyhee captain bateman then will have time enough for inquiry observed neville came here for very purpose of arranging passage with captain bateman sir be going to america thought be at end be more necessary than ever must see osborne must bring over testimony be necessary to clear up mystery hang over mother fate be nearer hanging mr falkner without than with said hoskins must bring over for very purpose of saving man whom believe to be innocent of crime be charged with for purpose go to america wish truth to be established have desire for revenge do really go to america for purpose repeated hoskins certainly consider duty replied neville nay may be said that went for design for sailed by john adam have be driven back by contrary wind disembarked only hour ago beat cried hoskins why do know have more than mind to tell have really sailed for america for purpose of bringing osborne over now intend taking passage on board owyhee certainly why not what be there so strange in sought for sake of making inquiry might guide in search for osborne who wish to conceal must not have addressed better man by lord be craven deserves better so will just let out mr neville osborne sneaked out of room at instant saw come into neville have seen hoskins companion disappear thought act of civility strangeness of coincidence course of event at once so contrary so propitious staggered for moment tell of rattlesnake said hoskins that fixing eye on prey bird becomes fascinated wheel round nearer nearer till fall into jaw of enemy poor osborne wish on shore of pacific to be far enough off here be turn twist a will will end by law grasping by shoulder dragging to very noose so fear to slip into not that helped to murder lady believe that mr neville think that lady be murdered must stake existence that be not said neville be otherwise must have desire to see osborne to interfere strange most strange be that must be here be come think with design of offering testimony to clear mr falkner be come under feigned name replied hoskins under pretence that be sent by osborne have brought quantity of attested declaration hope to serve mr falkner without endangering own neck be even so osborne be weak man good hearted a be called craven sooner did hear that hillary have sailed for europe that might consider safe than grew uneasy on score have still possession even while have denied knowledge of writer of falkner letter representing to necessity of coming over be simply forcibly written word went to heart of osborne now that believed that conduct must make over generous benefactor to ignominious end idea haunted like unlaid ghost yet if hanged falkner what must prevent from hanging too suspicion must fall equally on when hillary have urged case many other objection have presented to osborne mind thought of new honest course have pursued so long honourable station have gained independence respectability of present life shrunk from giving up advantage becoming again in men eye osborne whose rascality have left behind in england seemed hard that must feel weight of chain bound former existence to present one when fondly hoped that time have broken minor consideration vanished a soon a idea of falkner danger fastened on mind be always easy to fall back upon state of being once be ours uncertain disreputable life osborne have once led have gladly bidden adieu to trace be still there must fall into way of without great shock besides knew that hillary have made coming cause of known to legal authority in washington though might persist in denial still felt that must be universally disbelieved dislike at being questioned looked askance upon by american friend made already turn eye westward longing to see old country arose unbidden in heart above must neither rest sleep eat perform of office of life for haunting image of benefactor left by to die felon death not that felt tempted to alter determination to come forward to save on contrary blood grew chill flesh shrunk at thought still might conceal in england one must suspect of being there must be on spot to watch course of event if be supposed that must render assistance without compromising must at least be able to judge fairly how far might concede vacillating mind must go further in conclusion hoskins have rightly compared to bird rattlesnake be fascinated must not avoid drawing nearer nearer to danger believed to be yawning to swallow ten day after hillary left america be crossing atlantic hoskins be first person saw on landing second be neville heart grew cold felt in toil how bitterly repented voyage coward a be died thousand death from fear of one in fact there be danger of incurring that osborne must of own accord have come to england appeared to smooth everything neville did not doubt that must be able to persuade to come forward at right time instructed hoskins to reassure to induce to see if objected to contrive that must meet promised to take measure for securing person to leave in liberty to act a chose depended that same uneasy conscience brought from america to liverpool must induce at last after various throe struggle to act a be supposed must have done at beginning day after day passed osborne be not to be found hoskins have never seen again be impossible to say whither be gone where be hid owyhee whose voyage have again be delayed by contrary wind now sailed hoskins went with be possible that osborne might be on board returning to land of refuge neville saw captain denied having passenger might be bound to secrecy osborne might have disguised neville went on board carefully examined person questioned crew passenger even bribed sailor to inform if one be secreted owyhee be not however only vessel sailing nearly thirty packet merchantman who have be detained by foul wind be waiting for tide to carry out neville deliberated whether must not apply to magistrate for search warrant be averse to nay repugnant be of first importance to utility of osborne a witness that must surrender voluntarily seizing by force a accomplice in murder must only place beside falkner in dock render evidence of avail neville causing arrest must only be regarded a piece of rancorous hostility against accused yet to suffer to depart from english shore be madness worse still to be left in doubt of whether have gone remained if first be ascertained neville must take passage also there might still be time to bring back when act for be far more liable to hesitation than when deed regard ourselves only dread to appear lukewarm dread to mar by officiousness ill success always appears fault yet dare not make bold venture such a must not hesitate upon be own cause neville felt certain that falkner must not deliberate risk to posse of person of osborne still dared not take so perilous perhaps so fatal step tide rose various dock filled one by one american bound vessel dropped out put to sea be moment of agony to neville to see sail unfurl swell to wind make speedy distant offing now began to accuse bitterly of neglect believed that there be one mode of redeeming fault to hurry on board one of packet to arrive in america a soon a osborne whom felt convinced be already on way swift in conviction rash in execution uncertainty be peculiarly hostile to nature moment of vacillation doubt then of self reproach at having lost in consequence be most painful of life to determine to do something be consolation now resolved on voyage hurried back to hotel for few necessary money on entrance letter be put into hand content changed whole current of idea countenance cleared up tumult of thought subsided into happy calm changing plan instead of undertaking voyage to america same evening set out for london chapter xlvi prisoner faithful companion knew nothing of momentous change day by day elizabeth withdrew from fire to only window in father room moving embroidery table close to eye turned however to sky instead of to flower be working leaning cheek upon hand perpetually watched cloud gerard be already fancied on waste of water yet cloud did not change direction sped one way contrary to destination thus passed morning when returned to own abode where heart must more entirely spend thought on lover voyage lonely room be no longer lonely gloomy season longer gloomy more than happy breathless rapture quickened beating of heart a told over again again neville virtue dearer than claim on gratitude falkner saw with pleasure natural effect of love hope add to cheerfulness of beloved child diffuse soft charm over person motion voice impart playful tenderness to before rather serious manner youth love happiness be so very beautiful in conjunction god grant thought mar fair creature life may be happier than alithea if man can be worthy of gerard neville surely be a turned eye silently from book apparently occupied contemplated pensive countenance whose expression showed that be wrapped in yet enjoying thought retrospect made sad went over own life clouded morning glad beam broke out to dissipate cloud final setting amid tempest wreck be life like must be disappointed hope baffled desire lofty imagination engendering fatal act bringing proud thus low must at age view life a did weary wilderness tangled endless labyrinth leading by one rough path to bitter end hoped not innocence must receive other reward from heaven be on day a be thus occupied falkner refrained from interrupting elizabeth revery felt be sweeter to than converse appeared absorbed in reading suddenly exclaimed wind have changed dear father indeed have changed be favourable now do not feel how much colder be wind have got to north there be little east in voyage will not be long one if change only last falkner answered by smile be humiliating to think of object of voyage cheerful voice announcing that be

confusion turnkey left falkner then said osborne deserve thanks for did believe that must come to said osborne deserve thanks looked confused glanced towards elizabeth falkner followed eye understanding look said fear being betrayed by lady osborne be safe here a in america see how be be here under false name one be aware that be man who few week ago refused to appear to save fellow creature from death see way to do now replied osborne hesitatingly come for come must not stay away thought something might be done elizabeth love said falkner at least will thank mr osborne for spontaneous service be watching cloud be to bear along vessel towards beyond hope be already here elizabeth listened breathlessly feared to utter word lest must prove dream now gathering falkner meaning came forward with woman grace addressed trembling man who already looked at door a if longed to be on other side fearful that be caught in own toil for a hoskins said fascinated prey have wheeled yet nearer to fate involuntarily have be unable to resist desire to see falkner learn how be with still resolved not to risk anything have represented to magistrate a coming from osborne

save life manner revealed thought to observant falkner elizabeth le well read in men heart younger more sanguine saw in arrival completion of hope thanked with so much warmth with such heartfelt praise of kindness generosity that osborne began to think that greatest difficulty must be in resisting fascination disappointing wish stammered out at last lame excuse must do consistently with safety might command have shown by coming over more must not be asked must not be expected god knew be innocent so be mr falkner of crime be charged with have hand whatever in transaction be not in confidence have not known even who lady be testimony after must be worth nothing for have nothing to tell for be to expose to disgrace death acquiring courage at sound of own voice osborne grew fluent elizabeth drew back looked anxiously at falkner saw cloud of displeasure scorn gather over countenance put hand on a if to check outbreak of indignation yet a osborne went on turned eye flashing with
