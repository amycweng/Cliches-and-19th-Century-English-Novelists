euthanasia from that heard saw became convinced that be cause of fluctuation of castruccio mind that union must be prevented otherwise must never proceed against guelphs with vigorous hostility be

particularly to notice a friend of castruccio hope to find already recommended to portion of kindness regard euthanasia replied with courtesy to speech galeazzo continued being at head of ghibelines of lombardy be not wonderful that intimacy must subsist between castruccio for interest be same if by alliance hope to extend dominion in north of italy trust name a friend ally will aid in future design even on town design on town repeated euthanasia aye for in truth encourages hope whether be wild practicable hardly know of overthrowing nest of republican making prince imperial vicar of

graciously remit to fault by laying stress on foolish word euthanasia be silent mind be too much disturbed to know immediately what part to take have believed in castruccio promise of peace foundation of very life seemed to give way when faith appeared tainted with falsehood knew to be ambitious suddenly thought struck that galeazzo alluded only to romantic conception of future union among italian state into also have entered might easily be mistaken for scheme of war conquest upon belief renewed conversation told companion that must have mistaken meaning of castruccio that be that chief wish a be of patriotic italian to unite faction caused so much bloodshed misery to country that war be not measure intended to adopt to bring about pacific termination be now galeazzo turn to be silent looked down answered in monosyllable seemed to wish to make euthanasia believe that might have divined well plan of castruccio though must not believe be of so peaceful nature euthanasia continued to talk for seemed to gather faith in what desired from own word galeazzo remained silent replied with downcast eye to appealing word look at length after pause appeared to make struggle to throw off embarassment of demeanour looking up madonna said let intreat to mention subject more if thought that conjecture be right must frankly say so word that utter make believe that antelminelli conceals true design from since have chosen a depositary of secret must be traitor to friendship honour if disclosed will see soon then can unravel mystery in mean time pray rest content with assurance that

that there be nothing wanton in severity yet methinks have better have banished than so many family who now go a beggar through world also be banished once say that prince learn from adversity believe learn cunning in cruelty prosperous can never know nay dear countess speak not so hardly of castruccio be born to rule be noble minded firm of resolution can blame for securing life on welfare of lucca perhaps of italy depends euthanasia did not reply knew although from gentleness of nature have never participated in that there be then in italy spirit of cruelty carelessness for life pain of others rendered le wonderful that castruccio must have adopted mode of conduct similar to of most of contemporary be strange that man born to suffering often writhing beneath must wantonly inflict pain on fellow however cruel individual may be one be so remorseless a ruler for loses even within idea of own individuality fancy that in pampering inclination revenging injury be supporting state state fiction sacrifice that constitutes to support of mere name euthanasia knew that ought not to apply same rule of conduct to prince a to private individual yet that castruccio must have tainted with common vice of tribe be shock unsettled whole frame of mind unveiled at once idol have dwelt in shrine of heart shewed falseness of apotheosis forced to use faculty to dislodge from seat have

be now pursued by remorse madness ghost of victim hunting through world gave rest hope one of company milanese said that be impossible that remorse must have caused madness of messer francesco since in revenging injury wife have done only followed example set by hundred of countryman if have gone beyond in cruelty merely proved that love sense of honour transcended theirs castruccio replied far be from to plead for childish notion must take sword out of hand of prince make bind men of iron with chain of straw doe surprize that man must dare so to idolize a to sacrifice human victim at shrine of pride jealousy revenge francesco be monster when tortured murdered wife be now man feel fitting remorse for so foul deed man may force nature commit deed of horror be human being child of one common mother who will not suffer that one must agonize other without suffering in turn part of anguish have inflicted after time other visitor departed euthanasia be left alone with castruccio for while be silent changeful colour of cheek might shew that love have not forgotten accustomed course rushed in warm flood to heart then ebbed commanded by power hardly le strong than bid ocean pause power of virtue in well formed human heart castruccio watched in returning calmness of eye in unhesitating voice when did speak read of female softness none of female weakness will pardon said at length if speak frankly to not take in ill part expression of reflection to late word have given rise castruccio smiled replied madonna know already what be about to say be mistaken in conclusion said that man must with impunity sacrifice life of fellow creature to own private passion must not torture meaning head of state be no longer private man must act with shameful imbecility if submitted to enemy because dared not punish euthanasia replied to drew lively picture of suffering of exile castruccio answered laughing speak to one wiser on subject than have not be exile do think that forget mournful procession when poor ghibelines left lucca nearly twenty year ago do think that neri must have reigned if have not turned out how must reign if permitted horde of guelphs to sit here plot in

success will spare word blow against who must oppose in undertaking be guelph surely dear girl will not sacrifice happiness to name allow party spirit to get better of more noble feeling of nature euthanasia listened with attention answered in mild sadness doe not appear to castruccio sacrifice thing noble in nature when refuse to unite to enemy of country a ghibeline know that loved be not word alone that cause change fight florentine with word only be still yours more than love florence castruccio do love peace heart bleeds to think that cessation of bloodshed devastation poor

with one voice that castle must be reduced following morning castruccio bade arrigo di guinigi carry message to euthanasia arrigo have always be favourite with countess castruccio thought that must be more delicate forbearing to send one so young unpresuming a bearer of most displeasing message euthanasia received youth with kindness talked on various subject carefully refrained from mentioning castruccio name alluding to late transaction at lucca be long before arrigo must summon courage to introduce topic at length said madonna bear message to from prince euthanasia changed colour when be
