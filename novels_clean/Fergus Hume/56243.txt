to be said patricia departed when closed front door of home of art found in street became aware that night be damp dense with gas light however shone blurred vague through white mist so there be need for to use lantern one be about not even policeman in curve of cul de sac at event when passed into straight line of crook street almost fell into arm of constable who be standing under lamp patricia paused to ask question will fog get worse officer think will miss said man touching helmet bending to look at face must advise not to go far be only going to park to see friend answered miss carrol heedlessly then remembering that be complete stranger whom have to see one to whom be not even to speak regretted having be so doubtfully truthful what be time asked to cover confusion half past eight o'clock miss said constable consulting fat silver watch best go home again miss might get lost in fog in park there be rough character about oh be right thank said patricia with bright smile passed along same now began to feel uncomfortable to realize that hyde park on foggy november night be not exactly place for young lady only desire to earn coveted five pound nerved to do have agreed to do crook street be not far from main entrance to park on bayswater side a fog grew thin further on patricia found speedily on broad path lead directly to serpentine bridge knew portion of park extremely well a having much time on hand frequently wandered about grassy space on idle afternoon there be few people about a night be so disagreeable saw moved swiftly past occasionally caught glimpse of vague form under tree never looked closely at night prowler keeping in middle of path moved steadily to destination at last came to bridge took up station at right hand corner on near side having come to end of journey lighted lantern across water broad bridge stretched weirdly vanishing into fog here grew denser like bridge of life in vision of mirza patricia have read addison fantastic story in school book be suggested to again by sight before people came out of mist disappeared into again passed unconscious of quiet figure at corner while others peered into face one addressed much to relief ruddy light of lantern shone like angry star then expected happened in one moment quite without preparation man came swiftly over bridge so swiftly that might have be said that be running have time to see what be like in look how be dressed before caught sight of red light stopped for one moment to thrust small box into hand then darted away to left disappeared along bank on bayswater side be chapter ii what happened for moment patricia stood still with box in hand stared into gloomy fog behind man be retreating man passed swiftly a if in pursuit of first halted for one single moment to look at be indistinct figure in misty air must feel that eye be piercing through through few second later disappeared also whither went must not tell whole oddity of episode startled although much that have taken place have be anticipated described by mr pentreddle a name flashed across miss carrol brain remembered that have yet to complete mission by taking back box to old lady almost mechanically with lantern still burning began to retrace step in direction of bayswater fog be growing denser by knowledge of path feel of hard gravel under foot be enabled to avoid getting lost sudden sense of weariness doubt came from slackening of nervous tension overcame be glad to sink down on first bench came to be near gas lamp in blurred circle of light felt safe from attention of night bird then strange thing happened be sensation nothing more one connected with small box held so tightly clasped in hand a gripped felt with sixth sense doubt that wave of force be radiating from interior patricia body being celtic be strung with extraordinarily delicate nerve by be made aware of many influence passed by le highly organized mortal nine human being out of ten must not have felt radiating influence of be contained in box did a wave after wave extended outward felt a though invisible force be driving back invisible evil nervous fear have hitherto felt wonder considering hour place mission vanished entirely smiled to think that anything must ever have frightened warm light felt rather than seen seemed to envelop within charmed circle evil must come have robber attacked have earthquake happened have storm of thunder lightning devastated air must not have felt least fear regular wave of strange force passed ever outward repelling harm fear body thrilled to pulsation be a though unseen being be draping in mantle of power naturally connected weird manifestation with box that with mr pentreddle how came asked that so commonplace woman must be connected with so extraordinary object then recollected that have not set eye on object whatever might be yet to do so have only to look into box opening shutter of lantern in glass be set so that must see by natural light not by red glare examined box be common deal case very small very roughly made with lid held down by thin wire in fact be only one of box furnished by shopkeeper to customer so delicate good china glass such like might be carried away without danger of breakage be not even swathed in paper bound with string seemed strange that if what box contained be valuable dangerous more precaution have not be taken in rendering content safe then again man who have delivered in so odd way have be overcome with fear patricia guessed that when remembered laboured breathing backward glance have thrown over shoulder hurried way in have made off after thrusting box into hand finally there be doubt that other man who have halted for moment be in pursuit patricia looked up when arrived at point of meditation must see one although heard footstep dying away others approaching on hard gravel time be considering thing wave of power still continued to radiate a have banished fear have also stimulated limb no longer felt weary being case half rose to return to home of art since there be longer reason for delay being woman be curious desired to see what be that produced queer sensation indeed le inquisitive person must have also acted a now did for be desire of to learn why wherefore of unknown almost without thinking certainly without consideration patricia untwisted wire peered into depth of box in vivid light of lamp green radiance flashed upward outward uttered exclamation of surprise delight must scarcely have be woman have not done so at bottom of tiny box a if have be hastily thrown in be jewel like of have never set eye on with gasp of pleasure took in hand never casting thought to danger of public examination at dark hour in lonely locality might easily have be robbed rendered insensible by blow a sat there spell bound gazing at brilliant object just covered palm of gloved hand more lovely thing have never seen luminous green poured from heart of large emerald perfectly cut polished formed centre of flower petal of be cut out of hard dull green stone with exquisite art a girl stared entirely fascinated by sight became aware that whole lovely jewel represented chrysanthemum blossom of emerald be central glory from radiated regular petal of blossom layer upon layer in perfect circle until outward round extended in delicate point to quarter of compass like corona of sun a wonderful object lay on open hand patricia felt still more strongly wave of invisible force radiated therefrom be a if glorious power be welling up from depth of emerald to stream off from carved petal be wonder that stared half hypnotized by marvel suddenly even stranger thing happened in single moment a seemed force appeared to falter weaken light felt be around died away darkness of night closed in with uncomfortable swiftness radiance vanished from jewel with rush fear came back a though magic longer kept at bay felt sensation at in carved chrysanthemum saw glory charm be simply beautiful ornament nothing more just a realized with murmur of dismay someone suddenly leaped lightly forward snatched jewel from hand before must rise to foot robber disappeared into mist running a delicately swiftly a startled cat terrified girl be left alone in fog with empty box for single moment remained stunned motionless then leaving lantern umbrella empty box behind started to run wildly after thief vaguely guessing direction have taken in few minute have completely lost amongst tree then became aware with shock of fear that have left path for grassy space of park there be sign of robber peer a might here there everywhere into surrounding gloom sank down on wet sward under dripping tree to weep with shame at failure of mission have betrayed trust have lost treasure how must face mr pentreddle without have be sent to fetch for curiosity in opening box valuable jewel must not have be stolen thief of night must have seen examining beauty by lantern light forthwith have secured for own might be be second thought man who have followed other man who have paused to look at piercing darkness with cat like vision be thief in case there might be chance of recovering jewel a mr pentreddle might know name of person who desired property be mr pentreddle property if be why must have be delivered in so mysterious fashion why must first man have be afraid of second man who pursued finally presuming that pursuer have snatched ornament from hand why must have done so patricia head buzzed with question sat on watery grass almost weeping at inability to answer one of position be terrible have lost jewel five pound also a mr pentreddle certainly must not pay money be not time for weeping be patricia carrol very tearful person only thing to be done be to return to mr pentreddle make clean breast of whole occurrence old lady might know how to deal with matter seeing that there be strange tale connected with deal box content of patricia be unaware such knowledge must probably enable mr pentreddle to take step for recovery of property police must be called in here girl paused must police be called in considering mystery of whole affair patricia on swift reflection thought not thought here patience gave way rose hastily unable to put up further with torment of vexed brain most obvious thing to be done be to see mr pentreddle at once explain there be other course open to girl nerve quivered at thought of very unpleasant quarter of hour must probably have however be use being coward stumbled a quickly a must towards broad path anxious to reach bench upon have left umbrella lantern empty box night be so gloomy fog so dense that became confused amidst multiplicity of tree with violence ran against one falling half stunned to ground lay there quite unable to rise patricia be clever self reliant girl accustomed to act immediately firmly in emergency adventure have robbed of calmness of will power felt a though end of world have come in cold damp lonely darkness must have cried for help comfort like frightened child retained sufficient self command not to do so even exerted will sufficiently to again stagger to foot strive to find bearing with outstretched hand wandered trying to gain glimpse of light in vain then began nightmare journey through gloomy wood here be girl in heart of london a wholly lost a babe in primeval forest stumbled here groped there in aimless fashion until sens became so confused that did not know what to do several time dropped several time rose for hour a seemed moved onward towards ever receding goal doubtless be moving in circle after fashion of lost in vague wandering lost count of time in heart began to wish that dawn must come to reveal whereabouts a in darkness certainly must never succeed in escaping from enchantment of urban wood so patricia dragged on night dragged on effort to get back to light humanity became journey in eternity towards a seemed to now bewildered sens goal have actual existence how long wandered did not know having lost count of time finally instinct moved in right direction gained broad path be not one have strayed from a speedily ascertained when chanced upon policeman path to bayswater miss said turning bull eye light on face wondering at haggard look bedraggled dress why be right on other side of park miss near statoo patricia knew that be so for above in foggy air rose lofty pedestal of achilles statue must have wandered deviously across vast space of park said so policeman readily accepted explanation added one of own dessay have got

for adventure have left weak wandered off bayswater path near serpentine be mercy miss that did fall in what will do now miss patricia walked with towards gate near clock call cab said for although must ill afford decided to drive a be quite impossible to walk fog forbade pedestrianism let alone that be much too weary to trudge way to crook street what cab miss certainly miss although will be hard to find one in fog constable whistled shrilly what be time please patricia asked same question a have put to other policeman half past eleven miss girl uttered cry of astonishment well might having left home of art at half past eight must have be wandering about for at least three hour seemed century hastily made for cab drove slowly up looking like spectre in fog what must mr pentreddle think of being absent for so long question be nothing beside one old lady be bound to ask with respect to lost emerald tell man to drive to iii crook street bayswater said patricia feverishly bestowed in hansom here handed kindly policeman one of precious coin accepted with salute gave necessary direction to driver in few minute patricia be on homeward way thankful that strange adventure have not cost life a might have done thought be extremely unpleasant have lost umbrella must ill afford to do also lantern of mr pentreddle worst of extraordinary jewel have be sent to fetch how must explain only answer must find be very obvious one that must be best to tell truth then began to think what word must use until head became confused dropped into uneasy sleep meanwhile cab crawled slowly cautiously through fog towards home of art patricia be made aware that have arrived at destination by sudden jerk of vehicle a came to standstill then still sleep bemused alighted in stumbling manner to find in arm of mr sellars oh dear where have be be terrible be terrible good lady wrung fat hand oh what be to be done what be terrible asked patricia stupidly for head ached mr pentreddle own

enter drawing room by jovial looking man whose must be military air did not suit look be stout red faced grey haired bluff in manner resembling typical john bull more than anything else tried to be stiff failed in buckram civility when forgot that be inspector harkness remembered that be primarily human being miss carrol be so pretty graceful in spite of white face drooping air result of fatigue that officer beamed on approvingly having placed chair for one for mr sellars who be to be present at interview became aware that have duty to perform looked a stern a possibly must now young lady

with imperious glance what do mean what say answered patricia whose nerve be giving way man came snatched jewel from hand while looked at jewel cried mr sellars alertly what jewel one be in deal box box unknown man thrust into hand asked harkness of course must not have opened box did so because patricia hesitated seemed useless to tell two very matter of fact people about weird sensation have felt while holding jewel a must neither understand believe swiftly changing mind ended sentence differently because whole circumstance be so strange that wished to know what be in box be afraid that mr pentreddle have sent on nefarious errand yes be with good reason said patricia harkness nodded approvingly mr sellars disagreed why martha be most religious woman so good a to be almost unpleasant must never have sent on errand have to do with anything wrong dear can judge for said miss carrol quietly be telling have taken place harkness pondered say that left house at half past eight wandered in hyde park until half past eleven how can prove very easily mr inspector met policeman in crook street when left house asked time told that be half past eight at half past eleven spoke to policeman near achilles statue saying have lost in fog asked time also told to whistle up cab said be half past eleven got cab mr sellars told in bedroom that have questioned cabman sir so must substantiate story harkness nodded yes told that policeman have put in cab at hyde park corner about time mentioned see that can account for leaving house returning to what be doing in meantime have told said patricia annoyed at having word doubted yes have told can prove what say luckily can unless thing be stolen what thing umbrella lantern empty box left on bench in broad bayswater path be sitting there when man robbed what be man who robbed like ca say be foggy only remained for single moment be man who gave box like can only make same answer said patricia incident happened so swiftly that have time to observe anything if will send to park will perhaps find article left on bench inspector nodded rising from chair went out of room mr sellars caught girl hand when be alone what doe mean dear asked helplessly ca say replied patricia shaking head know know must form own opinion what be yours have none be quite bewildered at moment inspector harkness re entered room returned to seat have sent to broad walk in hyde park said bluffly so if story be true article will be found story be true said patricia flushing with anger while be away someone may have sat on bench have taken article finished officer dryly well yes hope for sake that tale very strange one will be substantiated by proof do believe that be telling falsehood asked patricia in most indignant manner believe nothing say nothing until article be found if be not inspector hesitated looked awkward did not reply patricia stood up trying to control nerve quivering from head to foot perhaps accuse of murdering mr pentreddle before went out dear cried mr sellars catching hand kindly doctor say that poor martha be murdered about ten o'clock a can prove that be absent by mean of policeman cabman one can accuse of crime know said mr sellars bursting into tear that must hurt fly much le martha who liked in disagreeable way be not accusing miss carrol beg to say remarked inspector a soon a secured moment to speak whole tale be so strange that miss carrol can not blame if desire proof naturally high spirited young lady doe like to be questioned in way mind being questioned interrupted patricia hot irish blood aflame be being doubted that object to natural enough natural enough said harkness soothingly one can not bring personal feeling into legal matter have daughter of age miss carrol have sympathy with position a man father fully believe word say a officer be obliged to disbelieve until have proof if demand jury coroner will when where asked patricia startled at inquest will be most important witness miss carrol know who committed crime doe anyone else can tell coroner jury what have told hope that article left on bench will be forthcoming to prove truth of extraordinary story come miss carrol must see that be trying to make thing a pleasant a possible for consistent with official responsibility yes said patricia sat down again for after must not deny what story sounded very incredible a yet have not told most incredible portion a have to do with own peculiar sixth sense be very certain inspector mr sellars possessed a have not got how useless must be a fully recognized to relate sensation caused by stolen jewel tale be improbable enough so there be need to make still more so can describe what be stolen harkness asked patricia did so explanation be received with exclamation of surprise by mr sellars with somewhat sceptical air by inspector patricia saw doubt grew annoyed again what be use of telling thing when wo believe before harkness must answer very natural question young constable entered placed on table article have be left on bench in foggy park miss carrol spread out hand triumphantly yes said inspector interpreting gesture believe story now young lady here be proof ah yes groaned mr sellars rocking where be jewel chapter iv inquest destiny work in most mysterious way frequently evil brings on individual becomes parent of good during three year have passed since death of father patricia have faced much trouble for girl of twenty two have money have possessed friend until met with mr sellars so career have be painful one of toil penury heart felt despair last misfortune connected with commission of crime seemed to be greatest blow have befallen truly believed that be now entirely ruined for who a argued must engage a governess girl who be mixed up in so shady business even if must prove innocence have doubt on score mere fact of errand to park be so fantastic in explanation that many people must believe have invented in order to shield from arrest in nine case out of ten might have happened destiny ordained that patricia case must be tenth through darkness of cloud environed sun of prosperity broke unexpectedly of course next day newspaper contained detail of murder at home of art mystery fascinated public crook street be never so full since have be thoroughfare motor car hansom cab four wheeler taxicab cart bicycle conveyance of description came to curved cul de sac also sight seer on foot came to survey house number iii appeared in daily illustrated paper when reporter became more fully acquainted with what have taken place portrait of patricia appeared also together with account of how murdered woman have induced to leave house be generally considered notwithstanding that errand have be proved to be genuine one mr pentreddle have sent girl away in order that might see mysterious person who have murdered if be not so argued everybody how came that man people be certain that criminal be man have gained admission into house examination of snick to window have proved that be too stiff to be pressed back from outside indeed that upper lower sash of window be so close together that blade of knife must not be slipped in between plainly man must not have entered in way so only assumption be natural appeared to be that dead woman have admitted by door fact that middle window be unlatched slightly open be accounted for by presumption that man have left in way why must have chosen odd mean of exit when must have more easily have left by front door theorist did not pretend to explain however general opinion be that patricia fantastic tale be true finding of article on bench evidence of two policeman together with cabman statement proved that mr pentreddle have got rid of a inconvenient witness to unpleasant interview how unpleasant have proved for mr pentreddle must be plainly seen from fact that be now dead that jury coroner be about to sit on remains harkness have gathered together what evidence must be not much reporter be on qui vive for startling revelation to be made whole affair be so out of ordinary that journalist anxious to fill up column of respective paper during dull season made most of very excellent unusual copy supplied to added to took away from so distorted truth plain fact became even more sensational than truly be painting of lily brought miss carrol into prominence a heroine of day girl shrank from such sordid publicity be useless to try hide a searchlight of journalism played fiercely upon that be so pretty only added to attractiveness of unwholesome episode when portrait be published patricia received at least six offer of marriage of naturally refused be indeed very indignant that must have be made mr sellars be rather surprised at indignation a having instinct of successful actress looked on such publicity a excellent advertisement dear said impressively two three day after murder when home of art be centre of attraction to morbid people sorry a be that martha poor darling met with sad death there be denying that tragedy will do house good oh cried patricia highest instinct outraged how can talk so be sensible woman must talk so said ma firmly tear sorrow wo bring martha back again perhaps be better where be a certainly never enjoyed life in sensible way since be case let take good out of evil thought dear that home must have be ruined instead of that have become famous must fill place twice over a so many people wish to come intend to keep present lodger at same price never will be said that made capital out of dear sister death dear need not be so particular since be not connected with in flesh blood way a be do see patricia shivered mr sellars really see be connected with poor mr pentreddle in blood way certainly for if have not gone out must have be alive now well dear must help going out since have to go on errand one know better than do how obstinate martha be well be gone a soon a have settled who killed must send to devonshire to devonshire echoed patricia surprised yes did tell that squire colpster whose housekeeper be have come to london well be in town now called to see to day be very shocked at martha death intends to take body back to lay in beckleigh churchyard near of late husband perhaps must say late husband although be not sure that 'it can have husband be very kind of squire colpsters be always kind be coming to see afternoon before inquest take place what about asked patricia uneasily wish to hear story from own lip be in paper much of what paper say be untrue better advertisement said mr sellars cheerfully be quite sure dear that trouble be over can marry when choose certainly sha marry horrid men who have have impertinence to write to declared patricia indignantly oh must if find one of men be nice rich if feel inclined to marry be at least sufficiently widely known to get good situation patricia shuddered again to soul who must engage girl connected with horrid crime lot of people said mr sellars promptly crime be not so horrid a mysterious who can have murdered martha why everyone be asking that question mr sellars one seems to obtain answer observed good lady mournfully not even inspector harkness police well dear must go see about dinner remember what said to have magnificent boom on just now if take full advantage of be made for life miss carrol did not know whether to laugh to scold when ma left finally took refuge in quiet merriment notwithstanding disgust at finding centre of such sordid sensation good natured kind a mr sellars undoubtedly be idea that must urge anyone a phrased to make capital out of sister death revolted patricia finer feeling certainly since old actress intended to retain child even though must have obtained more lucrative boarder be behaving extraordinarily well considering limitation in spite of own self denial theatrical instinct be so very strong that have to induce someone to make use of advertisement a must not bear to see such chance of gaining wide publicity wasted quite grieved that patricia must so persistently refuse especially when considered that girl required money miss carrol not only declined to entertain idea kept a much a must to own room refused interview to several inquisitive reporter have business capability mourned ma to playwright why if have happened to when be on stage must have doubled salary in week trebled in month statement be undoubtedly true since majority of people greatly enjoy morbid squire colpster a patricia learned country gentleman be always called at beckleigh also by mr sellars who be beckleigh woman appeared at home of art immediately before inquest be held therefore have scanty opportunity of talking with girl although managed to exchange few word turned out to be tall lean rather bent man with dry ivory hued skin gold rimmed spectacle perched on aquiline nose term squire suited john bull personality of inspector harkness better than did quiet student patricia although did not learn at moment what mr colpster particular study be gathered that passed greater part of day in well furnished library only tragic death of old valued servant gentleman hinted must have brought up to london during very damp month of november spoke with considerable emotion poor martha how strange be that must have come to town to meet with terrible doom be never so shocked in life a when read telegram sent by mr sellars do know why came to london asked patricia bluntly mr colpster shook head be covered with rather long iron grey hair in true student fashion only know that martha wanted to go for fortnight jaunt to london own word rather think although did not say so added squire musingly that expected to meet son harry who be sailor be in town now believe so nephew theodore dane told that have seen over week ago harry then said that have returned from far east be going later to amsterdam for few day if have carried out intention expect that be ignorant of mother death when hears of will return immediately think a harry be greatly attached to mother if anyone can find assassin harry pentreddle will a be smart very tenacious of anything take up wish knew where be in amsterdam miss carrol a must then send telegram patricia pondered wonder if can throw light on motive for commission of crime seems impossible a harry having be on year voyage have not seen mother for twelve month be just possible that a martha be week in town before murder may have seen harry in interval of course understand martha only sprained foot on night previous to death slipped on stair said patricia mechanically son certainly have not be here mr sellars must have told have idea what caused crime to be committed mr colpster pondered in turn rather think will wait until inquest be ended before answering question said judicially wo answer at inquest so that truth of matter may be known urged girl puzzled by tone may not be asked question at inquest said mr colpster blandly declined to discus matter further indeed there be time a be summoned at moment to drawing room where juryman under control of coroner be waiting for various witness have already inspected body of unfortunate woman be lying in upstairs bedroom a have be before stated inspector harkness have very little evidence to lay before in authority criminal whether man woman have disappeared in what seemed to be magical manner officer must do did do be to produce various witness to relate baldly what have taken place must say very little nothing must be proved save martha pentreddle have be murdered by whom for what reason be impossible to say inspector gave hurried sketch of have happened since have be summoned to home of art then called first witness be mr sellars who wept great deal spoke volubly adopting best dramatic manner so a to create sensation for be always mindful in spite of genuine grief that what said must be printed in great newspaper chance of advertising a retired star of drama be too good to be lost in spite of good lady volubility have really very little information to give sister mr pentreddle have come to london six day previous to death from devonshire where be housekeeper to squire colpster ostensibly on plea of shopping have gone out great deal nearly always witness be with deceased have not spoken to anyone in particular have certainly mentioned that son harry have returned from far east that hoped to see before returned to devonshire harry have written have called must have be so pleased to see harry who be very charming nephew to have ended mr sellars with doubtful grammar did deceased mention that be expecting anyone on night be murdered asked coroner gravely oh dear sir have done so must have forbidden to receive single person a be slightly feverish from sprain caused by slipping on stair be not in condition to see anyone in fact be most unwilling to leave implored to do so a knew how interested be in drama of mr samuel amersham only on condition that someone remained to look after did agree to go miss carrol kindly promised to remain so departed quite happy only to return said mr sellars with burst of emotion to find that martha have gone to bourne whence traveller return deceased never hinted to that be in danger of life never be quite happy be a happy a must be with religious view be extremely dull have idea of dying for told that hoped harry must return with to devonshire did know of anything in life led to believe that have enemy who desired death certainly not martha never made enemy in life although certainly be reverse of agreeable be a dull a be bright said mr sellars blushing comedy tragedy pa called remark ended examination a witness apparently must throw light on darkness environed crime doctor who have be called in to examine body stated that deceased have be murdered by sharp instrument being thrust into throat have pierced jugular vein miserable woman becoming unconscious almost at once have slowly bled to death hair be in disorder when discovered body be lying half on half off sofa be doctor opinion that assassin grasping hair have drawn back victim head so that must more easily accomplish deadly purpose from nature of wound be probably inflicted by fine narrow blade witness thought that stiletto might have be used from condition of body death have undoubtedly taken place at ten o'clock probably since death be caused by hmorrhage deceased must have be struck down minute earlier be medical evidence obtainable although proved clearly how mr pentreddle died must not show who have committed crime use of word stiletto gave coroner idea only foreigner must use such weapon remarked witness disagreed word suggests italian because be name of weapon extensively employed by bravi of middle age murderer of other nation must use just a naturally if came to hand besides only assume from nature of wound smallness of orifice that stiletto be used be sure that be right however coroner rather agreed a also be doctor have seen wound must there have be stiletto in house asked generally yes cried mr sellars unexpectedly from seat near door became prodigiously excited what be asked coroner a doctor stepped away from place assigned to witness what do say mr sellars at once occupied vacated position now remember that only three day before poor dear martha met with death be showing of old stage dress there be page costume wore in duke motto with be jewel stiletto pooh pooh stage weapon said coroner contemptuously not at not at friend of mine who admired acting gave real italian stiletto to wear in part very dangerous weapon be sharp pointed daresay martha be killed with have missed put away dress never thought of looking martha must easily have taken while back be turned just wait sir will go see before coroner must give permission mr sellars a active a young girl be out of room there be pause a be impossible to continue examination of other witness until important point be settled everyone looked at one one spoke a be felt that here at least be tangible clue in very short space of time mr sellars returned red faced out of breath waving empty sheath be not here declared quickly giving gold embroidered sheath to coroner be found martha must have taken stiletto why must demanded coroner doubtfully ask said mr sellars vulgarly with shrug there be only one inference to be drawn from absence of weapon mr pentreddle knew that be in danger have therefore armed against possible attempt being made on life chapter v inquest continued until came to examination of patricia very little be learned from deposition of various witness summoned to give evidence that boarder servant must say be that mr pentreddle although not extremely sociable person have behaved quietly in way have kept very much to herself have mentioned business in coming to london to one certainly have never hinted in slightest degree that possessed enemy who desired to take life who dwelt beneath hospitable roof of home of art expressed surprised at death of poor woman there be nothing apparent on surface of thing a one witness observed to lead up to catastrophe be entirely unexpected unforeseen bunson butler deposed that before leaving house with fellow servant for theatre have locked three drawing room window when police examined room afterwards middle one of have be found unfastened slightly open assuredly must not have be difficult for assassin to have come along iron balcony to window there have tapped for admittance bunson swore positively that unless deceased have opened window man must not have entered be witness who have found body stated that have not touched until be seen by inspector harkness underling be at point in answer to question of juryman that inspector admitted absence of weapon with deceased have be killed stiletto have be found either in drawing room in part of house so be presumed that criminal must have taken away with wonder that did not place stiletto in hand of dead woman so that might be supposed have committed suicide said juryman probably did not think that must be proved that deceased have taken stiletto from sister room when stage costume be being displayed suggested juryman have not yet learned if murder be committed with weapon be coroner remark call george colpster then came turn of squire to be examined must tell nothing likely to aid in discovery of criminal mr pentreddle declared have be housekeeper for over twenty year have rarely gone away on holiday have asked for fortnight leave so that might pay visit to mr sellars in london have readily granted have never told reason why wished to go to london presumed at time that intended to see sailor son during stay when fact rather suggested fact became known coroner recalled mr sellars learned again what might have known have learned before have referred to note that harry pentreddle have never be near house when mr sellars stepped away again from position allotted to witness squire colpster finished evidence by swearing solemnly that housekeeper have never hinted that be in danger of life yet must have thought so observed juryman else must not have taken stiletto have not yet proved that murder be committed with weapon snapped coroner once more of course real interest of case truly began when patricia carrol be sworn since apparently knew more about matter than did anyone else moreover have be last person to see mr pentreddle alive gave evidence quietly clearly relating have taken place from time mr pentreddle have asked to go on errand to time returned to learn that during absence wretched woman have be stabbed on occasion a on other when harkness have questioned patricia left out confession of sensation when holding stolen jewel judged very wisely too that statement of kind must be put down to hysteria coroner juryman questioned cross questioned witness in way must cause to deviate from detail originally gave mr pentreddle have promised to explain about matter when witness returned unforeseen death have ended chance of explanation in quarter be death unforeseen by asked coroner catching at word used by patricia certainly replied readily expected to find mr pentreddle ready to receive when returned expected to receive five pound sir have failed in errand have asked to do therefore did not desire to be paid can describe appearance of man who placed box in hand appearance of thief told so before men came went in flash even if have waited must have be impossible for to have noticed dress look a fog be so thick night be so dark did man speak came went in silence policeman in crook street at hyde park corner proved that have met patricia that have severally asked time also cabman deposed to driving young lady back to home of art so without difficulty whatsoever be proved that miss carrol have be absent from house when crime have be committed crook street policeman also swore that have seen no suspicious people haunting beat fog be so thick ended witness that must have be difficult to see anyone unless someone ran into arm a young lady did be pea soup night sir concluded evidence harkness be able to get after pause coroner began speech before got very far door of drawing room be hastily flung open sammy amersham playwright dashed in holding dagger aloft be stiletto cried triumphantly clapped down on table under coroner nose when be asking question about remembered unfastened middle window wondered if assassin have opened same to throw weapon into area when have killed poor mr pentreddle went down searched found must have thrown out a guessed then have stepped in to close window leave by front door there be blood on too be stiletto mr sellars asked coroner passing along woman shuddered a took be mine sure enough said there be blood on handle ugh dropped be blood sammy playwright be sworn stated again how have found weapon in area below iron balcony amongst rubbish said mr amersham be area ever used asked coroner quickly called out mr sellars tradespeople go round to back by side passage gate in iron railing round area have be locked ever since have be in house one must think of looking for stiletto there last witness did said coroner dryly show that be got making of dramatist said mr sellars proudly although one saw connection between coroner assertion comment one thing be clear from discovery of weapon in area namely that mr pentreddle must have be afraid of attack else must never have armed by stealing dagger from sister also be certain that sammy shrewd explanation be feasible that assassin after killing unfortunate woman have opened window to drop stiletto into unused area deceased must have expected visitor on night said coroner musingly probably sent miss carrol away so that must see undisturbed did not tell that expected anyone said patricia quickly must not seeing that evidently desired to have secret interview a be alone in house assuredly must have admitted must not leave sofa with sprained foot cried mr sellars perhaps must not have crawled to front door remarked coroner will evidently enabled to crawl to middle window open why must man have come to middle window by appointment impossible said mr sellars nervously in first place martha must have told have intended to see anyone pardon madam interrupted coroner sharply very fact that deceased sent away miss carrol showed that desired interview to be secret one must not have admitted man who intended to murder did one else must have admitted fact of open middle window showed how be admitted opened that to throw out stiletto probably did that undoubtedly window be opened before mr pentreddle must not have crawled to front door martha have so strong will that must have crawled to top of house if have made up mind to say again never must have let in man whoever be to murder poor dear believe expected to be murdered dagger precisely madam criminal did not bring with therefore did not enter house with intention of committing crime deceased be afraid of man thus took stiletto so a to keep at distance probably threatened with there be struggle during be murdered then assassin searched house for what asked mr sellars shaking head sadly for strange jewel described by miss carrol be in martha possession when quite so interrupted coroner dryly assassin evidently believed that mr pentreddle possessed struggled with to see if be concealed upon when drew forth stiletto with have provided be used to kill then assassin a said before searched bedroom one thing must ask mr sellars before close evidence did anyone know that mr pentreddle must be alone on night of death be alone miss carrol be with yes know did anyone know that house must be empty ca say of course sammy play be talked about lot everyone said be going even let servant go yes yes do think anyone outside house knew that there must be clear field ca say mr sellars shook head talked lot to everyone outside in saying that be going know anyone who must have murdered poor martha coroner speech be not very long a really there be little to say whether mr pentreddle have really expected someone have therefore sent away miss carrol so that interview might be private be quite impossible to prove in way that deceased anticipated danger be more le clearly shown by theft of stiletto from sister undoubtedly assassin a nature of wound presence of blood stain on handle of weapon suggested have turned dead woman mean of defence against finally idea that criminal desired jewel stolen from patricia in park be equally impossible of proof in fact ended coroner wearily for business have be exhausting beyond undoubted truth that mr pentreddle be dead can prove nothing in way be also opinion of juryman be very natural considering scanty nature of evidence without hesitation ordinary verdict given in doubtful case be brought in wilful murder against person person unknown said jury present felt that nothing more nothing le must be said under sad circumstance believe that will ever learn who slaughtered poor martha sighed mr sellars over cup of tea when everyone save boarder have departed will just bury in devonshire beside husband try to be cheerful again harry will say when learns know for be desperately fond of mother be sorry for murdering villain if harry ever lay hand on never will bless dear most people believed that mr sellars spoke truth whole affair be mysterious be confidently asserted that murder of mr pentreddle must be relegated to list of undiscovered crime immediate result of inquest be offer made by prominent music hall manager to patricia a heroine of crook street crime be suggested that must appear on stage in pretty frock relate experience in hyde park at salary of two hundred pound week magnificence of chance almost took away mr sellars breath be greatly disappointed when patricia refused to make show of girl phrased in way indignantly declined oh dear cried mr sellars almost weeping need money so badly must sooner need life than degrade in way retorted miss carrol looking prettier than ever with cheek flushed eye sparkling how dare man insult insult dear two hundred pound week insult take mr sellars replied patricia impatiently after poor mr pentreddle be sister will be just a great object of interest to crowd a must be be not young pretty dear be thing tell patricia shrugged shoulder well refuse have written to man saying can not accept offer refuse good money refuse to get married be going to do for livelihood mr sellars be in despair over obstinacy patricia shrugged shoulder once more oh daresay will manage to earn living in decent way perhaps mr colpster may help what make think so be coming to see evening know be coming said mr sellars thought be to see last of poor martha remains take to beckleigh to morrow by afternoon train must have gone to attend funeral be impossible to leave child looked at patricia curiously wonder if want to marry dear hope not said miss carrol hastily how thought do run on marriage mr sellars well be too pretty to remain single miss carrol said old actress frankly sammy must marry if must only encourage can tell sammy amersham have great future then sha hamper with wife what

much to be done with getting poor martha ready for last journey have to see undertaker men dear mr sellars waddled away in great hurry patricia wondered what mr colpster wished to see about wondered also what must be matter with girl so oddly termed mara last piece of curiosity be not gratified for day learned first two hour later when squire colpster interviewed in mr sellars private sitting room what said to took breath away return to beckleigh to morrow with corpse of housekeeper said squire in dry way struck that might be willing to come with to devonshire come with mr colpster gasped patricia thunderstruck yes said simply directly see martha be dead want someone to look after house to be companion to daughter to mara queried patricia remembering what mr sellars have said ah know

of home of art showed ma surrounded by child standing at front door waving farewell blowing kiss miss carrol sighed be good kind simple same be glad to have left that dreary house be connected in mind with so woeful tragedy excitement be now at end since verdict of jury have be given be probable that in few day whole affair must be forgotten for there seemed to be chance that interest must be re awakened by capture of assassin evil creature have stolen into house out of mist to kill victim have then departed again into darkness now patricia herself be departing from scene of crime seemed to a though horrible chapter in life be closed for ever thank god for said girl putting thought into speech at paddington station found squire colpster waiting for body of late housekeeper informed have already gone on to devonshire by early morning train patricia be glad of a if corpse have be in train be to travel in must have felt a though be taking portion of disagreeable past with into what

thing bevis colpster threw away for knighthood did good for title did not even descend to child fortune have dwindled since then until have only what mention unless emerald be recovered what now posse will also leave family will die out even a be ended bitterly have son to succeed patricia wondered at what took to be superstition in so clever man saw that must not be argued out of fancy therefore pretended to accept belief a true asked question what became of emerald inquired eagerly for family legend interested colpster roused sunken eye flashed keenly when will adam went to japan in a pilot of jacques mahay fleet queen gave emerald to present to potentate in east to emperor of japan because fleet sailed from amsterdam did not intend to go to japan be wrong in saying so be going to indie akbar be reigning then emerald be for adam be wrecked on coast of japan when became favourite with shogun ieyasu presented with great jewel ieyasu gave to mikado go yojo presented one of successor did to shinto temple of kitzuki there remained for hundred of year how did come to be in deal box what have mr pentreddle to do with why be snatched from in mr colpster threw up slender hand one question at time please said with faint smile ca exactly say can form own conclusion from what tell paused a though collecting thought patricia did not interrupt again also be thinking recalling that strange jewel be set in centre of regular circle of stiff petal knowing that chrysanthemum be royal badge of japan felt certain that whole jewel be meant to represent same be at point of meditation that mr colpster began to speak again a told continued be anxious that must recover emerald so that family luck must return therefore read many book of travel spoke to many japanese about stone in strange way will tell day learned that jewel be at temple of kitzuki in province of izumo be regarded a very sacred how to regain again must not tell paused once more then went on quietly a know have son of name to carry on line only sister whose husband be already dead died also left two son to look after brought up with daughter basil went into navy theodore remained at home to look after estate then be mr theodore heir asked patricia swiftly at one time intended to be a desired to marry to mara must then a decided take name of colpster when be gone carry on family in female line while emerald be lost thought that luck must not return to colpsters therefore told what have told to nephew said that one who brought back mikado jewel a called must be heir what did say theodore scoffed at idea said that did not want money declined to go to japan run risk of getting jewel by stealing purchase surely did not wish to steal oh said mr colpster so hurriedly that patricia felt sure have once intended to get jewel fraudulently if not honestly thought that emerald might be brought back will adam have right to give to shogun a be intended by queen elizabeth to cement friendship with akbar family mean must be quite justified in taking by force be not to be thought of therefore gave sum of money obtained by mortgaging property told when ship touched at nagasaki to try buy be expecting ship hm walrus back in fortnight emerald be in london exactly be brought to be given to martha pentreddle be what puzzle what do think miss carrol hardly know what to think said girl in puzzled voice then added

of temple surrounded with petal of chrysanthemum flower carved out of green jade jade patricia recollected stiff petal oh be that kind of stone ah said colpster eagerly with air of triumph see remember mikado jewel yes emerald in centre be same amyas colpster got from inca princess bevis parted with to elizabeth for knighthood can be certain persisted patricia bewildered by strangeness of what took to be coincidence emerald jade chrysanthemum may be still at kitzuki in province of izumo squire shook head sadly basil wrote time ago saying that have gone to kitzuki to make offer to buy back emerald learned that have be stolen stolen who must have stolen be what wish to find out have be stolen now appears in london be placed in hand only to be taken away again by paused looked at girl know who gave into hand who snatched said in regretful tone know know did martha tell anything asked eagerly not word said that when came back with deal box must explain know what happened before

diamond taken from eye of idol be recovered after various adventure by priest of god what have to do with one moment miss carrol emerald also have become sacred stone also have be stolen what be more likely that shinto priest murdered martha priest must snatch from hand why must emerald come to mr pentreddle at be what wish to know said squire feverishly clenching hand that added bending forward be what must find out must learn who murdered martha recover family luck see how be to be done sighed patricia must be done have to be done colpster smote knee hard will try said girl extended hand squire shook warmly chapter vii garden of sleep after turmoil of london excitement of last uncomfortable week at home of art peace beauty rural influence of beckleigh be extremely pleasant patricia arrived with unsteady nerve unhappy feeling of unrest after seven day in somnolent corner of devonshire regained usual placidity of character although be irish girl by reason of magnificent health escaped to great extent up in air down in sea mood characterize celt a arthur have be taken to island valley of avilion there to be healed of grievous wound so patricia felt that have be guided to garden of sleep that irritated nerve might be soothed at end of week be more convinced than ever that have chanced upon veritable paradise of rest well deserved name be garden of sleep thought patricia dreamily here will rest until paused at point a future must not be foretold in way girl found beckleigh to be little fairy bay on south coast of devonshire shut out from world by high moorland over tourist rarely came where rolling down dipped to sea there be secluded nook dimple on face of natural beauty here quaint rambling old house of mellowed grey stone nestled close to mighty cliff of red sandstone be quarter of mile from mansion to yellow sand of tiny beach fertile acre be covered with many tree wood be partly wild partly artificial be threaded by dozen of path narrow broad led unexpectedly to clearing rainbow hued with flower to sylvan glade fit for revel of titania elf although be close upon christmas yet myriad flower be in bloom stately palm growing here there gave suggestion of tropical vegetation to miniature forest climate of particular beauty spot be truly wonderful with almost constant warmth sunshine here again resembled avilion lacking snow hail rain voice of wild destructive wind ruddy cliff gathered heat of many sun poured forth when sky be clouded while high moor screened favoured paradise from cutting north wind be truly lovely said patricia a strolled with mara through garden of alcinous day after day found same bland condition prevailing must not have believed that there be such lovely spot in cold grey england oh have bad weather sometimes said mara in soft low voice sky grow cloudy sea grows very rough rain too heavily at time think have ever have snow hail cliff keep warm two girl turned on edge of lawn where wood began looked upward at mighty cliff towered majestically above like tower of babel to mara who have dwelt beneath for so long looked like kindly guardian giant who gave shelter warmth to favoured acre at base patricia thought looked frowning menacing look a though one day must fall crush house said with shiver for hostility of great mass of rock seemed certain mara smiled in slow sad way have stood there without falling since world began suppose said wisely so see why must fall now have come suppose not yet patricia shivered again make feel uncomfortable do remember in 'childe roland how hill like giant at hunting lay watching game at bay look to like mara have not read browning must not grasp allusion gazed at vast lowering mass with affection for to be like domestic hearth where must warm after time turned stared seaward towards glistening sapphire water flashed in pale winter sunshine through wood broad path be cut from lawn surrounding house to smooth beach where wavelet broke in gentle play to right left of bay be tall cliff similar to guarded mansion ended in bold headland distance out on one side other rising gently greenly vast space of moorland swept grandly away to height above in cup be solitary mansion muffled in warm wood in spite of lateness of season air be moist heated a if red cliff be clasping home of colpsters to gigantic breast how do get food here asked patricia suddenly when saw that mara did not speak be there village about two on moorland one on way to hendle where railway stop ah yes patricia nodded remember hendle how drove here with squire down that winding road be so dark must see nothing on way since have be in place have not explored neighbourhood can do so whenever like said mara quietly will be best to wait until basil come home next week love place know inch of surrounding country doe mr dane know also theodore oh yes in way be like father be never so happy a when be reading writing doe not go out much only see at luncheon dinner be nearly luncheon now patricia caught girl slim hand let go in now said be hungry mara believe be fairy like life on 'apricocks dewberry with purple grape green fig mulberry who said that asked mara smiling in dreamy fashion titania said shakespeare put word into mouth mara must educate in english literature knew nothing of browning when quoted lately now see that have not read shakespeare play be dreadful mara shrugged thin shoulder care for reading patricia be much nicer to walk about under open sky wish to become like theodore father stay indoors everlastingly do never go away for change rarely theodore father have be in london lately theodore came back first then father came last week with be sorry brought asked patricia slipping arm impulsively round girl waist said mara in so unemotional fashion patricia felt chilled like a worry miss tibbets always worried with lesson must be educated mara why see use of learning thing patricia looked at curiously for although have be studying girl for several day mara be still enigma to mr colpster only daughter only child be undersized slim graceful in figure movement clever enough in spite of dreamy way to look after in very thorough fashion patricia did not at agree with mr sellars use of word weak a applied to mara for young lady made shrewd remark at time showed capable character there be something decidedly elfish about girl in look way mara pale golden lock pale blue eye pale complexion presented to onlooker a somewhat shadowy creature silent movement low voice frequent lack of conversation gave same impression patricia must not get near shy soul clothed in fragile tintless body seemed to be scarcely human to be compounded of moonlight grey mist containing in be melancholy in nature warmth tropical luxuriance of beckleigh did not suit personality must have be placed in sad antique temple isolated on lonely plain under sombre sky irish girl be warm human life loving affectionate so be difficult to make friend with undine so chill distant in way look patricia began to think that after salary have thought so large be not too much seeing that have to warm statue into life how to set about task did not know what do like doing asked a walked towards house nothing get bored not at mara hesitated then turned pale blue eye on flushed lovely face of companion dream said quietly what do dream about asked patricia curiously mara passed pale hand across pale forehead can hardly tell said in low voice suggested softly breathing midnight wind there be something wanting something wanting to bring back dream about what do dream about persisted miss carrol more puzzled than ever a looked at mara pale pathetic face something will tell when brings back brings what back dream about be know conversation be turning in circle mara be repeating answer a be patricia question invisible barrier divided two girl although patricia wished in order to earn salary honestly to break down mara apparently did not in look gesture did make advance so miss carrol must hing sigh over difficulty of problem have to solve renew walk towards house mara followed in silence not sullen at being questioned not angry be simply indifferent colpster homestead be two storey rambling confusedly composed of various style of architecture oldest portion be tudor have be built by amyas founder of family when have first set up tent in solitary spot later colpsters have added taken away so that one wing be wanting while other be of jacobean style on one side also there stood square georgian block of many room comfortable ugly effect of mass of different order of architecture be to make entire dwelling look picturesque if not strictly beautiful time also have mellowed whole to lovely restful hue nature have clothed many eye sore with trailing ivy virginian creeper indeed so thickly be wall covered with living vegetation that looked a though loosely built untidy dwelling be fastened to emerald sward of lawn a patricia thought halting on doorstep for single moment a though building have sprang therefrom in single night like mushroom house dwelt in fondled loved for many generation have about warm homely feeling of intimate humanity over a girl again observed with shiver ever hung angry red faced cliff menacing sinister interior of mansion be a jumbled so to speak a outside for various addition alteration removal have destroyed original plan of dwelling if indeed ever have possessed such design room have door leading into others passage twisted turned in most bewildering manner few ended in blank wall stranger must find stepping down into one room up into a flooring of whole house be irregular there be narrow door broad door many of window be diamond paned casement while others presented large surface of modern glass grate be here vast open fireplace there many room be a dark a others be light house pleased irritated a everywhere visitor came upon unexpected corner be brought up short before closed entrance be nightmare house like none patricia used to extreme modernity have ever entered furniture furnishing of many room be also fantastic here patricia saw more plainly effect of colpster narrow income a everything be old fashioned worn carpet hanging paper covering wall painting adorning ceiling be shabby faded drawing room be filled with chippendale table sheraton chair fender stool of albert period empire sofa covered with worn brocade while dining room have merely horsehair mahogany suite aggressively slippery whole house looked shabby be shabby yet hand of time have so co ordinated furniture decoration of various epoch that effect of whole be beautiful sombre family portrait tarnished silver ornament subdued hue of curtain carpet gave dwelling refined air there be nothing modern garish machine made about place everything looked mellow suitable old world slightly melancholy be house to dream in a be filled with drowsy suggestion mansion of meditation a ground without be garden of sleep wonder mara be given to vague vision stronger person must have succumbed to somniferous influence of place luncheon table laid with snow white linen glittering with diamond cut glass heavy old fashioned silver looked very attractive in soft light of large room stole in through quaint casement patricia anxious to take up household duty have arranged decoration of table be rapidly getting into swing of domestic duty found servant dull out of date very obedient although with privilege of old retainer grumbled at many of innovation did what asked to do mr colpster congratulated on successful dbut on very occasion be born housekeeper miss carrol said when took place at head of table looking leaner more like student than ever used to look after father house before died said patricia with sigh be very particular be even a boy remember at sandhurst be at sandhurst remarked girl looking at host who did not in way resemble military man colpster laughed in silent fashion oh yes have thought of winning vc so tormented father to make soldier soon grew tired of army a have not necessary money to keep up therefore retired when father died have vegetated here ever since hope find life here too dull miss carrol looked anxiously towards bright face of girl like replied patricia absently be such rest after rush worry of london by way mr colpster wish must not call miss carrol sound so stiff patricia then said squire genially with bright look in usually sad eye showed that be pleased be very charming name suit made old world bow very charming young lady girl laughed coloured bowed in return then to turn conversation be becoming too complimentary glanced at vacant place opposite to of mara where be mr dane asked abruptly talk of angel hear wing said squire for at moment door opened to admit eldest nephew theodore be tall rather stout with heavy face by mean attractive skin be pale possessed very bright blue eye reddish hair worn a be uncle rather long jaw be of bull dog order with bulky figure to say nothing of piercing look in eye appeared to be rather formidable personage be so good natured conversational that patricia liked thought be probably true that bark be much worse than bite dressed much more carefully than did mr colpster one noticeable point about be delicate white hand be rather fond of using to emphasize conversation patricia guessed that man be proud of hand a one of rare good point liked to draw attention to perfection be sorry be late miss carrol said theodore sitting down with alacrity surprising in so heavy man be taken up with new manuscript acquired when be in london what be about asked patricia politely occult matter must not understand even if explained theodore stopped then looked into face added yet be irish what have got to do with remark mr dane only that celt be usually more in touch with unseen than be saxon come of latter race have psychic power think have miss carrol what do mean exactly by psychic power can see thing feel thing be more than many people can do by reason of limitation ah looked at sharply a saw face change have felt something have seen something well yes answered patricia regretted admission at moment be thinking of mikado jewel sensation when holding fearful of being ridiculed have not said anything even to mr colpster about did not wish to speak even to theodore although guessed from talk that be le sceptical about such thing than ordinary man may tell about experience day added quickly seeing from face that be about to press question not now theodore nodded will keep to promise said alertly might try experiment mara wo let experiment with like experiment theodore said mara quietly looking up with nervous look on pale face be dangerous there be always danger dear girl when one be exploring new country realm of unseen be new to dream mara flushed never mind about dream said frowning with sudden glance at patricia never mind continuing unwholesome conversation said mr colpster who have be opening letter be not good for mara by way basil be coming home in three day ship be at falmouth oh be so glad cried mara delightedly love basil be dear let hope that miss carrol will love also said theodore grimly love everybody who be nice to said patricia laughing although wondered why mr dane made remark oh basil will be nice be universal lover scoffed man shrugging patricia looked at sharply noticed acrid tone seemed to that theodore be not fond of brother wonder why asked naturally must obtain reply to intimate question chapter viii theodore life went so softly gently at beckleigh that be like dwelling in enchanted land in fabled heaven of drowsy ease patricia compared place to island of lotus eater after storm of early experience enjoyed to full calm seclusion never be there so solitary place colpsters be county family of respectable antiquity be to be presumed that in ordinary course of thing knew many people of own rank friend acquaintance lived too far away be not invited to house for stranger ever came near place not even inevitable tourist chanced upon charmed spot beckleigh might have be situated in moon for connection have with outside world dweller in quiet haven did not seem to mind being left alone in odd way servant mostly old staid be contented with house ground occasionally ventured on quiet water of fairy bay in rowing boat once week elderly butler drove to hendle to adjacent village to bring back grocery such thing a be needful to support life postman came on bicycle once day with news from outside world patricia found that library be well supplied with magazine newspaper there be complaint to be made on score a inhabitant of beckleigh always knew what be going on at home abroad might be secluded be not ignorant although not rolling stone gathered moss warm forgotten nook be ideal home for student theodore uncle be student a patricia gradually learned mr colpster be writing history of family have be engaged for many year in doing so from amyas downward squire traced history of forebear showing how have risen to wealth rank until middle part of elizabeth reign how from period by selfish conduct of bevis colpster in parting with emerald son grandson have lost greater part of possession also related various romantic story dealing with attempt of georgian colpsters to redeem family fortune finally when reached conclusion of book a told patricia intended to relate how emerald have be recovered how again have worked spell of good fortune if recover emerald asked miss carrol very sensibly must recover said squire vehemently if family will die out when mikado jewel be again in possession can inherit estate on condition that marries theodore basil be speaking of mara questioned patricia noting vague way in companion talked of course of course answered testily must marry one of cousin husband can take family name then emerald will draw plenty of money to will again buy back lost land how can emerald draw back money asked patricia again thinking a very often did of sensation when holding stone know ca say be only using figure of speech a be dear girl in way emerald mean good fortune to a be amply proved by success of amyas son grandson owned land a far a hendle when emerald be lost acre village be lost also mr colpster rose began to walk to fro excitedly must find that emerald must must how be going to set about asked girl doubtfully can not say resumed seat at desk with heavy sigh there be clue to follow if must learn who murdered martha might discover assassin regain jewel how can assassin have mr colpster assuming that murdered poor mr pentreddle in order to steal emerald know that be not in possession be quite true while assassin be searching house emerald be being stolen from in park undoubtedly emerald be meant to be given to martha since went to receive how did manage to get want answer to question why not ask of harry pentreddle suggested patricia quietly colpster raised head stared why what must harry possibly know about matter be only putting two two together continued girl thoughtfully looking out of window told that emerald be taken to japan also that harry pentreddle have returned from far east what colpster rose excitedly to foot think that harry brought with that stole from temple of kitzuki why not demanded patricia swiftly japan be in far east harry pentreddle came from there also mother came up to london to meet receive emerald feel sure of harry never came near house expostulated squire be clearly proved at inquest quite so do remember what told about emerald being sacred stone how mentioned wilkie collins novel of 'the moonstone ' perhaps priest be on harry pentreddle track so did not dare to go openly to mother must have arranged signal of red light in park so that must give mother emerald secretly must not keep appointment by reason of sprained foot so sent now believe on assumption declared patricia firmly that be harry pentreddle who gave deal box colpster grew very excited sound feasible theory muttered of course martha knew about desire to get back emerald why must get son to steal can understand secrecy of meeting in park a undoubtedly priest of kitzuki temple must make effort to regain stone harry have to give emerald to mother secretly probably for same reason be now in hiding at amsterdam fit in mr colpster paused looked straightly at girl why did martha want emerald perhaps to give to in case must have told of plan think not said patricia after pause might fancy must not approve of jewel being stolen however be theory only way in can get at truth be by questioning harry pentreddle question be how to find murmured squire musingly if think priest be after will remain in hiding if have seen report of mother death of inquest said patricia coolly will see that there be longer reason for to dread priest of kitzuki why not because believe that harry be followed by one on night that second man who stole jewel from be one of priest if be so why be martha murdered ca say of course like moonstone guardian there may have be three priest one followed harry one went to home of art third third may have directed other two be fancy perhaps said patricia hesitating think that theory be correct be positive that be said squire with decision where man argues to reach point woman jump in dark intuitively gradually might have arrived at same conclusion suggest by reasoning feel certain that have given truth by using that subconscious mind be more active in woman than man yes yes mr colpster opened shut hand excitedly have given clue harry be told by mother to steal emerald did not tell a knew must not approve harry secured emerald be followed by who guarded being in danger of death made secret appointment with mother kept passed along jewel japanese who be following saw that what wanted have changed hand leaving harry came after when looked at jewel snatched meanwhile in way priest knew that jewel be to go to martha so one must have gone to get from refused to say anything be killed by man who afterwards searched house for emerald be clear perfectly clear what will do now asked patricia catching fire from enthusiasm do almost shouted old man straightening bent frame will try find harry pentreddle see if will endorse story theory corrected girl quickly well theory if like harry must be found doubt thinking be in danger of life went abroad be in hiding how can find then will ask isa lee life at hendle be girl to whom be engaged must have written to why not ask mara broke in quiet voice patricia looked up with start so unexpected be observation from behind screen be placed in front of door came theodore dane for so huge man in patricia eye looked more gigantic than ever at moment moved a quietly a cat mr colpster seemed rather annoyed by stealthy entrance wish must make more noise said irritably thought did not like noise uncle said theodore calmly allowed to drop into saddle back chair more do same care about being surprised in way must have knocked at door have rattled handle did knock did rattle handle said dane carelessly thrust one white hand through leonine mass of reddish hair be so interested in conversation with miss carrol that did not hear listened continued squire irritably ask pardon for doing so conversation be about mikado jewel always fascinates must scarcely help overhearing few word if conversation be private heaved up big frame a if to go away be not private snapped colpster sitting down at desk only unexpected appearance startled must have reported conversation to later a know that be a anxious a be to recover palladium of family must certainly like to recover personally said theodore with point a know succession to estate depends upon being given to if get inherit if basil be lucky finder obtains property know what arranged yes hold to arrangement a basil have secured mikado jewel one of inherits finished dane quietly one who marries mara get said colpster decisively be only daughter must benefit under will marry theodore be heir mara be nice girl ca object mara will like basil better than doe in case must marry basil can become master here when pas over said mr colpster with shrug theodore white face flushed blue eye glittered even more brightly than usual patricia who be watchful of movement for latent strength of man impressed guessed that be furiously angry be reining in passion with iron hand if basil inherits will turn out of door said heavily oh can make own arrangement with basil said squire never get on well together so because be ugly duckling burst out theodore eye flaming like sapphire basil be popular one have look checked suddenly smiled in wry manner family arrangement can not interest miss carrol let leave marriage arrangement may come after death uncle alone for moment have to find emerald in what way asked squire directly rather sourly there did not seem to be much love lost between burly nephew must find out where harry pentreddle be question isa lee may know in order not to lose time suggest that question mara said colpster sharply last time put in trance be ill for day wo have constitution tampered with mara spirit got beyond control said theodore quickly remained away longer than be wise must not obey child might have died growled squire who did not seem surprised at strange speech of nephew leave alone isa lee will certainly be able to tell where harry be mara be useless be not useless when told where emerald be to be found said theodore calmly lounging in deep chair mr colpster looked at patricia who be privately amazed at extraordinary conversation dealt in matter of fact way with super physical thing laughed at expression on face promised to explain one day how came to learn where emerald be remarked patricia nodded yes did mr colpster in train remember well then theodore here put mara asleep told to look for jewel went unerringly to japan saw that be in temple of kitzuki in province of izumo at time did not believe proved to be true shrine held a basil wrote home to be precisely described by mara when in trance believe in thing burst out patricia staring aghast at what regarded a gross superstition inquisition did not believe that earth went round sun said theodore coolly although forced galileo to deny that truth earth continued to circle sun took disbelieving inquisitor along with measure everything by own brain miss carrol for there be more thing in heaven earth than be dreamed of in oh have heard that quotation so often cried patricia impetuously nothing can be proved not to who only posse physical brain who have eye can see who have ear can hear to people christ appealed patricia laid delicate hand on lap despairingly know what be talking about observed with shrug well never mind theodore hastened to say seeing that be rather annoyed day will understand just now all need know be that mara told that emerald be to be found in temple of kitzuki in japan proved to be true although be learned in what appears to to be nonsensical way believe fixed gaze with keen blue eye strongly believe that be psychic mr colpster jumped up trifle nervously wo have theodore leave patricia alone be quite sure experiment with mara have done great deal of harm have made more dreamy unpractical than ever wo have patricia caught in evil net there be evil in searching for unseen protested theodore warmly in case if be regarded a evil mean men must cease to inquire there must be invention if searching mention be regarded a evil said squire grimly men must certainly search more willingly than if power be regarded a good however put foot down be not unbeliever a know think be right to pry into what god wish to be concealed 'thus far shalt thou go further be said of ocean retorted theodore yet have reclaimed land from sea prevented wave from going a far a used to everything be good if rightly used wo hear wo hear mr colpster walked abruptly to window be always arguing leave patricia alone what doe miss carrol say asked dane turning to girl agree with mr colpster rejoined promptly like such thing think be evil very good will talk more of matter said theodore quietly only one thing will ask since believe to be sensitive have not experienced strange sensation in connection with emerald have replied patricia who be anxious to have curiosity in respect gratified dane certainly seemed man who must do so on hearing reply mr colpster turned away from window walked back to plant before what do mean asked abruptly mean that while held emerald felt strangest sensation be because felt opened box theodore leaned forward with hand on arm of chair knew be psychic said triumphantly irish people be more a come along chaldean egyptian carthagenian line what do mean asked patricia completely puzzled oh never mind never mind broke in squire impatiently theodore can explain later meanwhile tell what sensation felt patricia stared straight before striving to recall what have experienced on terrible night when jewel be in box in hand said slowly felt sensation a though held great force be ever pushing outward pushing outward muttered theodore pinching nether lip how can scarcely explain wave after wave of invisible force seemed to radiate from petal of flower what flower asked colpster greatly interested chrysanthemum blossom be formed of carved jade petal with emerald in centre radiating force seemed to push back darkness evil so that did not feel afraid seemed a though be in middle of circle of light thus be safe from harm theodore muttered again bent forward eagerly be there sign carved on emerald demanded breathlessly what sign asked greatly puzzled triangle circle oh sign did not observe replied patricia simply jewel be so lovely sensation be so strange that kept staring at in silence feeling happy safe when became cold dark then be afraid theodore held up hand to prevent uncle from speaking when did jewel become cold dark a phrase asked sharply just before man snatched radiance seemed to die away power appeared to falter when felt be holding mere ornament dull dead cold thief snatched away from dane rose slowly nodded towards uncle certainly be priest who stole jewel observed probably be now on way back to japan will never get uncle a now will be guarded more carefully why do think thief be priest questioned squire abruptly well thought so said theodore lightly seems natural to suppose that priest of kitzuki must be more anxious than other people to get back sacred talisman talisman echoed patricia theodore turned heavily towards yes said emphatically emerald in way have be impregnated with radiating power mention for purpose can not say perhaps a suggest to keep off evil darkness at event man who stole have way of neutralizing power did when saw staring at jewel might be that must not take from until have destroyed barrier of light felt in case seeing that be able to take away force must have be priest of temple who knew about mikado jewel understand faltered patricia understand at do growled squire intend to recover jewel day in way be mine will regain theodore shook head will never regain said firmly be now on way back to shrine whence be taken by pentreddle chapter ix basil odd conversation with squire theodore dane strangely affected patricia in rather unhealthy way be ordinary commonsense irish girl whose father have be matter of fact military man in conventional life there have be no place for supernatural when with colonel carrol death came daughter subsequent poverty patricia have be far too much taken up with battling for existence to think of unseen to be over inquisitive about next world seemed to sensible mind unnecessary since there be so much to be done on earth knew very well that be sensitive to thing other people did not perceive put down to having highly strung nerve thought very little about matter now apparently time have come for to consciously use organ hitherto unguessed at patricia must scarcely help feeling that atmosphere of beckleigh hall be unusual isolation dreamy nature of mara uncanny conversation of theodore uncle appeared to accept a quite ordinary thing have effect on mind began to be vaguely afraid of darkness sleep be greatly disturbed by vivid dream in vain assured that be owing to imagination that be losing nerve in most ridiculous manner for spell of place be laid upon felt that be being caught in net of unseen of mr colpster have spoken to healthy minded girl such a miss carrol undoubtedly be feeling be highly unpleasant resented influence seemed bent upon controlling even against will yet to influence vaguely felt must not describe must not even put name only thing must tell be that powerful influence be setting to capture mind will body soul that there be of herself that knew later became aware that influence seemed to be centred in theodore for when in presence felt more than ever desire to peer behind veil have always be polite to since night arrived have looked upon felt certain a merely pretty commonplace girl content with earthly thing be surely true have be until influence came to draw away from concrete to abstract since have confessed to experiencing weird sensation of jewel theodore have haunted step persistently talked to during meal strolled with in garden exerted to please in way finally asked to visit special set of room be at back of house with sense that danger to soul lurked within at first refused finally over borne by insistency consented to enter along with mara girl be absentminded indifferent still must form convenient third must prevent theodore from performing of experiment hated a matter of fact mara mentioned that objected to need not be afraid dear cousin said dane dryly a led way along corridor only wish to show miss carrol book have chat with about psychic matter think be healthy murmured patricia feeling distressed uneasy wish must talk of something else there be nothing else interest in world retorted theodore throwing open door be study miss carrol through door be bedroom so see have part of house to myself room be large broad with low ceiling wide casement looking towards east wall

dane matter quite understand if did wish to find in picture went on with emphasis must find there knew be psychic tell make more certain than ever patricia shuddered talk about uncanny thing like make uncomfortable theodore laughed in constrained manner with spoon threw powder on charcoal at once thick bluish smoke arose like column strong perfume spread through chill atmosphere of room pleasant scent be not miss carrol said dane restoring box to cupboard fixing eye on girl face be made after recipe of moses spice stacte onycha galbanum sweet spice with pure frankincense of will there be like weight will find word in exodus result of mingling such thing sacred incense a be smell breathe perfume be beautiful be assuredly wonderful smell too overpoweringly sweet patricia drew in deep breath through nostril fragrance seemed to impregnate whole being began to feel languid singularly content unwilling to move time dane vividly blue eye be fixed on face seemed to be sapphire flame a breathed perfume looked into deep eye heard movement removed own eye with effort a appeared to now confused sens then saw that mara be on foot moving towards door not a ordinary human being must walk rather appeared to be dancing in rhythmic way swaying from side to side waving arm gracefully with clasped hand seemed to be shaking invisible instrument theodore put out hand to stay waved aside danced if must be called dancing through door a disappeared patricia tried vainly to rise must go to be ill murmured patricia then fell back in chair again enveloped a seemed to in dense cloud of perfumed smoke eye closed breath seemed to leave then appeared to go away to league long goal where went how went must not say inward perception be only conscious of vividly brilliant atmosphere through passed a swiftly a swallow far away heard thin voice like one speaking through telephone bidding search for danger be voice of theodore a patricia in dream trance be state of being passed swiftly on soaring to unknown end became aware that flight be being stopped faltered paused then turned came swiftly back with speed of light sens returned to feel water being poured on forehead to feel also cool night air be out of door in arm of man who bathed face move move said man anxiously have fainted who be asked patricia gazing upward at handsome face be basil said man brother have be trying devilry on chapter x new comer patricia be not particularly imaginative girl considering that be of irish descent blood there be something in clean shaven face of young naval officer appealed to clasp of arm thrilled although on recovering sens extricated from hurriedly yet for day seemed to feel round basil be so strong kind hearted virile patricia femininity went out to became ideal of what man must be tall slim well made wiry young dane be a handsome clean limbed man a anyone must meet in day march hair be brown skin be tanned by sea wind sun eye be hazel in colour have firm chin well cut mouth patricia must well imagine must be set firmly at time indeed when opened eye to find in arm mouth be stern enough be evident that basil did not at approve of brother experiment theodore protested that have intended no experiment simply burnt incense to dispel chilly feeling in atmosphere of room declared scent be too much for miss carrol if be questioned basil dryly why did mara come out to say that have put miss carrol into trance oh mara theodore looked disdainful know what crazy thing mara say when wake up to ordinary life talk like theodore well then quarrel with moment arrive home retorted theodore patricia drying wet face with handkerchief saw latent animosity between two ill matched brother leap to life to throw oil on troubled water of fraternal strife began to laugh somewhat artificially be true still sufficiently naturally to show that be now entirely not hysterical be silly of to faint said in matter of fact way trouble about mr dane spoke to basil be right be fault not mr theodore that lost sens be trying experiment there see said theodore with triumphant glance at brother must burn strong perfume said basil angrily walked away without looking at patricia evidently be annoyed that girl must champion theodore doings in pronounced way one moment miss carrol said theodore when patricia be about to depart also for be close upon dinner hour have to dress called brother mr dane be wrong be eldest name be mr dane whereas be called simply mr basil patricia heard venomous tone of voice saw angry look darted at basil a young gentleman stepped into house first inclination be to make angry retort when considered swiftly how wrong must be to increase enmity between brother curbed temper replied deliberately must excuse mistake will not make again when did mr basil arrive rushed into room just when fainted mara told took up in arm carried out here into fresh air did not faint said patricia looking at searchingly although defended to smooth thing over really did try experiment on be that not so be such sensible girl can admit a much said theodore with ironical bow yes did use perfume to put into trance wished to to hesitated to look for danger mara said threatened finished yes how do know because when be mile mile away bathed in flood of light heard voice very clearly telling to search theodore gazed at eagerly so can bring back consciously what see on other plane did learn what danger be force drew back basil theodore clenched hand face grew black if have not interfered might have found out doubt moreover if have found out must not have told why not asked astonished because like experiment ought to many people soul depart see thing can explain when in trance few like can bring back consciously what see tell what will tell nothing because have nothing to tell ask to explain one thing to what be why did mara dance towards door saw a became insensible dane looked worried know when smell that perfume always act like that be dance exactly be certainly measured movement understand mara confessed candidly have power be not under own control must control will not allow to be quite right said miss carrol emphatically never again will allow to put in trance be dangerous with nod also went into house theodore dane with lowering face savage gleam in blue eye stood where be with bowed head considering what coming of basil have cost be greatly attracted to patricia not by love for beauty sweet nature because possessed certain psychic power wished to control must a now knew go return consciously that capability showed advanced state of spiritual evolution with messenger to send into unseen since must not go mara refused to obey must accomplish great thing have be left alone with girl for certain period might have managed to sap will power render slave coming of basil changed that basil be young handsome ardent with sailor keen sense of beauty must be certain to admire perhaps love patricia if be so basil certainly must prevent more experiment being made be evil heart be filled with black rage at unexpected thwarting of aim curse muttered alluding to brother always cross path put wrong a spoke raised head to survey goodly heritage assuredly basil must gain in end will not be driven from here raged theodore furiously will marry girl gain property by getting basil out of way how be to be done with safety to myself must think meant that theodore intended to draw to certain evil counsellor who being supernatural must guide in selfish way wished to take power being evil must be only too glad to minister to wicked passion since by doing so secured more control of must use for own accursed end to sow discord on earth plane theodore not being possessed of psychic power must not come directly into contact with being so malignant strong be obliged to find medium since mara must not act in capacity since patricia be lost to must be through influence of basil man thought turned to old brenda lee grandmother of isa to whom harry pentreddle be engaged be accredited with being witch possessed power theodore knew only too well to be real have made use of before for there be evil bond between now intended to make use of again pending near visit to consultation of creature intended to summon to assistance theodore smoothed face to smile went in to dinner be very pleasant meal on especial evening squire colpster appeared to grow young in cheery atmosphere of basil strong virile youth sailor of twenty five be so gay bright talked in so interesting manner of what have seen where have be that even dreamy mara be aroused to unexpected vivacity theodore with rage in heart smile on face behaved so amiably in such truly brotherly fashion that basil be quite hand in glove before time came to retire to rest younger brother straight honest natured kind hearted did not credit theodore with crooked way although knew that relative be not so straight a might be basil calling internally crank set down deviation from normal to secluded life uncanny study ought to go about world more theo said at dinner must do lot of good perhaps may travel day said mr dane in must be genial manner just now have so much interesting work in hand want to move of cloudy scheme be not so very cloudy although may think to be so said elder brother significantly there be look in blue eye made patricia move uneasily girl instinct let alone what have seen when recovered from trance showed clearly how deadly be enmity between brother be only just to say that dividing feeling be rather on part of theodore than on part of basil latter only mistrusted brother a slippery unscrupulous man who be to be avoided did not seek to do injury on other hand theodore hated basil with cold calculating malignancy be on watch a patricia by sixth sense perceived to hurt in possible way nothing of be apparent to eye of mr colpster a sat at head of table smiling at newly returned nephew tell said mr colpster when mara patricia have retired to drawing room three men be smoking comfortably over coffee tell exactly what happened about emerald can tell nothing more than what set forth in letter replied basil frank face clouding over went from nagasaki to kitzuki when arrived in japan offered to buy emerald priest laughed at for daring to make such offer then told that emerald have be stolen whom by must not say yet added basil reflectively believe knew something although declined to speak indeed because of offer for jewel believed have something to do with theft what nonsense said theodore lightly very fact that offered to buy jewel openly showed that did not take priest thought that did to throw off scent be waylaid one night searched might have gone hard with a have nasty knock on head akira came along saved akira must rather say count akira explained young sailor be in japanese diplomatic service so told be of high rank father be famous daimio over thirty year ago when japan be medival akira must be daimio also if thing have changed a be be high in favour with mikado be very clever certainly saved life for assailant must have killed have not come along however will hear about from own lip squire sat up alertly be coming down here with permission sir told must ask if must allow to come if agree can write to be at japanese embassy in london can come at once write to by mean said mr colpster excitedly may be able to tell about emerald think know anything about save that be one of treasure of kitzuki temple have be given to then high priest century ago by mikado go yojo akira be too modern to bother about such thing a loyal japanese certainly mourned that emerald must have be lost wonder if will ever be found have be found said theodore quickly be now on way to japan basil let cigarette fall from well cut lip what do say oh be theodore idea although entirely agree with said squire impatiently be long story have to do with murder ah poor martha said basil regretfully be so sorry to hear of terrible death be so very fond of of read lot about tragedy in newspaper there be still much that must like to hear particularly how miss carrol who be one of witness at inquest come to be here a mara companion met when went up to inquest said colpster quietly a have known father colonel carrol at sandhurst invited to come to beckleigh a housekeeper mara companion poor girl have money friend so offer be godsend to be glad made sir said basil heartily be one of very prettiest most charming girl have ever seen fall in love with basil said brother with disagreeable laugh a uncle here want to marry mara inherit property oh think mara must marry said basil lightly in case disbelieve in marriage of first cousin besides must be better for theo to get property a be always away one who marries mara who recovers emerald will have estate said squire decidedly have known that for long time can talk of later meantime ask about emerald well be stolen from patricia on night martha be murdered deuce what have miss carrol to do with basil sat up quickly hazel eye brightened theodore observed with thrill of annoyance that reference to patricia seemed to stir up brother augured ill from interest displayed by sailor listen said squire in slightly pompous tone related that knew from time patricia have left mr pentreddle in drawing room of home of art to time have returned without jewel found old woman corpse basil ceasing to smoke listened in breathless silence drew long breath when interesting story be ended what perfectly ripping girl ejaculated talking of patricia moment mr colpster ceased so brave cool headed not very cool headed seeing lost emerald said theodore dryly basil nodded absently be pity took out of box of course that talk of drawing power be nonsense perfect nonsense from material point of view said elder brother with sneer in opinion priest who followed snatched jewel stole in fact now have taken back to japan basil shook head never heard at kitzuki kamakura that anyone be suspected approve of word stolen if indeed priest of kitzuki temple followed thief recovered emerald in way state have perfect right to do so emerald be ours said squire fuming pardon uncle know have never agreed with on point said basil significantly amyas colpster gave jewel to queen elizabeth for knighthood so family have no right to get emerald back again unless indeed added sailor with afterthought jewel be freely given think seeing that store be set by at kitzuki that gift will be made who must have stolen emerald miss carrol suspect harry pentreddle said theodore lighting cigar ah might be so heard that ship be touching at japan martha wrote to hong kong told why must steal why must wish to give secretly to mother questioned squire wish to learn thing basil boy ask harry then know where be went to amsterdam fancy when be last heard of ca know that mother have be murdered must have certainly returned long ago be sure to turn up sooner later said basil easily rising to foot poor martha be good friend to where be buried in churchyard on moor beside husband said colpster also getting on foot be sorry a martha be such good housekeeper patricia be succeeding very well moreover be more agreeable to look at sneered theodore what beastly thing say observed brother sharply have seen for year theodore manner have not improved paid miss carrol compliment think that can dispense with compliment retorted fiery sailor in case spoke slightly of dead martha be very dear to must be to also when mother died martha stood in place remember that if please boy boy quarrel moment meet said squire be basil fault be fault of bitter tongue theo said younger dane trying to curb anger with brother always inspired however wish ill feeling let go to drawing room ask miss carrol to give music always miss carrol murmured theodore resentfully felt that hated brother more than ever same threw down half smoked cigar moved with other two men towards door squire placed hand over shoulder of nephew walked between proudly there be only three of to represent family said affectionately since mara being girl doe count so much a man must stick together recover emerald so that good fortune may return heaven only know how badly need good luck there be that lawsuit over hendle water right bad hay season with continuous rain not here mile away if luck depends upon emerald said theodore crossly will never return be on way to japan tell well have one piece of good luck cried basil gaily miss carrol be in house damn thought elder brother amiably 'd like to wring neck self satisfied beast chapter xi harry sweetheart with arrival of basil dane life became much brighter more lively at young sailor be active minded light hearted so that be always glad to provide amusement for others took patricia mara out sailing in fairy bay walked with across windy space of moor to view various centre of interest in evening having sweet tenor voice sang to while miss carrol played accompaniment of course have much to tell about foreign part one must possibly be dull while basil be in house even squire left beloved history of colpster family to enjoy breezy humour of favourite nephew old house awoke a be from sleep to enjoy brief holiday of innocent amusement although basil be attentive to mara since greatly wished to arouse from dream set apart from others gave patricia most of company from moment have set eye on have be attracted by beauty of face now that knew better found that have heart of gold frankly fell in love with such perfection very wisely for patricia be rare specimen of sex be not on part averse to wooing a of men have ever met basil appeared to be most trustworthy fascinating be old story of love at first sight miracle at material minded people scoff be veritable truth in spite of such scepticism theodore needle to say be not pleased to see fulfilment of prophecy have known moment basil arrived that something of silly sort so phrased must happen knowing nothing of love for selfishness swallowed up other quality in somewhat narrow nature have scanty patience with folly wished to get patricia entirely to because of rare psychic quality to do so be even willing to marry of course by such act must cut off from chance of acquiring property since be very evident that mikado jewel must never be found theodore be certain that have gone back to japan there must be chance of being stolen second time being case only by marrying cousin must secure beckleigh carry out design of forming school of occultism ambition a have before be stated be willing to surrender provided that must dominate patricia mediumistic power with at disposal felt that must do much to forward selfish desire moreover be factor also in decision mara disliked so intensely that certainly must never marry none of theodore feeling appeared in look manner to reach end have to play comedy did so with skill of clever actor face be smile behaviour most deferential carefully avoided possible quarrel with brother also did not speak of occult study since discussion of such thing be not welcome to others theodore in fact appeared in quite social rle seconded brother in promoting brighter more active state of thing in old mansion be clever at conjuring gave exhibition in drawing room when girl grew weary of music conversation always be polite genial so much did impose upon basil mara squire that believed theodore have a saying be turned over new leaf patricia did not credit a genuine too suave demeanour knew if one else did that leopard must not change spot what be more that particular leopard did not wish to beckleigh be certainly vale of avilion for in spite of bad weather prevailing in almost other county in england favoured spot preserved more le serene calm of course rained at time not very long not very hard a squire have said hay crop at hendle be completely ruined by wet anticipated great loss must ill afford in straitened circumstance flower garden round family seat bloomed in almost constant sunshine also when snow fell be now close upon christmas hard frost be coming spread mantle of white on moor above did not descend upon beckleigh be true that owing to season many of tree in demesne be leafless goodly number being foreign be evergreen still clothed in leaf throughout winter when severe condition prevailed on high land climate of little nook by sea maintained mildness warmth little short of miraculous place might have be situated on riviera patricia thought that extraordinary circumstance for english winter be due to great red cliff sheltered vale during day drew in much heat into breast breathed forth at night when air grew chilly be like being warmed by good humoured volcano thought for patricia after manner of browning always humanized force of nature undoubtedly be right in surmise for solar fire constantly drawn to cliff radiated from cliff created artificial summer endured throughout year beckleigh be like garden of eden for climate fruitfulness beauty theodore be intruding snake a yet even to herself did not dare to confess that be modern eve to basil adam if passing thought of nature did cross mind blushed did not dwell on if have must never in maidenly confusion have be able to meet eye of lover yes have come that far be lover of course theodore always on watch saw that pair be falling deeper in love daily savagely felt that must hing to prevent happy ending to romance squire might want basil to marry cousin mara merely loved young man in sisterly fashion did not dream of closer tie colpster be not man to force daughter affection even for sake of family so be probable that if mara refused basil assuredly must do if offered if patricia accepted young sailor mr colpster must settle beckleigh property on daughter give up fancy of re establishing family moreover be now strangely fond of patricia must be glad to have for niece by marriage look what way must must theodore saw that chance of gaining beckleigh miss carrol be very small indeed be then that determined to seek out brenda lee see what future have in store for after mara warning have always be haunted by sense of ever nearing danger although must not tell from quarter must come granny lee must know however a be clairvoyant must look into seed of time a did macbeth weird woman of course in material age most people contemptuously dismiss such thing a hanky panky did not matter to theodore sceptic might refuse to shape course by such vague chart knew positively from experience under certain circumstance devil must speak truly if granny lee with malignant disposition greedy venom be not devil who be granny lee therefore be one to solve riddle to granny lee theodore went few day before christmas yet so a to impress upon uncle that be going on harmless friendly errand young man sought out in seclusion of library be going to see isa lee ask if have heard anything about harry since return to england said theodore abruptly be going to hendle isa so have be told be stopping for christmas with grandmother in miserable hut on moor can go return in three hour must like to come with said squire alertly be most anxious to know whereabouts of harry pentreddle must question about emerald wonder if really know anything be perfectly certain that doe rejoined theodore positively if did not must not have stayed away from isa advise to come with uncle george a there be deep snow on moor be not so young a be besides can ask necessary question well do so if can recover emerald know what reward will be said squire turned again to decipher old document dealt with adventure of amyas colpster in peru theodore shrugged big shoulder departed with grimace much a must have liked to secure emerald if only to inherit beckleigh be kind of vineyard in greedy eye felt quite sure that harry pentreddle must tell little must be helpful harry undoubtedly have stolen jewel have given to patricia a mother emissary having departed for amsterdam almost immediately must know nothing of unexpected loss apparently did not even know that mother have be so barbarously murdered if did know assuredly must have returned to avenge in spite of danger there might be to from guardian of great gem that danger be now a theodore fully believed thing of past emerald have be recovered so be only natural to suppose that priest of kitzuki temple must leave well alone with thought in scheming mind theodore well wrapped up in fur mounted winding road led to moor vast grassy space be covered more le deeply with snow dane accustomed to country since boyhood possessing great strength made light of drift far away on dazzling expanse brilliantly blindingly bright in sunshine saw many dark dot marked village near cromlech where mr lee have home glance backward over cliff showed verdant acre of beckleigh flash of colour where late flower still bloomed there be snow below only emerald sward green wood running to verge of sapphire bay where wavelet lipped curved streak of yellow sand contrast between summer be leaving winter be going into struck theodore forcibly wish must get to myself groaned basil be out of if marries carrol mara have sense to look after may secure after patricia scowled want to become basil wife speech showed that theodore wished to have cake eat since wanted girl property however be useless to moralize over possibility so dane resolutely struck across moor ploughed manfully through drift after mile so came to high road up tourist came to view rocking stone cromlech be comparatively clear have further difficulty in gaining goal swiftly walking in spite of great bulk theodore must walk swiftly when chose soon arrived at handful of house sheltered immediately under brow of gently swelling hill bos marked highest point of moor be most unlikely place for village a there seemed to be chance of inhabitant gaining food acted a guide to tourist drove in vehicle from to hendle shepherded drove of exmoor pony flock of hardy sheep if rumour be true employed much of spare time in poaching village boatwain be

pitying lack of comprehension sit down dream of patricia be going to tell father that heart be broken shooting whimsical glance at amazed startled basil slipped out of room five minute later miss carrol arrived with household work completed for day in spite of what mara have told basil must not follow path have pointed out be rather more attentive than usual to patricia gave to understand that must wreck continent for sake modesty of man be greater than of woman kept tongue quiet eye unintelligent patricia did not entirely approve of restrained attitude a knew that loved wished to be told so in plain english must not understand why did not speak basil understood very well waited for patricia to give sufficiently strong hint that adored then must lay at foot did not seem right so basil thought to act on what have learned from mara a must be taking advantage of illicit intelligence for sailor rigorous view of situation must have be adjusted then there same be not because must not speak must not a for mara returned to father demonstrated to very plainly that cousin wished to marry miss carrol that when time came must do so colpster felt annoyed mara must not marry basil must not many theodore so plan for future well being of family be disarranged what must say if gave beckleigh to basil asked pointedly must marry patricia know take name must be very glad replied mara quietly well then wo said father greatly annoyed be last of direct line must have property must know what to do with must live here when be gone mara raised faint eyebrow alone questioned know must not allow theodore to stay that patricia must go with basil who be always moving round world oh must what be to be done then asked squire helplessly mara threw arm round neck rare demonstration of affection from so usually self controlled girl wait whispered wait see what be about to happen what be about to happen know something be coming along to change life how do know ca tell only feel that there be something in air to oh colpster grew angry more of occult rubbish wish be ordinary girl mara not dreaming visionary will wait until emerald come back then must make up mind to marry theodore since basil affection be engaged mara reflected thought how very certain theodore be that emerald have gone back to japan never to return recollection gave chance of pacifying father of securing freedom very well then said quietly when get emerald father will marry in way affair be settled for time being think a might mara must not guess how father expected mikado jewel to return to colpster family even if did must not understand how possession must affect thing in way meanwhile day week passed by time drew near for visit of count akira mara although said nothing be looking forward to arrival why did not know for a rule be quite indifferent to who came to beckleigh hall in heart however felt that be coming into life either for good ill be feeling made say to father that change be about to take place must not have put feeling into word did not attempt to do so with fatalism be inherent in character waited passively certain that what be meant to be must certainly become when hour struck there be nothing more to be said theodore have duly told uncle of interview with isa lee although for obvious reason said nothing about sance with grandmother squire be therefore anxiously awaiting arrival of harry pentreddle a then hoped to learn how why young man have stolen emerald also might be able to guess who have snatched from hand of patricia if so must then tell in whose possession now be great deal depended upon what pentreddle have to say colpster watched daily for coming count akira be first to arrive in attending to new fascinating guest squire almost forgot anxiety to hear evidence of young pentreddle japanese came late in evening having arrived at hendle by express to be driven to beckleigh by basil young man went to meet friend brought to hall in time to dress for dinner be not until meal be in progress that mara set eye on then be so excited by presence although did not show feeling that must scarcely eat what have expected vague a be have come true man from far east be man who must change life into what must change down what new path must lead must not say knew be that with hour have come man count akira be small neat person with bronze coloured clean shaven face black hair black eye very dignified manner at first sight did not look particularly impressive a european evening dress did not entirely suit aggressively oriental appearance when gathered in drawing room came to notice keen dark eye so observant piercing to listen to carefully worded speech to look at nobly formed head became aware that be ordinary man race be apparent in gesture glance dominating manner so quiet yet imperious came of noble line accustomed to rule personality made felt more more a something strong dangerous while hour passed be past present future of island empire epitome of japan representative of highest type of yellow race filled with far reaching ambition be true that worship sun in japan asked theodore tactlessly akira turned shrewd eye on speaker smilingly displayed set of snowy teeth do replied evasively assure mr dane that if ever saw sun in england must worship also with very good reason oh get sun here said squire patriotically get name not real central planet said akira with shrug cloud mist obscure ray only in east doe true sun exist be that not so dane spoke to basil whom always addressed in way although be more ceremonious with theodore be assented sailor with laugh yet akira when under painfully blue sky in blazing sunshine have often longed for cooling mist of england so despise be quite poetical smiled patricia sailor be always poetical although show side to landsman solitary space of sea sky when one be driven back on one self to think out high thing be enough to make man poetical well said mara shrewdly if sailor show that side to landsman probably show to landswomen be that not so basil mischievously glanced from to patricia back again to woman replied basil briefly colouring through tan what when sailor have wife in port sneered theodore then aware that have said more than ought to in presence of lady quickly turned to akira perhaps count will tell about little man blinked keen eye politely assented made comfortable in many coloured word placed fairy land before eye with great charm of manner told of cool buddhist temple wherein weird ceremony take place related delightful legend of jizo sama kindly god who protects dead child pictured vivid life of toy city colour movement drew attention of fascinated hearer to charm of japanese chinese lettering lend to fantastic odd decoration after time gave description of pilgrimage have made to fuji sacred mountain appears in thousand one picture of dai nippon country with fuji yama left out be like hamlet without prince said smiling mountain be guardian genius of land then told about rice field with delicate springing green of cherry orchard in blossom of pine forest where fox woman lurked sketched out many charming legend talk be like page of lafcadio hearn mara hung breathlessly on word a proceeded breath became quick short eye grew larger looked at narrator through past a though described be passing before like panorama of byegone century suddenly clapped hand remember remember cried rising unsteadily to foot land be land remember at last stopping suddenly sank unconscious at foot of astonished japanese chapter xiii unexpected next day mara be quite old indifferent self with feminine craft denied what have said even though five witness be ready to repeat word did know what be saying said mara impatiently of course heat be too much for heat repeated father in january beckleigh be england nerve be out of order count akira have funny japanese scent on handkerchief theodore be looking at always upset in way made idle excuse none of must hold water wish must leave alone ended angrily a there be nothing else for be left alone queer episode be passed over mara be polite to japanese nothing more eye be constantly following about came upon by design in unexpected place akira be too shrewd not to notice that be object of interest to pale golden haired english maid inwardly be puzzled to think why must pursue in secretive fashion mara everlastingly inquired about japan about people wished to know manner custom of inhabitant entreated count to draw word picture of far eastern landscape observed that never asked question when anyone else be present with delicate sense of chivalry kept silent about secret understanding odd conduct have brought about between for there be understanding without doubt akira found wondering at time if be really english for towards at event did not display world wide reserve for island race of west be famous of course squire colpster seized first opportunity to question guest about emerald akira professed that knew little more than fact that there be such stone that have be stolen month before from temple have be to kitzuki said count a religion be shinto in izumo be oldest of shrine very wonderful building be be built in legendary age by order of sun goddess same temple surely doe not exist now oh have be rebuilt twenty eight time squire interrupted with exclamation remember lafcadio hearn say that in one of book be very clever man loved people replied akira quietly yes yes colpster nodded absently be strange that did not say anything about mikado jewel be not generally shown to stranger explained japanese have seen of course what be like like chrysanthemum blossom of green jade with emerald in centre mr colpster believe be given to shrine by one of emperor called go yojo be received from shogun ieyasu akira fixed sharp black eye on tired face of host seem pardon to know great deal about jewel observed inquiringly ought to emerald belonged to family century ago astonish thought must cried squire triumphantly yes ancestor of mine gave emerald to queen elizabeth sent through english pilot called will adam to akbar emperor of india adam however be wrecked on coast count presented jewel to ieyasu how very interesting said akira usually passive oriental face betraying wonder thank for telling mr colpster must relate to priest of kitzuki temple when return to own land do so in month two added courteously jewel be now lost so understand read report of death of housekeeper colpster gazed in astonishment at little man did that interest naturally rejoined akira unmoved seeing that death be connected with mikado jewel be sure that be same asked colpster breathlessly assuredly from description expect thief whosoever be brought emerald to london who stole from miss carrol akira shrugged shoulder spread out small hand ala know must mr colpster seeing that thief proposed to transfer to housekeeper through miss carrol looked very directly at host a spoke squire reflected for few minute will be frank with count observed earnestly that emerald brought good luck to family since have left possession have have misfortune loss wished to get back jewel gave basil sum of money to to offer to buy back interrupted akira nodding yes know sent on dangerous errand mr colpster for must have be murdered a perhaps know basil told story said colpster drawing up stiffly can not really agree with a to danger merely offered to buy back what belonged to ancestor of mine ancestor parted with said akira readily rather dryly so a stone have become sacred one be impossible for priest to take money for know dane have nothing to do with disappearance ah squire became cautious know who have anything to do with theft wish did what then must seek out thief regain jewel by own showing thief parted with emerald to miss carrol be akira quiet remark that be taken from be strange oh think so count thief saw miss carrol looking at remember of course detail given at inquest snatched akira be silent for few moment mr colpster said earnestly if be wise will make attempt to regain stone brought family good luck century ago if come into possession again will bring bad luck how do know know for certain even know why be snatched from miss carrol where be now said akira coldly do know added with great emphasis since emerald have be adapted to certain us in shinto temple at power posse must be entirely changed oh believe have such power said squire roughly yet believe that will bring good luck said akira with dry little cough be that rather illogical sir mr colpster must find rejoinder to very leading question dropped subject be very plain that akira knew very little about matter also be dangerous to speak to on subject if indeed jewel be in possession of london thief might be recovered sooner later if akira knew that have again passed into possession of colpster family might get ambassador to claim for japan squire rather regretted that have spoken of matter at since explanation might arouse guest curiosity a day passed away akira did not again refer to abruptly terminated conversation colpster thought that be mistaken japanese really be indifferent to loss of jewel doubt have never given subject second thought squire determined must learn anything from harry pentreddle to keep knowledge to akira doe care meditated one never know if can get emerald by miracle may want for kitzuki again will hold tongue for future be fool to speak of matter having decided to act in manner warned theodore basil mara not to refer in way to mikado jewel yet strangely enough did not warn person who knew most to hold tongue therefore came about one day while patricia be showing garden to akira abruptly mentioned subject of inquest incidentally touched on adventure in hyde park be not afraid miss carrol yes be not afraid until emerald be taken from said patricia frankly why asked count politely with seeming indifference hesitated fear will think silly then in reply to wave of hand idea must never enter head added hastily when held emerald felt power radiating out from ah japanese started in spite of usual self command then have occult power sight feeling hearing have not replied patricia vexed with herself that have spoken so freely be very commonplace person indeed count felt that feeling because be worried hungry naturally muttered akira to get in touch with when physical body be weak get in touch with what asked patricia crossly for began to think that beady eyed little man be making game of with what felt with what saw sha say anything more about matter patricia turned away with great dignity be sorry spoke at secret be safe with miss carrol be secret mr colpster two nephew know suppose understand mr theodore dane doe snapped miss carrol fractiously for persistence of man be getting on nerve yes said akira with ghostly smile in way doe know enough pity for that doe what be talking about count nonsense replied promptly after miss carrol be here to play wonder came here at to quiet place oh care for orgy miss carrol if ask wonder also why be here patricia felt that be speaking truthfully turned on with look of amazement from have seen of small japanese judged that be man who knew own mind a looked by telepathic process guessed what be in hers sometimes do answered on occasion exactly drawled last word slowly patricia almost jumped be very uncomfortable man remarked east west dear lady never meet without misunderstanding cryptic remark closed conversation went in to afternoon tea akira said more did explain puzzling conversation in least however still remembered for time looked at patricia smiled so enigmatically that mother be in woman made wish to slap send to bed without supper same evening in drawing room strange thing took place made patricia wonder more than ever theodore have be performing conjuring trick with card at akira smiled politely basil have sung have played sonata of beethoven feeling tired doubt of shakespeare musical glass mr colpster have stolen to study to look at beloved family tree young people have drawing room to a save mara who invariably declined to contribute to gaiety of evening have done part be turn of japanese amuse in way count commanded patricia crossing to sofa throwing luxuriously on silken cushion ala be so foolish know not how to amuse have told so much of own country that must be tired cried mara with shining eye alert manner never grow weary of hearing about japan why asked count half closing eye mara face became strange cold know said in hesitating manner seem to know japan mara cried basil staring have never be there same know especially know temple of kitzuki ah be there put in theodore glancing at count whose eye be curiously intent upon girl pale face how when asked suddenly went in astral body in search for mikado jewel talk of thing interrupted mara in angry tone count doe want to hear such rubbish of course be rubbish said akira promptly patricia mindful of afternoon conversation did not believe that spoke a felt ah sneered theodore quietly be one of scoffer yet thought that east believed in such thing believe in much never talk about replied akira calmly then there be pause until suddenly produced from pocket bamboo flute can play said with eye on mara a though addressed to be simple japanese instrument have drum basil who be addressed laughed think so there be dinner gong will do said akira serenely must mind getting beating rhythmically like tom tom softly of course so a not to drown note of flute hand bell added casting look round room be arranging orchestra laughed basil going out to fetch gong here be bell cried mara taking small silver hand bell from table covered with nicknack hold please what be to do with asked girl bewildered music play will tell said akira somewhat grimly then patricia began to see that there be meaning in preparation more that same be in hidden way connected with mara however said nothing waited event presently basil tall slim returned carrying brazen gong sat down to flourish stick punch judy said basil now for akira said nothing looked at patricia theodore who be staring at with astonishment at basil laughing over gong finally at mara who held hand bell appeared puzzled suddenly japanese rose from seat crossing to fire threw something into immediately thick white smoke poured into room strong perfume came to patricia nostril seemed to be familiar incense of moses heard theodore mutter hang fellow doe know something of thing mara also smelt perfumed smoke eye grew fixed nostril dilated a patricia have seen in theodore room began to make shaking motion with hand a formerly closed together holding silver bell mouth downward a fragrant smoke be wafted through room shrill piping of flute be heard basil according to instruction began to beat low muffled monotonous accompaniment on gong music sounded weird eastern be unlike anything patricia have ever heard before stupefying incense smoke sobbing flute wailing above throbbing of gong made head swim suddenly mara a if be moving in sleep rose slowly walked into centre of room there began to move with swaying motion in circle shaking silver bell with closed hand foot scarcely made figure a only walked rapidly round round upper part of body swung from side to side bent backward forward be like indian nautch weird uncanny basil seemed to think so for stopped measured beating smoke still wreathed through room in serpentine coil flute shrilled loud piercing mara danced a in dream at once reeled bell crashed on floor basil flung down gong sprang forward be fainting cried angrily catching mara in arm akira what devil doe mean be ill said mara a flute stopped scent of incense grew faint be not ill be be have be doing looked vacantly round room akira laid aside flute spoke with suppressed excitement have be performing miko dance said trying to control miko dance of miko cried mara stretching out hand know remember dance of divineress at last at mara be ill cried basil roughly catching by arm hurried still protesting out of room what doe mean asked patricia who have risen know asked akira looking at theodore said dane puzzled trifle awed when mara smell that scent always dance in queer fashion never saw keep up for so long a have done to night where did get that incense be old japanese incense said akira carelessly then turned to patricia now know why have be brought here said understand stammered girl nervously will explain did not intend to come to beckleigh be compelled to come with sixth sense must know what mean miss carrol wondered why be brought to out of way place now know be to meet former miko of temple of kitzuki oh yes be sure now know why miss colpster declared that remembered country loved to hear talk about be reincarnation of dancing priestess who lived age since in province of izumo do believe that asked patricia scornfully akira nodded japanese believe in reincarnation said in decisive tone be foundation of belief believe also theodore to whom spoke nodded yes wish wish turned pale akira looked at imperiously wish nothing said be not for be not for west be for dai nippon chapter xiv jewel be judged best by concerned to keep episode of miko dance from mr colpster since undoubtedly must have be very angry have known of strain to mara nervous system have be subjected not that girl suffered ill effect be extremely tired remained in bed for greater part of next day patricia attended to tenderly must learn little from a to why have acted in so strange way under influence of incense music intimated vaguely that dance have re awakened recollection of previous life when be not mara colpster quite person miss carrol be quite distressed by what regarded a hallucination privately consulted basil next morning after breakfast be greatly annoyed said dane frowning akira must not have acted in way did without consulting must not have given consent to experiment said patricia certainly not mara be too highly strung to be subjected to thing might easily lose reason be just a well that have decided not to tell uncle must be furious then there must be trouble with akira who have not best of temper under cool exterior why do call experiment ca see merely think that akira wished to give specimen of japanese music influenced mara a saw perhaps have be too hard on akira did not know what must do if did not intend something to happen why did throw that incense on fire asked patricia meaningly ca say unless be to heighten dramatic effect of silly nonsense retorted basil whose temper be still hot be to revive mara memory about what about past life in japan basil stared at surely miss carrol believe in what akira said last night observed with displeasure stiffly patricia looked at keenly young sailor grew red well said at length there be doubt that much common sense be to be found in belief of reincarnation have be so long in east that scoff at so much a western people do same go so far a to say that entirely believe in who have never be east of suez ca possibly credit fact that mara hundred of year ago be priestess in japan patricia looked straight out of window at azure sea bright line of distant horizon dislike weird thing said after pause be uncomfortable to believe since have known brother theodore dislike more than ever a make bad use of what know be certain of doe really know anything asked basil sceptically yes said patricia decidedly really believe have certain power although be not so much on surface a mine everyone according to have power latent require to be developed want mine to be brought to surface a own idea be to live quiet ordinary life basil eye have look in asked if wished to live ordinary life alone said however be quite agree with patricia nodded absently being too much taken up with own thought to observe expression a therefore have belief in such thing continued belief have be more le proved to mind by strange feeling experienced while holding mikado jewel see reason to doubt doctrine of reincarnation seems to better than anything else to answer riddle of life mara be certainly a must admit strange girl very strange indeed assented basil readily unlike other girl have always so told went on patricia steadily be trying to remember dream by think mean previous life must never grasp until last night then music incense brought back memory opened door in fact to most people for instance be closed then really believe lived in japan century ago asked basil in rather awed tone yes do replied miss carrol firmly although know that many people must laugh if said so morning mara be staying in bed will not speak much gather that past have returned to remember how loved to hear count akira story how followed about noticed that so acted a did last night why did think of miko dance in connection with mara theodore confessed to oh patricia blushed must not call by christian name young man suppressed pang of jealousy dare say do so because hear calling one by christian name often wonder added cautiously that call basil patricia blushed still deeper waived question have to tell what brother said remarked stiffly related to count akira how mara danced in weird manner when smelt certain incense gave count hint acted upon a saw paused then turned to face basil what be to be done now sailor have already made up mind in first place uncle must not be told a must make trouble in second will take akira to hendle to day sightseeing so that may not meet mara in third will hint that must be a well seeing effect presence have on mara that must terminate visit do approve yes said patricia nodding be taking most practical way out of difficulty there be one thing be afraid of however what be mara may fall in love with count akira if indeed be not in love with already what with japanese cried basil furiously racial hatred became pronounced at once must never do must not see again be bound to return here so must see ca keep in room until akira go patricia shook head mara be difficult to manage however although may love count may not care for let hope so can do be to act a suggest now must go see after dinner basil must have liked to detain to talk on more absorbing topic question of mara oddity be so very prominent that decided against chatting about more personal matter with sigh watched disappear then went away to seek out akira take out of house for few hour japanese with astuteness did not fathom reason why be asked to drive round country willingly assented asked few careless question about mara did not refer to scene of previous night basil on side be acute enough to let sleeping dog lie so pair started off about noon for jaunt in friendly fashion talked of thing round shop a saying be one referred to scene of previous night yet vivid memory of be uppermost in basil mind a very shrewdly suspected be present also in thought of akira judging from man composure conversation have quite forgotten what have taken place basil be pleased with reticence a saved unpleasantness of explaining too forcibly meanwhile patricia drew long breath of relief when basil drove away with japanese diplomatist went at once to see if mara be right girl feeling drowsy be disinclined to chatter lay back with smile of ecstasy on pale face lip be moving although did not open eye patricia bent to hear if required anything mara be saying amounted to reiteration that have recalled past doubtless since door be now wide open be in fancy dwelling again in oriental home however be quite happy so miss carrol seeing that presence be not necessary to girl comfort stole on tip toe out of room be when came downstairs that chanced upon theodore in entrance big man looked startled surprised spoke to in excited tone come into uncle library at once miss carrol said touching arm have come what have come naturally asked miss carrol puzzled by tone look came by post went on theodore breathlessly be not even registered there be not line with to show who sent know what be talking about mr dane uncle want to hold again in hand see if can feel drawing power spoke of come come quickly at last patricia knew what meant face grew white have mikado jewel asked leaning against wall faint sick for answer theodore unceremoniously led into library saw mr colpster standing near window gloating over something held in hand a moved to face girl vivid green ray shot through subdued light of large room look look cried squire stuttering in excitement held up jade chrysanthemum with emerald flashing in centre a sunlight caught many facet mikado jewel gasped patricia leg refused to sustain longer sank into chair how how did get came by post by mid day post explained squire repeating what nephew have said earlier just carelessly wrapped up in brown paper directed to not even registered packed in small tin box tied round with string postmark be london so must have be sent through general post office district name be stamped on covering oh wonderful wonderful luck of colpsters have returned who sent asked patricia looking with ill concealed repugnance at sinister gem have indirectly brought about death of mr pentreddle man who committed crime struck in theodore impatiently be impossible assassin of poor martha never have in possession although a know hunted house to find thief who snatched from in park miss carrol must have repented sent to rightful owner be rightful owner said squire drawing up spare form to full height gem belonged to ancestor be only fair must posse patricia must not approve of speech a knew from colpster own lip sir bevis have given to queen elizabeth in exchange for knighthood knew also that be useless to argue with squire a appeared to be obsessed by jewel to ascribed such fantastical power nothing be convinced must ever make give up be confirmed in opinion by next word say nothing to basil akira about arrival of emerald said hurriedly to companion trust that japanese think that jewel belongs to temple of kitzuki so doe remarked patricia quickly colpster snarled face became quite ugly animal in anger when turned on sharply belongs to to to cried vehemently pressed jewel close to breast will never give up never never never tell akira at peril intend to say word to count said patricia retreating step before malignant expression be none of business if be wise will throw away why why why chattered colpster still angry at opposition perhaps pricked in conscience by word think will bring evil upon must let come into house panted felt that what said be true theodore started grew pale granny lee have used almost same word when have asked about possible danger old woman have refused to say what danger be perhaps a stated must not put name to after hearing patricia remark theodore felt that perhaps mikado jewel have be referred to a granny lee have said plainly let come into house now girl who also possessed certain power declared that must not be allowed to remain under roof lest must bring evil in train be talking rubbish said theodore roughly trying to conceal dismay how can jewel hurt anyone know ca say must not be allowed to remain here squire colpster laughed laid lovely thing down on desk where flashed gloriously in ray of sunshine will remain here always bring good fortune to family said vaingloriously patricia impelled by outside power rose went up to lay warning hand on old man arm there be something wrong urged consider mr colpster how must thief have sent jewel to unless knew more about matter than think if ordinary tramp stole must have pawned if priest of temple took must have carried a mr theodore suggested back to japan why be sent to know be what puzzle said colpster mouth grew more obstinate than ever be going to keep anyhow what do say miss carrol turned to theodore big man winced grew shade whiter for warning of granny lee still haunted mind sight of jewel knowledge that might one day posse awoke covetous nature must not make up mind to suggest that must be sent away after to brenda lee referred might not be gem say keep remarked drawing deep breath luck of family be bound up in be certain bad luck of family said patricia bitterly oh have be listening to akira said squire crossly declared that probably power have be changed how must know when never set eye on jewel ca imagine admit that be very strange that must have be sent to ca conceive how thief either obtained address how knew that wanted plunder might read in paper began theodore only to be stopped by uncle who looked at sharply talk rubbish boy said nothing at inquest about interest in jewel one outside own family knew that desired must wonder if akira knew said theodore quickly impossible have heard have to tell same will be a well to say nothing about recovery of gem while be in house have promise miss carrol yes will say nothing theodore good even tell mara basil else may let out something to infernal japanese will lock jewel in safe yonder pointed to green painted safe standing in alcove of room now will see luck returning will win that lawsuit will sell ruined hay to advantage will patricia stopped believe everything will go wrong with how dare say that girl exclaimed colpster furiously because feel must jewel have be sent to for good purpose be convinced sixth sense again suppose scoffed squire angrily perhaps said patricia simply privately believed that jewel be already beginning to do harm since old man behaved so rudely a rule have always treated with politeness now revealed side to character have not seen eye shone with greed showed instinct of miser looking at then glancing at nephew continued to speak to hold in hand see if still feel drawing power spoke of in silence patricia took cold jade blossom lay outstretched on pink palm did not speak bewildered expression gradually took possession of face two men who be watching closely spoke together moved by single impulse what do feel patricia did not reply directly be not mikado jewel said in breathless tone be sure be not squire became pale theodore looked amazed what make think that demanded latter who be first able to command voice drawing power be reversed in jewel said patricia yes oh yes feel quite plainly instead of power radiating keeping away evil be drawing danger towards danger gasped squire nephew mindful of granny lee warning winced visibly danger darkness wave after wave of fear be coming towards while hold stone darkness be swallowing up oh patricia shivered deliberately dropped jewel on floor take away like at colpster picked up gem be sure must have let emerald fall otherwise said patricia who be now trembling a if with cold when last held wave of light went out felt absolutely safe now tide of darkness press in on on side there be sense of danger everywhere what sort of danger asked theodore nervously ca say ca put feeling into word look like mikado jewel ca be when feel so different be certain that be mikado jewel cried colpster angrily whether be not ca say retorted patricia backing towards library door be dangerous get rid of suffer went quickly out of room leaving two men staring at one chapter xv pentreddle story squire colpster locked recovered emerald in safe again repeated order that theodore be to say nothing about notwithstanding patricia doubt founded upon different sensation felt by when holding stone master of beckleigh hall really believed that possessed mikado jewel must not comprehend why have be forwarded to how thief have obtained address why thief must think that wanted have squire be le obsessed by ornament might have taken patricia advice with regard to getting rid of in perhaps must have be supported by theodore who be feeling uncomfortable since granny lee statement be always in mind a be said nothing to urge uncle to take such extreme course squire certainly never suggested that gem must be sent away so there lay in safe with influence for good bad ready to become apparent patricia on side put matter of emerald out of mind a did not like to think about occult matter moreover have to attend to duty a housekeeper visit to mara room in afternoon showed that girl be up dressed apparently quite old indifferent self said nothing about miko dance in have figured so patricia did not remind her of in way once twice asked where akira be on learning that have gone sightseeing with basil appeared to be satisfied two gentleman returned in time for dinner tired rather damp from moisture of mist have encountered on moor akira expressed a pleased with english country although shivered when mentioned absence of sun yet a basil reminded japan did not posse particularly tropical climate conversation took place when soup arrived a usual when mention be made of east mara grew delicate rose pink fixed eye eagerly on diplomatist akira gave indifferent glance answered sailor speech in north of japan have very cold weather be sufficiently warm in south in case there be nothing depressing in country such a foreigner find in england be english climate to great extent have made what be count observed colpster seriously can say same of japan hardy climate make hardy men sir think that admire country for do oh swathing mist damp field shivered smilingly at least have earthquake put in patricia with nod ah there have advantage of answered akira wiping mouth in place can keep earthquake away what do mean asked theodore scenting something occult yes akira guessed what vaguely felt there be law control earth wave scientific law said basil quickly might not call so said akira quietly in east know be aware of natural law west have not yet learned well then tell how to control earthquake said squire with sceptical look on face curious must ask that sir must ask miss carrol ask patricia looked amazed held mikado jewel in hand said akira coolly theodore colpster patricia exchanged look wondered if japanese be aware that gem reposed in library safe be impossible of course since have be absent day with basil yet be strange that must refer to object be uppermost in mind understand said patricia doubtfully can explain miss carrol have examined emerald must have seen sign of earth spirit graven thereon that sign show that power to control earth force lie in stone oh ca believe that count yet felt so told radiating ray keep back earth tremor steady a be colpster looked up suddenly thought knew nothing about mikado jewel count said sarcastically know very little told what did know replied akira quietly conversation about climate revived memory of what one of kitzuki priest told emerald have have certain ceremony said over have be set on radiating petal of jade chrysanthemum thus posse repelling power be kept in temple to repel earthquake from shaking ground upon temple stand theodore stole glance at patricia who looked sceptical if suggested in low voice if power instead of radiating be drawn to emerald speak of count what must happen patricia be not quite sure fancied that saw subtle smile on bronzed face of neighbour might have be fancy tricky light of candle glimmering through rosy coloured shade however replied courteously enough in case mr dane according to occult law about confess know little earthquake danger instead of being repelled must be drawn to place where jewel lay oh never have earthquake here said mara with gay laugh if mikado jewel be here power be reversed a be suggested by mr dane must soon feel earthquake else mighty cliff at back of house must fall overwhelm place theodore shivered granny lee have mentioned that have seen crushed a flat a pancake wondered if what akira so idly said must really be true seemed so for must jewel have in drawing power that assuredly have if patricia be to be believed there be great chance that mr lee prophecy might be fulfilled for be not fatal gem in house at moment yes theodore shivered again a became more certain of belief mikado jewel be sibyl have warned must never be allowed to enter beckleigh hall oh be rubbish said squire who not knowing anything about occult refused to believe what patricia have told what akira have so strangely affirmed even if such be case believe jewel be not here akira laughed nodded now can understand why warned not to seek for family emerald again said be afraid will never see said colpster lying with great ease from what theodore think must be now on way back to japan let hope so said akira politely a native of country because religion be shinto regret very much that gem must have be stolen in hand of ignorant person may well bring about death understand looked at patricia not at confessed really in heart scouted idea that emerald must be endowed with such malignant power please talk more about horrid thing hate so do said basil who be growing restless at way in brother eyed patricia let change subject be accordingly done after dinner squire went into drawing room with family scarcely have seated to digest meal when butler entered with whispered information that man wished to see particularly who be sims asked old man impatiently harry pentreddle sir said sims who be old retainer knew a much about member of family a did colpster bounded to foot theodore who be standing before fire came hastily forward basil patricia also looked startled a knew suggested connection between pentreddle giving of jewel only akira mara who be talking quietly in corner appeared unmoved continued conversation will go at once said squire eagerly advancing towards door let come too uncle asked theodore following will hear story if have to tell then can repeat to stay where be basil patricia will see harry alone went out hastily while left behind with exception of japanese mara looked greatly disappointed mr colpster walked quickly into library found seated there before fire thick set young man blue eyed fair haired with unmistakable look of seaman rose a squire entered room twisting cap in strong brown hand looked bashful in fact be trifle nervous of reception have reason to be for mr colpster who have known from babyhood fell on nail so here be at last harry said with frown have given lot of trouble to hunt out what do mean just tell did expect behaviour from harry mother old servant have be murdered in most abominable manner instead of coming to assist in hunting down scoundrel who did go away hide be not ashamed of colpster thundered out word largely did not seem to produce much effect on young man harry pentreddle stood where be still twisting cap stared at squire with steady blue eye composure seemed to be not quite natural did silence can not sit down speak demanded colpster throwing into usual arm chair getting ready to ask question harry sat down quietly still continued to stare steadily be not ashamed of sir because can explain conduct fully then do so snapped squire mother father be servant be born at beckleigh a parent be dead have right to look after do think that need looking after sir asked pentreddle with faint smile glance at stalwart figure in near mirror know what mean

mother be sent miss carrol to get emerald must only have got from who have a told theodore just returned from japan by way do know about death yes said pentreddle stooping to pick up cap thus hide emotion for lip be trembling read everything in paper did not come over because wished to return to japan to kill priest who believe be assassin be sure that priest of kitzuki killed yes feel sure to obtain possession of emerald yes be certain be motive for crime stole emerald yes said pentreddle boldly did laughed softly be very clever of to guess unless poor mother told told nothing snapped squire with glare did be to ask for london holiday got went to death be miss carrol must have read about in paper who suggested that possibly might have passed emerald did although at time in fog darkness believed be mother only when reading about death did know that have be kept at home with sprained ankle wait bit said colpster throwing up hand be confusing want to hear from beginning paused seeing that pentreddle looked nervous be beginning to twist cap again swiftly made up mind to course of action to suggest confidence wait bit said colpster again went to safe when returned to table placed mikado jewel under lamp harry rose bent over quite speechless with astonishment thought be snatched from miss carrol in park gasped so be someone thief presume sent to arrived here without detail be sure that be jewel asked quickly yes be jewel right enough answered pentreddle returning to seat how did thief know wanted ca say be not even aware if thief sent know be that there lie luck of colpsters have shown to so that may see repose confidence in in return harry squire leaned forward touched young man knee wish to hear about theft of emerald from kitzuki temple pentreddle thought for few moment while looked at winking green ornament under lamplight then glanced at watch nodded must get away soon said briskly be staying at hendle friend of mine be waiting on moor road with trap wo take long to tell everything sir colpster leaned back placed tip of finger together be ready to hear said quietly bending head harry began story in hurry mother a know sir nursed nephew mr basil be always favourite never must abide mr theodore learned from sir that intended to leave estate to nephew who got back emerald be family luck yes such be intention well mother went on sailor twirling cap be determined that mr theodore must never inherit so a knew be going to japan asked to steal emerald have right to steal must have forbidden martha suggesting such thing said squire angrily pentreddle nodded know for reason mother kept affair secret readily agreed to do what wanted a mr basil have always be kind to whereas mr theodore halted oh go on said colpster with cynical smile know that mr theodore be not favourite with anyone how can be sir when behaves so badly insulted be neither here there sir have time to talk of matter told mother must get emerald somehow when landed at nagasaki set about looking for in what way well see sir mother learned from about giving of emerald to shogun chap then told how miss mara in funny way knew that be at temple of kitzuki went there on chance man who kept tea shop told about jewel said that have be given to temple by mikado thought be shogun shogun who got from will adam gave to mikado presented to temple explained colpster go on oh be be sir well then went on twirling cap got sight of jewel in temple stole how when be so carefully guarded think be guarded over much said pentreddle thoughtfully see sir tea shop man told that emerald be under spell of earth spirit called queer name ca remember to keep away earthquake japanese must dare to touch jewel lay a saw on small altar near shrine managed to stop inside temple after dark stole how did get away said squire wondering at daring will tell that day sir a be getting late did manage to get away stow jewel on board ship be followed followed by whom japanese suppose be priest be nearly knifed at nagasaki once be drugged have hidden emerald away must not find when got to port of london thought that be safe soon found that be dogged there also by whom asked colpster once more japanese said pentreddle again went met japanese swarmed round have written to mother saying must give emerald if came to london did wrote asking to go to home of art knew better than to do sir felt certain that if gave jewel to mother must run chance of being killed there be one big chap with scar across cheek believe killed poor mother what make think that harry asked colpster eagerly because be loafing round home of art one evening trying to catch glimpse of mother when saw beast watching house be man with scar priest just be said sailor vigorously shinto priest saw in temple at kitzuki then be certain that be being followed by priest wrote told mother must only give emerald secretly replied saying that whole household at home of art have appointment to see play know said squire impatiently skip that well then sir mother said that being alone must leave house at night without suspicion being aroused told to meet at nine o'clock at right hand corner of bayswater side of serpentine bridge to look for red light of course a learned later be kept in by sprained foot sent miss carrol why did not speak to miss carrol have chance said harry simply guessed be being followed by priest with scar by smaller slighter built chap dodged at heel in fog so have just time to shove box into miss carrol hand into mother hand a thought then run off in hope little beast must follow did did for time then fancy suspicion must have be aroused by red light by stopping for moment lost lost in fog then instead of returning to lodging in pimlico made for limehouse dock heard next morning of death why did then come to home of art be good sir remonstrated pentreddle must only have be knifed by japanese there must have be two murder instead of one sir be such fool a going to home of art must have brought mother back to life bunked over to amsterdam lay low then read in paper how miss carrol have be robbed of gem colpster nodded must have returned then be of use sir said sailor gloomily knew that emerald must have got back into hand of priest that must return to kitzuki in japan be certain be now that big man with scar on cheek stabbed mother so waited for ship told about to go back to japan kill then isa wrote said if saw must help pentreddle looked at emerald seems to that thing be more muddled up than ever here be mikado jewel where be priest colpster pinched nether lip looked perplexed ca say by way theodore met in london yes sir by chance in pimlico why did give emerald why harry looked astonished because be to prevent mr theodore becoming heir that mother took trouble so met with death rose to foot will go now sir squire rose also yes unless prefer to stay here for night sir want to get back to hendle will come see again if want to hear more think will be a well must like to repeat story in presence of nephew meanwhile good night squire having shaken hand with sailor sent away wished to be alone to think over thing while doing so put away mikado jewel in safe ten minute later returned to drawing room where be count akira akira be tired went early to bed said basil be off too uncle chapter xvi lover next morning occurred to squire that have dismissed pentreddle too abruptly rather since man wished to go have given leave too easily thousand one question came into mind desired to ask must have put to sailor during hurried interview recollection that harry be stopping at hendle be holding at disposal of feudal chief modern style reconciled to oversight decided that second examination must be longer one will drive over to hendle to day cross examine thought squire completing toilette descended to breakfast with excellent appetite at meal heard news for akira stated that must have to return day to london a chief wanted be coming down again in few day said japanese stealing glance at mara who sat opposite to rosy faced interested in yacht did know have yacht akira said basil with keen interest of sailor in craft oh yes replied count composedly very good yacht friend have much money know have taken to english way so far a to buy steam yacht later propose returning to own country in colpster be frankly relieved that akira intended to leave did not for one moment connect with who be hunting who have be hunting for mikado jewel while curious object be in house preferred count absence to presence there be doubt that if little man did learn how gem have returned to original possessor that must clamour for restoration to kitzuki be not to be thought of for one moment squire have not yet solved problem a to why jewel have be sent to how sender have known that presence be desired at beckleigh hall by master must have liked to question akira for if priest according to pentreddle have snatched emerald from patricia akira a japanese must best be able to explain same priest reason for sending to devonshire be obviously impossible to ask question so colpster contented with expressing regret that count have be compelled to cut short stay at hall trust when return in yacht will at least complete interrupted visit by sleeping under roof said colpster thank sir replied japanese politely will remain on boat for few day stay here hope added with comprehensive bow to present that will allow to return great hospitality mr colpster by giving entertainment on board entertainment cried mara eye sparkled yes japanese entertainment with japanese food drink amusement miss colpster will be change for doubt will give great deal of pleasure will give pleasure said patricia smiling for black eye of little man be fixed on face then ask to entertainment even servant must come mr colpster never see anything unusual down here so will amuse to see how japanese live presume added akira with attempt at humour that can allow house to be empty for one night oh yes said theodore laughing there be robber about here in case hope invitation will be accepted certainly count thank for invitation observed squire in hearty manner on behalf of family household accept akira bowed that be good sir for a depart for own country after leave place in yacht will not see again for many long year have to remain at tokio for official business have have delightful stay here looked round pleasantly will see of how can return kindness wo be tired travelling to london to day said theodore quickly count piercing eye seemed to look questioner through through a if inquiring why asked particular question retired early last night a know mr dane said quietly so be not at weary dane turned sideways to basil will drive to hendle must allow to do count put in squire have to go to hendle on business to day thank sir show true hospitality basil felt uneasy a did not know if guest spoke ironically not resolved to test matter can come also akira ah be not necessary akira held up protesting hand will enjoy drive with uncle stay here will meet again on board miko mara started miko cried eagerly with shining eye name of yacht miss colpster named after divine dancer girl looked a though wished to ask further question significant glance of patricia directed towards squire who knew nothing about miko dance made mara more prudent rose abruptly from table shortly rest followed example akira went to see that servant be packing thing properly basil accompanied a for theodore followed uncle into library closed door what did pentreddle say to last night asked anxiously be long story said colpster sitting down to look over correspondence will tell to be driving over to hendle will bring back with akira can drop at station to catch afternoon express must like to come also uncle a be so anxious to hear harry story there be room in brougham for said colpster coldly showed very plainly by unnecessary lie that did not wish for nephew company theodore frowned knew that be favourite at least uncle give short account of what heard squire at first refused theodore be so persistent that in end be obliged to yield hastily ran through story what do think asked when ended expect harry be right that priest with scar murdered mother doubt man learned why harry be hanging round home of art laid plan accordingly martha did not posse emerald insisted squire doubtfully priest did not know at time said dane grimly accomplice watched harry apparently while man with scar watched crook street house must have induced martha to let in might have thought be son know then when grew frightened threatened with stiletto used against having murdered poor old thing finally searched house colpster nodded must see other solution of mystery curious though that priest did not get caught by police oh according to evidence fog be very bad one policeman confessed in print that did not patrol cul de sac carefully pity did not catch brute oh said colpster with grim look harry will see that man be punished be going from amsterdam in tramp steamer to japan for very purpose ca understand said theodore after pause tapping desk with long finger why harry did give emerald when met must have saved trouble squire coughed in rather embarrassed manner must scarcely tell theodore harry acting under mother instruction wished particularly to prevent from gaining possession of jewel therefore shrugged shoulder evaded question there be many thing can not understand in connection with case quite so said theodore with uneasy look at safe particularly why mikado jewel must have be sent to uncle added after pause get rid of sell pawn return to akira to take back to japan send out of house beg of why demanded colpster drawing brow together be mad theodore wiped perspiration from high white forehead on contrary be particularly sane heard what akira said about reverse power possibly bringing cliff down on house oh rubbish said squire roughly akira doe know that gem be in house more reason for believing that spoke truly said dane with desperate look be sure thing be evil there be now in drawing power a know miss carrol felt believe in rubbish patricia be fanciful girl said colpster coldly emerald be in possession intend to keep if dare to tell akira about theodore will send out of house will never recognize again a nephew be not so sure what must prefer to be out of house while damned thing be in said theodore between teeth be playing with fire uncle see that get burnt with warning departed leaving old man looking after back contemptuously be very material man be squire considered that nephew be as for believing in thing must not be proved by arithmetic theodore be not happy in mind when akira colpster departed for there be many matter worried basil a usual be following patricia about house be one grievance now that mara must not marry must certainly lose chance of inheriting through desirable acre of beckleigh be grievance finally presence of charmed mikado jewel in house troubled very much indeed felt certain that granny lee prophecy concerned since akira have spoken of occult power of stone patricia have felt reversion of power so theodore uneasily considered that be just possible that cliff might be shaken down in ruin on house went out looked at mighty height almost expecting to see sign of crumbling of course there be none red cliff stood up boldly gigantically a have stood for century past sight of massive grandeur rather reassured theodore be rubbish muttered to coming in out of rain for morning there have be downpour daresay be making mountain out of mole hill same eye fell on safe in library in knew be jewel safely locked away to shift mikado emerald must need to shift safe be impossible oh be rubbish declared again then went to own room on way passed library saw mara lying on cushion of sofa stringing bead onyx turquoise malachite pink coral sliver of amethyst gleamed like rainbow a slid through deft hand theodore wondered where got entered to inquire count akira gave to said mara gaily tried effect of glittering chain against pale golden hair be lovely yes father wo like taking present from infernal japanese mara said theodore crossly nerve be so upset that felt must relieve to vent temper on someone mara sprang to foot like small fury face grew darkly red a pale eye blazed with anger have right to speak in way of count akira love care who hears love sat down again suddenly wish must take to japan ended viciously mara theodore be horrified japanese well be one age ago retorted believe yes do know too much about occult thing to disbelieve theodore a matter of fact did believe did not intend to confess a much ca be sure snapped furiously can be sure be sure said mara mutinously since danced round of divineress heard music have come back to remember temple of kitzuki quite well ceremony oh wish must go back there be native land theodore looked at stealthily eye glittered a idea struck hard must go if akira took yes mara wet lip stared at perhaps will take said softly be coming back in yacht know if went father must disown care must lose beckleigh care must be cut off from own race care be fool shouted theodore savagely will tell father mara wreathed many hued bead artistically round neck admired in mirror over fireplace also have glimpse of cousin face spoke from what read written thereon wo theodore observed coolly meaningly must be glad to see run off with count akira give up everything why must be glad demanded dane taken aback by shrewd reading of most secret thought because a say father must have nothing to do with must inherit beckleigh be safe in hand there be chance for said theodore tartly failing basil must inherit think so if marries patricia uncle george like patricia know that so do think must like basil to marry in fact mara faced believe that father must like to make patricia step mother what theodore be now really astonished be absurd see that father be still young man for year oh rubbish nonsense theodore broke furiously into speech fairly ran out of room to think over problem thus presented to believed that what cousin said be perfectly true a mara be observant young person in spite of dreamy way then remembered how colpster always professed to admire patricia did so loudly be always asking if liked place what must do for telling that hoped must stay there for rest of life theodore drew long breath see what old man be up to considered a mara wo marry either basil intends to marry patricia in hope of having heir to estate must be end to everything not that believe girl must have yet of theodore must not be sure a judged miss carrol by own greedy self must girl penniless a knew patricia to be resist offer of so beautiful home dane thought not set wit to work to bar possible chance of very unexpected thing coming to pas to do so have only to throw patricia into basil arm believed that knew how to do will ask to marry thought theodore with evil smile then basil will be so furious that will ask hate love so in end will become engaged then uncle george will kick out of house mara evidently intends to elope with akira when return in yacht little beast said that boat after leaving here be going straight to japan will settle have will be only person left to console uncle george so must a reasonable man leave property can see thus arranging plan went away to find patricia force into basil arm be sorry to lose girl because of psychic power a plainly hated saw that easily there be not chance for since must not make use of in one way therefore decided to make use of in through basil must be got rid of then mara must ruin by eloping with akira dane rubbed hand with delight at prospect thus opened out before even forgot uneasiness over mikado jewel ceased for moment to remember sinister prophecy of mr brenda lee of course be necessary to act comedy so a to accomplish aim suspected that must suffer pain during acting if insulted patricia intended to do basil must assuredly knock down if sailor did that must be obliged to declare love for patricia if only to prove right to be champion what did little pain matter to prospective owner of beckleigh schemer found pair in smoking room cosy somewhat modern apartment for house be in west wing possessed large plate glass window looked down vista where tree be cut down to beach water of bay patricia knitting silk tie sat on sofa near window while basil lounged in deep arm chair smoking pipe two be laughing when theodore entered suddenly became serious when saw who have disturbed be strange that elder dane must always produce dull impression on gayest of people perhaps be owing to uncanny disagreeable atmosphere always carried about with what be joke asked new comer throwing into arm chair opposite to in brother sat nothing said basil shortly brow wrinkled what do want to smoke cigarette replied theodore producing case room be free to be quite free said patricia colouring for did not like tone when two brother be together be always apprehensive of trouble for reason because hoped to throw oil on troubled fraternal water did refrain from leaving room yet theodore look be so insolent that half rose to do so must go patricia said elder brother hastily mr dane like to call by christian name said colour grew deeper than ever rose to full height now made ready to go theodore doe know what be saying muttered basil in tone of suppressed rage brother looking at mockingly saw that face be a crimson a of patricia really seem to be like goddess of discord went on intruder intent upon bringing about catastrophe seemed jolly enough when entered laughing talking will be jolly again when leave snapped basil savagely daresay sha have miss carrol to yourself go miss carrol see that be addressing with respect rose slipped between door a spoke want basil to see that like a much a do patricia looked nervous feeling be not soothed when basil rose in turn go away miss carrol said sternly vein on forehead stood out with rage can deal with theodore theodore can deal with said that gentleman turning on brother with black look on face be always taking up patricia time have right to also yes faced to startled girl intend to call patricia because love want to marry theodore be mad thundered basil furiously be mad to ask girl hand in marriage sneered theodore patricia stopped further speech of basil with imperative gesture looked at theodore be well able to take care of said quietly mr dane thank for offer decline oh be not so handsome a basil be not so rich a uncle george take care take care breathed basil savagely in ear patricia again stopped temper rose eye sparkled in angry fashion what do mean by reference to mr colpster want to marry ah keep off theodore flung out hand with scream a basil hit out blow caught fairly in left eye reeled towards window to fall on sofa bully fairly sobbed apologise to miss carrol by heaven will break neck raged basil standing over flabby man with clenched fist patricia admiring strong lover came forward laid hand on arm imploringly leave alone basil be not worth hitting theodore struggled to foot with rapidly swelling eye presented miserable spectacle basil screamed rage be partly real so call basil doubt that be for be knitting oh burst into mocking laughter pointed finger at so be how be carrying on be got further basil breaking from patricia sprang forward catching theodore bulky body in powerful arm fairly flung through window with mighty heave patricia gasped with surprise delight a glass smashed theodore swung across grass down slope like stone fired from catapult devil roared basil shaking fist through broken window will kill if come near patricia oh be dead gasped girl clinging to sailor not see sure enough theodore with face convulsed with impotent rage rose heavily limped out of sight have settled hound now looked at meaningly patricia shrank back flushing like sunset mr dane called basil just now will call basil for rest of life must not marry theodore said masterfully will marry yes whispered patricia yielding to embrace always loved darling darling darling cried delighted sailor straining to breast theodore meant to part only succeeded in bringing together kissed again again little knew how theodore have schemed to bring about very kiss chapter xvii trouble misfortune rarely come singly theodore be so damaged by basil that be compelled to keep to room have meal sent up to apart from physical pain schemer be very satisfied with result of comedy have played in smoking room lurking unseen at corner of house have beheld patricia in brother arm must believe evidence of own eye that rubicon have be crossed nevertheless felt pang at losing girl for apart from psychic power must have be extremely useful to in study be so pretty charming that le susceptible man than dane must have regretted success of theodore have by time decided that must not have cake eat so be necessary to lose beckleigh patricia

on shore during hour of darkness basil indeed a soon a akira informed of catastrophe akira seemed to know positively what have taken place even before arrival of steam launch with news wished to see what have become of uncle brother japanese pointed out that fragment of cliff be still falling that must be dangerous to venture a hour so thunder of falling mass be heard dane considered that advice be good possessed soul in patience until dawn frequently during night lamented that have not searchlight of own ship to see what extent of damage be done of course such wishing be altogether vain a miko be large there be plenty of accommodation servant be persuaded to go below sleep woman be very hysterical men greatly upset everyone be devoted to squire hoped against hope that have be saved be noticeable that one troubled about theodore until night basil have idea how very unpopular brother really be have not much time to think a greater part of time be spent in soothing patricia felt dreadful accident consequence much more than did mara that young lady wept expressed great sorrow with rigid face stared into gloom veiled home of childhood made scarcely remark akira when harry came on board privately asked if thought that colpster nephew have escaped be certain have not said pentreddle emphatically mr theodore be tied up last saw of squire be at window cursing for taking away

emerald be no longer in danger give life also because obeyed instruction so implicitly can have produced ten note of ten pound one hundred pound friend must touch sir must look a though wanted to take money for avenging poor mother death be very creditable to pentreddle think need decline have be useful to deserve payment thus persuaded harry gladly took note a placed in pocket observed gloomily that thought theodore dane have died in too easy manner akira shook head rebuked friend that mr dane broke great law when next be born will have to pay back to mother owes by wishing to torture a suggested to be only preparing trouble for yourself have be partly punished leave a to rest to great law what be great law a sow so will reap said akira quietly have heard that before sir be in sacred

mr dane pentreddle did so when questioned a to how came into possession related that knew how have brought back will to rightful owner patricia be present when explained lover be horrified to hear that theodore have murdered poor woman questioned cross questioned until be weary excused so that might get little sleep there be none for young couple if theodore be indeed dead be mercy said basil thankfully oh dearest dead in sin oh said young man rather cynically if one have to wait until theodore from what knew of be fit to die must have become immortal darling added quickly catching sight of patricia pained face mean to be flippant god have mercy on soul say with heart be thoroughly bad man well be dead so let think more about so said so felt throughout weary night continued to talk of scamp also referred regretfully to death of squire patricia wept for old man who have be so kind to in end grief anxiety wore out fell asleep on basil breast sat in sheltered corner of deck for miss carrol refused to be parted from lover in grey grim light finally saw ruin have be wrought by fall of mighty cliff there be vast rent in breast be by mean so high a have be below be tumbled mass of red rock beneath not only hall greater part of ground be buried that have be beckleigh be now thing of past for in way must enormous quantity of rubble rock sand stone be lifted whole formed gigantic tumulus such a of yore have be heaped over body of barbarous chief squire colpster wicked nephew certainly have magnificent monument to mark place where reposed amidst fallen rock be impossible to rebuild hall to reconstruct ground have income said basil while stood on deck with arm round patricia waist looking at ruin home be gone for ever patricia shuddered be sorry of course for be such lovely place be such lovely place dear yes yes always felt afraid when in hall felt certain that day cliff must fall always seemed hostile to be only hostile to two people said quiet voice of akira behind man who murdered for sake of emerald man who set in motion cause brought emerald to beckleigh have paid for sin do mean count will tell dane when go ashore said japanese calmly in meantime come down have breakfast look faint miss carrol be time that restored strength go down see wife will look after when patricia descended companion akira turned to basil excuse dane said courteously fall of

unless cast hopeful glance at scarred face of cliff squire brother be dead will lie under mighty pile of earth to end of time unless high tide wash away of course mean sheath will soul be now reaping according to sowing come to breakfast basil descended with patricia bridal couple have excellent breakfast be much needed be useless to sorrow for dead to extent of starving for for basil have seen very little of uncle for many year certainly have cause to mourn for theodore a for mara be a cool composed a ever ate so well that one must ever have believed that have just lost father be use cry over spilt milk said making use of favourite proverb although cousin patricia considered that be decidedly heartless must not deny good sense of saying invariably quoted a excuse for indifference be not sufficiently hard hearted to remain behind although feeling may have be merely one of curiosity for came on deck cloaked gloved with hat on ready to join party akira promptly told that did not wish to go a slightest wish be law to obeyed yacht be to sail somewhere about noon so there must be chance for basil patricia to come on board again did want to seeing at present have so much to think about so said good bye to countess akira departed along with melancholy household have now no home launch took ashore under what seemed ironically sunny blue sky after late rain storm be cheerful to see water of bay sparkle in sunlight ala beckleigh be a ruined a ever be pompeii in future fairy bay must only be stretched out before desolate scene patricia almost wept when saw ruin of beauty spot not vestige of house be to be seen be crushed flat under ton of red earth while nearly down to water edge great sandstone rock much rubble have smashed tree obliterated flower bed over gigantic heap of dbris mighty cliff still soared rent scarred although not to original height early a day be many people men woman be moving amongst rubbish seeing what must pick up there be absolutely nothing to be found enormous fall of ton ton of earth have pulverized beckleigh into dust be like ruin of pre historic world many people came down when saw approaching launch amongst relative of servant together with friend took charge of homeless wanderer gradually whole household disappeared up winding road to find shelter before departed basil informed that within week must return to hendle attend to need a have inherited property although young man be favourite dispossessed be too miserable to raise cheer departed with sad face hanging head world be in ruin save what stood up in be without money home promise made by new master that must look after cheered not little akira after have walked round desolation with basil patricia asked to return to pier here have seat brought up from launch sat down to hear what have to say first speech rather surprised used a be becoming to happening of unexpected be sorry that have occurred said seriously waving hand towards ruin have to bring about looked at one then at speaker believing with reason that be crazy how must possibly bring about asked mr dane in sceptical tone mikado jewel brought about oh patricia winced be going to talk more of occult nonsense can call nonsense in face of miss carrol be accident owing to late rain quite so be what world will consider can tell differently happened because mikado jewel be in house be not said basil imperatively must have gone on talking that patricia stopped be in house said quickly only mr colpster poor man asked theodore to say nothing about basil cast glance at red heap then be buried under rubbish said disdainfully for occult power must look after looked after said akira quietly be now on board yacht be taking back to japan to restore to temple of kitzuki how did get akira pentreddle by desire took from squire when went last night to accuse theodore brother of murder did not tell said basil involuntarily asked not to a wished to tell be sorry to bore with occult talk miss carrol think must like to understand reason for jewel being at beckleigh at sent to mr colpster yes did to punish for daring to have stolen from kitzuki did wish stolen be angry that harry must steal akira waved hand mr colpster be original cause of setting in motion cause led to mr pentreddle death to own death to of nephew believed that jewel must bring back luck instead of that brought that pointed to ruin basil looked helplessly at speaker dear fellow be quite in dark a to what be talking about listen will explain something of what tell have be told to before something now tell be new drew long breath continued expect to believe say will try said basil ironically go on mr colpster wished for mikado jewel said akira deliberately so employed dane to offer money for mr pentreddle heard from late master that intended to give property to nephew who brought back jewel hated theodore loved so a son be going to japan asked to get jewel in way told mr colpster need not repeat stole got away with be followed watched priest of temple told government at tokio be deputed to see if jewel must be recovered went to kitzuki saved life when came to offer money for gem thank for doing akira said basil heartily right be only too pleased since information gave about emerald having be presented to one of queen helped to unravel mystery several attempt be made to get gem from pentreddle while be in japan failed therefore sent two men to watch for arrival of ship in london followed knew that have made friend intended to come to beckleigh if be necessary when arrived in london found that pentreddle be trying to give jewel to mother learned through hanging round house that old lady be staying at home of art in crook street have that watched suppose of course replied akira serenely man with scar on cheek who be attendant in temple of kitzuki watched that house then learned where pentreddle be boarding in pimlico second man gained access to room letter left about be read learned that mother intended to meet at serpentine in way know of followed when went to keep appointment what cried patricia be count who snatched jewel from yes noticed that pentreddle passed box followed fancied must take box home sat down to examine be strange drawing power made open box wanted to see what caused power fear answered akira rather ironically that curiosity be not gratified however a power still radiated from stone keeping off thing must hurt reversed power rather stopped altogether how did manage asked basil doubtfully akira shook head can not tell dare not be secret even if did must only laugh since believe in sort of thing knew necessary mantra to say said looked at patricia with smile felt difference yes nodded with look of something like awe then snatched of course jewel being recovered must then there have taken back to japan for murder of mr pentreddle theodore did murder then said basil in low shamed voice oh yes in way son told man with scar saw crime committed secured scarf a evidence with name of brother marked in corner bad a theodore be said basil drawing deep breath be glad that did not shame family by denouncing akira smiled at in friendly way of course be friend observed also wished to find young pentreddle came down to beckleigh a know left instruction to two men to send down jewel to mr colpster before leaving london reversed power see expect to see dear man interrupted akira quickly jewel arrived with power reversed yes patricia nodded again felt shivered well then akira glanced at watch there be little more to tell simply waited while jewel did work of loosening cliff time be in house be drawing ton of earth down on place heard in drawing room night mr colpster be going to speak to pentreddle pretended to go to bed instead of doing so got out of window intercepted on winding road then told must prove who killed mother sent to wait for arrival in london went next morning came on later then made man with scar tell everything pentreddle left with full statement signed by man witnessed a brother be dead be useless to make scandal said akira glancing at basil got that document from last night burned dane leaned forward shook hand of japanese be greatly obliged to said with emotion why said akira in friendly manner there be reason that must suffer for sin of others must not be fair besides wish to give miss carrol clean name now then do wish to know more a must up anchor steam for east how many people know that brother committed murder do two men a be going away for ever will hold tongue need not fear harry pentreddle will say nothing a respect miss carrol too much besides gave one hundred pound to get married on so when be happy will not wish to make others unhappy squire be only other person who knew be dead name be quite safe thank god for said basil reverently took off hat one question more said patricia rising what did mean when told that now knew why have come to beckleigh be because of mara explained akira gravely be formerly priestess in temple of kitzuki for reason spirit of earth whose spell be on emerald wished to bring to arm have promised to love for seven life know for reason theft of mikado jewel be permitted for pentreddle must have be kept back by radiating power even with ill intent have to reverse rather break power before must take gem from then know spell what be power contained in stone now akira hesitated told that jewel be left on board said be not true brought with produced box from pocket took from jewel great stone blazed with green lustre in sunlight take in hand miss carrol patricia did so while basil looked at gem curiously have never seen before suddenly patricia cried out with delight oh yes feel warmth light power streaming out from petal imagination said basil impatiently took stone can feel nothing of what describe count carefully replaced jewel in box be not psychic never wish to hear that word again said basil fervently think will replied akira dryly slipped box into pocket well now will say good bye from japan will send wedding present be kind to mara said patricia imploringly be sure of be sacred thing to be not miko of kitzuki did not earth spirit bring to arm changed reverent tone for matter of fact one good bye dane akira held out hand then suddenly drew back there be one thing must like to add so that may guess be not in favour of killing innocent people gave entertainment so a to lure dane miss carrol together with servant on board yacht out of harm way therefore mr colpster assassin be left to fate alone in house pentreddle asked basil shuddering akira looked towards winding road up harry be slowly climbing have to send to get jewel remarked warned of danger escaped now be have to tell added quickly seeing that patricia be about to ask question good bye of once more shook hand gravely round then akira jumped into launch steamed away in great hurry a usual basil patricia set face landward picked way over loose rock in short time walking above grave of uncle cousin gained clear space of winding road here came face to face with mr lee who be toiling down alone ah said with chuckle so be mr basil old creature nodded told must be crushed a flat a pancake if allowed to come into house did like silly fool now be buried under rubbish pointed staff disdainfully downwards who did tell to granny asked

senile laugh what do make of basil asked patricia when reached top of winding road came in sight of carriage be to take to hendle railway station well said young man reflectively after what have taken place dare not disbelieve in many thing hope that what granny say will come true dear basil amidst trouble turned to catch in arm be sure that with darling a be for wife everything be entirely
