darkness while cabman with muttered expression of thanks drove back to town be lonely road with high fence on side topped by tree beyond great house in darkness a inmate have apparently gone to bed adrian have idea where be walked slowly along muddy path with downcast head hand thrust well into pocket boot be more adapted to piccadilly than to country road cold chill struck through thin sol paid attention mechanically walking onward without heeding where be going above heaven be slightly clearing of mass of cloud few star showed brightly in cold blue while tree on side shook branch complainingly in cold wind heavy drop of rain fell from moist leaf at last found walking along under weather stained brick wall on top of grew luxurious ivy towards end low door appeared stood slightly open half thinking that must admit into park where must conceal adrian with very definite purpose in mind pushed wide open entered found in dense darkness standing in path apparently ran through belt of beech tree whose branch meeting overhead shut out midnight sky with outstretched hand carefully advanced following winding of path carefully avoiding collision with trunk of tall tree on side at last emerged into wide lawn half ringed by dense mass of tree while at one end stood large house with many gable turret standing black against clear sky beyond adrian recognized a one of old country house still remain in hampstead isolating in sullen pride amid wide park although enclosed on side by row of red brick villa desirable residence long drive frightful excitement through have passed dampness of night be telling on physically longed to find place where must lie down rest with idea stole across lawn towards house on turning corner of great beech tree stood high up in

furnished apartment with man seated in chair near table covered with white table cloth on be spread comfortable supper hardly knowing what be doing only anxious to have someone to talk to relieve overburdened mind adrian boldly stepped into room tall sombre figure with muddy boot wet with rain sir said lancaster taking off hat will permit to suddenly broke off speech with low cry for figure in chair that of old man wrapped in comfortable dressing gown did not stir remained in same position with still limb closed eye adrian at first thought be asleep case be too urgent to permit remaining till man awoke so stepping forward touched on shoulder to dismay figure did not stir on looking closely at still face closed eye rigid limb lancaster saw that be dead fearful sight in connection with horror have already undergone be too much for nerve with ejaculation of terror put on hat strode rapidly towards window with intention of seeking safety once more in flight stay adrian faced round

being withdrawn fellow priest determined to kill a one knowing too much of secret dangerous to brotherhood fortunately however learning stood in good stead for discovered danger fled from neighbourhood must not have saved seeing that priest have at command secret if used must have annihilated physically by disintegrating body sending soul forth to infinite without fleshy envelope at critical stage of career however chanced to meet old friend lai chunder who be still engaged in life long penance by power be protected in great measure from malignity of brahmin lai chunder be man who have marvellous knowledge of secret of psychological science for self complacent savant of europe profess such profound contempt for hindoo trinity of brahma creator vishnu preserver siva

former tenement remained motionless empty law of universe however forced to return once more to own body having done so buried mortal part of yoghi in earth to resolve into original element then left india for europe did a be still object of enmity to priest although now possessed spiritual power equal to own be unwilling to come into collision with in way have plenty of money a far a material want be concerned be amply provided while of course life long study gave complete command over spiritual part of only arrived in england last year established in house found convenient to city also isolated enough to permit to live own life without comment have one servant whom hired when first settled down serf sufficiently well be doe everything necessary for material want speaks to one about life lead frequently leave body for day soar untrammelled through wide expanse of infinite have strange vision wild dream unexplainable ecstacies only regret be that being bound by law of universe be fixed unalterable have to return at certain interval to body of course servant know nothing of trance a knowledge of be bounded by life lead in house curiously enough in spite of year of spiritual training material desire be not yet conquered six month after arrival in country fell in love what attracted most about young lady became attached to be not beauty of face form although in of be pre eminent strong masculine spirit inhabited feminine body be introduced to through medium of father on whom called to deliver letter of introduction from friend in india finding that material nature have surrendered to spell have cast over determined to marry initiate into mystery of occult science so that like soul must be able to leave body fly side by side with mine through infinite space however be already in love with young man about own age not finding ancient year scarred emaciated body sufficiently attractive refused to marry so after many trial failing to shake resolution gave up thought of attaining object returned here to await in patience period of solution when soul will at last leave body reside for ever in unseen world love may imagine now only being ever loved have so disdainfully trampled on affection offered have wish to stay on earth longer than can help a told however law of universe permit to leave body until period appointed by god although be now sixty year of age body have be exposed to torture privation must have killed ordinary man yet still live on so far a can see there be probability of dying for year ardently desiring however to cut short period of earth life sought for other solution of enigma besides death must not die dare not kill for suicide be terribly punished in spiritual world a soul murder by mean of communings while in spirit with inhabitant of distant sphere have discovered that if can obtain soul willing to inhabit own body work out allotted year own soul can leave world for ever solution perplexed very much a did not know where to find man who must be willing to leave own body incarnate in withered trunk go by name of dr michael roversmire thought however chance might send someone willing to do what wanted garden door be left open by so that stranger might be drawn hither by strong desire for service have be burglar must have offered choice of being arrested for attempt to rob house of being incarnated in body enjoying income working out balance of life though week have passed one came however to night presented think will be excellent subject for purpose have committed murder in own body be in danger of being hanged therefore propose that must conceal in frame work out allotted span of life so that soul can leave world without sin mingle for ever with pure spirit who inhabit unseen universe see therefore that if be agreeable to plan can secure from earthly harm by incarnating soul in body a adrian lancaster to morrow will see in prison few week possibly on scaffold concealed in personality of dr michael roversmire will be able to defy everyone lead life desire now have told story can ask question please think have put question plainly before remains with whether will accede to request incarnate in body a adrian lancaster run risk of arrest ignominious death at hand of law chapter iv curious transformation adrian listened to strange recital in silent astonishment in spite of trouble in be involved felt inclined to regard whole a whimsical outcome of madman brain have heard great deal about occult science theosophy spiritist belief engaged in frivolous life have not paid much attention to teaching looked upon a religion of charlatan quack here be man who far outstripped power theosophist spiritists professed to exercise arrogating to function of creator in dealing with whole narration be too fantastical for belief still be in such desperate danger that gladly seized chance promised safety proceeded to interrogate roversmire in order to find out if there be anything tangible in weird belief held if accept offer said slowly permit to incarnate soul in body what becomes of own will remain to appearance dead until soul again return to animate will go back to again then yes think so body be sixty year old yours be must say about twenty six year a thing stand now there be prospect that will outlive when therefore soul inhabits body such body will die at allotted time soul having habitation will be forced to return to own body in order to work out period suppose be incarnated in body for year will not own decay because be not dead only asleep if however be fated that must die before body will begin to decay then will remain in mine till period fixed by god for solution soul will then mingle in world of spirit a if have died in own frame understand said adrian thoughtfully be curious idea be very fortunate one for replied roversmire quietly where will body remain during time be incarnated in yours in house said doctor rising going over to fireplace a there be danger that body might be meddled with by ignorant people during period soul be absent be necessary to place in safety so sent servant away for few week have secret chamber constructed about know nothing when want to assume astral body tell be going out of town for few day so that may not think disappearance strange then enter into secret chamber leave body there go where will knowing that fleshly envelope be safe till return when entered to night however left body sitting in yonder chair presence warned spirit of danger to physical part of so returned in time to stay exit where be secret chamber asked adrian rising now more inclined to believe fantastic story of doctor can see certainly be important must know a will have to leave present body in for safety look touched spring in mantelpiece whereupon whole of fireplace swung round on kind of pivot showing that back be hollow that narrow flight of step led downward into darkness roversmire lighted candle stood on mantelpiece then taking in hand bent down entered into cavity beckoning to adrian to follow young man did so a soon a be on verge of step doctor touching spring in stone wall caused fireplace to swing back again into place see anyone in room must not tell be hidden here said roversmire smiling come downstairs will show secret of pyramid somewhat bewildered by strange experience adrian followed doctor down narrow stair guided by glimmering light of taper went down for distance then found in small square vault with room enough for three people to stand in roversmire again touched spring one part of wall slid slowly aside showing space beyond in utter darkness precaution see said doctor pointing to third spring anyone who found first secret must never guess second come advanced into vault going towards one end of turned ivory handle fixed in wall whereupon whole apartment be irradiated with powerful electric light adrian gave exclamation of surprise put hand over eye a felt quite painful in sudden glare after dense darkness only lighted by candle be moderate sized apartment circular in shape with domed roof of pure white painted with sign of zodiac from centre blazed electric light hidden in large semi opaque globe wall be hung with strange tapestry of brilliant colour be depicted animal god of egypt fantastic deity of india while floor be covered by thick soft carpet with bizarre pattern in blue yellow red outcome of opium confused oriental imagination at one side of queer place be low couch covered with magnificent tiger skin near at hand mother of pearl inlaid moorish table whereon stood decanter of red wine glass together with plate of white bread existence of be only known to ourselves said dr roversmire casting satisfied look around here can leave body until such time a be fated mine must die when soul will of course return to former dwelling place a body left so long without action food will be weak will find wine bread of great service in restoring vital power suppose body dy soon have to return to own said young man miserably will then be arrested that of course will be own look out retorted doctor shrugging shoulder provide with hiding place for time if body dy lose city of refuge well be not fault think can rest assured that unless accident happens commit suicide body will continue on earth for few more year by time dy whole affair of murder will have blown over can re animate own body go out of county live on money freely make over to be rich yes think will find plenty of ready money standing in name in international bank moreover in desk be small box of gem be worth great deal income may posse now think will suffer by change into body be not sorry to give up wealth dr roversmire laughed in amused manner a if adrian have asked childish question indeed have from doctor point of view sorry echoed sorry to exchange weary body for astral one sorry to give up gross pleasure of earth for pure delight of spiritual world be not sorry change to will be like of beggar man passing suddenly from abject poverty to kingly affluence reflect said adrian earnestly if accept offer think of what be have committed crime according to own showing be not good man soul in body may commit many foolish action yet will be held guilty of body will not soul replied roversmire coolly do in body will have to be expiated by own soul since be freewill that act not mine a to personality seem afraid of harming doe not matter to in least have relation on whom action in body must bring disgrace can do what like with shell be only concerned about soul how about past life have told past life must need to know more there be plenty of paper in desk will tell action of mine since arrival in england with indian life have nothing to do a trouble will come from there reputation be that of savant recluse when occupy body can indulge in prank like warn that however youthful soul may be body be old weak if play with will kill thus lose city of refuge sooner than expect so safety rest entirely with be impossible to undo past said adrian gloomily although committed crime in moment of passion will never cease to feel remorse be part of punishment said roversmire seriously can give new body not new soul so whatever act of evil have done in past life remembrance will always cling to if expiate crime on earth by prayer repentance in body in own will purify spirit for world beyond now think everything have be explained so if will lie down on couch will release own soul accomplish transformation of yours into body one moment cried adrian a sat down on couch how can sign name to cheque imitate handwriting will do so mechanically said roversmire who be lighting fire in small brazier writing be operation of body not of soul can not give learning a pertains to soul take with material knowledge posse physical dexterity have acquired will be yours to use a will now be ready yes said adrian obediently lying down be engaged to marry girl called olive maunders how will affect in body of course wo know replied doctor with peculiar smile fanning fire be now at red heat will have to wait till reassume own body before marrying be simply question of safety for just now so 'd better leave love out of question will lose life love everything else adrian gave sigh of sorrow slightly turning head watched preparation of doctor fire be now burning deep red brazier be standing in centre of ring of white powder have be strewn around doctor bent down touched powder with finger muttering word whereupon blue lambent flame sprang up ran round circle roversmire then cast herb on fire took out of small silver box raising arm chanted kind of hymn in low soft voice wild music barbaric in extreme rose fell like rhythmical fall of wave on lonely beach thick white smoke curled upward from brazier spreading pungent odour through vault after time roversmire looking strange spectral amid veil of smoke paused in chanting crossed over to young man spoke solemnly be about to leave world for of spirit leave soul in charge of body make good use of for what do will be of own free will must be expiated by own spirit be ready willing to take burden upon be ready replied adrian slowly then close eye commanded roversmire going over to brazier farewell may crime stained soul be cleansed by prayer repentance expiation in obedience to instruction adrian closed eye felt acrid odour of smoke titillate nostril while doctor resumed measured chant strange melody sounded like wailing of lost spirit seemed to recede further further away a sens of young man became clouded by fume spreading through apartment suddenly whole body felt contorted with extreme pain muscle nerve seemed to be wrenched asunder in paroxysm of terror strove to cry out be unable to do so fire seemed to run through body burning up physical frame writhed twisted in agony of torture then thick darkness seemed to descend on brain remembered more how long thick darkness continued did not know for when opened eye again be lying on floor near brazier from whence fire have died away cold air pervaded vault raising from floor adrian saw with sudden thrill of horror that body pale still be lying on couch while looking down at limb saw that be wrapped in roversmire dressing gown with cry did not sound like own voice walked to mirror be hanging on wall then recoiled with shudder for face looked from glass be not own handsome countenance old grey bearded wrinkled face of roversmire now no longer calm placid convulsed with terror anguish transformation have taken place adrian in person of dr michael roversmire walked languidly over to table already feeling in limb difference between youth age pouring out glass of wine drank up then looking at own body lying so still on couch folded arm across chest lighted candle after turning out electric light left vault soon found way back to room above a hand seemed to

animal shifty grey eye habitually downcast thin lip twitching involuntarily at corner air of self restraint clearly pointed to fact that man have cunning nature must by mean be averse to performing treacherous action for sake of money adrian took immediate dislike to physiognomy dislike be not lessened when heard soft hissing voice issued from thin lip have not be in bed sir asked closing door softly after coming forward to centre of room replied adrian in dull voice feeling incumbent upon to keep up character have assumed have be engaged in writing just slept here for few hour dentham cast

bath changed clothes for found in wardrobe still however retaining dressing gown a did not want to make too sudden change in outward appearance intended to make close examination of roversmire paper in order to get thoroughly conversant with daily life of recluse be curious that must take so much trouble in learning trick manner daily action of usual body seeing that be impossible anyone must comprehend change have taken place however strikingly altered habit must be put down by person to well known eccentricity of doctor assuming new body a disguise be very different from assuming new garb be very novelty that made adrian so painfully careful a seemed almost impossible to that one must notice transformation having finished toilet returned to sitting room found table spread for breakfast consisting of milk egg watercress fruit dentham be in attendance adrian speedily dismissed a felt ill at ease under stealthy glance servant bestowed upon whenever felt unobserved wonder if

candle touched spring having replaced fireplace in normal condition so a to obviate discovery by dentham descended into vault turned on electric light looked around sight of former body lying so still deathlike gave momentary pang must not help contrasting handsome face fine figure with present uncouth exterior for owing to ordeal to have be subjected body of dr roversmire be in rather battered condition adrian saw that own frame be still wrapped in ulster hat lay beside couch on floor although hunted in corner of vault must not find stick with thrill of terror extinguished electric light then in darkness feebly lighted by glimmering taper seemed to feel spiritual presence of old fakir who have doubtless returned to see how occupant of body be getting on cold breath of air seemed to break suddenly into warm atmosphere of vault adrian half thought saw luminous cloud hovering near half vision however soon vanished young man put down to excited state of mind still vault seemed to be occupied by strange presence hurriedly left nether apartment returned hurriedly to upper room luckily found still untenanted thank heaven infernal servant did discover absence thought blowing out candle trust in way old doctor be more easily gulled than must have thought possible if believed in man with such treacherous face at moment subject of reflection entered room proceeded to clear away breakfast thing at same time handing daily telegraph of day to master by way dentham did not see walking stick lying about here oak stick with gold band round asked adrian unfolding paper sir did not

statement owing to late hour at affair have taken place very full report have not come to hand paragraph be headed curious affair stated that gentleman called lancelot alther have gone up to mr adrian lancaster room early in morning found owner absent mutual friend mr philip trevanna lying half dead on floor have be stunned on administration of remedy have revived although must not give explanation of assault a be now in high fever be doubtful if must recover mr lancaster have disappeared trace of have be discovered adrian laid down paper with sigh of relief a read news did kill after said in thankful tone be only stunned must have be better if have remained explained affair although in case must certainly have be arrested at event even if doe recover be too late now to do anything be imprisoned in body unless something happens will have opportunity of becoming adrian lancaster again have indeed vanished completely from world think police in london will be able to trace whereabouts must just wait patiently for chapter of accident to redeem curse on for fool in accepting roversmire offer so readily be lost to world to olive to everything else by own act will wait see if philip trevanna recovers then chance may release from mask of old age will be able to face fellow men once more a adrian lancaster chapter vi torture of hell there be punishment that men can devise so terrible in effect a remorse physical torture can not last longer than certain period without wearing out body remorse be monster feed upon little by little gain possession of whole inner life making outward thing hateful to sight be feeling adrian experienced after have surrendered liberty to gain safety in body of dr roversmire memory of crime be constantly with reminding at moment of day that soul be held in bondage of alien body that even if philip trevanna recovered must be powerless to break chain fettered deed once done must not be recalled of own free will have entered into prison from nothing short of miracle must release a day went slowly by strove mightily to adapt to dreary monotonous life be now leading roversmire have indeed be able to draw entertainment from store of knowledge vast experience power of releasing soul from body whenever earthly thing grew too irksome to adrian having lived life in frivolous world have not well stored mind to draw upon consequently being debarred by strange position from ordinary pleasure did not know how to employ time furthermore memory of folly stung sharply forced inaction of life of seclusion to be now condemned made tortured soul writhe in new dwelling place with hideous sense of impotence weariness day by day paper informed of progress philip trevanna be making towards recovery astonishment excited by own strange disappearance be powerless to come forward explain circumstance of affair resume place among fellow men have sinned in permitting temper to lead to so nearly kill human being be punishment dreary life of forced inaction of agonising remorse of terrible self reproach truly be paying dearly for one mad act of life to mind punishment appeared immeasurably severe to magnitude of crime have philip trevanna died must have accepted terrible situation with sullen apathy looking upon a fit reward for taking life of fellow man seeing that friend be recovering that crime be unpremeditated that trevanna have provoked beyond power of endurance seemed bitterly hard that must have to pas indefinite period in constant state of torture unpleasant state of thing be not rendered more bearable by presence of dentham who adrian knew kept constant watch upon action what man suspected must not tell that be suspicious of life led by dr michael roversmire be certain a adrian felt rather than saw stealthy glance with watched going out coming in getting up laying down in be enough to irritate sensitive mind added to appalling torture unhappy young man be constantly feeling drove nearly to verge of distraction longed for something to happen must give if not release at least change of life at last event happened caused adrian to make up mind to leave seclusion also caused considerable anxiety to enquiring mind of mr dentham one day about two week after transformation have taken place adrian saw in paper notice of reward offered for discovery of whereabouts of adrian lancaster be wanted by police suppose muttered gloomily to idea be soon dispelled when read last line of advertisement said that information be to be given to o nook marlow buck be olive olive cried adrian throwing down

of shilling shocker not detective answered father quietly dealer in mystery doctor roversmire charlatan think be charlatan know more about unseen world than think olive maunders looked at father in puzzled manner then rising from seat walked to fro hurriedly with arm folded behind back ca make out father said lightly be so sensible in thing in others well really know how can believe in theosophical rubbish 'there be more thing in heaven earth horatio than be dreamt of in philosophy ' quoted sir john with smile oh know quotation answered daughter shaking head be always quoted by people who believe in supernatural a unanswerable argument so be in one sense of course did not see enough of doctor roversmire to know what pretension be so ca say word against did not like olive certainly did not yet admired so much so that did honour to ask to be wife replied olive gravely of course be engaged to adrian ah poor adrian wonder where can be wait hope be tired of waiting hoping

see must ask to use knowledge for benefit of adrian do know where life father at hampstead believe then will write to to night mind believe good will come of still be so anxious to find adrian that 'd consult even fortune teller spoke in scoffing tone appeared to wound father be about to remonstrate with upon levity when servant entered gave card olive glanced carelessly at then started in surprise

entered room in hesitating manner a if not quite sure of reception mind be soon set at rest by cordial manner in be met by sir john maunders who advanced towards with outstretched hand dear doctor said in hearty voice be indeed unexpected pleasure moreover curious coincidence a be just speaking of hope conversation be favourable to said doctor advancing towards olive clasping one of cool slim hand how do do miss maunders be quite well thank answered quickly withdrawing hand from warm grasp have be away from london yes have be to monte carlo began adrian mechanically then suddenly recollecting that personality be lost in body of dr roversmire went on hurriedly be have not be out of town further than hampstead why have not be to see for long time said sir john have not have visit for month have be living very quietly replied adrian with effort making experiment fact be did not know exactly what to say a be quite ignorant of relation existing between dr roversmire sir john maunders moreover be woefully ignorant in matter of theosophy in sir john be quite adept besides sight of olive maunders calm sweet face have woke deepest passion of soul a reflected how near yet how far away be to saw face heard voice touched hand yet for satisfaction obtained might have be mile away separated a be from by mask of ancient seeming in ardent young soul have become incarnate olive maunders on part be struck by change in manner of former admirer look of calm conscious superiority have be accustomed to admire much a disliked man be gone in place be expression of anguish look of haunting dread in dark eye voice also formerly so rich smooth flowing be broken rough a if owner have lost power of controlling speech be very glad to see dr roversmire said olive looking at keenly a wish to help will be delighted what be wish to do find adrian lancaster adrian recoiled a if have received blow asked to find quite ignorant of strange transformation have taken place what must do in matter be unable to produce own body void a be of vital principle yet if told truth must be looked upon a madman a thought flashed rapidly through brain saw at glance precipice upon stood resolved to gain time by dexterously temporising so a to form plan of action sir john have strolled outside on to lawn so be quite alone with olive must speak freely adrian lancaster said smoothly think have have pleasure of meeting at time be visiting in town be away on continent although know personally dare say have seen name in paper of late adrian pretended to think for moment yes fancy have replied anxious to learn from olive lip true condition of philip trevanna did not attempt to commit murder olive arose to foot rapidly with look of anger on expressive face no did not answered in clear vibrating voice mr trevanna be now getting better have made statement completely exonerates mr lancaster from such intention thank god thought adrian thankfully at event character will be cleared even although be unable to defend mistaking silence for disbelief olive went on to explain circumstance of case mr lancaster mr trevanna be playing card mr trevanna insulted friend by flinging card in face hardly knowing what be doing mr lancaster threw decanter at mr trevanna struck on head stunned thinking be dead mr lancaster left very likely to get assistance mr trevanna be now recovering blame severely for provoking mr lancaster anger a said mr lancaster kept temper admirably for time under grossest provocation mr lancaster have disappeared said adrian yes have vanished completely in spite of enquiry can not be found be sure went to seek assistance fled asked adrian in measured tone wrong by thought said olive loyally adrian lancaster be not man to fly from consequence of own misdeed believe went to seek assistance never came back said pseudo roversmire cynically olive lifted arm with gesture of despair ill becomes to speak in way said severely what do know about impulse of youth be old man cautious cold blooded calculating be warm impulsive hot tempered if in moment of anger thought have committed crime be therefore very wonderful thing that must go away secretly for period so a to gain time to explain matter instead of waiting to be arrested blame for folly a much a do pity love same adrian heart smote a saw how nobly defended pusillanimous conduct though to be sure be easier to be brave even at cannon mouth than to await in cold blood for certain arrest possible ignominious death thought said went to seek assistance observed deliberately say so again retorted angrily why do measure clip word in pedantic fashion might have changed mind if have erred in acting upon impulse of moment doubt be now being severely punished for poor soul little knew how severe punishment be be hiding in distant place suppose that in be punishment for noble hearted gentleman like adrian to have to conceal face from fellow men punishment indeed tell dr roversmire have be certain already undergone worse punishment than law can devise in casting round for apology for adrian conduct have accidentally hit upon truth soul of man loved hidden in body of man hated writhed under lash of word have however to act part of cold philosopher such a be in keeping with dr roversmire general conduct crushed down rising emotion with powerful effort understand appreciate have said observed calmly what do want to do tell where be how can do by aid of science chicanery reading in star else practise under title of theosophy what be good of pretending to supernatural power if can not exercise in emergency like here be dilemma adrian have not slightest idea of science dr roversmire be supposed to know be quite unable to answer girl who stood looking at with piercing gaze perhaps already know where be said with sudden suspicion echoed in apparent surprise how must know may be that although have never seen like went on feverishly not paying attention to answer did honour to ask to be wife declined a loved adrian lancaster perhaps hate on account believe in spell juggling trick still still tell demanded with sudden outburst of anger do know anything about disappearance of adrian lancaster made gesture of dissent for although be burning to reveal yet dread of future consequence kept silent be true that can disintegrate body have heard that profess to do so if so have disintegrated adrian oh what be talking about be madness insanity playing with supernatural believe in power say posse adrian be in hiding afraid of consequence of folly when see advertisement will return be sure will be afraid not said adrian sadly knowing how impossible be such thing must happen what do know about cried fiercely wheeling round on with look of suspicion in eye must not have come to for concealment did not know such thing can not occur in real life adrian took sudden resolution rising to foot advanced towards seized by wrist listen to miss maunders said gravely there be more in occult science than dream of age of miracle be not past be happening day lover thought have committed crime disappeared vanished into night darkness hide want to know where be can not tell have doubt be punished a suggest how be impossible to explain will go to work perchance may restore adrian lancaster to arm reward for asked disbelievingly love said softly forgetting for moment who be olive maunders tore from arm with cry anything that said with expression of anger what must be good of returning adrian to if lose again by becoming wife be generous dr roversmire be learned man far above in knowledge wisdom if can do what say will ever look upon a friend ask for bread give stone said adrian sadly well so be will try find lover in return ask friendship held out hand clasped in of hers must go back to town said after short silence say good bye to father for be going to do asked quickly turned towards in surprise be going to try find adrian lancaster replied quietly with bow left room at once while stood staring idly at brilliant group on lawn wondered how must laugh jest so carelessly while life happiness be at stake chapter ix philosophy of mr dentham so adrian after one glimpse of woman loved left paradise returned with heavy heart to solitary existence at hampstead have be true promised to restore lost sheep to arm of gentle shepherdess how be to be done did not know there be two way in must regain identity that must be killed in present body by accident that must commit suicide former of method seemed unlikely to occur a number of people who meet with accident be really very small a to latter although be coward yet shrank with vague dread from putting end to present existence be true that roversmire have informed that soul must return to own tenement suppose be wrong soul powerless to enter former habitation must remain suspended like coffin of mahomet between heaven earth last case must be worse than first adrian in spite of what be at stake must hardly be blamed for preferring present condition unsatisfactory a be to possible chance of leaving world altogether one thing however have learned by visit to marlow gave feeling of satisfaction be certainty of trevanna recovery be at least guiltless of blood moreover explanation of trevanna exonerated from malicious intent so that when soul returned to former body must at least be in position to hold up head a have be accustomed to do devotion displayed by olive in defending character have touched deeply be now anxious to

break presume be from said handing note written on blue paper yes mum replied dentham casting flickering look on from under white eyelash saw advertisement about mr adrian lancaster came to see about

know little tell know said olive quickly having laid down hat brown paper parcel dentham hand be free made use of opportunity of rubbing slowly together speaking meanwhile in deprecating tone think mum there be mention of reward reward will be forthcoming if information prove to be of use amount mum began valet still washing hand with invisible soap water will depend entirely on information replied olive disdainfully dentham looked at stealthily scratched chin with one lean finger evidently debating in own mind if must not be better to make term before parting with information teddy saw be feeling although a rule good tempered fellow felt thoroughly enraged at mean spirit displayed by unpleasant looking individual come man said sharply do hear what lady say tell know about mr lancaster will be paid accordingly how much sir demanded dentham in tone of covert insolence whereat rudall completely lost temper be about to step forward with very amicable intent when olive stopped if information be worth anything will give fifty pound said quickly half before leave room half when mr lancaster be found eye of spy sparkled a have not anticipated being paid so well be not certain of whereabouts of adrian lancaster knew what have to tell must certainly gain twenty five pound so be quite content to sell information for sum very well mum said with pleased smile be sure be

night have be quite changed so excited like found that stick took to own room what right have to do asked teddy sharply dentham wriggled looked down well sir to tell truth sir thought a master be forger coiner burglar that visitor be pal of so thought if kept stick might find out something about going on did doctor roversmire ask about stick demanded olive yes mum several time said have be given to by friend of of course knew have how did connect stick with disappearance of mr lancaster asked teddy who be more upset by story than cared to show well sir master be always looking at paper after morning on found stick about week ago after reading telegraph asks for bradshaw said be going out of town when left room looked at bradshaw saw have looked up train to marlow then thought something in paper might have put into head to go there found advertisement mum seeing be at marlow knew be on right track then letter on stick be of mr adrian lancaster name who be being advertised for so wrote to be be very ingenious gentleman indeed said teddy grimly when recital ended quite amateur detective well miss maunders what do think of story olive have resumed seat be leaning head on hand deep in thought started when teddy addressed looked up quickly seems to that adrian went to house said quickly a stick be certainly must only have be left there by there be doubt be doctor roversmire visitor why know a be quite unacquainted with doctor with fact that knew at event be plain be there on night in question here trace seems lost did stay there did go away again stayed said dentham solemnly how do know asked rudall did see in house afterwards hear noise to lead to suspect that mr lancaster might be concealed there dentham shook head neither saw heard anything replied quickly be wet night when came after found walking stick searched for footmark traced more le clearly from garden door up to window of room in heard voice must have left same way if left at footmark pointed towards house none away from so be certain did not go away be detective said teddy with smile certainly explanation be very ingenious one so let assume for sake of argument that mr lancaster did not leave house so far so good now next question be did leave room asserted dentham again why not asked olive because be lying awake listening to voice although must not make out what be saying yet if master mr lancaster have left room must easily have heard doing so teddy rudall looked puzzled well if lancaster did not leave house room must be concealed in else have vanished into thin air be of course impossible be not so certain about said olive looking up remember what be talking about teddy shrugged shoulder contemptuously occult science theosophy disintegration said glibly oh nonsense stuff be humbug believe master devil asserted dentham suddenly with scared look others stared at in silent astonishment there be look of apprehension on olive face showed that shared to extent in idea of servant how so demanded teddy with disbelieving smile because have left in room sir locked window before leaving sometimes have come back found gone with window still locked shutter up must have got out of window must clear by door because be generally in passage must have seen now sir finished dentham triumphantly where did go to think true explanation be said rudall quietly have secret chamber exit in wall of special room to refer have examined wall sir then depend upon theory be correct one said teddy in complacent tone there be sliding panel masked door lead to outside of house to secret room think latter because if have let mr lancaster out by secret way must have heard from long ago opinion be that be keeping adrian concealed in hidden room refer to why asked olive quietly gave explanation said rudall quickly be case of revenge fancy now in order to find out anything must search room how sir asked dentham master never go away from house ca look if be there oh can manage said olive decisively will get father to write letter asking to come down to marlow during absence can search room if find anything can demand explanation at event will certainly make tell why adrian called to see on night yes think will be best thing to be done said teddy thoughtfully well miss maunders have better go down at once to marlow get father to write necessary letter a for added turning to dentham go back to hampstead keep watch on master arouse suspicion if try to clear out wire at once money mum said dentham in whining tone a olive arose to foot took out purse handed two ten pound note one five pound in silence information be well worth said quietly a took with servile smile if find mr lancaster in house of doctor roversmire will double reward be too generous miss maunders said teddy suspiciously know nothing definitely yet now must go to paddington at once a there be time to lose olive consented with alacrity left house secured hansom be soon on way to railway station leaving mr bickles to solitude of town house dentham with twenty five pound in pocket very well satisfied with day work chapter xii perilous situation now although dentham intended to betray confidence of dr roversmire olive maunders yet be operation of difficulty a foresaw on taking quiet view of situation so far have made twenty five pound out of transaction must not obtain more money from adrian lancaster betrothed until house have be thoroughly searched unhappy young man found if did discover adrian shut up in secret chamber a rudall surmised must certainly gain balance of reward from olive maunders on other hand must obtain nothing from master a must be unable to warn make term if be murdered mr lancaster mused dentham to a took way homeward will arrest straight off then wo be able to give straight tip get paid for then will be away from house if find anything so will be able to wire old cove at marlow make appointment in town once get hold of will bleed freely else hand over to law yes be what will do ca put in gaol straight off so will fix up thing with before get chance mr dentham be quite delighted with villainous little scheme must not help admiring for dexterous way in turned thing to own advantage said 'd double reward resumed referring to miss maunders doe that mean twenty five fifty if only double twenty five will only clear seventy five pound if mean fifty will be hundred twenty five in pocket will be something on account if can only get hundred twenty five pound out of old cove will be able to sit down with three hundred clear that will set up for life not much trouble ah knew something must come out of old cove way of living lord what scoundrel be to be sure be wicked world old cove about worst in so mused virtuous mr dentham who while blaming presumable wickedness of master concerning have proof be quite blind to despicable part be playing then mr dentham called baseness business placed whole transaction in quite different light moreover being without least atom of conscience be quite at rest on score of moral consideration regarding possible three hundred pound a honestly earned money adrian lancaster still hidden in personality of dr roversmire be quite unconscious of perilous situation in be placed be true mistrusted dentham never expected valet must be so dexterous in piecing evidence together so establish case against a to dentham communicating with olive maunders never entered brain that thing must occur a have said nothing to servant to outward appearance there be nothing to connect so called dr roversmire with disappearance of adrian lancaster morning after dentham satisfactory visit to town adrian received letter from sir john maunders asking to come down to marlow stay night a wanted to speak with on particular subject know wrote cheery baronet that be kept busy with philosophical study work play make jack dull boy so if give pleasure of society for few hour be sure will do good be sorry to say daughter will be away during visit may probably return before take departure at point adrian laid down letter debated seriously with a to whether must accept invitation seeing that olive must be absent on whole after much consideration came to conclusion that must do so a be now in such desperate state of mind over difficulty of situation that determined to tell sir john everything ask advice a to future movement be afraid to reveal secret of transformation to olive a knew how scoffed at power alleged to be exercised by theosophist thought with great show of reason that must look upon a madman with sir john be very different a adrian remembered have have good deal of experience in occult science knew many strange thing have occurred quite outside law of nature be law of nature a seen by world at large under circumstance must not deny that curious event a transposition of soul might take place adrian knew must give enough proof of own life to convince baronet however sceptical that soul of adrian lancaster be really concealed in body of dr roversmire then must be able to ask sir john advice a to chance of getting rid of roversmire body resuming own identity for sir john be acquainted with many votary of theosophy who might be able to hit upon solution of enigma surely among theosophist there must be found one equal in knowledge to dr roversmire who must undo harm have be done releasing soul from aged body restore once more to proper habitation having come to conclusion adrian wrote letter accepting invitation declined to stay night a wanted to get back to study fact be that be afraid during absence something might happen to solve difficulty be unwilling to be absent must chance of regaining freedom present whole house be permeated with influence of spirit for of course dr roversmire during tenancy of earthly body have be constantly visited by friend of spirit world sometimes weird feeling must seize adrian a if be in centre of crowd of ethereal being whose body impalpable invisible be pressing around on side must have given anything must have known of invocation by to communicate with find mean of release from unpleasant position although read most of book in house favourite paper of dr roversmire spell ceremony presented by must do so there be time when strange influence brooded over house almost proved too much for nerve longed to escape from spirit haunted atmosphere into matter of fact frivolity of outside world by prolonged fast by terrible ordeal ascetic mode of life dr roversmire have rendered body peculiarly sensitive to spiritual influence now that have transferred body to adrian material soul of unhappy young man felt strange to subtle contact seemed to feel with unseen world about knew absolutely nothing dentham of course felt nothing a soul be too sensual body too gross to vibrate come in contact with spiritual thing adrian body being strange to be not under control felt a though stood on neutral ground between two world powerless to leave one equally powerless to enter other will go mad if continues said to a directed envelope be like putting savage to live among people highly cultivated feel influence can not respond so have pain none of pleasure afternoon at marlow will do lot of good drive away phantasy of moonlight spirituality so sent letter told dentham be going to leave next day for visit at valet be highly delighted sent off telegram evening to miss maunders telling house must be able to be searched following day olive on part have told father nothing of revelation of dentham have got to ask dr roversmire down to marlow then intimated intention of going away sir john at first objected to strange mode of proceeding be ultimately over ruled by clever daughter know what mean to do grumbled good naturedly will be glad to see roversmire who be very clever man although seem to like whether really like not depends entirely upon what learn during next few day replied where be going to learn anything about roversmire asked father curiously will tell when come back responded olive promptly well have own way said baronet with sigh certainly be enigma of course said teddy rudall who entered at moment be woman that answer everything chapter xiii startling discovery in due time adrian feeling depressed dreary departed by early train to marlow leaving dentham in charge of house at hampstead expected miss maunders mr rudall to call about mid day prior to arrival made exploration of sitting room on own account with view to finding out if possible secret chamber rudall said must exist dentham though crafty enough in small villanies be woefully ill fitted for such task after hour hard work during examined most unlikely place gave up search in disgust if have calmly sat down logically argued matter out might have come to satisfactory conclusion instead of doing hunted about in blind confusion with natural result that nothing came of work be bosh muttered dentham to sitting on chair mopping heated brow believe there be such place be opinion old cove killed mr lancaster hid body in garden meditation be brought to end by arrival of olive teddy rudall of whom be in state of suppressed excitement a to issue of plan to examine house during absence of owner say know said rudall when be seated in room for rest preparatory to beginning search have right to do sort of thing without search warrant oh that doe matter replied olive with sublime disregard for majesty of law feminine sex sometimes display dr roversmire will never know anything about unless find something then will have enough to do in clearing without bothering about search think will come up unbeknown mum asked dentham uneasily for have wholesome dread of mysterious master can set mind at rest on point said olive decisively have suspicion of visit here will stay down at marlow till evening even if did wish to return must not arrive back here for at least two hour will give plenty of time hope so mum answered dentham respectfully rubbing hand together be like looking for needle in bundle of hay have hunted everywhere in room ca find sign of secret door doubt went blindly to work without considering situation said teddy cheerfully first thing to be ascertained be how room lie what do mean sir asked dentham in puzzled tone will explain later on answered teddy before doing so be agreed upon one thing adrian lancaster came to room never left to appearance yes assented olive promptly 'd better state case exactly observed rudall cautiously so that may run chance of making mistake fact a have gathered be simply adrian lancaster disappeared from room in piccadilly about three week ago hear nothing of till man come to produce walking stick recognise a adrian property be found in room so presumption be that on night of disappearance adrian be here dentham heard murmur of voice asserts positively that lancaster must not have left room by door leading to passage must have heard yes easily said dentham emphatically on other hand resumed teddy learnedly night in question be wet dentham traced lancaster footstep more le clearly from garden door to window lead on to lawn although looked carefully must find footmark leading away from house so that having left by door window stand to reason must not have gone at under circumstance most logical conclusion be that did not leave room can not see a none of be foolish enough to believe in theory of disintegration must be concealed somewhere in secret chamber entrance to be from room now what have to do be to find entrance yes how asked dentham dispiritedly first by finding out position of room said teddy rising to foot glancing round two side of be bounded by outside wall a appear to to be thick enough to contain hiding place may be certain that secret door can be in of third wall stand between room passage so that same objection applies now what about fourth wall in centre of be built chimney there be room beyond same a explained dentham in case objection applies to whole four wall said rudall ruefully what about roof bedroom be above humph in case lancaster can not certainly have gone heavenward floor there be cellar below cellar ejaculated teddy thoughtfully that look more promising let examine cellar think must be better to look at floor first suggested olive for adrian ca have got into cellar without mode of exit floor be of polished wood consisting of narrow plank laid horizontally be partly covered here there with turkish mat collecting in heap teddy dentham made thorough examination be quite unable to find trapdoor through entrance must have be gained into cellar be cellar open to anyone asked rudall rising to foot dusting knee of trouser yes sir answered dentham quickly be out in dozen time day there be wood coal stored there doe seem much use examining cellar in case fail to see that there can be secret hiding place said olive in despair be quite sure dentham did not hear doctor mr lancaster leave room quite sure mum replied dentham decisively room be above be in a came out looked over stair so if of 'em left room 'd have seen a well a heard then observed olive disconsolately disintegration theory be bosh interrupted teddy angrily believe in theosophy a told even if can disintegrate body can only meddle with own not with of other people there must be secret hiding place to entrance be from room where demanded olive wall roof floor give clue teddy fastened eye upon chimney what about fireplace asked going over to surveying cumbersome proportion oh there be nothing there sir said dentham with wriggle of scorn know so much about replied teddy see there be half burnt candle on mantelpiece always have candle said dentham referring to master why know a there be lot of gas light always have candle murmured rudall thoughtfully humph dare say be to light way to lower region what be under flooring of next room added turning to dentham nothing sir except earth cellar below here be dug out think sir teddy gave cry of delight then depend upon there be secret chamber under next room entrance to be from chimney piece impossible said olive rising coming forward be most reasonable explanation can offer at event said teddy suppose examine fireplace dentham miss maunders now very much excited at chance of possible discovery assisted teddy began to make minute inspection of fireplace consisted of ordinary steel grate surrounded by bordering of encaustic tile mantelpiece be heavy oaken one elaborately carved with fruit flower although teddy pushed shook grate remained immovable there certainly seemed possibility that heavy mass must be moved at perhaps there be spring suggested olive began to feel among carving of mantelpiece with deft finger attempt proved successful for by chance finger came in contact with spring there be click a pressed almost involuntarily three present gave cry of surprise a whole of grate swung round upon central pivot disclosing space beyond knew be right cried teddy in ecstasy lead to secret chamber must not be surprised if found adrian lancaster prisoner below olive turned pale a lighted candle bending down crept into black cavity at first feared to follow in step love for adrian prevailed cautiously entered also dentham who be shaking in limb with terror at strange discovery remained in room when teddy companion disappeared down narrow step curiosity got better of fear groped way in same direction be secret chamber asked olive in disappointed tone when found in square vault think so replied teddy doubtfully holding candle above head surely roversmire must have made more comfortable there may be door suggested miss maunders hopefully examine wall teddy did so running hand rapidly down on smooth surface of stone felt round button pressed with strength immediately blank wall before seemed to disappear showing only dense black space dentham cried teddy on seeing go get more candle lamp upon dentham sped rapidly up step without being required to be told twice adrian cried olive peering forward into darkness dimly lighted by glimmer of candle be there voice answered in vague terror girl caught teddy by hand oh do think be dead whispered know replied blankly perhaps be not here there may be more door to open see here be dentham with two more light olive took one of candle headed by teddy little band went forward along narrow passage at length found in circular vault looked weird spectral looking with strange decoration look like cave of magician said teddy slowly waving light to fro hullo what be up sudden exclamation be caused by dentham who have dropped candle with chattering teeth shaking limb pale face pointed to dark form extended on couch with cry of terror olive rushed forward held light close to figure face fell on knee with shriek be adrian adrian be dead dead echoed rudall in awed tone impossible be true quite true shrieked setting candle down on floor limb be cold eye be closed ca feel heart beat roversmire may have thrown into trance said rudall reassuringly who in face of strange discovery be willing now to credit roversmire with kind of superhuman power here miss maunders take up candle hold mine dentham will carry mean will carry adrian upstairs to light almost overcome by grief olive be yet sufficiently mistress of herself to do what asked arose to foot holding light in hand while tear be unable to wipe away streamed down pale face come on said teddy seeing that dentham overcome with fear made move take mr lancaster by head dare not whispered dentham shrinking back be dead how do know be dead said rudall angrily may be only in trance do what tell will thrash within inch of life on hearing dentham with manifest reluctance did a be told gave shudder of fear a seized inert foot of figure on couch teddy held up head preceded by olive with light two men with great difficulty managed to carry body upstairs to sitting room olive courage sustained thus far when saw adrian body lying on floor stiff cold let candle fall from hand flung down in paroxysm of sorrow oh adrian adrian wailed clasping one cold hand be dead dead nonsense said teddy roughly kneeling beside still form if be dead symptom of decay must have set in long ago be not dead tell in trance girl dried eye summoned up courage arose to foot be certain be not dead asked breathlessly be rather difficult to say answered teddy rising also leading to seat will send at once for doctor meantime must have glass of wine dentham get wine for miss maunders dentham disappeared meantime teddy comforted olive a well a be able be sure be in trance insisted quietly look how firm healthy flesh look if be really dead must not look like after three week here dentham returned with wine teddy made girl take good glass of dentham said when olive grew more composed go down to police station send police here then come back with doctor a hard a can dentham took money teddy held out towards putting on hat left house chuckling quietly to yes will get police doctor muttered a walked rapidly down road will telegraph to old cove at marlow be just a thought be killed mr lancaster so a soon a know body be found will be able to fix up wo let off unless pay jolly well chapter xiv dentham make term jintle hotel be situated in very unfashionable neighbourhood seven dial mr jintle proprietor thereof be friend of dentham on evening of day upon strange discovery have be made at hampstead dentham be seated in small stuffy back room of hotel talking eagerly to le personage than master dr michael roversmire who have come up from marlow to jintle by four o'clock train in answer to telegram sent by dentham adrian be in terrible dilemma a did not know way to turn telegram warned not to go back to hampstead must be arrested have fallen upon like thunderbolt have come up to town at once to see dentham that gentleman have gained reward from olive maunders be now happy possessor of one hundred twenty five pound not satisfied with even sum represented wealth to be now trying to make term with master cringing manner have disappeared sat opposite to adrian with elbow resting on table look of coarse triumph irradiating mean looking face knew how must be be saying in sneering tone if 'd only trusted about young man must have helped now be too late unless make worth while what do want to do asked adrian hopelessly fully aware that be in power of man quite at loss what course to pursue what do want to do said dentham jeeringly want to give cheque for two hundred straight off if do queried adrian fixing eye on dentham face well will do best to help to get off retorted dentham with silky smile suppose refuse oh in case will go straight out tell police will indeed said adrian with grim smile stroking long grey beard what about warrant for arrest ca do on suspicion now try lark on said dentham in bullying tone because be only person who can help out of mess wo unless be civil oh yes will for money retorted master coolly besides want first to be assured of truth of story dentham be quite exasperated by quiet tone in doctor spoke have expected to find terrified man who must give sum to be placed in safety instead of proposed victim talked a calmly sedately a if terrible charge of murder be hanging over if what have told convince nothing will said sarcastically ai said being asked to marlow be blind found out mr lancaster have be with on night by mean of stick denied having seen interpolated adrian quietly that business said be stick be lie well answered miss maunders advertisement told knew in other word betrayed can call what like have to look after number one paid well for what told so now having betrayed getting paid be going to betray in hope of similar reward always make hay while sun shine retorted dentham with ugly smile for did not like villainy to be put before so plainly whatever did be none of business know be miss maunders mr rudall came to house morning found mr lancaster body where hid called in police if have sent that telegram to marlow 'd have gone back home be arrested saved for own end said adrian with dreary laugh good heaven what scoundrel there be in world so think killed adrian lancaster be sure of replied dentham promptly saw where be now demanded adrian leaning back in chair at number forty beryle square miss maunders have taken there with permission of police afternoon so there be warrant out against yes on charge of murdering mr lancaster if give cheque for two hundred pound will help to escape will do best replied dentham evasively do know be compounding felony said adrian rising be doing be better than being murderer have not got more time to talk know offer can do what like must have time to think over said adrian calmly can go away leave for time try to escape cried dentham moving towards door 'cause wo will keep watch outside may escape yet in spite of oh will scoffed dentham daresay be juggler ai perhaps can get through keyhole juggle wo get out of mess unless pay well with parting shot dentham took departure closed door after left alone in dirty ill lighted little room adrian walked up down pondering over situation saw plainly be in dentham power if refused to accede to demand must be at once arrested tried in person of dr roversmire for murder of adrian lancaster a proof be so strong against ultimately hanged be not prospect made shudder be something far more terrible for knew that own body being to intent purpose dead must be duly buried then oh god how terrible when be hanged a dr roversmire soul must have to go back to find original body find where in darkness of coffin must be lying under earth living man must die by most terrible of death suffocation bare idea of such appalling death made cold sweat break out on forehead leaning arm on mantelpiece groaned with anguish must die two horrible death first on gallows a dr roversmire then in narrowness of coffin a adrian lancaster what be to do consent to dentham offer be saved give up try to explain whole affair ala knew that if did so must be looked upon a madman even if life be spared must be put in lunatic asylum sooner later life of dr roversmire body must end then must most certainly by returning to own die terrible death in grave on other hand recognised fully treacherous nature of dentham foresaw that even if did pay what asked valet must first make certain of money by cashing cheque then betray into hand of police in hope of further reward there seemed escape on side be hemmed in by peril be helpless sport of circumstance raised head from arm stared steadily at old
