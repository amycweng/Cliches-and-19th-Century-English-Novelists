opinion be that if have be attacked overpowered by strategy have fled to nearest town for shelter a have marched overland with colonel garibay from tlatonac knew country better than did jack proceeded to defend theory of reinforcement safety by describing position of town be hundred mile more a crow fly from tlatonac to god forsaken place within limit be four town le one twenty mile when marched south two week ago first went to chichimec then to puebla de los naranjos last one be midway hermanita be next then after dropping in at centeotl came on to janjalla still if indian surprised by night

general desire oh here be garibay thousand greeting colonel what senor juan ah mi amigo how pleased be to see safe once more deemed be dead dios be merry corpse senor said tim turning head where be general within yonder house of jefe politico also senor corresponsal doe desire to see be at service of senor gigedo know comandante what desire to speak of be that will convey glorious news of naval victory to gran'diario dios will be done within hour waited to find out particular from don juan oh can tell everything said jack cheerfully be on board montezuma with don rafael be torpedo sank pizarro viva los torpederas shouted garibay who be greatly excited over unexpected victory cry be taken up by chattering group of officer lounging in from off general headquarters jack being recognized be at once surrounded by be mostly young fellow who be weary of being pent up within wall of suburban town saw in sinking of pizarro chance of coming face to face with enemy be cry of viva bueno gracias dios a duval passed through midst many must fain have detained to learn particular of combat jack be anxious to hear gigedo view concerning non arrival of reinforcement so entered mansion at once colonel garibay conducted without delay to general apartment gigedo cigarette in mouth be poring over large map of country evidently tracing line of march from tlatonac on seeing duval sprang up advanced to salute with pleased smile thousand congratulation senor on escape from hand of xuarez said warmly still more on gallant conduct of last night oh a to general be onlooker replied duval modestly credit of sinking pizarro rest with don rafael maraquando have heard particular assuredly senor don sebastian de ahumada have left moment informed of affair also delivered instruction from excellency find here added gigedo striking pile of paper with open hand over thousand men left tlatonac for front four day ago be so general friend senor felipe be with have not arrived don juan troop of xuarez can not have intercepted be at loss to understand delay can explain senor said jack after pause before left tlatonac there be rumour of indian rising while prisoner at totatzine saw tribe incited to war by ixtlilxochitli high priest of chalchuih tlatonac ah cursed opal cried garibay fiercely be cause of great trouble must that must be taken from indian rest content senor garibay be taken from indian dona dolores took from shrine be now in tlatonac dios exclaimed general garibay simultaneously while tim be scarcely le astonished naturally enough indian wish to recover sacred gem senor therefore rising have taken place sooner than be expected fear gentleman that indian have surprised massacred poor friend santissima madre thousand men indian force amount to three time that number said jack quickly be true that excellency at request sent messenger after reinforcement to warn of possible attack yet be not unlikely that messenger may have be intercepted by indian might have fallen on reinforcement without warning then senor three thousand against one thousand unexpected attack ala be terrible risk troop may have retreated to one of town said gigedo taking same view of case a have tim must know if telegraph wire have not be cut a be can wait meantime remarked garibay dryly xuarez will land troop already two thousand lie before town have hard work even behind wall to keep back now have scarcely five hundred here capable of defending town many be dead wounded fever dysentery prevail greatly if xuarez land more troop make immediate attack janjalla must fall can not land more troop while iturbide torpederas guard harbour said gigedo in tone of displeasure even if two thousand again assault wall can hold out until reinforcement arrive excellency tell that two thousand men be to follow in ten day hark cried tim a garibay be about to reply gun senor warship be at again with permission general hastily left room went off to wall where be soon afterwards joined by jack who have be hurriedly dismissed by general looked seaward saw performance of most extraordinary drama be now about three o'clock ocean like sheet of glass stretched in inclined plane upward to distant horizon owing to elevation of city wall looked down a from height of amphitheatre rampart be crowded with spectator townsfolk soldier immediately below be beach rebel camp then long pier shooting out into blue beyond flashing expanse of sea iturbide be lying quarter of mile from shore with two torpederas one on side of cruiser have swung round be firing gun at slowly approaching warship columbus cried jack when eye fell upon vessel true for john said tim handing glass have come south by thought told transport be not due here till midnight no more be expect xuarez learning through spy of departure from tlatonac have sent columbus on ahead to join force with pizarro with two warship hope to keep lot at bay till transport with cortes be safe in harbour sinking of pizarro will rather upset plan columbus dare not attack two torpederas cruiser single handed upon soul that seems exactly what intends to do tim low murmur of surprise arose from crowd on rampart who be eagerly watching warship seemed a though columbus be bent on own destruction for came steaming straight ahead for three ship of junta insolently flying red flag of xuarez what deuce doe mean cried tim in perplexity surely ca mistake iturbide for consort perhaps intends to desert suggested jack columbus be now more within range though hitherto have be silent under fire of iturbide now began to speak in turn white line of smoke ran along black side a ball came singing over water not much deserting about said tim grimly rebel have scheme in head by time pedraza be thoroughly enraged at insolence of one ship attacking single handed signalled at once to torpederas captain of columbus saw that signal ordered boat to up anchor acted accordingly in surprisingly short space of time rebel ship have swung round with full steam ahead be standing out to sea ship of junta be taken by surprise at manoeuvre be fully question of hour before started in pursuit tim shut glass with click jack see columbus want to get boat out of harbour so a to let cortes transport slip in together rather risky game tim will be overhauled sunk by torpederas in time not while can keep off with heavy gun what speed have torpederas eighteen to nineteen knot columbus well rafael say ordinary speed be fifteen in case of need can crack up steam to eighteen even give torpederas one knot to good can outsteam iturbide oh yes sixteen be limit then tell what columbus a said have come here a decoy know cruiser ca touch speed hope to keep torpederas at safe distance with heavy gun be off in bee line straight out other boat be after then will dodge steam back here to find cortes transport safe in harbour believe be right tim of course be right look at way be smoking through water jack put glass to eye saw columbus be travelling at top speed towards open sea after scampered two torpedo boat like hound on trail further behind iturbide with black smoke vomiting from funnel be putting soul into chase pedraza be evidently determined to follow up one victory by over eager to sink capture crack ironclad of rebel forgot about incoming transport thus in hour four ship be mere speck on horizon harbour of janjalla be left open for arrival of xuarez fresh troop crowd of people on rampart be too excited at stirring spectacle of chase to think of thing yelled hoarse in cheering for pedraza below on beach rebel who have evidently understood manoeuvre of columbus be cheering vigorously for don hypolito wait dog cried jack shaking fist at soon will sing tune by saint so will said tim wisely unless fort keep off transport will have two thousand troop down there night then be wig on green there will be agree with tim unless reinforcement arrive even then four thousand attacking town can do powerful lot when reinforcement arrive will only have one thousand five hundred to put against however let not despair added tim philosophically come with don juan will look over town then will go see if there be sign of new troop jack assented descending from rampart made way through town to house where tim have quarter street be filled with soldier who mostly looked smart well fitted for work here there be wounded men few sick with malarian fever from adjacent swamp on whole be wonderful how healthy be town twice have rebel assaulted wall twice be beaten back not without considerable loss of men on side of loyalist fortunately provision be plentiful be cool season therefore troop of junta be in comparatively good condition despite small number be so heartened by sinking of pizarro that be plain must fight like fiend to hold janjalla until aid arrived from capital townspeople took fact of being besieged in most contented manner hardly interrupted daily occupation in street tortilleras be cry ware water carrier proclaiming fact that sold aqua limpia for unusual number of soldier must have be quite impossible to see that city be in very jaw of danger at time woman wrapped in rebozo must pas along street a rule kept within door showed rarely in plaza men be being drilled many of house be used a hospital for sick wounded tim jack made way through crowded street duly arrived at former quarter where found peter eagerly expecting be weary of being by when heard be going to land gate to seek news of reinforcement insisted on accompanying after taking drink of aguardiente of stood much in need owing to exhaustion caused by excitement three friend set off at once to see if must hear anything about expected troop don sebastian be fraternising with captain in command of cavalry a own troop have be sent forward to sea rampart mounted regiment be stationed at end of town a be more useful in sally than be infantry be proved by way in have succoured soldier from iturbide a only horse men must have kept rebel troop at bay sign yet senor said don sebastian politely hour ago general sent out two indian scout with instruction to inquire at centeotl for men be twenty mile away yes indian travel fast before midnight will hear news of troop be if get a far south a centeotl before midnight xuarez will have landed new regiment said tim turning away well there be help for suppose come jack peter 't be use waiting here must wait till scout return meanwhile tim come with to telegraph office be going to send account of sea fight to paper be sure wire be not cut to southward said peter a trudged along to office be morning anyhow why must cut want to do be to intercept communication with capital care two straw go to england xuarez doe told so ah see xuarez be not here at present have forgotten to give order to cut when arrives again will do maybe well seeing that wish world to look on a noble patriot certainly wo care about wiring plain truth about to old country will either cut wire bring war correspondent on own hook rival cried tim indignantly if thought so 'd shoulder musket myself go out to shoot dirty villain here be po boy peter hold noise jack going to give history of fight know a much about a jack doe said peter in injured tone a entered office then will let put in word here there replied friend in kind tone why peter 'd do anything to please did think be knocked out of time entirely manuel be wire right yes senor replied operator dark alert looking man safe to truxillo bueno then will be safe to england truxillo be in honduras be a right a bank come jack begin at once be over two hour at business a what with jack roundabout description peter interruption took time for tim to get story ship shape then manuel be constantly wiring intelligence a transmitted to by tim who took full advantage of licence given by editor to send extensive telegram be close on six o'clock when finished be just stretching with yawn after long spell of sitting when outside murmur began rapidly swelled into roar three friend rushed out of office to learn what new event have taken place telegraph office be situated in street ran straight to land gate down street saw advancing dense body of men viva los soldatos viva el republico hurrah roared tim wildly 't be reinforcement there be philip cried jack pushing way through crowd wounded said peter noticing with true professional eye that cassim left arm hung useless by side janjalla band stationed in plaza burst out into patriotic strain of opal fandango crowd yelled cheered soldier tramped steadily down street tim to imminent danger of life flung almost under foot of philip horse philip dear boy here be tim jack thank god cried philip urging horse little way to side jumped down from saddle tim gripped one hand jack other peter patted baronet on back philip looked worn haggard winced a tim seized left hand be wounded cried tim letting go yes not badly indian arrow through fleshy part of arm ah exclaimed jack anxiously then cocom be right have be attacked by indian two day ago surprised camp by night came in in overwhelming force velez be unable to rally men be forced to retreat to centeotl how many men have brought philip six hundred one thousand started from tlatonac said jack sadly four hundred killed thank god philip at least be safe chapter ii fall of janjalla mount rampart man wall resolved to keep climbing foe at hot mouthed cannon hurl thousand ball thousand sword flash forth to wound slay down in fosse planted ladder fall smoke sulphurous spread veil of grey like incense from altar up roll to tell war god that thousand soul be to honour sacrificed day oh mar oh red bellona though fallen shrine bend yet 'neath yoke born later than greek seem to be not much more civilised than be folk instead of spear shield cutlery revolver rifle gun spit fire smoke for ye blood thirsty pair yet retain ancient love hence on battle plain with myriad victim name invoke siege of janjalla lasted five day during period town be completely invested by troop of xuarez a have be foreseen by columbus acting a decoy have drawn away ship of junta from protecting harbour same night xuarez under cover of darkness landed four thousand troop from transport by inconceivable oversight on part of engineer city wall be unprovided with search light electric apparatus so don hypolito be enabled to land boat load after boat load of men without hindrance by dawn six thousand men be encamped on beach under very gun of fort have xuarez attacked capital must have be easily repulsed for in tlatonac latest invention for defence be to be found krupp gun pointed from fort powerful electric light swept harbour bed of ocean in front of sea line be one vast mass of torpedo flower of cholacacan army be behind wall armed with latest invented rifle altogether siege of capital must have lasted month don hypolito however be too crafty to waste time so fruitlessly artfully attacked republic in weakest part janjalla be ill defended by wall cannon ill garrisoned with capable men by throwing on devoted town overwhelming mass of troop must hope to capture within few day then making head quarter must gradually advance along plain towards capital eating up town at twenty mile be already master of acauhtzin in north if must only reduce janjalla four inland town must be in complete command of whole inner country then besieging tlatonac by land sea must starve capital into surrender promptness be xuarez great characteristic so rapidly have accomplished transference of active operation from north to south that have completely taken junta by surprise be fatal mistake on part of governmental party in leaving such incapable man a gomez at head of affair if relying on strength of capital to protect have sent available soldier to garrison janjalla defeat rebel before must get footing in south must have probably crushed rebellion in bud victorious in lower part of country must have then reduced acauhtzin at leisure thus ended war within few week unfortunately gomez lost head at critical period proved quite unable to cope with masterly activity of rebel leader first of all committed mistake of not concentrating troop at janjalla then sent few hundred of men down at time general gigedo therefore found shut up in janjalla with scarcely thousand troop few gun insufficient ammunition telegraph wire having be cut be unable to communicate promptly with capital being in urgent need of reinforcement be in absolute despair a to what must occur in near future be true that gomez have promised thousand men in ten day even if arrived earlier must be too late a with small garrison at disposal be impossible that must hold out against force of six thousand for lengthened period must have sent messenger to tlatonac for aid troop of don hypolito completely encircled city be worse than useless to try break through girdle of steel held council of war decision must be arrived at save janjalla must hold out if possible until reinforcement arrived from capital day after day gigedo staff swept ocean with glass looking for torpederas cruiser none of appeared must only be conjectured that have captured columbus taken at once to tlatonac in harbour of be now doubtless lying meanwhile garrison fought with desperate valour with great difficulty managed to keep rebel at bay must be easily seen that state of thing must not last on fourth day preparation be made by xuarez for final assault everyone instinctively guessed that end have come cortes be lying with transport out of range of fort gun by mean of glass shut up in town must see that warship be making ready to bombard city don hypolito have come south again with new troop must be now seen riding about camp with brilliant staff seeing that thing be ready for assault jack who in company with philip be leaning over rampart noted audacious rebel remarked on presence before wall of janjalla there go brain of rebellion said touching philip on shoulder if must only be disposed of war must be over doubt xuarez know own value too well will therefore keep out of danger have evidently made up mind to finish siege to day unless help come think will succeed replied jack gloomily can not conceive what president maraquando can be thinking about to thus neglect janjalla if town fall into hand of xuarez a must do unless miracle take place don francisco will find war longer than expects gomez be fool said philip stamping foot what deuce be use of keeping army in capital there must be ten thousand soldier shut up in tlatonac excellency evidently intends to keep there till xuarez victorious troop arrive before wall very likely indian be before wall now be waiting for xuarez to join be not improbable thing look promising for junta because let gomez muddle business see rebel be marching up to sea gate be now noon before sundown will be within wall master of city what about garrison life depend on caprice of xuarez said philip after pause may let gigedo march out with remains of troop massacre one of intend to be massacred replied jack dryly what be more intend to be seen by xuarez must know by time through spy escaped from totatzine be probably ignorant that be in janjalla must escape unseen philip else will send back to be slaughtered by ixtlilxochitli hardly jack while tim be at hand what do mean don hypolito said philip sagely wish to stand well with world tim be medium through action be reported to world be to send englishman to be offered up by savage to barbaric deity there must be trouble with england xuarez ca afford to risk so will let go free did do in acauhtzin in acauhtzin friend be supposed by to be killed in riot must do a pleased with one who to world be practically non existing person here be different be alive be with friend one of whom be correspondent of great english journal dare not seize for own end in broad daylight dear jack while be beside xuarez will think twice before repeating treachery of acauhtzin will have to look for new victim for ixtlilxochitli fervently hope trust so answered jack looking at revolver to see that be loaded now suppose have better go to plaza troop must be assembling just now hark there go trumpet where be tim in telegraph office with peter wiring news to paper poor peter said duval a left rampart came here to collect beetle find plunged into unpleasant war never mind there be nothing like experience jack peter will recount deed of valour even unto third generation will come out safe in end will marry dolores eulalia will be gas gaiter videlicet nicholas nickleby philip gaiety be infectious jack burst out laughing at last remark have time however for further conversation a trumpet be calling loudly in plaza hurried to portion of town to find troop rapidly falling in general gigedo made speech to encourage soldier assuring that have communicated with tlatonac relief must shortly come to besieged town be that true lie asked jack of don sebastian who stood beside true replied spaniard smiling morning carrier pigeon be sent to excellency with message of deplorable state will certainly be relieved in few day few day echoed philip with sneer dear senor de ahumada few hour will see troop evacuating janjalla if be forced to do senor can fall back on centeotl what with few hundred men indian scouring country be further north assure be not replied cassim emphatically be attacked near centeotl by time savage be between town senor de ahumada assure that if evacuate janjalla will fall into hand of indian dios cried don sebastian suddenly cortes have started bombarding even a spoke bomb burst in air directly over plaza at once gigedo gave signal to troop to march to rampart in distance must hear fierce cry of rebel a marched out of camp tremour passed through whole of city a within wall recognised desperate state of affair bomb after bomb exploded with deafening noise troop manned wall besieger hurled against sea gate planted ladder against wall assault have commenced be beginning of end full force at disposal of general gigedo excluding sick wounded amounted to nine hundred men divided into two portion five hundred held sea facing portion of town four hundred be stationed at inland gate xuarez attacked two gate of town simultaneously trusted in event of entering at portal to be enabled to attack loyalist in rear thus crush between two army on rampart be not so difficult to keep foe back a be below planted ladder be hurled with burden of climbing men into ditch below incessant fusillade of musketry crackled along wall cannon with depressed muzzle hurled ball with more le damaging effect into dense throng massed on beach below bomb from cortes did deadly work skilfully besieger kept a widely apart a possible so a to neutralise effect of shell on compact mass be outside sea gate however that siege be pressed most hardly xuarez have cannon planted at gate to break down if possible huge wooden valve clamped with iron through loop hole low down in wall besieger fired incessantly killing rebel gunner a strove to discharge cannon above city hung thick cloud of grey smoke at interval through misty veil flared red flame of bomb bursting overhead rattle of musketry booming of cannon cry of wounded shout of besieged besieger made infernal din deafening to ear tim peter be at land gate in company with captain velez colonel garibay while jack philip fought side by side in repelling attack from sea front after incessant cannonading lasting two hour rebel managed to smash gate down with artillery rushed in only to find confronted by dense mass of resolute soldiery from sea gate street arose suddenly on top of incline gigedo have planted cannon cut lane in throng of rebel pressing through gate at last battle resolved into hand to hand fight in loyalist strove to beat back rebel force from gate xuarez saw signalled to cortes to stand in closer drop shell into centre of besieged at once warship did a be commanded in few moment bomb be creating fearful havoc in rank of loyalist in answer gun of fort speedily opened fire on warship did little damage a besieger be too busily occupied in repelling foe a swarmed up wall to take careful aim what with dense crowd pressing from without loss of men caused by incessant bursting of bomb in midst loyalist began to fall back in spite of most desperate resistance be thrust beyond line of cannon at top of street horde of rebel soldiery rushed inside gate proceeded to scale rampart in order to aid comrade who be climbing outer wall to silence gun playing on cortes skilfully making use of material found to hand xuarez turned cannon taken from loyalist on in hurried retreat have be unable to spike gun now loaded fired by rebel be mowing down in dozen soldier on rampart be either killed beaten back whole of sea front of janjalla be in complete possession of xuarez one comfort have loyalist namely that be protected in rear by men defending land gate shortly however roar of rage cheer of besieger announced that town be captured on side soldier retreated towards plaza in centre of town there found comrade who have fallen back from sea gate here there be handful of men shut up in square surrounded on side by victorious rebel must not possibly hold out long against dense mass converging to centre from part of town must be easily seen that siege be practically over during fighting night have fallen now battle be going on in dim twilight rendered still darker by heavily hanging cloud of smoke enwrapping town jack have received nasty cut on shoulder philip be unwounded in general scrimmage managed to keep well together when beaten back into plaza made for telegraph office where hoped to find tim peter be rendezvous appointed by tim in case battle went in favour of rebel a wished to send final message to paper before clearing out of town with handful of men principally belonging to own regiment philip jack managed to throw into telegraph office shortly afterwards be joined by tim where peter asked jack a saw huge form of friend dashing through door just behind with don sebastian gasped tim throwing into chair be up boy opposidores be in full possession of land gate sea gate also said philip who be reloading revolver men be in plaza ca hold out much longer whew there be bomb 'd better get out of janjalla make for centeotl cried don sebastian entering with sword smashed in two be over gigedo killed garibay

though must give in a though capital must be divided into two hostile faction when solution of difficulty be proposed by padre ignatius making appearance suddenly in hall good priest first stilled tumult by holding up crucifix then begged to lay before junta proposition must suit party must never do said padre to depose don francisco pretext for war alleged by xuarez be that gomez ought to be deposed for breaking constitution of cholacaca knew that excellency have not done so that have loyally upheld freedom law of republic if deposed by own party deposition must give colour to xuarez assertion that have right on side perhaps prejudice inland town in favour better must be to let don francisco still remain president till date of expiration of office four month hence in meantime entrust conduct of war solely to don miguel maraquando by arrangement excellency must still continue nominal head of cholacaca war must be conducted by maraquando without responsibility resting on president proposition seeming to be only possible solution of problem be unanimously accepted by party be true that gomez who hated maraquando like poison sorely grudged giving up command of affair to rival a saw that junta wished to be so be forced to yield don miguel be therefore elected general of army of republic don francisco be permitted to retain civil rule then meeting broke up maraquando went off to take measure for immediate relief of chichimec while gomez much mortified at slight have received retired sullenly to palace what be matter tim asked jack a left palacio nacional ought to

immobile face carambo senor news terrible news what be cried three englishman simultaneously chichimec have fallen jack uttered ejaculation of rage darted off to gate followed by tim philip found

first puebla de los naranjos now chichimec janjalla have already fallen wo fall interrupted jack abruptly a last of cavalry swept through gate when thing be at worst matter mend just now be very gloomy to morrow may improve tim stayed behind to make inquiry about fall of chichimec for use of paper philip in company with jack went off to look up peter ask if must consent to act a tim messenger to truxillo must not find in own house learned from servant that have gone in search of to casa maraquando at once repaired thither have just reached door when peter with look of alarm on face rushed out of house almost falling into arm in hurry philip jack have heard what be matter peter don francisco have shot don miguel have just told philip made gesture of horror jack ran into house to see maraquando learn particular of case be perfectly true unable to bear disgrace of being deposed from active conduct of affair president gomez have retired to room shot through heart chapter v indian raid painted brave came on war path numerous a leaf in summer decked with feather with wampum face fierce fearless streaked with colour like sunset rage be in heart of iron spear grasped bow arrow horse like storm cloud swiftly swept across prairie till firm earth shook trembled 'neath thunder of thousand loud sang song of battle sang song of war bloodshed while nation woman hearted hid within walled city like rabbit in burrow when heard that chaunt triumphal certainly fate be dealing hardly with republic of cholacaca one blow followed seemed a though final catastrophe must be triumphal entry of don hypolito xuarez into capital janjalla be in possession now threatened centeotl two town of puebla de los naranjos chichimec have be destroyed by savage ally unexpected death of don francisco gomez put finishing touch to series of calamity whole city be pervaded by feeling of dismay disquieting rumour crept among people xuarez have captured centeotl hermanita that be now on way to tlatonac that death of president gomez be due to machination fabrication gaining addition a flew from mouth to mouth carried fear into heart of citizen many be of opinion that nothing be left save surrender to insolent conqueror junta met within hour of intelligence of don francisco death unanimously elected don miguel maraquando a president of republic even party of dead ruler supported election a must not fail to see that maraquando must make exceptionally vigorous firm handed president though there be doubt that don francisco have committed suicide out of pique at being deposed from active command of affair yet junta ignoring manner of death thinking only of past service decreed late president state funeral house of city be draped in black flag floated half mast high minute gun boomed at interval from fort with due formality president gomez be interred in vault of cathedral when ceremony be at end weight seemed to be lifted off city bad fortune have persistently dogged later month of don francisco rule seemed to be passing away under vigorous leadership of maraquando capital became wildly patriotic one idea pervaded mind of that war be to be ended at once that xuarez be to be crushed by prompt well conceived measure after indian have sacked chichimec be naturally expected that must march southward join don hypolito before centeotl instead of however savage began to threaten capital daily band of well horsed brave must scour plain before puerta de la culebra sometimes soldier on guard exasperated by insolent defiance of principal city of cholacaca must dash out in small party on sally being made indian always disappeared bulk of army still lay a be ascertained by spy at chichimec seemed a though scouting party be anxious to draw troop of junta from behind wall so a to fall on in open plain president maraquando be anxious to march whole army south encounter don hypolito in neighbourhood of centeotl in order to do must have to overcome horde of savage formed living barrier between tlatonac chichimec entailed risk if beaten by indian must have to fall back on capital in crippled condition thus give xuarez time to increase discipline army then again even if did succeed in conquering bloodthirsty tribe must in probability lose many of men be forced to encounter don hypolito fresh soldier with jaded diminished troop at one time thought of waiting until return of torpederas from janjalla then embarking troop on iturbide proceed southward to attack xuarez in rear even there savage must have to be reckoned with during absence that of greater portion of troop must perhaps attack capital besides maraquando did not wish to risk expedition to janjalla unless cortes be either sunk captured altogether be in state of much perplexity only way by must make move be to detach indian from cause of xuarez task be accomplished by jack duval in what seemed to be almost miraculous fashion new president entertained great opinion of duval ability invariably found clear headed shrewd capable of giving good advice wonderfully prompt in coming to decision in time of emergency therefore when shortly after death of don francisco young man called to see at casa maraquando with view to lay certain proposition before useful to republic don miguel interviewed at once gave fullest attention time since peter with tim note have started in bohemian for truxillo at last moment philip have decided to go with jack desired to confer with maraquando about proposed scheme to be on spot in order to carry out tim be afraid to leave capital lest must miss stirring event likely to be of value to paper philip have special reason for remaining constantly at tlatonac unless for sake of dona eulalia dr grench did not object to go to truxillo in bohemian on observing that must feel more at ease regarding navigation of vessel if philip commanded baronet promptly decided to go be good thing for peter old benker have not heard reflection on seamanship else must have be much displeased at event peter by artfully putting matter in light secured philip for companion yacht have departed previous day for honduras be expected back in four day philip determined on return voyage to stand in close to shore of janjalla assure of result of expedition against cortes jack made appearance in patio in company of cocom whose presence required in delicate proposal have to make intended to appeal to superstitious side of indian character wanted cocom to back up opinion so a to induce don miguel to give consent to experiment desired to attempt connected with harlequin opal don miguel be on azotea smoking endless cigarette glancing over paper relating to civil government secretary be present when duval appeared president sent below with document received jack factotum alone jack took seat by president cocom rolling cigarette squatted on floor wrapped in zarape where be senor corresponsal asked don miguel solemnly after first greeting have passed between at puerta de la culebra replied jack taking cigar offered to by old gentleman asked to wait there senor a in hour so peon sent by excellency to chichimec be expected back bueno what news do expect by peon news that indian contemplate advance on tlatonac por todos santos don juan thing can not be indian must not dare to so insult majesty of republic jack privately thought majesty of republic have be pretty well insulted already wisely refrained from giving voice to opinion indian excelencia said smoothly be according to trustworthy report six thousand strong thus think match for even capital of cholacaca have reduced puebla de los naranjos to ash have sacked chichimec without hindrance excited by such victory have rashly determined to attack tlatonac on own account without waiting for arrival of xuarez do really think will dare to camp under wall asked don miguel still incredulous really do think so excelencia replied jack frankly if think be too rash in pronouncing such opinion question friend cocom have already rendered great service to to republic therefore must know that speaks truth speak to senor president turned eye towards old indian who impassive a idol sat at foot smoking cigarette answered maraquando inquiring look with grunt of assent to jack remark be true indian excelencia of maya be name be that of king cocom speaks now truth don xuarez be also indian come from hidden city of totatzine have understanding with high priest ixtlilxochitli don hypolito said war chalchuih tlatonac through priest of huitzilopochtli said war therefore be six thousand indian in arm now opal be in possession of enemy of god in tlatonac city hated by ixtlilxochitli xuarez have told fighting men that war be holy war for recovery of sacred shining stone be not for opal indian must not dare to come to tlatonac even with six thousand brave be holy war will dare anything to recover sacred stone therefore will come here excelencia camp under wall be truth swear by shrine of holy mother of god might be so said maraquando musingly opal be in tlatonac without doubt niece have in chamber knowing how sacred indian hold gem doubt that will fight boldly to gain again for hidden shrine of god huitzilopochtli assuredly don miguel to gain will come to tlatonac must not be cried president emphatically will send army against encounter host at chichimec with what result senor even if conquered victory must cost many men thus must army be weakened to encounter xuarez true true don juan what then be to be done let indian army come to tlatonac let camp under wall close gate of city make hostile sign what say senor said maraquando in fiery tone must have leave savage foe in peace till joined by don hypolito by rebel xuarez will not be joined by xuarez don miguel when rebel arrive will find savage ally under wall of tlatonac if must be so must be well how senor do propose to make savage army vanish without blow by mean of chalchuih tlatonac understand mi amigo explain if will be so gracious be attention jack began to explain without further preamble observe excelencia said slowly so that don miguel must have difficulty in following reason be now noon night if mistake not indian army will come to tlatonac bueno interrupted cocom nodding head like mandarin have heard thing spoken with many tongue messenger excelencia will confirm what say indian army will march night for tlatonac at dawn will see encamped round wall proceed don juan said president gravely a can see senor maraquando pursued jack emphasising remark with finger savage will not arrive till night so a be now noon will have time to make ready for arrival dios said make preparation not hostile preparation senor listen pray have chalchuih tlatonac property of be regarded with superstitious reverence by indian what opal command will do when glow red prepare for war let azure ray shine know that god command peace at cost will lay down arm how be done glowing of red of blue will explain senor in hidden city saw opal hung by golden thread before shrine of huitzilopochtli thread be twisted in certain way by priest by careful calculation must tell how far must untwist so that opal stone depended motionless showing colour wished if desired war red side of stone revealed if peace blue to prophesy plenty yellow ray came to front so on with tint then say don juan that if indian saw opal glowing blue must lay down arm assuredly senor withdraw at once to totatzine leaving xuarez to meet force of junta alone if stone glow blue know be will of god that must not fight don miguel smiled incredulously doubt senor whether warrior flushed with sacking of puebla de los naranjos chichimec must obey stone now even though glowed blue thus proclaimed peace excelencia broke in cocom earnestly know not power of chalchuih tlatonac senor be good catholic believe not in devil stone countryman senor think that spirit of god huitzilopochtli dwells in gem believe that must punish with plague unto death be to disobey will a conveyed by opal shining precious stone be strongest thing in world to believe excelencia that when warrior see stone glow blue even be on eve of entering tlatonac must lay down arm retire to forest trust may be so said maraquando addressing to jack not unimpressed by indian speech where senor duval do propose to let see opal in chapel of padre ignatius outside wall replied jack promptly cocom know where there be image of war god will set up on altar of chapel before by thread will hang sacred stone at dawn will be ready cocom can so twist thread when opal hang motionless will glow blue indian will arrive during night at dawn will spread through suburb enter chapel of good padre there will see image of god sacred splendour of opal will kneel down worship watching twisting of gem when stop glow blue then will know huitzilopochtli be satisfied with sacking of two town now command peace before noon excelencia there will not be single indian left before wall will retire into forest to sacred city of totatzine thus will xuarez lose ally maraquando listened to proposal in silence cheek resting in palm of right hand when jack have concluded did alter position mused long deeply of guest attempting to interrupt meditation idea of detaching indian from xuarez by mean of opal seemed to to be childish that army of six thousand untutored savage flushed with victory must voluntarily retire at bidding of huitzilopochtli spoken through stone seemed improbable then maraquando have never be to totatzine did not know in what extreme veneration opal be held by indian thus deemed jack proposition weak when in reality must scarcely have be stronger nothing be so powerful a superstition to work on mind of indian through abject belief in virtue of shining precious stone be master stroke on part of duval seems to said maraquando at length raising eye that carrying out of scheme will entail loss of opal without doubt senor replied duval coolly by such sacrifice gain more than lose indian will desert xuarez will be able to march army south conquer in neighbourhood of centeotl before have time to approach nearer to capital then can crush nest of traitor in acauhtzin better lose opal than tlatonac if succeed in getting rid of indian may be that city will fall what say niece dona dolores have spoken to senor for sake of city be willing to run risk of losing jewel don miguel smiled approvingly be patriotic liked to see same quality displayed by family at same time be just man knowing how dolores loved gem did not care about taking advantage of offer to sacrifice same unless voluntarily consented to surrender sacred stone will ask lady said rising from chair one moment senor will return with niece disappeared down staircase leading to patio jack be left alone with cocom may be that indian will not dare to take jewel said jack looking at old man cocom uttered grunt might have meant anything rest content don juan once chalchuih tlatonac leaf wall of city will never return again back to sacred shrine of totatzine will go high priest have ordered be sought for far wide lest god afflict people with plague for loss still if remained in chapel watched senor nay that indeed must be rash indian must slay only one will watch jewel that one can not prevent worshipper seizing mean be said speak of cocom will sit by image of god when indian enter chapel of good father indian might slay cocom that be to be must be replied old man stolidly cocom must watch sacred gem so that sends blue ray of peace from breast tribe have be told by ixtlilxochitli that cocom be traitor false to worship of old god when be seen must die friend be silent senor not man can turn aside spear of teoyamiqui why must murmur if death be portion be old be mutilated be weary of life if die die for safety of white people may be senor that a say good padre cocom will go to heaven of christian with virgin such going rest jack found word to reply to speech remained silently thinking of how must save old man from death have a yet arrived at conclusion when don miguel appeared with niece on floor of azotea dolores ran towards jack threw into arm querido said in tender voice good uncle tell of scheme be that of spoke to may save tlatonac from savage foe thus do aid to extent of power held out opal towards may lose altogether dolores matter juanito may save city consent to sacrifice don miguel yes senor think will turn aside host of savage with away can hope to conquer xuarez otherwise maraquando stopped suddenly made gesture of despair of course be merely experiment said jack doubtfully one must be successful cried dolores quickly querido can doubt that after what saw in sacred city a god speaks through opal so will indian act let dart then blue ray drive back to forest be sure can make shine blue cocom senor said old man with great dignity give life to prove that will be so jack took opal from outstretched hand of dolores so be cried fervently opal have brought indian to tlatonac opal will send back again to totatzine tim suddenly made appearance with face full of excitement jack senor maraquando said quickly in spanish messenger sent to spy on indian at chichimec have returned what doe say senor corresponsal that whole host of indian be marching from chichimec will be camped round wall at dawn dios be lost cried jack brightly be saved what deuce will save jack asked tim in english duval held up harlequin opal ray of sunlight struck jewel blue ray darted out like tongue of steel bueno said cocom stolidly chalchuih tlatonac prophesies peace chapter vi luck of opal red ray dy in opal stone god hath spoken arrow bow spear be broken red of war be fiery token lo in zone pale fade faint dy a sunset wane in eastern sky blue ray glow in opal heart god be smiling victim more need be piling on altar stone for dread beguiling blue ray dart to tell war must surely cease so in land let there be peace jack at once proceeded to execute project fortunately padre ignatius have gone south in iturbide thinking ministration might be required by wounded else duval must never have gained good priest consent to desecration of chapel a be jack hoped to carry out scheme restore chapel to original state before return of old man actual elevation of heathen idol on shrine of virgin not being seen by padre ignatius must think le of sacrilegious act more especially when must find on return altar in nearly same state a when left being protestant jack have scruple about matter cocom be such queer mixture of paganism catholicism that view be not very decided believed in virgin certainly seeing that altar be required to save city cocom thought that surely must not object to conversion for time of chapel into heathen temple besides if be not done indian must be sure to destroy shrine so be best to make attempt to avert disaster even in such illegitimate way rather than risk whole place being destroyed by savage be cocom idea in matter therefore proceeded to put image of huitzilopochtli in place occupied by cross father ignatius must have died of horror have witnessed such daring afternoon laboured to transfer chapel into semblance of temple of war god at length succeeded in making very fair representation huitzilopochtli left foot decked with humming bird feather be set up on shrine small altar on fire be lighted burned before wall be draped with mat of featherwork pictured linen whereon be depicted hideous form of aztec deity from roof by

surprise awaited don rafael mounted on mustang came galloping through gate reined up steed in front of astonished father father great news good news have just returned in montezuma have captured cortes transport don miguel looked incredulous news coming after departure of indian seemed too good to be true be true father said rafael proudly by noon to day will see in harbour now don hypolito have fleet hurrah cried jack tossing hat in air luck of opal near repeated exclamation swelled into roar throughout tlatonac only one cry must be heard vive el opale chapter vii under opal flag marching away joyous gay rank upon rank with splendid display leaving city at breaking of day riding along gallant strong round populace tearfully throng greeting going with patriot song under foot flower bud sweet tread in marching through plaza street never kinsfolk again may meet laurel to earn foeman to spurn only for glory anxiously yearn conqueror will hither return juan said dolores seriously believe opal brought bad fortune while be in city janjalla fell don francisco died went wrong now be lost indian have departed fleet of xuarez be destroyed everything promise well for future be true in one sense yet wrong in replied jack smiling must not forget that be through opal indian departed while be in tlatonac pizarro be sunk two other warship captured suppose never again will behold opal juanito not unless care to pay second visit to totatzine dolores shuddered memory of peril in hidden city be painful one recent event have not obliterated recollection of terrible journey to coast through tropical forest must certainly not care about seeing totatzine again querido yet must if only to save cocom be impossible to save cocom responded jack trifle sadly only way to do so must be to lead army to hidden city rescue how can such thing be done in narrow secret way soldier must be cut to piece in rocky defile there be other way suppose be not sure dolores canon road lead to outer world if must only enter valley where totatzine be built by way might succeed in capturing city be afraid such entrance will never be discovered ay di mi then poor cocom be lost be own fault querida tried to save refused to obey order still there be one chance of aiding though be afraid faint one that juan listen angelito sacrifice of cycle doe not take place for two month have escaped cocom may now be selected by ixtlilxochitli a victim if can crush xuarez finish war within next few week may be that can march troop to sacred city save life how can get to city by secret way by canon road see dolores have idea be sitting on azotea two day after indian have retreated from tlatonac rafael have just left full of glee at proposed expedition to janjalla be then that dolores have made remark about opal lead to conversation regarding cocom totatzine canon road in lap dolores have pile of flower be arranging for use of house jack took handful of kneeling down on floor of azotea proceeded to illustrate theory by constructing map with blossom behold own said deftly placing bud here there rose be totatzine situate fifty mile from coast in straight line here be tlatonac indicated by scarlet verbena from point where embarked in canoe to capital be twenty mile understand said dolores much interested in explanation from totatzine to point where embarked from thence to tlatonac be what call right angle now if draw straight line from capital in slanting direction can see that pass through totatzine see that querido third line be longer than other two be longer than of other two line if take separately shorter if take together know euclid dolores else must discover that two side of triangle be together greater than third side wait moment juanito exclaimed dolores vivaciously from totatzine to point where embarked be fifty mile from thence to tlatonac twenty mile in seventy mile by reasoning third line be not seventy mile of course not still believe be quite seventy mile from tlatonac to totatzine by new way how so because can not go thither in straight line if went by one have drawn distance must be much shorter than by secret way of sea a have to follow railway be longer journey quite seventy mile see be cuavaca at foot of xicotencatl thirty mile from tlatonac from cuavaca to terminus of railway be twenty mile from thence to totatzine possibly twenty in seventy mile so see that distance way owing to configuration of country be precisely same yes what of can not see at point where railway stop be only twenty mile to totatzine now if a suspect there be road leading up canon to city distance from termination of railway work to road can not be very far if therefore discover hidden road can take troop up by rail march rest of distance enter totatzine through mouth of canon oh cried dolores astonished at idea propose to attempt entrance if can be found unfortunately cocom be only indian who must supply such information be prisoner to ixtlilxochitli if knew of canon road why did not lead by way instead of towards coast forget whole country be overrun by indian must not have disguised a pilgrim have gone by canon road be evidently secular path other way to coast be sacred might be done juanito yes can not be done till xuarez be conquered war be ended santissima sighed dolores sadly when will be very shortly now have succeeded in getting rid of indian will be able to crush xuarez at one blow when do march south to morrow at latest will senor felipe be back be afraid not in three day expect yacht will return by time who know what may not have conquered rebel shortly afterwards conversation came to abrupt conclusion a don miguel sent special messenger to call jack to palacio nacional in day jack be very important personage maraquando be so impressed by way in indian have be dealt with entertained higher opinion than ever of duval capability frequently appealed to for advice did create jealousy for cholacacans be now beginning to regard duval a one of be going to marry niece of president be engineer who have constructed railway be deeply interested in future of republic so be generally supposed that when war be at end must be naturalized citizen of cholacaca take up abode there altogether clever brilliant young man like jack be distinct acquisition to country liberal minded cholacacans welcomed accordingly from deepest despair city have passed into state of great elation with death of gomez bad fortune of republic seemed to have vanished since maraquando have seated in presidential chair have gone well superstitious tlatonacians looked upon a ruler likely to bring good fortune to republic be such belief to be wondered at seeing how suddenly tide of fortune have turned within last few day in favour of governmental party indian have departed thus be don hypolito deprived at one swoop of power cortes menaced by columbus iturbide torpederas have surrendered now with transport be lying in harbour of capital xuarez by loss of fleet be cut off completely from north shut up in janjalla with six thousand troop after event have transpired junta met in hall of palacio nacional to map out coming campaign whole of member be on side of maraquando before peril threatened republic in south party difference have disappeared representative of several province united in upholding policy of don miguel judicious unity be salvation of republic capital be garrisoned by ten thousand troop plentifully supplied with cannon ammunition rifle force be under command of general benito who have be elevated to command after death of ill fated gigedo at janjalla troop be in great state of excitement a be well known that be no longer to be held back within wall of capital maraquando have decided to throw forward nine thousand men a far a centeotl leaving one thousand to defend tlatonac try conclusion with rebel in open plain at second conference of junta decision be somewhat modified by advice of benito that astute commander pointed out that in janjalla lay strength of xuarez if be defeated at centeotl must fall back on southern capital whereas if be in power of government must have chance of retreat be thus crushed at one blow main thing therefore be to capture janjalla deprive rebel of last refuge in case of defeat be rafael who supported general proposed plan by southern city must be taken senor cried rafael vehemently what general benito say be true must leave xuarez refuge must be crushed between army in north south behold senor in harbour of city lie two warship taken from enemy now manned by faithful sailor of junta also armed cruiser iturbide two torpedo boat zuloaga montezuma one of have honour of commanding give senor order to steam south put two thousand troop on board of transport then will lie in harbour of janjalla bombard town a don hypolito have probably gone north with bulk of army to centeotl town will be ill defended in end must surrender then can land troop push forward to gain rear of rebel from north senor seven thousand men will march under command of general benito thus xuarez will find between two army be forced to surrender submit to be cut to piece rebel will be defeated war will be ended proposition commended to junta be ultimately adopted at once fleet under command of captain pedraza be sent south with instruction to bombard capture janjalla then to lead troop push forward to effect conjunction with general benito at centeotl warship cruiser torpederas transport left harbour of capital afternoon amid great excitement then populace rolled from sea gate to land gate in order to witness departure of army for south a yet bohemian have not returned from truxillo delay vexed tim mightily a wanted to send boat off again with fresh despatch besides knew that philip must be annoyed at missing battle be to decide fate of war when have left for truxillo there have be chance of loyalist rebel meeting in open battle of late event have developed so rapidly that be impossible to delay matter further army be marching for centeotl philip be absent at truxillo only one person be pleased at eulalia be afraid of losing lover in what promised to be terribly sanguinary affair be therefore pleased that be out of danger have not spartan spirit of cousin who though downcast at prospect of being separated from jack yet bade march forward with army to conquer rebel made attempt to detain by side two thousand infantry have embarked on board transport for janjalla now army consisting of five thousand foot two thousand horse left for front by puerta de la culebra maraquando be nominally commander in chief of force presence being required at tlatonac left conduct of campaign to general benito army of janjalla proceeding thither by sea be commanded by colonel palo be directed when southern city be captured to march to centeotl effect if possible junction with troop from north there be also forty field gun battery of gatling with corp of engineer thus provided army of government deemed invincible when set out maraquando solemnly delivered to benito great standard of opal have never before left wall of capital now in splendour floated over head of soldier shining star with glitter of feather work jewel leading south to victory with standard army must scarcely conceive that there be chance of defeat sign of indian have disappeared there be doubt that obeying opal have retired to sacred city there delivered recovered treasure to high priest doubtless ixtlilxochitli still desirous of aiding xuarez must stir up to war before must again emerge from forest general benito hoped to cut army of don hypolito to piece reduce south to order then marching north defeat savage force under wall of capital great strength of republic lay in fact that by strategy have succeeded in isolating xuarez in south owing to loss of fleet must no longer depend upon help from acauhtzin now that indian ally have deserted be forced to meet royalist army with comparatively small army on monday afternoon transport filled with troop convoyed by warship left for janjalla at dawn on wednesday army began to march out of puerta de la culebra on way to south jack took fond farewell of dolores soothed with promise of speedy return don miguel with member of junta accompanied mile on way then returned to capital to wait upshot of bold attempt to end war at single blow from tlatonac army marched to chichimec found in ruin hardly soul be left in town for who survived massacre have fled southward to puebla de los naranjos be true that there also must find ruin did not know a telegraph wire have be cut by indian a savage be between chichimec capital unfortunate townspeople be only able to escape southward leaving chichimec benito marched to puebla de los naranjos there found considerable number of fugitive from former city be informed that centeotl still held out against rebel though xuarez be besieging hotly that hermanita be untouched by savage rebel news be very comforting desirous of reaching that town by general pushed forward troop by forced march by eight o'clock army came in sight of hermanita be joyfully greeted by citizen who threw open gate to receive whom justly regarded a deliverer night troop occupied town centeotl be twenty mile further on benito be desirous of ascertaining position of xuarez before venturing to give battle sent out indian spy speedily brought report a to numerical strength of rebel appeared that xuarez have in about seven thousand troop a have be joined by several of smaller town of republic have left five hundred to garrison janjalla never for moment dreaming guarded a be town by cortes must be attacked by loyalist from sea now having lost sole remaining warship must not help seeing that position be desperate by spy learned that army under benito be camped at hermanita that janjalla be being bombarded by fleet of junta at one time thought of falling back on janjalla concentrating force within wall holding out against loyalist until reinforced by indian ally a yet knew not that have deserted withdrawn to forest have be aware of isolated position might have come to term with junta relying on aid of savage trusting to ixtlilxochitli promise felt confident that must gain victory a janjalla be being bombarded by warship decided not to fall back there a must expose troop to double danger land army of benito bomb from sea what proposed to do be to meet benito at centeotl defeat army then occupy town hold out till ally came south march north to effect conjunction with before capital a to janjalla must hing to relieve be absolutely necessary that must keep troop together so a to meet army of republic under benito before janjalla fell into hand of junta hoped to conquer land force be chance fully recognised that position be most perilous only hope have of turning tide of fortune in favour be to be joined by indian from north warship have left tlatonac on monday afternoon general benito knowing weak garrison at janjalla calculated that city must succumb to bombardment by friday at latest be now morning of day determined to march troop forward to meet rebel army from janjalla from hermanita to centeotl be twenty mile way assuming that janjalla be captured a there be reason to believe general benito hoped that two thousand troop from south own force from north must meet at centeotl about same time with idea marched with full strength to centeotl for now that indian have vanished have fear of being attacked in rear if forced to retreat must fall back on hermanita that city being defended by ordinary garrison don hypolito so a not to expose troop to double fire of town plain left shelter of wall occupied low range of hillock running at right angle from city between benito flowed river broad sluggish by noon army faced one at one o'clock first shot be fired battle of centeotl began chapter viii battle of centeotl squadron move across plain beneath rain of deadly missile falling falling oh must gain height beyond where gun be calling of deed appalling one to other not in vain then might conquer in fray victor be e'er close of day stream lying between two army be called rio tardo from slow flowing current emerging from interior mountain pursued way in many winding to sea centeotl be built on left bank so that loyalist be unable to occupy town without crossing river to do so must have have to force passage at point of sword battle took place about three mile from city on large plain streaked here there with low range of sandy hill intersected by broad stream of rio tardo on one of range don hypolito have planted artillery swept river with heavy gun also disposed infantry along bank whence kept up regular fire of musketry on loyalist bridge at centeotl have be destroyed prior to arrival of benito so that there be way of crossing save under fire from foot soldier in teeth of battery posted on sandy ridge behind battery xuarez held cavalry in reserve lest loyalist must accomplish passage of river combatant come to closer quarter between centeotl position have taken up placed line of thousand horse with object of preventing attack by besieged in rear in disposition of troop showed wonderful skill in taking advantage of capability of ground general benito saw plainly that must be with considerable difficulty that must effect crossing of rio tardo on side there be range of hill upon must post artillery by must protect men nothing desolate plain covered with brushwood incapable of offering least shelter against devastating fire of insurgent only way of crossing river be to silence battery on sandhills with object brought up field gun opened heavy cannonade on height beyond rebel replied for over two hour cross fire went on without intermission on side benito trusted by gunnery to deceive insurgent a to real purpose be to attempt crossing with five hundred horse three mile further up stream near ruin of bridge by doing so must take xuarez in rear while rebel be employed in facing new danger from unexpected quarter hoped to cross river with full force don hypolito evidently suspected stratagem for kept sharp eye on disposition of loyalist army in direction of centeotl when saw body of horse move citywards to effect crossing at once sent troop of cavalry to dispute passage benito seeing despatched battery of six gatling to support troop trusting that under cover of gun playing on enemy must force stream at once xuarez brought up field artillery in short space of time cannonading lower down river be being repeated further up at ruin of bridge right wing of loyalist army consisting entirely of infantry be thrown forward in direction of centeotl kept up fusillade under cover of cavalry in scattered group tried to cross insurgent however must not be dislodged from opposite bank be impossible to accomplish passage under persistent musketry for close on three mile along bank of river line of sharp shooter extended at end of line artillery thundered incessantly men on side be dropping moment seemed a though army must annihilate other without crossing stream for four hour battle have be raging without combatant coming to close quarter xuarez soldier remaining ever on defensive began to grow impatient on other hand royalist trying to carry passage of stream by dash after dash be warming up to work must have be madness for don hypolito to cross stream with few attack many of loyalist river be great safeguard so long a interposed water between enemy felt comparatively safe trusting to hold position until arrival of indian from north whom counted upon taking enemy in rear saw plainly that men be growing weary of remaining solely on defensive submitting to be cut to piece by fire of benito artillery until saw prospect of being reinforced by indian be powerless to do anything stubbornly prevent loyalist from fording stream general benito saw that rebel leader be unaware of disaffection of ally relied on arriving shortly to turn tide of war in favour with view therefore to dishearten ordered indian scout attached to staff to ford river if possible below battery point present to xuarez a deserter from loyalist inform that indian have retreated scout at once obeyed attempted to swim river just a be close on opposite bank rifle shot struck be with greatest difficulty that regained shore several rebel soldier ran up to finish with bayonet implored to take to xuarez a be in possession of certain fact relating to ally on being brought into presence of rebel leader have just time to tell don hypolito of uselessness of counting on indian shortly afterwards expired xuarez thought at first be device of loyalist to gain time a hour after hour went on indian appeared began to believe that be indeed foolish to depend upon help from quarter full terror of position came on at once saw that deserted by indian cut off from acauhtzin whole success of rebellion against junta depended upon cutting army of benito to piece janjalla be behind several time thought of falling back on town knowledge that be being bombarded by loyalist fleet withheld from committing folly centeotl be held in interest of junta there be chance of safety there so saw that must remain in present position tire out benito by holding position stubbornly dash across river with main portion of troop try fortune of war in hand to hand fight with characteristic boldness decided on latter of alternative sent forward thousand cavalry to cross river carry war into enemy camp midway between two battery still kept up fire brought fifteen field gun to bear on mass of infantry on other bank armed only with rifle hoping to cut to piece thus afford cavalry safe landing benito ordered five gatling gun to silence field battery prevent if possible landing of insurgent cavalry unfortunately order must not be accomplished smartly enough before gatling must be brought into position field gun of xuarez have opened heavy fire on infantry under cover of five hundred horse men crossed stream landing once effected others followed cavalry rode down infantry like sheep while right left ball from field gun of xuarez cut passage in crowded mass for moment advantage be decidedly with don hypolito at once thousand cavalry held in reserve behind battery be hurled forward on horseman of rebel five hundred have now crossed stream there held loyalist at bay while comrade formed rebel regiment pierced like wedge into mass of infantry met cavalry of benito distance from bank of river what with horseman incessant firing of field gun infantry of benito be thoroughly demoralised flying in direction cavalry of xuarez with admirable discipline formed into line a soon a crossed river steadily drove horseman of loyalist backward xuarez at once took advantage of gain behind cavalry sent regiment after regiment of infantry with order to carry battery of benito by storm in vain foot soldier of loyalist be hurled against advancing mass of rebel horse foot now marching steadily for battery did not give way one inch xuarez hoped to capture battery turn gun against loyalist then bringing rest of troop across stream unexpected manoeuvre have taken benito by surprise there be little doubt that if battery be captured panic must ensue amongst own men thus give xuarez decided advantage column of rebel pouring across stream pierced host of loyalist like wedge bore steadily down on battery be still under heavy fire of insurgent artillery posted on sandhills thing looked black at moment for loyalist army at critical juncture troop of benito succeeded in forcing passage of stream further up near city what opposidores have done in centre of line did at end under cover of heavy fire from gatling managed to cross stream capture field gun of enemy be at once utilised turned on rebel in few minute be pouring deadly fire into mass of cavalry infantry sent to hold bridge passage by xuarez officer galloped post haste to benito informing of crossing of stream general recognising that might cut off force of xuarez on left bank sent to bridge soldier must spare amounting to fifteen hundred meanwhile cavalry of xuarez supported by several regiment of infantry be trying to carry battery of loyalist by storm own artillery be now silent a so inextricably mingled be rebel loyalist round battery that be impossible for gunner of xuarez to fire without cutting own men to piece rebel be still steadily pouring column after column across stream in rear of cavalry when suddenly line be cut in two by victorious loyalist from bridge have utterly beaten rebel defending passage by turning own gun on now latter be flying towards centre of scene of operation followed by scattered body of cavalry cutting down in direction loyalist infantry quickly crossed river followed in rear of horseman being on foot be necessarily far behind rebel attempted to re form reach point where column be fording stream flushed with victory cavalry of benito passed clean through mass cutting off further rebel from joining comrade on opposite shore at same time owing to deadly fire of loyalist battery invading soldier of xuarez be beginning to give way slowly fell back inch by inch towards point where have crossed be unable to get back however a cavalry of benito held in check on opposite bank seeing general threw forward two regiment across stream further up where bank owing to clean sweep made by cavalry be undefended rebel now found between two mass of foe between two fire with nothing river between slowly retreated before infantry pressing forward from direction of battery falling back on right bank of river found unable to cross in teeth of loyalist cavalry holding opposite bank while foot soldier behind fought viciously with rebel cavalry infantry of xuarez thus caught became demoralized unable to keep firm front to loyalist broke up into terrified mass be either cut to piece forced into stream where be shot down by enemy on opposite bank be now close on six o'clock after five hour incessant fighting advantage be now with army of junta benito held passage of bridge near centeotl from thence down to battery bank of stream on side be held by own men enemy beaten on right bank be slowly falling back on left concentrating round hillock from thundered artillery behind battery xuarez still held three thousand men in reserve brought forward with intention of hurling in one last effort of despair against advancing mass of loyalist general benito no longer held back army in person led soldier across river in miraculously short space of time combat be transferred from right to left bank of rio tardo whole force of loyalist with exception of corp of engineer attending to battery have crossed river be pressing forward to carry citadel of xuarez by storm what with killed wounded prisoner taken number of fighting men on side be terribly reduced yet numerically speaking advantage lay with loyalist who must oppose seven thousand men to four thousand on part of xuarez confident in position in shelter afforded by sandhills don hypolito gathered four thousand round base of battery played gun with deadly effect on advancing mass of loyalist over head of own men be now hand to hand struggle though loyalist have advantage over rebel in number yet a be unable to bring gun across river combat be more le equalised deadly fire from sandhills played havoc with rank be mowed down in hundred having artillery to oppose gun being unable to silence by battery on opposite bank only hope of thrashing enemy lay in carrying sandhills by storm benito with desperate courage now proceeded to do a yet xuarez have managed to keep loyalist in front gathering line from river bank to distance into plain desperately resisted attempt of attacking force to break through storm battery to protect rear from river side sent two hundred cavalry to back of sandhills to guard stream lest straggling party of loyalist must cross at point assail unexpectedly be now entirely on defensive unless succeeded in putting loyalist to flight with artillery saw not how must hope to win victory how bitterly did regret desertion of indian cause of disaffection must not understand with coming from north might have effected conjunction by crossing river a have done thus captured battery of benito a be however soldier have be beaten back loyalist have crossed river now whole force be concentrated round sandhills upon be placed artillery in despair don hypolito longed for darkness in hope that under cover of night might be enabled to fall back on janjalla long since must have done for timely information that town be blockaded by warship of junta seemed like madness to retreat into such death trap yet if must hold out against bombardment until arrived must at least have wall behind to fight regretted intensely that have not captured centeotl thrown therein to defend against loyalist surrounded by stone wall must hope to wear out troop of republic perhaps destroy in detachment a be have shelter whole front be being assaulted by loyalist behind have battery possible chance of falling back on janjalla in night time whole plain from centeotl to point of action be now in hand of loyalist seeing jefe politico of city threw open gate sent forward men with provision wine to wearied troop three hundred soldier yet remained within wall also marched out to join army of republic attack xuarez in last position be now past seven o'clock darkness be rapidly coming on don hypolito hoped that loyalist must withdraw renew combat next day in interval men must rest sustain with food fall back at once on janjalla respite however benito declined to give while light lasted determined to keep up fight if possible dislodge xuarez from position before morning deeply did regret that have electric light by glare of to conduct battle a be took advantage of clear twilight pushed forward men vigorously in attempting to break down stubborn line of defence offered by don hypolito be questionable how long state of thing must have lasted a rebel obstinately fought on though benito hurled column after column against not one inch must yield artillery also from height above be sweeping down rearward troop sent one thousand across river again to attempt rear of enemy under cover of fire of fifteen gatling xuarez turned four heavy gun on passage of river stopped crossing with ease carrajo muttered benito shutting up glass in rage will hold out till be dark then must stop during night will fall back on janjalla into hand of men replied jack who be standing beside general senor don hypolito know be worse than useless to retreat from present position when morning dawn will find still on hill bueno same don juan must like to finish off to night then send scout from centeotl to see if men be advancing from janjalla might be that city be not taken be true on other hand might be that city be coincidence occur in real life a well a in novel here occurred case in point tim who have be to centeotl to make inquiry galloped up to benito at moment saluted general said rapidly messenger have just arrived from janjalla city be in hand of junta troop to number of two thousand be pushing forward by forced march janjalla in hand cried benito joyfully then xuarez have refuge on to fall back army shouted on hearing cheering news looked upon destruction of rebel a foregone conclusion a indeed be xuarez shouting becoming aware of cause by frequent cry of janjalla ground teeth with rage a saw how fortune be against senor said to officer be condemned to stay here there be now hope of falling back on seaport can face enemy fight bravely must have heard of fall before a scout be over country to janjalla nevertheless in spite of discouraging news urged men to fight bravely hoping that night must come force loyalist to withdraw for hour in time army must rest eat while might think of plan by to circumvent tactic of general benito be quite ignorant that two thousand men be marching from janjalla to attack in rear last glimmer of sunset have long since died out of sky be now comparatively dark a yet reinforcement from janjalla have not arrived benito be almost on point of ceasing fight till dawn when moon arose in west appearance be welcomed by with joy for light be quite brilliant enough to enable assaulting party to continue fighting incessantly pressing on wearied troop of xuarez seemed only chance of beating from sandhills scattering army don hypolito cursed moon audibly for saw that last chance of escaping in darkness be gone nothing remained for to fight on doggedly then scout arrived learned that in hour two thousand men must attack in rear with cry of rage hurled field glass down hill fortune be against muttered biting lip with wrath star go down in blood attacked front rear can not hold out much longer yet be too brave to give in seeing that town of centeotl be left defenceless a garrison have joined benito hoped to make detour throw with remaining troop into city one thousand men must leave to defend battery draw off attention of loyalist with remaining two thousand march silently away to south then make detour for city then reinforcement must come up in vain for men must have slipped away like eel from between two army never thought of fate of thousand men be leaving behind at moment must have given anything to gain time to reconstruct plan must have sacrificed million life so that campaign must not end in disaster mad scheme to occupy centeotl in teeth of enemy be destined to fail for lack of time before must move single column towards city sound of distant firing be heard reinforcement came up in rear at quick trot whole force of xuarez be disposed along front of battery protecting from assault of benito army undefended in rear save for two hundred cavalry guarding river offered freely to reinforcement for storming don hypolito brought round troop rapidly from front to oppose new danger cavalry dashed recklessly between battery advancing infantry from janjalla three gun with depressed muzzle rained down shot on mass of infantry be in vain fresh troop elated by fall of janjalla crossing of river by general benito passed clean over thin line of cavalry drawn up to beat back mass of men obliterating man horse rolled upward towards hastily formed line of weary soldier brought round from front to protect rear succumbed in few minute gun no longer being able to do damage by reason of enemy being directly under muzzle reinforcement swarmed up slanting slope of sandhills with cry of victory benito heard cry at once guessed that troop from janjalla be carrying battery by storm hitherto have be holding five hundred cavalry two thousand infantry in reserve be now brought forward hurled on soldier of xuarez massed at foot of sandhills rebel looked in front saw mass threatening to overwhelm looked behind lo over brow of sandhills poured black crowd of men over whose head floated yellow standard of republic gun be silenced gunner bayoneted red flag of xuarez dragged from pole at top of hill xuarez surrounded by ring of officer waved sword for moment then wave of men passed over cry spread throughout host of rebel that be lost men at base of sandhills seeing wave of men rolling downward lost heart broke up into scattered mass on came army of benito between two force insurgent crumpled up like paper in direction fled like sheep be chased for mile by victorious republican benito merciful man strove to restrain zeal of soldier be in vain be drunken with victory sabred shot wretched fugitive without smoke hung heavily over field of battle when cleared away victorious troop of junta saw great standard of republic floating proudly in place lately occupied by battery of enemy don hypolito have disappeared army broken to piece be flying in direction from triumphant army massed round sandhills rose roar of joy made earth tremble wind have blown away smoke shook out

announced victory everyone in tlatonac be mad with joy dios be mad enough to night said jack smiling a looked down on crowd under circumstance think be excusable fall of acauhtzin last stronghold of

have utterly failed to fascinate peter smile insinuating remark have be quite thrown away on little doctor who showed disposition for matrimony scrupulously ignored languishing look of elderly admirer finally serafina gave up pursuit of medical male a bad job revenged indirectly on sex by being particularly sharp with eulalia dolores of whom be rarely permitted to be more than few minute with respective lover last blamed peter in measured term for thus depriving of society of future wife doctor absolutely refused to sacrifice longer on altar of friendship announced in conversation took place in patio of casa maraquando after ball must do anything for must explained plaintively to jack philip really can not go on paying attention to dona serafina think be in earnest so ought to be

special correspondent true for replied tim complacently occupation gone did send last article about 'the fall of acauhtzin ' from janjalla be war over war be certainly over said jack lighting cigarette danger of war be not yet past what do mean jack don hypolito still life while life republic be not safe still life echoed philip in surprise why jack see how can make out be not found on field of battle in janjalla in acauhtzin must be dead don hypolito be not man to die so easily where be know be certain be yet alive there be silence for few minute a be busy with own thought regarding probable resurrection of xuarez after battle of centeotl have vanished utterly from face of earth be thought have fled to janjalla perchance to acauhtzin in of town must be discovered after bombardment of five hour latter city have surrendered to warship don jose governor in absence of xuarez have be killed by bursting of bomb many of officer have shared same fate of xuarez however nothing must be discovered don miguel be much disturbed thereat with restless spirit like rebel leader still working in secret danger be not yet at end president be determined to spare effort to bring xuarez to justice while four friend be thinking over matter don rafael who have be holding private conversation with father entered patio that young man be hero of bombardment of acauhtzin have recovered dona carmencita father have consented to speedy marriage with lady be idolised by fellow citizen with good fortune must have be gay lighthearted a entered patio certainly looked anything happy dios what ail rafael asked jack a friend threw into seat sighed heavily anything wrong carambo everything be wrong father refuse consent to marriage what interrupted philip jack in dismay till xuarez be discovered punished finished rafael dismally ah said philip with breath of relief might have be worse thought be about to say don miguel have refused consent altogether dios know if doe not amount to replied rafael shrugging shoulder how be to find ladron of xuarez be not at acauhtzin be not in south where then be to look for can not find out can find out nothing mi amigo for part believe be dead for part senor rafael believe be alive retorted tim gruffly eh where do think be to be found senor corresponsal quien sabe said tim carelessly know senor after battle of centeotl rode to janjalla to wire report to england yes while there heard two prisoner talking deeming to be foreigner not knowing be conversant with spanish spoke freely bueno said nothing about don hypolito talked of pepe pepe echoed philip quickly zambo who decoyed dolores from tlatonac lover of marina same pepe appears have followed xuarez to janjalla being a know prince of spy when cortes be taken xuarez be thus cut off from getting back to acauhtzin pepe happened to be in janjalla troop of xuarez be wondering in case of defeat how must escape from hand of men pepe laughed on hearing doubt said must easily escape to totatzine to totatzine to sacred city said one must follow there that knew of secret way in south must take thither jack secret way came be to north of tlatonac said philip turning towards duval very true for long time have have suspicion that there be second way to city by canon road of told be by way to mind that pepe intended to go yes mi amigo said rafael triumphantly quite forget pepe be captured in south after battle of centeotl be now in prison at tlatonac awaiting punishment very true did not escape to totatzine a intended where be captured at battle of centeotl now seeing that don hypolito have disappeared be just possible that pepe told of second secret way to sacred city that xuarez may have escaped thence dios exclaimed rafael springing to foot think senor corresponsal that dog be now at totatzine be not sure might be so ixtlilxochitli be friend there must be safe if at battle of centeotl pepe told of southern way to city when saw that be lost probably took advantage of information why not find out if be so from pepe suggested jack when tim ceased speaking will tell nothing replied rafael in disgust zambo be mule for obstinacy might try at event said philip cheerfully where be pepe mi amigo in prison of palacio nacional if think senor there be chance of getting information from zambo let seek now why to night said peter looking at watch rather morning be two o'clock be weary with ball better wait till to morrow exclaimed rafael throwing heavy cloak over shoulder will go now father absolutely refuse to let of marry until discover xuarez want to know where be to be found at once otherwise will get rest a for senor will come by mean said philip putting on sombrero be also to interest to find xuarez else may not marry sister rafael will go said jack rising to foot tim may get copy make article of 'the confession of spy peter can go to bed a matter doe not interest in least oh doe said peter indignantly be a anxious a be to see married jack with permission will go to bed because think will get information out of pepe will try at event observed philip emphatically want to marry eulalia said juan following

slumber on special occasion did not wake at usual hour dancing of previous night have proved too much for virtuous peter who always went to bed early consequently be very tired by mean pleased at being awakened unexpectedly by jack peter be in middle of delightful dream in be hunting unusually large beetle after time however beetle began to hunt peter one having caught be shaking severely shaking woke up beetle changed to jack who be trying to pull peter out of bed what be matter grumbled peter vaguely struggling into sitting position want to get up must said jack serenely will start without start what where when beetle hunting peter be not awake what do mean by such delirious talk put on clothes come down to breakfast be waiting jack vanished peter wondering be matter got out of bed with manifest reluctance cold bath drove fume of sleep from head dressing rapidly repaired to dining room where found friend rafael making hasty meal peter stared began to ask question now what be oh here peter said philip looking up with smile come on sluggard have something to eat be going to cuavaca by train train repeated doctor taking seat what train jack train idiot said tim giving peter dig in rib wit be wandering think yours must be retorted peter addressing company collectively what be meaning of early rising be going to cuavaca never heard of then hear of now said jack crossly how stupid be peter will explain saw pepe zambo last night on condition that life be spared have promised to guide to city of totatzine by second secret way oh cuavaca cuavaca be town thirty mile inland railway line be laid down to place twenty mile beyond be taking thousand troop to cuavaca intend to leave there while pepe show canon road then will lead by way to totatzine save cocom take xuarez prisoner secure opal said peter argumentatively be end of railway near hidden city doe trackless forest lie between terminus canon road jack made diagram on tablecloth with knife plate look peter be tlatonac cuavaca go to latter place by rail from cuavaca railway be constructed twenty mile stop in middle of vast forest here according to pepe be totatzine sunken out of sight in hollow valley between end of railway totatzine be distance of twenty mile more le of tangled forest brushwood nothing of sort tell pepe have promised to show secret way other secret way entrance be from ruined city about mile to right of railway work find out that city take men from cuavaca to thence march up canon road to totatzine dios don juan exclaimed rafael who have be looking at jack table map seems to that if railway go on will pas by reveal hidden city not have there be chance of doing so must have have trouble with indian pulling up rail mi amigo line be surveyed long distance further on if turned to right might certainly hit totatzine a see trend to left if used for century must never reveal existence of sacred city ixtlilxochitli saw that did not mind railway passing so to speak by door city be too well hidden by encircling mountain by winding of canon to be discovered without special exploration seems to awfully stupid that priest must take so much trouble over one secret way never bother about other observation of philip seemed to strike jack reflected few moment before replied what say be very true philip replied slowly secret way leading to sea be very complicated even then priest always blindfold pilgrim on platform other road leading from ruined city must be blocked up by rubbish what not there be wall across entrance to canon be pierced by gate always open one come by narrow track so expect entrance to road have be choked up way fallen into disuse then how did pepe find out lord know secret must be alone else priest must have destroyed canon path leading to pierced wall so cut off communication entirely from side of town hope pepe be not leading into ambush said peter anxiously a arose to go if doe will cost life replied philip grimly pepe dear doctor march before with pistol at head first sign of treachery fall dead think will risk that catastrophe by time peter have concluded breakfast set out to puerta de la culebra near beyond wall be railway station on previous night pepe under promise of life being spared have admitted that don hypolito have fled northward overland to totatzine gaining city by inland secret way road pepe promised to reveal on condition that president spared life next morning rafael told father of offer a don miguel be anxious to capture xuarez readily assented to proposition of zambo of course six thousand indian who have be disbanded by influence of opal be not in sacred city village be far to north near acauhtzin a only came south to festival of opal by secret way of sea be unlikely that troop led by rafael jack must encounter resistance forest where railway ended where according to pepe canon road began be singularly devoid of population might have be caused by jealousy of priest lest wandering indian must find entrance to canon road from ruined city if so jealous suspicion caused ruin for have district be infested with indian seeing unusual concourse of soldier at cuavaca must at once have warned priest of intended invasion of totatzine then canon road must have be easily defended against troop from tlatonac by small body of defender disaster averted a be however inhabitant of sacred city be entirely ignorant of danger until foe be under wall railway line be completed a far a cuavaca little inland village promised to shortly develop into city owing to being future starting place whence line be to run north south throughout whole length of cholacaca from capital to terminus extended vast plain for over thirty mile so that there be difficulty in laying line have be speedily completed under vigorous superintendence of jack there be engineering difficulty to be overcome railway ran easily in straight line over plain to foot of volcano xicotencatl where cuavaca be situated from point began rugged mountainous country extended northward a far a acauhtzin twenty mile of railway have be constructed with great difficulty a owing to configuration of country line be singularly curving irregular bridge have to be built across canon tunnel have to be pierced through solid rock embankment faced with stone wall constructed where ground fell away rapidly to moderately sized plain district be situated in tierra templada about ten thousand foot above sea level grade constantly ascending a iron road went northward be calculated by jack that last portion of way must run short distance below snow line of tierra fria expedition to capture totatzine be not without danger be season of festival sacred city must doubtless be filled with fanatical worshipper who must fiercely resist attempted seizure of shrine thousand well armed infantry be sent to cuavaca by don miguel leaving quartered in village jack with three friend rafael guided by pepe went forward to search for secret entrance when be found intended to return take troop by railway twenty mile thence lead by secret entrance up canon road when be done reinforcement of thousand soldier be to arrive at cuavaca await instruction there lest first must fail to capture city engine running on line from cuavaca be singularly powerful machine strongly built so a to ascend gradient to northward there be plenty of truck in troop must be taken to end of railway jack also have few carriage shifted from cuavaca line to that running northward so that whole body of soldier now stationed at little town must be conveyed to hoped for entrance of canon road in remarkably short space of time by noon troop be quartered at cuavaca then jack started by northern line for canon road only took engine with one carriage so a to travel a rapidly a possible at first wanted to go forward with pepe philip must in way consent to doing ca trust zambo jack said decisively might take advantage of being alone knock on head scarcely when be armed be not if only two go can travel on engine if come must fix on carriage well wo make much difference retorted philip quickly be keen on business want to see how matter turn out tim peter rafael be coming with jack so hitch on carriage to engine right away be accordingly done without further objection on part of duval left cuavaca about one o'clock travelling rapidly so a to reach terminus with a little delay a possible according to pepe must take hour for to discover ruined city did not expect to return before six o'clock then must have to be decided whether must take troop on to ruined city at once wait till next day cuavaca be situate at base of great volcano xicotencatl reared white peak high above surrounding mountain north south stretched range from central point with summit more le covered with snow from cuavaca began dense forest clothed slope of mighty hill leaving village by side towards north engine with solitary carriage ran through moderately long tunnel piercing high range of hill shot outward at right angle from principal mountain from thence emerged on to deep valley skirted side of hill in winding track cut out of solid rock jack be on board engine with driver personally superintending journey three friend with rafael be admiring view from window of carriage pepe guarded by two soldier be seated at end of carriage looked anything cheerful under such surveillance scenery be truly wonderful sliding along side of mountain in carriage looking out saw not line on be running looked down eight nine hundred foot into depth below sometimes line be built of solid masonry clamped with iron be anything pleasant to think how train be clinging like fly to perpendicular side of giant hill below swirled rapid torrent raging over black rock flowing in broad stream between flat mud bank engine must proceed along level for distance then pant slowly up ascending gradient suddenly turning sharp curve must shoot breathlessly down decline on to long narrow bridge thrown across wide expanse of river bed intersected by thin stream at time of rain joined force into one vast flood owing to infinite winding of line be built on narrow gauge system so a to permit quick turning of curve when engine leaning to one side shot round turning sensation be anything pleasant be most wonderful line so far a engineering go said philip drawing back from window with sudden qualm a carriage rocked dangerously be devilishly unpleasant if went over there must be much of left said tim grimly begad philip have be in mighty lot of railway train line of jack beat banagher banagher beat devil santissima said rafael uneasily trust senor devil of engine will not fall over cliff 'd never travel on line for pleasure cried peter who be seated on opposite side to precipice for safety do think will be much patronised by people when opened sea for remarked philip thankfully anything being boxed up in place with chance of falling five six thousand foot without hope of getting out of carriage in truth journey be singularly unpleasant in many place jack have constructed line thoroughly well there be denying that sudden turn unexpected descent narrow bridge frequent tunnel be enough to shake nerve of strongest man on side arose snow clad peak far below ran river spread forest gaped canon between heaven earth crawled train holding on to side of mountain colour light sweeping over scenery be landscape below above be grand impressive four men in carriage felt somewhat nervous at tremendous journey in ordinary case be brave enough prepared for emergency boxed up in carriage felt helpless must accident occur a to jack be used to such travelling looked at work with great pride at engine shot from deep narrow cutting into depth of broad spreading forest clothing deep valley through centre ran torrent line skirted to left through dense woodland towards high peak of mountain in far distance midway in valley engine slowed down ultimately stopped philip looking out of window saw wide clearing with upturned soil fallen tree here there hut erected be terminus of railway thankful to have arrived in safety jumped out on to sward with alacrity beyond clearing appeared track cut through forest trending in direction of distant peak line stopped at beginning of avenue scattered rail pile of sleeper abrupt termination of line showed that went further between point unknown city of totatzine intervened distance of twenty mile little party with gun revolver in order stood looking around at unfinished line pepe guarded by two soldier be sullen watchful where be totatzine said rafael staring round wilderness of tree pepe pointed to north east beyond peak be there senor in hollow of hill buried city bueno will show to senor one moment pepe said jack staying zambo a turned off to left how can tell way to city from here dios senor americano escaped from totatzine to place four month ago be sent by don hypolito before war to priest ixtlilxochitli detained in city must not find secret way to sea one night went out through wall on to canon road led many mile along side of cliff then down staircase into forest at length senor took through tunnel have to climb over rubbish of stone earth up staircase found in large city of ruin leaving that pushed through forest to left came upon clearing where found men of senor americano at work took to tlatonac there remained till went to acauhtzin with marina a senor know did tell men of discovery of way asked jack abruptly senor americano feared vengeance of priest be railway at point four month ago jack asked philip looking round at clearing yes there be possibility of war be just going to england to get to come here work be left in condition now see if zambo escaped a say must easily have reached tlatonac from point bueno said rafael in satisfied tone thus far story be true let go forward amigo jack made sign to pepe who at once proceeded to walk towards wood on left guarded by two soldier escort be well armed so zambo did not try to escape knowing that before must run few yard must have bullet in skull rest of party followed keeping revolver handy in case of possible surprise from indian saw none however a forest be completely deserted by humanity pepe pushed forward through brushwood followed in case must lose way blazed tree with hatchet with have taken care to provide jack be resolved not to trust zambo too far for about mile proceeded through comparatively well defined track in north western direction then suddenly turned so a to face distant peak fifteen mile away new path gradually broadened out into wide avenue at end of three mile building ruin of wall began to make appearance in scattered fashion at length at conclusion of mile entered paved road adorned on side by statue of aztec deity similar to on platform facing sea can not believe that city be unknown said jack to philip a marched on abreast behind pepe guard why not one must suspect existence from railway clearing be true occasionally there must be tribe of indian about here must be sure to hit upon between clearing beginning of broad road be four mile track seemed pretty well defined clear enough at event to guide anyone hither once in avenue be easy to strike city a now have emerged suddenly into vast space built over with mansion palace temple mighty wall pyramid of earth surmounted by ruined teocalli be placed in centre of city wide street shot off from omphalos in similar way to of totatzine in fact on exploring city thoroughly jack came to conclusion that who have built totatzine have also constructed place plan be precisely same judging from massive building carven facade of wall broad terrace enormous flight of step must have be populous place of importance judging from what see think must be royal city said philip looking awestruck at colossal work of dead here perchance king have seat secret way be constructed from place to sacred city of totatzine where god huitzilopochtli have shrine at event have doubt that city be well known to indian of present day replied jack decisively though doubtless entrance to canon road choked up by rubbish have escaped notice did know of existence ixtlilxochitli must have closed up narrow track leading round precipice into interior wall be now between four five o'clock so have not much time to lose if desired to find entrance before sunset engine in charge of driver have be left in clearing jack judging must be quite safe there a indian seemed to be in vicinity have brought provision with if be necessary must camp out in clearing till dawn when must go back to cuavaca to bring troop pepe marched forward into central square then led towards extreme end of city here surprise awaited for found that town be built against vast cliff eighty ninety foot in height lengthy temple reached by flight of step be cut out of solid rock with range of pillar massive in design architecture wonderful cried philip in amazement a surveyed cyclopean ruin temple be like of petra what great men must have be who built such shrine great civilisation once flourished here jack without doubt said tim who be much impressed by grand remains toltec call be greater than aztec cortes to mind found vastly inferior civilisation than have be when city be built carajo senor corresponsal cried rafael overhearing remark have nothing like in tlatonac be likely to have said peter dryly toltec be greater builder than spaniard guided by pepe entered into rock hewn temple found in vast hall at back of shrine now unoccupied by idol appeared ruined archway choked up with rubbish explorer have taken precaution of bringing torch with knowing there be tunnel to be gone through from entrance a pepe informed be fifteen mile to hidden city of totatzine lighting torch climbed over rubbish fallen stone heaped in front of archway began to ascend immense staircase jack philip went first of followed by pepe guard after whom came three remaining member of party up staircase ascended at length emerging into light of day found on vast plateau thickly covered with forest well paved road still gently ascending stretched through wood into infinite distance be overgrown with brushwood giant tree still found difficulty in getting along owing to admirable way in stone block have be laid road ran for five mile then suddenly disappeared down willow flight of step under low archway here pepe stopped pointed downward step senor americano said addressing jack lead down for quarter of mile then along tunnel for three quarter of mile brings out on to bed of torrent flowing through canon narrow path lead from mouth for nine mile to pierced wall when there be just below wall of totatzine jack friend held consultation a to wisdom of proceeding further night darkness be coming on must be a well to get back to clearing before night there must camp out return to cuavaca for troop at dawn for part said philip quietly think need explore further on own account pepe have spoken truly up to present without doubt tunnel lead to torrent of canon narrow path a describes let return to clearing go back to cuavaca bring on troop can camp in ruined city to morrow night next morning can march to totatzine rest of party agreed to plan leaving willow tunnel at foot of protecting range of totatzine mountain returned to camp now that have shown way pepe wanted to be set free whole party unanimously refused to do friend said rafael making mouthpiece of others may warn indian be coming till totatzine be taken by troop be prisoner pepe be forced to abide by decision composed to sleep in clearing watched vigilantly by guard who knowing that escape might bring savage on kept keen eye on slumber to morrow said jack a turned in will return to cuavaca for troop before nightfall will camp in ruined city chapter xi destiny of opal spirit of fire sylph of air gnome of earth dangerous wave dwelling fay madly desire opal stone rare at birth gifted with rainbow hue gay earth gnome caressed sylph did enfold wave nymph doth chain in spite of flame spirit desire two have possessed now doth one hold yet will gain terrible spirit of fire there be many indian in cuavaca have entertained suspicion that there be second secret way to sacred city by canon road must have at once warned ixtlilxochitli of impending danger to chalchuih tlatonac a be however must not conceive reason of troop leaving cuavaca for interior of country from wandering in district knew perfectly well that line stopped suddenly in midst of dense forest there appeared to be reason that soldier must be sent thither generally received opinion among be that a indian of north have be on war trail soldier be sent up by government to punish such rebellion with idea peon of cuavaca took heed of expedition knowing that must be impossible for civilised troop to discover brother in vast forest among rugged mountain thus when next day at explorer returned to lead soldier to buried city none of indian suspected truth indeed troop be in absolute ignorance a to destination a rafael thinking indian of cuavaca might learn too much ordered soldier to blindly obey order not question a to where be going thus hoped to camp thousand men night within street of ruined city surprise totatzine by dawn when priest populace must be engaged in worshipping opal wall towards canon must be quite undefended a never within memory of priest have anyone come into city from direction ixtlilxochitli thought that way be quite blocked up never for moment deemed that bitterest foe must capture city from canon road day train went back forward between cuavaca clearing taking troop into interior of country so soon a arrived at railway terminus be marched off through wood to buried city there ordered to camp for night at least till such time a leader chose to guide forward by sunset thousand well armed well disciplined troop be bestowed in ruined city of toltec within fifteen mile of opal shrine yet not soul save leader knew that be case troop having be brought thus far rafael a leader of expedition held council of war a to advisability of remaining there for night pushing on to narrow path of canon so a to surprise inhabitant of totatzine by dawn jack tim be strongly in favour of marching at once a philip afterwards came round to opinion rafael almost made up mind to move forward without delay from here to canon torrent be mostly tunnel urged jack persuasively so whether go by day night doe not matter a must carry torch can easily march along road on plateau between two tunnel when enter last one can arrive at bed of torrent about midnight let camp there with a many men a possible then march along narrow path at first glimpse of daylight thus will be able to assemble on platform under pierced wall while populace priest be in great square of teocalli will be unprepared can capture city without almost blow will be equally unprepared during day said rafael with hesitation so why not wait here till dawn will not be unprepared during day replied jack decisively that pierced wall have people on occasionally sometimes come out on to platform overlooking torrent if saw soldier coming two abreast along narrow path must give alarm defender of city must kill advance guard block up road now if can get five six hundred on to platform by sunrise can keep populace at bay until rest of men arrive then city will be easily taken only two men can walk abreast on path asked philip dubiously a matter of fact three can walk abreast be safer with two path be cut out of side of canon be very dangerous must be attempted by daylight nine mile of narrow path in dark must end in losing men besides who know what that infernal ixtlilxochitli to make thing quite safe may not have destroyed portion of path if be done that there wo be much chance of taking city said tim in disgust true senor corresponsal replied rafael gravely thing considering think will be best to take don juan advice march two three hundred men to torrent camping ground to night plan being adopted council broke up at once be decided that jack rafael must push on with three hundred men guided by pepe be to camp at entrance of tunnel where led to narrow path by torrent at dawn remaining seven hundred men under
