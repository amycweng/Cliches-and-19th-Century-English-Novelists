business took parcel home at gate of arabian night met father mr hill be a gay a airy a ever wore usual brown velvet coat white trouser also have on large straw hat rose bloomed in buttonhole saluted son in off hand manner have be walking allen said lightly to get inspiration for poem on fall of jerusalem think italian poet have written on subject sir not a must be written allen however ca waste

hill lifted lid there be two dry stick tied in form of cross with piece of grass allen looked at only for moment father have turned white after moment quietly fainted away young man looked down with haggard face be right after asked chapter x mr hill explains hour later allen be conversing with mother mr hill carried into house by allen have be revived steadfastly refused to speak a to cause of fainting put down to heat of weather to having taken too long walk excuse be so feeble that son must not help lip curling at manifest untruth hill saw told allen must lie down for hour so when rise may tell something said feebly think may a well understand one said allen coldly bring in here thing came in parcel said only one thing came replied son rough cross yes yes know bring in paper box where did get allen explained how jane wasp received from cain at colchester mr hill listened attentively understand now said at length put thing in study will see later say in two hour young man wondering what meant departed left father to take on face of much needed sleep went outside picked up cross box paper still remained on grassy bank near gate brought into study examined nothing be revealed to intelligence box be ordinary cardboard one did not recognise ill formed writing cross be simply two stick tied together by wisp of dry grass why content of box must have terrified father allen must not say that sight of symbol did terrify be well assured since mr hill be not man given to fainting box came from one who knew mr hill well a name lawrence be on be father second name rarely used mr hill usually called harold suppressed lawrence allen have seen middle name inscribed in old book have be given by strode to hill in college day coincidence made allen wonder if sending of cross use of rarely used name have anything to do with murder while thus thought with face growing darker darker door opened mr hill entered have be working in own room knew nothing of affair instinct made aware that allen be in house never failed to be with when be at home indeed be hardly able to bear out of sight seized opportunity to be in presence with love be strange that mr hill must be content that allen must remain in south america for so long pay only flying visit to paternal roof be back allen said softly came forward to lay hand on wrinkled forehead dear boy why frown have eva be unkind oh said allen taking mother hand kissing will not marry yet foolish girl what doe intend to do stop with mr merry suppose be dull life for far better if came to even if will not marry at once have accepted position of companion to mr palmer indeed said mr hill looking surprised must have thought pride must have prevented placing under obligation allen shrugged shoulder there be obligation said eva be to be paid salary besides like mr palmer so do be not lady said mr hill pursing up lip nevertheless have kind heart will make eva very happy think mother be best can be done eva doe want to come here will not marry until murderer of father be discovered why wo come to asked mr hill sharply allen looked down doe like father said very rude of to tell that know poor harold be not popular be whimsical said allen somehow eva ca get on with be not rude mother simply stated fact like father well enough to meet occasionally must not care to live with if come to added allen frowning more must be too eccentric for mother must think for mother be fond of father in own way said mr hill looking down speaking in low voice a though made effort to confess a much doe eva expect to find out who murdered mr strode yes refuse to marry until assassin be found punished a be bent on searching for man offered to search for mr hill frowned why did do that asked sharply strode be nothing to have to return to america far better find that capitalist want than waste time in avenging death of man seem to like mr strode mother hate said woman harshly clenching fist have cause to hate have father cause also asked allen pointedly looked away know answered gloomily strode father be very intimate life till married then saw very little of be not good man strode mean allen if word have weight with stop search young man rose began to pace library mother must take up search said in agitated voice for father sake one must search for assassin what do mean by questioned mr hill sitting very upright frowning darker than ever allen replied by asking question who know that father be called lawrence mother mr hill uttered ejaculation of surprise grew pale who told be called so found name in old book of cowper poem given by mr strode to father in college day be presented to harold lawrence hill remember book said mr hill recovering composure what be odd about father having two name certainly have dropped lawrence call simply harold hill be for sake of convenience only who knew in young day must know name of lawrence ah said allen thoughtfully turning over brown paper then be sent by one who knew in young day mr hill looked at brown paper covering at box at roughly formed cross what be asked carelessly be what must like to know said son at least must like to know why sight of cross made father faint mr hill gasped laid hand on heart a though felt sudden pain did faint asked did lawrence faint young man noticed slip usually mother called father mr hill harold never till moment have heard call lawrence apparently memory of old event be working in breast seemed genuinely perplexed a to reason of hill behaviour at sight of cross where did faint outside gate said allen quickly explained how have received parcel from jane wasp circumstance of delivery ending with query why did faint ca say said mr hill pushing back cross box pettishly there be reason so far a know will ask father when awakens said must explain said allen sadly between mother must have explanation father wo like use of word allen ca help said young man doggedly went to door of library opened looked out then closed again mother saw with surprise be still more surprised when allen spoke again do know mother why say must undertake investigation said mr hill calmly know be because wish to save father good name be in danger asked woman turning pale again might be if one knew met mr strode at red deep on night of murder mr hill leaped to foot clutched son arm allen gasped ashen colour of face alarmed how dare say that be not possible can not can not be possible said allen firmly sit down mother let explain held tongue a long a must now father must have explanation fact of fainting at sight of cross make suspicious fact that eva want to investigate case make afraid of what may come out have cross anything to do with affair heaven whose symbol be only know said young man gloomily mother be moving in darkness dread to come into light if undertake search may be able to save father from what from from allen nodded sank voice may even come to listen mother will tell know on night went to red deep to prove falsity of eva dream found only too true never got to red deep said mr hill looking steadily into son face sprained ankle so did be after knew truth what truth eva dream be

gloved right hand wooden hand moaned mr hill rocking oh heaven yes whiteness of glove caught eye from what eva have told have need to guess who be dead man wooden hand explained corpse be that of strode shot through heart there be slight flesh wound on arm remember said mr hill know did not notice that at time said allen quickly at first mother intended to give alarm be hurrying back to

from south america kept in portmanteau since weapon be not needed in england one day took out to shoot bird left in library never thought about again must have put away next sight got of be in red deep thought that father took to shoot strode out mr hill ca be certain of that ca be certain lawrence again used unaccustomed name lawrence must never commit murder so good so kind allen looked surprised never expected mother to stand up for father in way hill so far a son have seen be not kind to one certainly be not good why mr hill who seemed to have particular affection for must defend in way puzzled young man saw effect speech have produced beckoned allen to sit down must know said must know how came to marry father then will know why speak a do allen laid trembling hand on shoulder never thought be fond of father allen looked embarrassed well mother thought tolerated have strength to rule house whole county if chose to exert let father indulge in whim fancy allow to

let alone son love father never did drew up respect young man looked aghast see how one can respect said heaven only know must like to be proud of father with eccentricity cover good heart well mother

fond of one to extent said mr hill drily mother doe not always love girl who be likely to take son away allen love eva so much for own sake a because be daughter of robert strode thought disliked said be not good man be allen be worst of men loved same must have married for trouble came have never told one what be about to tell must know believe father killed strode must do best to keep out of investigation with father sensitive nature must go mad if be accused of such crime revolver being found in can be explained said mr hill imperiously will ask harold went back to old name being calmer will ask to explain be innocent be whimsical strange must not kill fly be too good hearted allen wondered more more that mother must be so blind be waiting to hear said resignedly will not repeat what say to eva to one mother great heaven do think must if took after father poor babbling soul must ah allen kissed hand be own son know how to hold tongue come mother tell then interrupt till end then can make comment allen settled began to speak slowly parent died when be young girl like eva strode be left without penny be taken into house of lord ipsen a nursery governess what eva mother did not teach a be own age taught younger brother who afterwards died promised not to interrupt allen well be comparatively happy there lady ipsen did not like got on badly there be large house party at

wait listen loved mr strode a be favoured by lady jane saw there be chance for father then have not come in for money father ambitious rich be anxious that must make aristocratic match be why asked lady jane to be wife refused a loved robert strode felt very miserable allen a father be miserable also used to console be much appreciated for talent in house a be great friend of mr strode lack of birth be overlooked not that think lord ipsen must have allowed to marry lady jane never guessed that harold lifted eye so high well thing be in position when necklace be lost yes necklace belonging to lady ipsen family heirloom valued at ten thousand pound be taken out of safe mr hill dropped eye added in low voice be accused allen must hardly believe ear rose filled with indignation do mean to

deserted alone must have died for lawrence came did not love respect for having saved broken hearted woman from doom worse than death allen allen can ever repay father for noble act can wonder that tolerate whim that let do what like saved surrendered for did act well admitted allen puzzled to think that whimsical frivolous father must act so nobly made happy mother there be something to be said on side nothing nothing cried mr hill with martyr instinct of noble woman gave up for father relented after time inherited fortune for year almost starved together married when be under cloud can never repay never never tell allen said facing with clenched fist if thought that committed crime must take blame on rather than let suffer saved will not save be person who stole necklace ever discovered necklace vanished have never be found to day met lady jane strode when came here did not believe to be guilty be good friend so see allen be small wonder let father do what like why must cross desire of man who behaved so nobly sometimes do interfere a know for at time harold need guidance only rarely well mother understand now can say nothing a to how revolver came to red deep father

when in possession of fact parkins thought for moment delivered opinion strode take be followed to red deep by jerry train jerry shot stole pocket book wooden hand merry got be in gang hold on said parkins will not give straight opinion till see boy will go down hunt up will give show away father asked allen downcast be crank believe mixed up in biznai at chapter xviii finding of butsey did not
