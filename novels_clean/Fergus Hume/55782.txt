let sleeping dog be going abroad shortly be not likely that will see for many month never again will come to house only hope that will impress upon ruth necessity of forgetting a speedily a possible can not trust to see again so must leave task to poor lad sighed mr ca a finished letter be bitter for that must have to suffer for sin of parent wonder why have stopped short in endeavour to prove mr jenner innocence what can have said to have good mind to see added a after thought then changed mind must only revive sad memory matter be settled by letter be best to let sleeping dog lie will think more of so said so did not do conscience frequently took pleasure in reminding of whole story despite philosophical resolve to let sleeping dog knew very well that ought to rouse must not bring to do too much be at stake bolder man than mr ca must have shrank from consequence in frame of mind did best to argue that be right failed in attempt meanwhile geoffrey be in town have learnt from ruth that neil occupied room in waverley hotel in cherry square quiet unpretentious establishment three time heron called at hotel only to be told that mr webster be out of town fourth time be more lucky found young man at home neil webster looked extremely ill dark circle under eye told of sleepless night restless movement hinted at nervous system have gone to piece moreover lip be dry eye feverishly

happen to be rival need not have bad opinion of other be very good neil said faintly be sarcastic there be need assure remark made webster laugh why do laugh asked other sharply be wondering whether must make friend of thought of relative position with miss ca made scout possibility can never be friend why not like very well see why must be so bitter to be not bitter in fact must be friend think if be not for miss ca be ready to be friend in case said heron quickly think mean brute to hate man because be more lucky than lucky sighed neil sitting up heaven help if be not luckier man than well

felt that truly honest man in place must hold to promise so neil braced up to make sacrifice spoke out with decision engagement to miss ca be at end said will never be wife be probable that will ever see again be free to marry indeed hope will here voice quivered wish joy well heron said thoughtfully ca deny be glad to hear for ruth ca be world more to at same time time be sorry for can see that feel very deeply be of own free will that do eyed webster curiously in one way be in be not few week ago have right to marry now have none can help heron asked impossible man be so shaken ill geoffrey

enough be right heron said brightly know feel bad have behaved like briton than geoffrey thought there must not be higher praise if can help in way will have idea know that will be friend after have made good start anyhow said neil good bye when geoffrey have gone unhappy man buried face in sofa cushion wept bitterly have crushed down feeling throughout interview now nature must have way oh heaven wailed will ever know peace again chapter x great secret be small wonder neil have decided to give ruth up for first time saw what be miserable creature who in marrying must be committing deadly sin be not to be thought of thanked heaven that have command sufficient to put temptation away from renunciation of be to least of sorrow found comfort in visit of geoffrey heron who came almost day sat long with unfortunate man although must not in least understand suffering strove to talk of general subject must draw mind away from one on be brooding in main succeeded though when have gone neil always relapsed into torture of thought whence have be drawn for moment during visit neil observed visitor closely very soon came to conclusion that be right good fellow with vastly more heart than general mass of humanity once twice found on point of confiding in asking advice feeling of dread withheld liked heron enjoyed company be afraid of losing so tried to put aside insisted that be not a ill a looked crisis came one evening when geoffrey be with neil have be very ill day when young squire entered shortly after eight o'clock found lying on sofa almost in fainting condition geoffrey be alarmed tell what old chap must see doctor said neil shook head doctor can do good drug can not cure what be macbeth say 'thou canst not minister to mind diseased mind be not diseased how do know that clenched hand have not told secret want to know want to know why gave miss ca up for then must have to tell must get out of in way know what woman be know what one woman be at least be mother murmured neil must not tell ruth must do good might do much harm then speak of something else be exciting unnecessarily even a spoke nerve storm came on with unusual violence wretched man seemed possessed by seven demon tore in piece rose from seat strode furiously about room trying to prevent from cry out finally dropped exhausted into chair sobbed violently geoffrey heron quite astonished at outburst hastily got glass of water in seizing webster broke with strength of grasp must tell must panted must tell someone die mother be in prison on charge of murder be accused of killing killing say father fell back weeping trembling completely crushed good heaven cried heron stepping back pity for poor young fellow be sincere now felt must understand in degree what torture life have be to must understand moreover why neil have surrendered all claim to hand of ruth wo tell on honour wo said geoffrey wish have not told now that do know secret be at rate safe with valerian said neil nodding towards sideboard while heron got loosened collar drenched with cold water then mixed stiff dose of drug drank with sigh of relief heron looked at anxiously have better go now have said must go to bed to morrow morning will be right soon valerian will soothe have told so much that must tell must have said nothing about for nervous fit came over just now sit down accordingly geoffrey waited lighting cigar while now that information have be imparted to almost against webster will be anxious to hear whole story determined that ruth at least must never know try a might must never get out of made up mind too that must be friend to unfortunate creature who be so cruelly afflicted not only that must give what advice aid lay in power to ameliorate situation doubted whether position must be amended neil thanked by look returned to sofa in quieter frame of mind fury of attack have left weak faint insisted on speaking a did so strength gradually came back to geoffrey sudden recuperation seemed little short of miraculous for be quite unaware of power of nerve to recover have better begin by asking few question began be sure be strong enough will be right directly truth have to be told now moreover want advice will do anything in power heron said be good fellow how have misunderstood well will repay by giving up ruth to will never marry indeed anyone heaven help why not geoffrey asked have seen what be what sort of husband father must make be beside point hear have to tell advise what to do in first place do know turnpike house great heaven be talking about murder yes daresay remember remember must think so why nothing be talked about at westham for month crime man be found in house stabbed to heart wife be accused of murder be taken with child while trying to escape yes be calm reply father be murdered man mother be woman accused of crime child then name be jenner yes name to be proud of be not have not courage to take ugh shuddered think if be known how must appear in public people must come not to hear play to see man who have be connected with mysterious crime whose mother be suffering punishment for crime must kill if be known there will be no need to kill be absolutely safe with if ruth must ask ruth will never hear from when said just now that might cajole be thinking of trivial thing terrible story will remain secret for ever can speak to a must to confessor there be thing webster man doe not do be one of be glad have told be glad know sighed neil will ease mind to tell now listen recounted circumstance dream cause have led up to identification a son of accused woman geoffrey be more startled than ever especially when mr ca name be mentioned doe know asked then in reply to neil nod added wonder must not let marry daughter wonder said young man bitterly touch pitch defile be not who stopped marriage be must rather die than marry see what be mass of nerve think of terrible history of parent then imagine asking woman to share misery well now that know what do say heron looked rather helplessly at what can say remarked hesitatingly seems that mother murdered father under great provocation be now in prison well think must be best for to put matter out of head go abroad be not slightest use seeing have already done so neil said quietly geoffrey started from seat visited in prison asked yes learnt where be from mr ca went to see at once for loved mother a much a hated father poor mother hair be white now fact lined be mad with joy at first on seeing then very angry why be angry ah be strangest part of whole affair be now going to tell something that one else know not even mr ca fire ahead when went to prison neil continued did not believe that mother be guilty ca have told be did not agree with only from own lip must learn truth to prison went in order to learn saw governor asked to see mr jenner did not give real name merely said be distant relative of hers wanted interview well saw alone be allowed to do thought that woman warder must be present well one be stayed outside door where must hear little if anything be practically alone did recognise at once ah heron know what mother love be yes knew for be very image of what be in youth have fair hair blue eye not good look knew must only half admit why be well for one reason because warder be outside did not wish relationship known be that feared to give way altogether if once said be son so time addressed a mr webster talked of son to must be woman of wonderful self command said geoffrey now thoroughly interested woman in thousand a will admit before have done ah what mother be there ever noble creature well addressing always a have said said that son have be taken away to be brought up by mr ca in ignorance of parentage that have be done at own special request did not want son ever to know of existence of history did wish ever to see be dead to desired that must regard a dead also painful position for heaven know how painful be sitting up now speaking rapidly fell into humour for eye warned to do besides stood aloof refused to respond to feeling accepted situation told that son be violinist famous be afraid talked great deal too much about in boastful vein too will understand heron wanted to give joy must wanted to prove to that sacrifice have not be in vain sacrifice what on earth do mean by ah now come most painful part of story asked if be truly guilty refused to answer knew in heart that be innocent saw look in eye asked how own son must dare to doubt innocence not word did say what did say told still in character of relative did not believe killed jenner for by name spoke of declared that intended to devote life to proving innocence be about to re open case what happened then asked geoffrey seeing from growing agitation of young man that be coming to crisis of painful tale became angry be violently moved after glancing at door abandoned attitude have taken up of treating a stranger forbade to re open case commanded to leave thing a be refused swore must set free in low voice implored to let matter rest again refused in spite of that must say held to purpose by time a will understand have abandoned mask at last clapped hand said that there be help for help for what be about to tell caught by hand bent forward to speak in whisper be very word 'hing suffer for sake ' great heaven do mean to say that hinted that be who killed did more than hint said that did told that on night have gone away to get money for father that while be in part of house heard cry came back to room to find there standing beside dead body of father knife still in hand be certain that have done for earlier in evening have rushed at with same knife seeing that hatred for be in part work determined to save rushed away into night mist with in arm be taken accused of crime for sake held tongue suffered one know not even mr ca to whom gave that might be brought up by good man told in low hurried voice then bade leave matter a be curse must be upon promised to hing made promise then left since then oh what life mine have be flung on sofa to bury face in cushion heron pitied sincerely be sure that be true asked for seems to that if have really be guilty of killing father must have remembered something about think so be subject to trance on night agitated a be by sight of father fell into one must have done thing a in dream then passed at once into fever robbed of memory until be revived by dream can remember childhood now certainly remember nothing about murder last memory be that of rushing at father with knife with afterwards killed must be true yes be criminal nonsense boy of ten mad for time being be not criminal one must say so if mother have be wise must have told truth so a to save preferred to save if have explained who must have believed one must simply have be accused of trying to prove guilty in order to hide own sin now that know want to have advice how be to act leave thing a be geoffrey said promptly mother be innocent know if what say be true believe neil cried really believe ah will anyone else to confess seems trifle far fetched even if came forward accused whole story rest on evidence will not be believed webster leave matter a stand stick to name be known by mother wish since have done so much for be only right must obey know what to do neil clasped hand will remain silent take advice remain silent heron replied meant what said remember added that be always friend friend chapter xi ruth diplomacy might have be neil webster intention a to saving mother by proving guilty be frustrated by severe illness body must no longer bear strain of constant worry mental torture be seized with attack of brain fever then be that heron proved indeed friend attended to sick man procured for very best advice brother must have done more for poor fellow than did geoffrey putting entirely aside desire to be near ruth to prosecute courtship devoted to restoring neil to health furthermore at friend special request in early stage of illness geoffrey took measure to prevent mr ca hearing of precarious state in lay for neil considered that merchant have done quite enough for did not wish to give more trouble so geoffrey informed mr ca that young violinist have gone abroad for rest by advice of doctor then have removed to bognor placed under charge of mr jent impressing upon necessity for secrecy thus came about for nearly two month lay ill in bed at bognor without suspicion being aroused in mr ca mind to ruth young heron wrote explained that neil have given up that refused to say why have done so added that be going to paris for month so that if wanted back must return at end of time having thus sacrificed on shrine of friendship went down to watch neil through dangerous illness for be quite determined that must not die if human mean must save so with mr jent nursed friend with greatest tenderness friendly act performed visited mr jenner learned from particular of case at first sternly refused to tell anything when informed that son be ill that only chance of recovery be little embroidery of own lay in hope of innocence being established gave way have already succeeded in impressing upon fact that neil must not have killed father notwithstanding appearance to contrary from what say mr jenner remarked husband be strong man neil must still call be puny child be impossible that must have struck blow at best strength must not have be equal to jenner must have brushed aside a easily a must fly be true said woman thoughtfully found with knife in hand standing beside body might have entered room picked up knife if be go begin to see thing from point of view who killed husband can swear did not if child be innocent who be guilty be just what must find out to release from unjust imprisonment to set mind at rest now tell whole story especially event of night then may be in position to account for crime cheered somewhat by view took mr jenner told knew with full detail two point struck mr heron one that window have be open mr jenner have left husband standing near other that have have in possession red pocket book have afterwards disappeared beyond gathered that account of boast husband have made on night that have have somebody in power somebody from whom intended to extort money quite believe be true finished unhappy woman bitterly have instinct of blackmailer well said geoffrey preparing to take departure think motive for crime will be found in pocket book whoever took murdered husband window be open book a say on table near window husband be standing also added with emphasis say knife be lying beside pocket book now if son have used must have have to pas father to get so must have put on guard even if have not be prevented from taking mr jenner son be innocent a innocent a assassin seized that knife through open window struck blow in order to get possession of pocket book contained of be sure document must have be used a lever to extort money be theory will make business to prove that be right one meanwhile must nurse neil be good man said mr jenner shewing emotion for first time what say seems feasible enough go do best can heaven will reward son darling boy may die not if can help will pull round somehow keep up spirit have have long night believe dawn be at hand heaven bless said then geoffrey took leave to return to bedside of neil webster while be taking place ruth have not be idle have be annoyed by heron letter much alarmed at determination to stay away be beginning to find out that feeling for be stronger than anything young violinist have inspired in streak of obstinacy inherited from spanish grandmother kept in manner true to man for whom cared least besides be possessed of more than share of feminine curiosity never faltered in determination to learn real cause of webster mysterious departure be well aware that love for be not genuine that have be founded a jennie have very truly told on admiration for artist not on love for man be equally certain that must never marry same be resolved to learn secret for many weary week plotted for achievement of end a far a knew neil geoffrey be abroad so have fair field after much thought concluded that best plan be to make attempt through mr jent who have be nurse who have always retained affection almost motherly for old woman be trustful soul easy enough to manage by exercise of little diplomacy ruth plan be to act a have done with father to assume that knew more than must admit in way taking into account simplicity of mr jent be likely that old woman must let something slip must put on track ruth considered that if have succeeded with man like father must certainly have difficulty with person of mr jent calibre so made up mind a to best course of action to see mr jent without arousing suspicion be necessary that must go down to bognor without father knowledge must think odd that must at juncture wish to see one who be so closely connected with former lover to avert suspicion girl wrote to old schoolfellow at brighton asking for invitation be tired of dull country life wrote miss ca must be so glad of little amusement do ask down for week so mr prosser fell into trap seemed natural enough to that ruth must want little gaiety be glad to have pretty girl in house presence of beauty must attract good many men being not averse to occasional flirtation mr prosser judged that must share in pleasure to be derived from visit so desired invitation be promptly despatched mr ca quite unsuspicious permitted daughter acceptance of perhaps will put nonsense about webster out of head said a bade good bye to remark received answer for quite week ruth enjoyed thoroughly mr prosser house be bright one entertained great deal more especially now that have such charming friend to amuse to amuse that young lady made amends for neil desertion of for geoffrey absence by flirting to heart content consigning many youth to various stage of despair at what be pleased to call fickleness never lost sight of main object be to drop down on mr jent without giving that old lady warning of coming must take entirely by surprise accordingly on plea that be going to see old nurse ruth took train to bognor mr jent welcomed visitor with open arm indeed not having be warned did conceal fact that mr webster be ill in house that geoffrey be nursing dear how pleased be to see cried settling spectacle on nose young lady too how good of lovey not to forget old nurse a if ever must ruth said graciously tell what be doing with just living dear just living what with boarder two money dear papa allows rub along have boarder now asked girl more for sake of saying something than because felt interest in subject well not what must call boarder perhaps said old lady rubbing one withered hand over other at least one of be be dear boy neil neil with unbounded astonishment neil webster why be abroad such thing be here lovey have be for two month abroad why poor darling have be at death door aye must have entered too if mr heron have not heron geoffrey heron yes dear be heaven bless do geoffrey heron here interrupted girl rather to herself than to old woman why wrote to tell that be on continent what doe mean wonder be not hard to tell meaning said mr jent boy neil fell ill have brain fever poor lad mr heron brought here from london might nurse stayed with be almost a fond of dear boy a be be said ruth blankly considering that two men be have be rival for hand must not quite take in of course be said old woman with great energy better gentleman never wish to see be mr webster here in next room in most beautiful sleep daresay must like to see dear for have often talked of dare wake must be dangerous mr heron have gone to worthing will wait till come back might replied ruth thinking that must like to prove to heron that be fool have also spoken of often often dear why love have told so dozen time girl stuck pretty chin in air looked supercilious well be nothing to said crossly like deceitful people oh now defend added seeing that mr jent be about to deliver of indignant speech know more than do a to mr webster well be good enough to say that cared for too know have often spoken of to have got over fancy oh indeed cried ruth more angry than ever call love for fancy doe just like man then suddenly recollected errand resolved to make best use of time before geoffrey must come back interfere poor mr webster doubt be grieving for parent old lady started what do know of asked sternly that must tell be reply be engaged to told about people how foolish of mr jent said under breath hope think le of dear after be not responsible for wickedness of father mother ruth nearly jumped out of seat so neil father mother have be what old woman called wicked people moreover be suffering for what have done in not being allowed to marry be way put said nothing mr jent went on talking in firm belief that listener knew fact of case of course be long time before knew anything about parent mr ca must tell know last christmas when be staying with dear found out be at christmas that told about put in ruth did not add that be of american parent have spoken indeed must not make out whether mr jent be alluding to to other person of whom knew nothing felt confused ah well went on old lady with sigh suppose discovery be too much for have to tell someone why not dear laid withered hand on girl arm if have loved must never have told about nasty turnpike house murder did tell name be jenner dear said girl faintly knew truth now only that parent ca speak of be terrible old lady shook head to think of mother having murdered husband being in gaol never told that shrieked ruth for must play part no longer oh great heaven what horrible thing wonder father must not let marriage take place marriage stammered mr jent rising with expression of alarm on face yes be engaged to suddenly gave up father said must never allow to marry must not make out reason now know oh how horrible be then did not know truth neil told about american parent be story made up to keep quiet put in old woman yes mr ca thought best must not know found out truth for now have told to be glad have said ruth taking hand dear nurse have behaved so badly wanted to find out why neil have given up a father must not tell came to have be punished for curiosity still be glad be glad must give up now indeed miss said mr jent bristling with indignation think ought to stand by poor boy more than ever oh miss how must play such trick do hope will keep to yourself of course will all effect will have upon be that will think more of neil ah mr jent shook head thought better of good gracious how can expect to marry man whose mother be in gaol be not fault take own way miss think have behaved badly in tricking into speaking secret will tell father at once will tell sha be blamed nurse be wicked girl to have done have done there cry be not worth will go away not bother before mr jent must say word ruth be out of house walking swiftly along parade then unexpected happened for first person met be geoffrey heron chapter xii toy horse geoffrey heron must a soon have expected to see sea serpent off shore a to meet ruth ca walking along bognor parade however there be have to meet to explain a best must to put right in eye miss ca stammered taking off hat exhibiting very red face confusion of manner usually absent from demeanour be astonished to meet here daresay replied girl nose in air there can be doubt about after stone told be not astonished have be to see mr jent what have seen webster said mr jent mr webster doe not know that be here be asleep mr jent refused to disturb even for now what have to say for be long story said uneasily in case have better sit down must go back to cottage in case will go with part mr heron until have explanation of part of understand already what do understand asked startled for one thing know now why neil left impossible nothing be impossible to woman who have set heart on finding out what want to know neil refused to tell papa refused refused in meanest manner well have found out from mr jent never told cried heron agitated not of own free will got out of know now what be matter ah see believe be still incredulous just listen then neil real name be jenner mother killed father be now in gaol be right perfectly be relieved to find that did not know worst congratulate on diplomacy thought be going to use nastier word be sure be tempted to believe how can believe when behave a have done why be here instead of in paris because when saw webster found be very ill someone have to look after seemed to be right person just then must not have have leave poor fellow to die ruth held out hand seized eagerly on whole think be very good man mr heron why did tell that be in paris that neil also be abroad did so at request considered that have given father enough trouble knowing that in probability must have long illness asked to conceal whereabouts so that mr ca must not come down oh understand about why did hide in first place wanted to look after in second did not wish to see oh thank cried ruth highly indignant don t misunderstand said anxious neil told story story have got out of mr jent did not feel justified in allowing anything so terrible to reach ear knew be a wax in hand that must probably force to tell so judged discretion to be better part of valour kept away see think discretion will serve in long run here be seat there be few people about now mr heron sit down tell everything from beginning oh wo have 'buts about said ruth peremptorily know worst know only in fragment want to know whole why asked heron taking seat beside ca guess oh be stupid why to help poor neil of course ah be still in love with said heron with jealous pang be not found out long since loved someone else better oh be not going to tell name have secret a well a still like admire neil in spite of misfortune want to help be doing that already admire for well will work together must like nothing better geoffrey hesitated can trust secret be mine know be mine said miss ca very coolly share with mr jent whether know not be not prepared to say be going to tell now then hesitated very good said at length will tell know will work together to get poor woman restored to freedom what be innocent be certain of murdered jenner be not wife be found guilty be not first innocent person who have be found guilty wait till have heard whole story then will judge certainly must not think of judging beforehand said disdainfully must not think silly now go on from very beginning seated on iron bench with gaze fixed seaward heron employed best part of hour in telling story ruth for most part listened quietly only now again putting question so much to point a to amaze companion a neared end question comment became more frequent geoffrey congratulated on having taken into confidence poor neil sighed at last how must have suffered how doe suffer heron said gloomily love mother beyond created being will never be at peace until see rescued from fate to have be so unjustly condemned that will be task responded ruth with alacrity neil be too weak man to take burden upon now know why must never love altogether why be never satisfied what do mean asked heron anxiously well be way said miss ca drawing figure on gravel with tip of umbrella fell in love with when heard play looked so handsome so noble so inspired when be together something always seemed to be wanting know now what be strength strength of man believe geoffrey went on without noticing that be using christian name what woman want in husband be master wonder if will ever get what want know be there such men looked sideways at heron not in coquettish way rather wistfully geoffrey felt that embarrassment honest man feel at thought of having egotistical speech forced upon loved girl be sure that loved well geoffrey said after waiting in vain for reply will be wife will dearest hush take hand speak so loud be in public place remember many eye be on yes will marry for be man can never be master dearest said filled with delight for who must rule dove ah be where be mistaken be not dove by manner of mean be very self willed girl presence here prof that know wo be tyrant thwart in little thing when be wife know that not will have last word be what wish to be well perhaps there be truth in what say admitted will have own way dear always yes always be when fit in with own idea be quite willing to take on term be a strong a neil poor fellow be weak reminds added hastily that must not waste time in talking about must get back to brighton be staying there may yes be staying with old schoolfellow gave address may come over when can neglect poor neil for must settle business first let talk of must rather talk of said ruefully however duty before pleasure what be going to say believe that mr jenner be not guilty if be must have asserted innocence mere fact that held tongue be so wonderful for woman be sure did not kill husband oh be innocent enough let accept that a foregone conclusion said geoffrey hastily must not reveal real reason why mr jenner have not spoken lest neil secret must come to light so let ruth make what liked out of woman silence very good have decided that be innocent now must find out who be guilty agree with geoffrey that murder be committed by stranger jenner be near window crime be committed in order to get possession of red pocket book have material for blackmailing in now what have to learn be what manner of life led in past find out with whom associated who there be must have be likely to blackmail then will know who killed now how be to obtain information from mr jenner will see again told about murder nothing relating to past

road ruth watched till be out of sight then took cane began poking about rubbish under window where a geoffrey surmised murderer have stood watching intended victim on bending down to examine ground more carefully saw something glittering dimly almost without thinking picked up found to surprise joy that be oval piece of gold with champagne bottle enamelled thereon with exquisite art on other side be catch proved that oval have formed part of cuff link holding in small pink palm ruth looked now on treasure with greatest delight be dropped by murderer said to herself be torn from shirt cuff a struck blow there might have be quick struggle fancying finding after year rain from eaves have laid bare ah then assassin be gentleman well ought to be satisfied with day work will come again what good fortune to have found very first time be so excited that almost danced along road a took way home after while sobered down somewhat glanced suspiciously around for there have come upon undefinable feeling of being watched chapter xiv clairvoyant if ruth have gone carefully through deserted hovel must have made yet discovery instinct have not played false when have felt that unfriendly eye be upon for have be watched watcher now emerged from house to see disappear down road much later on came to know of spy at event have found link pale gold oval with champagne bottle enamelled upon be strange device thought for sleeve link certainly be first of kind have seen fancied that other portion of link must bear same design in be wrong what have found proved to that assassin have be gentleman for poor creature must have afforded to wear such jewellery how to make use of discovery how be to find out to whom link have belonged especially now that so many year have passed owner might be dead might be out of england there remained one expedient of asking mr jenner if must remember anyone who have worn such link so ruth made up mind to do a soon a must see geoffrey might question unfortunate woman through series of leading question truth might be revealed meanwhile feeling that nothing else be to be done for moment went to see mr garvey with power might reveal strange thing about owner of piece of gold girl have intended to take brown horse with on going to drawer in have put found empty then remembered that little niece have received permission to turn over silk lace questioned about missing toy ethel eldest frankly confessed that have taken for brother george hope mind aunt ruth child said pleadingly said must take what liked that wet day so long a put thing tidy thought george might like horse so gave to strange thought ruth that toy must have passed into very hand for be intended shuddered at thought of lad playing with thing of such ghastly association be own fault have forgotten that be in drawer when have told child that might play with chiffon told ethel to put back said why did not replace toy ethel drew piteous lip tear came into eye oh be cross aunt ruth tell mother know how angry will be put everything back horse george must not give up to why must not take from aunt asked impatiently because have hidden away sobbed little girl wo say where be so after pacifying child ruth went off in search of george came upon young gentleman on terrace playing with cart naturally looked for horse must have be drawing vehicle horse be to be seen where be gee gee coaxed aunt ruth gone to grass lisped george who be precocious beyond telling bring back from grass georgie give to aunt ruth positively refused to do animal be hidden away must say do failed to compel production dobbin be ill be in paddock be that must say from position failed to move ultimately have to go without made george promise to bring from paddock next day relying on slender chance of recovering toy must never have fallen into hand ruth went way hoping to learn something from mr garvey about broken link mr garvey be thin pale woman who practised calling of clairvoyant in opposition to husband wish dear cried lady receiving ruth with great effusion be glad to see be not unexpected for be borne in upon by telepathic communication that be in trouble must come to for assistance well be quite ready to give to do know ruth began somewhat puzzled by exordium know nothing do wish to know spiritual insight posse will reveal to what be for good come into temple will see what be to be done room be dignified by name of temple be small bare apartment thickly carpeted window being darkened by green blind for quite three minute there be dead silence then mr garvey spoke murder said in low emotional voice piece of gold have to do with crime see bare room child with knife in hand dead man at child foot there be hate in heart not of child of dead be in darkness in mist in rain dead man be enemy will trouble more who be cried ruth blood running cold at hearing circumstance of crime so minutely described woman gave low cry will not tell will not tell said in fierce voice quite at variance with in usually spoke be safe after year be will never voice died away in drawl became silent tell more more cried ruth springing towards mr garvey made reply influence of spirit of piece of gold else be that moved have passed be in what appeared to be heavy sleep seeing that nothing further be to be got out of for moment ruth obeyed instruction have received beforehand drawing up green blind opened window light keen air pouring into room seemed to dispel mr garvey drowsiness stirred moved arm woke with yawn to find miss ca bending over of have passed be evidently quite oblivious even seemed surprised at sight of visitor scared face dear said at last hope have not be telling anything very terrible know what have said something speaks through be only vehicle remember nothing when come out of trance do know anything about turnpike house murder mr garvey started ah be about crime have be asking jenner tragedy know man be murdered by wife have piece of gold got to do with belonged to murderer ruth said with shudder seemed to that spoke in person of murderer described room appearance at time of crime dead body child holding knife looking on then said be in darkness that must never be found out oh said lot of strange thing that child have knife in hand that be standing over body faltered ruth thinking be about to hear that neil have killed father mr garvey shook head be not child said decidedly must not have have link about man who killed father wore else must not have told what did where did find piece of gold under window of room in crime be committed what say fit in with own belief that blow be struck through window ca remember who be in trance mean said woman gently remember nothing find man to whom link belongs can give further better advice than be easier said than done protested girl how be to find man mr garvey shook head must give more information said so moreover be exhausted after effort have made seeing ruth took broken link returned home more perplexed than ever that being usual frame of mind of who dabble in supernatural yet fully believed what clairvoyant have told mr garvey must not possibly have known of scene in bare room immediately after crime have be committed mr jenner alone must have described have told only to geoffrey heron although miss ca thought be much taken up with case saw way of prosecuting further inquiry toy horse in hand of clairvoyant might perhaps have helped truth to tell have forgotten about meanwhile wrote to geoffrey related what have happened with regard to clairvoyant quite expected that hard headed young man must scoff at much to surprise did not in place of letter young squire appeared with full permission from neil to tell ruth reason why mother have held peace did not stay at hollyoaks drove over from own place mr chisel received with effusion worried with question about time for reason of own connected with love business be dying to be alone with miss ca at length however mr chisel putting in own graceful way thought must only be fair to give poor ruth chance of pushing conquest so left winter garden on plea that dear child required mother eye geoffrey heron proceeded at once to business have brought be beginning to think something of clairvoyant after said what wrote to about mr garvey description of scene must be wonderfully accurate yes even to child with knife in hand that child be neil be because mother found standing thus that have undergone punishment without speaking word in own defence gracious be ruth not very original exclamation did believe that have killed father how terrible very terrible said heron gravely now can understand how be that webster be taken ill for mother have told that believed to have killed father then forbade to re open case be perfectly willing to remain where be so long a be safe free oh be noble woman cried ruth be not neil who consciously unconsciously committed crime mr garvey say did not who be can not tell one moment geoffrey will tell more explicitly than must do by letter proceeded to relate whole story from beginning to end well be a far from truth a ever geoffrey said when have finished think next step be to shew that broken link to mr jenner may be able to remember someone who used to wear such ornament ruth took link out of purse gave to will send back again when have done with said want to keep a memento of horrible affair asked with smile be like man who have book bound in human skin care for such thing will have back with full report of what mr jenner say now dear think may talk little about ourselves after case be not whole of life to did talk about among other thing told of encounter with job sapengro astonishment when have spoken to in romany tongue how on earth did learn asked amazed oh when be at school after left too be fond of reading lavengro then dropped subject be busy talking of prospect when mr chisel glided into room geoffrey found that have important engagement at nearest town took leave for society of elder sister be more than must endure went to see off at door few whispered word passed between ruth mr chisel be immediately on alert what did say to asked a soon a be out of earshot made offer of marriage of course refused ruth said flippantly then darted off to seek safety in own room before offended matron must empty upon vial of wrath on way up be stopped by mildred chisel who held up new doll for inspection call jane said small child in confidential whisper be new clothes be old see aunt ruth have dress brooch of old peggy ruth looked carelessly at doll then eye be suddenly caught by ornament served in mildred eye for brooch be gold oval enamelled with horse be double in device of link have found where did get that asked faintly oh grandpapa gave that brooch replied child chapter xv punishment of curiosity for first time in careless happy life ruth knew torment of anxious mind chill struck through very being at suggestion that dearly loved father might be implicated in sordid tragedy yet did not lose presence of mind wheedled so called brooch out of mildred on strict understanding that must be restored next morning thought be painful in extreme for examination of piece of gold proved beyond doubt that belonged to same set of link a did one found under window now ruth recollected that in bond street shop have seen similar set of link four oval of be enamelled respectively with horse champagne bottle pack of card ballet girl be playfully denominated four vice of course be utterly impossible that can have anything to do with thought a paced bedroom there must have be motive yet again how did of men come into possession of link remembered now horror have felt at idea of marrying neil when have come to know that mother be at least to outward appearance murderess judged that if father must be guilty then geoffrey must feel same towards again again tried to find explanation again again failed only by father must her doubt be set at rest be absent true must return in three day how to live during time with hideous doubt in mind must imagine now how people felt when be going mad sending down excuse for not appearing at dinner went to bed to face world even own small world be more than must bear only relief be in solitude of course a might have be expected amy came up to fuss over offer advice blame for having made ill in way mr chisel must have avoided then in came jennie creeping like mouse with soothing speech cool hand for burning brow of sick girl be not well dear said in reply to miss brawn inquiry want be good night rest in morning will be again with answer jennie have to be content left to herself ruth began self communings crossed mind that father who have always be great admirer of beauty might have be attracted by mr jenner good look even a thought of dismissed idea with blush of shame who be to think ill of father must certainly question mr chisel about former governess must learn what have be mr ca attitude towards ruth anxious to propitiate offered on following morning to help with work be told must not do a mr chisel wished in spite of disagreeable speech waited patiently for opportunity of introducing subject of amy childhood amy governess kept temper a best might under deluge of platitude glorification on part of sister at length after having made attack upon several of acquaintance good lady indirectly introduced subject upon ruth wished to speak by giving opinion a to incapacity of jennie brawn a governess say doe not do best said magnanimously oh dear jane brawn so invariably referred to jennie have more idea of teaching than hottentot know how thing must be done a have told dozen time will not take advice what about own governess put in ruth artfully be good amy be excellent a governess returned mr chisel with sniff of disparagement a woman left much to be desired dear amy how do know

married man called jenner clerk in papa office saw more of a have gone to school very good thing too went on mr chisel with air of offended virtue mother never liked did turn out badly after murdering

of mr ca from bordeaux in due time arrived looking better for journey be welcomed by mr chisel with enthusiasm be more pleased to see grandchild than mother for like everyone else found trifle wearisome a for ruth when saw once more father grave face kindly eye be ashamed of have be in mind displayed so much affection that mr ca be surprised for a rule younger daughter be not demonstrative

part of assassin said geoffrey ah said merchant significantly be not astonished jenner be clerk in office a thorough blackguard a ever walked be exactly man who must have blackmailed if must have done so with safety what reason have mr jenner for thinking because husband have boasted to that in red pocket book flourished in face have material for getting money now that pocket book be not produced at trial see said mr ca chin on hand think murderer stabbed jenner a stood by window stole pocket book have link wrenched off in struggle be only way in can account for crime seems feasible enough

heron do ask aunt ruth to give back dear little brooch prattle of child worried terribly yes yes said impatiently run away play now dear a mildred scampered off great heaven thought can ca have murdered man impossible must have have motive be thankful to be alone for felt that in present state of mind must speak to one therefore still thinking of new discovery have made felt annoyed to see jennie brawn leave child come towards must have escaped by walking off called to have perforce to remain looked anxious worried mr heron wish to speak to particularly said be so glad to find alone look ill have have rather shock really be all right said with attempt at smile what be miss brawn well said be somewhat curious story know ruth brought back with toy horse put into drawer in bedroom gave child permission to open drawer there found horse george took possession of hid away well produced animal other day pulled out of hiding place proceeded to cut open to see what be matter with said be in room watched without paying much attention if have have wit about must have recognised ruth horse must not have allowed to touch however did so pulled out stuffing saw that be making mess on carpet went to stop then found among stuffing paper with name on waited for opportunity of giving to here be jennie put into hand bill of exchange old discoloured crumpled hardly knowing what be doing heron glanced at document saw that father signature geoffrey heron be written across bill while signature at foot be that of frank marwill chapter xvii heron follows trail ruth must not rid herself of haunting doubt that father knew more of jenner murder than chose to confess if have not killed man in fit of impetuous rage girl must not bring to think knew who have struck fatal blow ruth be certain now that mr jenner be innocent notwithstanding fact that have be found guilty being so argued to herself that if father be aware of truth must at once take step to remedy grave miscarriage of justice have taken place a made move ruth perplexed doubtful became quite ill with suspense be wonder then that geoffrey have found poor company have failed to understand constant melancholy under circumstance have taken departure wondering what have befallen house have formerly be so bright pleasant satisfaction be to be have from mr ca from daughter on arriving at own place went at once to library to look for document with father signature in order to compare with on bill after close inspection of half dozen autograph of late mr heron came to conclusion that signature to bill be forgery once convinced of began to see daylight argued out case that evening alone undisturbed jenner be at one time clerk in firm of ca marwill thought therefore must have known very well be dismissed so have cause to love employer mr ca so far a know be always upright man jenner have chance of injuring in way with case be different if remember rightly mr jenner told that husband marwill be a thick a thief master patronising clerk on account of man beautiful voice musical accomplishment marwill too lived gay life be given to spending pretty freely be quite possible that might have made use of jenner a tool to get more money through bill five hundred pound said geoffrey looking at document in question humph just sum might require for emergency turned over bill found endorsed by julius roper ah went on where have heard that name roper roper be sure someone spoke of roper suddenly flashed into mind that roper be moneylender in whose employment jenner have be after have failed on stage bill be discounted in office in jenner be employed thought with growing excitement for matter be becoming more interesting minute jenner knowing be forged stole from roper meant to use a mean of extorting blackmail ah stopped short blackmail be of that boasted to wife then be material for getting money that said have in red pocket book pocket book have disappeared bill humph how did get inside horse must jenner have put there if so why what be reason must see mr jenner ask between two of may get at truth although be satisfied that father signature have be forged must not be absolutely certain that marwill have be forger have drawn bill be true jenner might have counterfeited signature have assisted marwill to get money then geoffrey recollected that father particularly precise man have be in habit of keeping diary in be accustomed to set down most trivial detail of somewhat uninteresting life sooner have thought struck than went to certain press pulled out series of little book contained entry glancing at date of bill set to work after hour search found evidence late mr heron have made attempt to conceal marwill rascality for be plainly set down that certain mr roper have called upon to shew bill of exchange to ask if signature be mr heron have replied that have never signed bill in life where upon roper have intimated that bill have be presented by frank marwill that money have be paid to roper have also expressed intention of having marwill arrested to mr heron have objected bad a thought man wanted to avoid serious trouble le for marwill own sake than for of miss inez ca to whom be engaged who be deeply in love with roper have left house with avowed intention of making thing hot for so mr heron have called on marwill at house near hollyoak told what have happened then marwill have confessed that being in want of money have forged mr heron name stated that be going to pay money back to roper very shortly implored mr heron to take step against must break miss ca heart said mr heron pitying inez having great respect for brother have promised to say more about have agreed to refrain from assisting roper on condition that five hundred pound be repaid a later entry in diary proved have be done after there be further mention of matter well geoffrey said to a put away book be quite plain seems that mr frank marwill be pretty scoundrel oh there be doubt that bill be blackmailing document referred to by jenner now wonder if marwill murdered to get possession of if did bill must not have be concealed in toy horse ah doubt marwill thought be in red pocket book stole that after have killed be why pocket book disappeared probably marwill destroyed humph have gone so far with very good result now before can proceed further must see mr jenner roper wonder if scoundrel be still alive next day geoffrey paid visit to gaol where mr jenner be serving life sentence after difficulty be permitted to see prisoner indeed might not have procured interview at have not told governor that saw good chance of proving woman innocent governor be humane man anxious that justice must be done stretched point allowed heron to see with a much privacy a be compatible with prison discipline a soon a be alone heron related that have discovered then proceeded to ask question mr jenner poor woman became much excited small wonder seeing that for first time saw chance of regaining freedom after will be to die mr heron said sadly be very ill trouble exposure mental worry have be too much for doctor saw two day ago have ordered removal to infirmary geoffrey looked at true enough there be death in face few week be of life left to now yet on hearing geoffrey news bold spirit flamed up again in for last time be sure be right mr heron said feverishly mr marwill be guilty person be always scamp rake there be doubt that be for purpose of blackmailing that husband came down to westham on night be murdered in fact said a much to at turnpike house do know that have met marwill on very night no did not tell that forgot besides really did not think mattered did not expect that mr marwill must be brought into affair be always cunning enough to look after at time be engaged to marry miss ca loved with fierceness of tigress do mean present mr marshal who else must mean always loved have strange fascination for woman why know for be not particularly good looking attractive miss inez loved be within two month of murder that be married be in prison then a be now under sentence of death then think that marwill killed husband do said with look of hatred in large blue eye feel certain of look at motive have be engaged to marry miss inez ca be rich needed money then again there be talk of leaving firm believe that mr ca be quite tired of way be going on wonder that mr ca knowing a did did not forbid marriage what must have be use sister be own mistress have own money large fortune be madly in love with marwill must have done anything for simply grovelled at foot infatuation be talk of westham at time be starving at turnpike house ' extraordinary mused geoffrey be so masterful woman wonder must have fallen in love with so weak man be one of thing in woman nature be stronger than principle said mr jenner besides be fascinating be no longer young woman added with touch of feminine spite at rate be delighted when fell in love with determined not to let go be in love with perhaps be wrong to put way doubt wanted money did leave firm yes shortly after marriage ah then depend upon mr ca got rid of married miss ca for money must have be in great strait when committed that forgery oh quite believe be who did be wonderfully clever at imitating handwriting knew of accomplishment long before be married how hate geoffrey must not help exclaiming be very good hater said quietly have reason to hate man be who got husband dismissed be certainly who led into dissipated way for jenner be not bad man during early year of married life be only when came under marwill influence that took to drink began to treat cruelly oh know what owe only too well must like to see arrested for murder hanged hanged spoke with such vehemence that heron shivered hope will be proved innocent for that said remember be engaged to niece miss ruth be not niece save by marriage still disgrace well leave matter alone said mr jenner abruptly have suffered so much that little more le doe not matter when be gone there will be end of trouble let marwill live to repent if can be willing to die with disgrace on ca well be worse off than be son will soon forget do wrong mr jenner love dearly let be a may what have to do be to get at truth of if marwill will confess guilt will consult with mr ca see what be to be done confess on ruth account want scandal must desert for love be too just hope to visit sin of other people upon innocent head mr jenner seemed to be considering then mr heron said at last be good man leave matter where stand let die guilty woman in eye of world if be in good health might speak differently be dying let die have suffered so much that now must not even enjoy freedom there be rest for in grave believe be better to leave thing a be well will see about tell how did bill get inside toy horse ah be difficult to explain horse belonged to boy be playing with before fire on evening left there when took child to bed be likely enough went on musingly that husband knowing have driven marwill into corner be afraid might lose bill may have sewn up inside horse when be out of room knew very well that kept boy toy thought must be safe there one must ever have dreamt of looking for in hiding place be really most wonderful when one come to think of that have come to light at can tell where jenner met marwill on night can not know be what told that have seen two hour before came to see boasted of blackmailing be can tell geoffrey rose well have given information if not very much said now will go see roper to make certain how bill came to be stolen husband stole when be with roper said mr jenner with last piece of information geoffrey departed to follow up clue chapter xviii money lender mr julian roper have establishment in golden square soho although gentleman be over eighty have not yet repented of many iniquity callously continued to conduct evil transaction office two dingy room be

influence over be widow at least be a such that described for husband have left many year before in sheer disgust at tyranny mr hutt be name have son who acted a clerk to julian when geoffrey heron arrived at sordid temple of mammon be received by drudge young old person of particular age dressed in suit of rusty black informed visitor that master be absent clerk who answered to name of jerry hutt gave mr heron broken backed chair returned to desk be smuggled away into corner with shrug at poverty of place apparently enfeebled intellect of person in charge young man took seat amused by taking stock of surroundings jerry took not slightest notice of geoffrey after first greeting wrote hard with tongue thrust into cheek giving vent at time to faint chuckle be positively uncanny coming to conclusion that be half witted heron came to regard in light in most people saw more a article of furniture than man in in common with rest of visitor to den be wrong for underneath assumed stupidity jerry be a sharp a proverbial needle luckily heron have not long to wait in about quarter of hour jerry raised big head looked out of window shuffling step be heard at door minute later someone came coughing grumbling along narrow passage mr roper chuckled jerry pointing towards inner room go in there geoffrey taking notice of brusque manner passed into back room be better lighted better furnished than clerk den still be sordid enough so dirty that young squire found necessary to dust with handkerchief seat have chosen cleanliness godliness be absent from establishment thought mr heron must hear roper outside growling at jerry must catch nothing of conversation guessed that have to do with for shortly mr roper entered back room with what be meant to be amiable smile on mahogany face in appearance be double of clerk a thin a yellow even smaller in stature have hey said being way in be accustomed to begin conversation mr heron ah yes mr geoffrey heron quite so knew father good man mr heron strong in expression geoffrey took to mean very rightly too that father have expressed in measured term a to moneylender professional transaction made comment merely remarking that have come to see mr roper on business have hey chuckled old man shuffling towards desk with aid of heavy stick quite so not like father oh dear never borrowed money be not here for purpose retorted mr heron haughtily old man panting for breath dropped into chair can assure that be last person to whom must come in such circumstance business be quite of different nature have then why do come here mr heron have much to do be poor money be hard to make if business have nothing to do with money why come at because be only person who can assist hing for nothing croaked mr roper quickly if want anything out of must pay pay cash down understand have have enough of bill mr frank marwill bill for five hundred included asked geoffrey man started plucked at nether lip have hey what do

yes of course know forgery father quite so stopped looked up sharply well what be asked geoffrey sat down again be beginning to see way to successful management of old gentleman be long story said slowly keeping eye fixed on avaricious face of usurer let begin at beginning what about man called jenner roper gave screech be visibly startled cast swift glance at door behind doubt useful jerry be eavesdropping jenner said recovering with effort be clerk of mine blackguard one implies other heron said drily if have heard of be true now sir come libelling whimpered usurer still disturbed wo have will bring action for damage heavy damage do mr roper must like to see shewn up in court how many of transaction will bear scrutiny of law have never broken law roared with attempt at dignity ill became be poor man honest jenner oh yes be murdered deserved to be murdered beast who did asked geoffrey abruptly for second time mr roper be visibly disconcerted how must know more than quavered wife

because hate have daughter loved must not marry oh dear father reputation be too bad for so fine gentleman so died pined away mr heron a be sinner oh how jerry felt admired loved so did marwill eye flashed must not marry for be dead buried now most expensive tomb added vaguely marble most costly be daughter hate to spend good money elsa be daughter most expensive tomb listener took for senile babble of age perhaps be for tear stood in usurer eye hard eye have remained dry whilst looking upon much deliberately created misery wiped now with snuffy red bandana then looked fiercely at client come said roughly with growl a of beast about to spring what about marwill geoffrey said nothing for moment stared fixedly at moneylender have hey said roper impatiently there be yellow gleam in eye be waiting what about marwill must rather ask what about jenner hing for nothing a have told be reply if must assist to punish wretch might perhaps help otherwise well may be able to help in oh oh said old man what grudge have against marwill have none have very good reason for acting a be doing what be reason refuse to tell speak freely to leave matter alone good man can do without assistance cried usurer with frightful energy if marwill be to get into trouble be man to assist broke elsa heart wish to be revenged what be want to know tell about jenner heron said curtly saw that old man moved by recollection of marwill behaviour to daughter be in mood to be confidential must get must out of before wind changed roper commenced speaking in hurry a though in fear that resolution must fail jenner be wretch scamp said be in employment before jerry grew up to assist took off street repaid kindness by robbing of bill of exchange on be forgery of father name oh know that said with glance of surprise well daresay father worthy man must doubt tell jenner took bill just when thought have marwill in palm of hand ah be blow must have given hundred to have kept bill to have lodged marwill in gaol when be gone must hing have bill do know where be give to will work matter have not bill said geoffrey deliberately saw that honour of ca family must be lost if entrusted to hand of man bill be stolen from jenner dead body added with studied equivocation by whom roper asked abruptly do not know certainly not said with violence be about to accuse of crime why even know of place where met death can prove nothing against sir however cleverly lay trap be not laying trap geoffrey said mildly want to know something more about jenner a have told at least five time be in employment

must tell jennie brawn story of broken link position with regard to father have given promise be forced to hold tongue on part jennie always open honest felt trifle embarrassed at secret understanding with geoffrey heron regarding bill of exchange seemed to too delicate perception to be wrong for be not young man friend lover like ruth jennie have given promise must not be broken too have to hold peace under circumstance girl be le open with other than usual on account did not seek one a be formerly case jennie made teaching serve a excuse ruth took to wandering about country in society of own sad thought have promised father to refrain from further meddling with jenner case did not think that bound to abstain from visiting turnpike house be always finding in neighbourhood of ill omened building held secret of crime several time ruth have noticed smoke rising from chimney began to think from recurrence of phenomenon that tramp have taken up abode in deserted building full of nervous apprehension lest said tramp must find something in house likely to connect father with crime ruth have more than once made up mind to see who be that occupied hovel on occasion courage failed at last moment one day screwed up courage set out to visit turnpike house must if other piece of evidence connected with crime have be discovered if so ascertain who be finder a approached must see that although house still looked dilapidated disreputable in green jungle attempt have be made to render fit for human habitation window have be mended door repaired roof patched in various place ruth walked boldly up path now trodden down by footstep of new owner after glance at closed door looked in at window be guiltless of blind curtain must see quite plainly what be going on inside to surprise first person saw be aunt inez seated by fire talking eagerly to job who be astride chair beside gypsy turned head rapidly a shadow of girl lengthened by sun fell across floor uttered exclamation of mingled surprise aid vexation mr marwill looking up at moment beheld niece very last person expected indeed desired to see in place dark face grew trifle pale black eye flashed looked downright savage at intrusion however there be nothing left for now to make best of situation so before ruth have time to recover from astonishment aunt inez have passed quickly to window have thrown wide open goodness ruth why do come in silent way to frighten people come in come in stand staring there like fool ruth struggled to recover from surprise be astonished to see here aunt inez said when have found tongue did not know be acquainted with job be pensioner of mine mr marwill said composedly preparing to shut window be coming in ruth can walk back together know approve of roaming country in uncivilised fashion seems be only following example ruth said pertly be married woman job patroness remarked ruth who be too much annoyed by aunt manner to be careful mr marwill flashed at look boded ill for harmony of future relation yes be looking after poor man there be nothing wrong in hope on contrary said niece went towards door be opened by job who during interview have be most discreetly silent winked at girl not rudely to intimate that still looked upon a romany sister ushered into room mr marwill have resumed seat by fire pointed out other chair to niece job leant up against table regarded two with twinkle in dark eye evidently anticipated amusement have be here before ruth asked elder lady sharply once be curious to see place on account of murder suppose replied mr marwill with contempt really ruth do wonder that must care to concern with such horror why do come here again to see job be quiet answer lady be pal put in job oh yes can patter black tongue be real romany

to associate with job aunt be doing so exclaimed that lady with something of defiance in manner have taken poor man under protection intend to make comfortable ruth did not reply immediately then looked up last time be here watched aunt inez said slowly perhaps did perhaps did not replied that lady coldly scorned to tell lie refused to own truth then know what found here under window job looked up eagerly exchanged glance with mr marwill that clever lady preserved imperturbable countenance what found dear be of consequence to said impatiently rose to foot be more to purpose that must be going will arrange about weekly money said turning to job thank lady said gypsy gratefully be real good sort wo trouble long though be booked before year be out ruth lingered for wanted to speak to man alone aunt hurried away last glimpse have of be standing in doorway laughing in anything respectful manner one must have thought that miss ca have burnt finger quite severely enough to avoid playing with fire such be not case curiosity be stronger than prudence besides after smile have seen on job face began to doubt aunt plausible explanation unfortunately mr marwill escorted niece right up to gate of hollyoaks park refused to go in have left carriage at inn said a uncle be not very well must go home at once hope will come see soon ruth be neglecting very much will come with pleasure aunt will next week do week will do be always at home except on occasion like when be employed in charitable work will expect next week when aunt have gone ruth waited until be out of sight then took short cut across meadow to turnpike house within hour again presented at door be opened so suddenly that felt sure that job have be watching greeting proved that such be case expected sister said come

mr ca room geoffrey refused to have dinner have dined before leaving home said did not decline cigar glass of good port mr ca be at once convinced from expression of tragic gravity on young man face

heron to begin mr ca said at last have come to renew former conversation oh jenner murder suppose mr ca said lightly thought a much did not know that intended to pursue matter did of own free will replied geoffrey coolly circumstance have thrust upon fresh discovery want assistance mr ca looked up sharply replied with studied carelessness of course will do best to help dear fellow really see how can will soon see when have told of discovery be grim answer about link know merchant started changed colour ah said ruth told time ago what did not tell what did not reveal mr ca be that be owner of link how can be certain on point asked mr ca calmly what have found out to make think that at rate broken one ruth got under window of turnpike house have anything to do with will tell said leaning forward looking very directly at host gave portion of one of link to granddaughter mildred for doll found child cry because ruth have taken what called 'brooch from at first did not connect with one ruth have found when described guessed that be part of set to make certain shewed one aunt have picked up recognised at once a double of brooch with difference in design of course did not tell of mr ca why must have told mr ca tone be slightly defiant did give such link to mildred be one of set have set asked heron forgive asking have good reason for doing so know what reason be replied merchant raising voice be wrong did not drop that link at turnpike house did not murder jenner nothing be further from mind protested young man jump to conclusion meaning be quite different expression on mr ca face be one half of relief half of uneasiness what do mean then demanded have right to know will know be in order to tell came over evening first have remaining link mr ca crossed room to old fashioned desk stood in corner began to search in five minute returned to seat by fire bringing with oval enamelled with pack of card be have said mildred have one with horse on have other with champagne bottle ballet girl where be that one mr ca be silent shifted uneasily in chair can not tell until know more clearly what have discovered will know may save certain person from relentless enemy yes may look mr ca tell there be one man who hate with intensity of soul will only too willingly do injury mr ca began to grow angry at mysterious description one man man repeated what do mean who be enemy julian roper who be heron looked at in astonishment if face be to be read host knew nothing of man be surprised that know who roper be said slowly why must never even heard name can recollect if have grudge against can not understand reason seeing a have said that be unknown to did not say that have grudge against hinted a much after suppose be man who be so well hated at least can take speech in other way mean at allude to marwill brother in law marwill mr ca sprang to foot face turned positively grey time geoffrey have reason to complain of indifference be plain that host feared revelation about to be made against sister husband quite understand said what have marwill think understand very well mr ca can only wish that during last conversation have spoken out if want truth in plain word say that frank marwill murdered jenner at turnpike house to recover bill of exchange on have forged father name stop stop cried mr ca dropping back into seat what what ground have accusation be not true upon word of honour can not say think can mr ca know that mr jenner be innocent that marwill be guilty merchant became vehement can not say that cried dashing fist on table because know did suspect marwill on certain ground knew nothing of bill must not fathom motive be doubtful so came to conclusion that mr jenner be guilty person must have told before heron honour of family hope to be one of family soon geoffrey said quietly can not suppose that be le anxious than be to avoid scandal must know truth now at cost will know everything can tell oh heaven if must be so if must be guilty must never be sure never must have taken step to get unfortunate woman released did not want to suffer in way without incriminating marwill must have managed if only have be sure bill ah be motive never knew did not tell that a to roper can assure that be first time to knowledge have heard name yet discounted bill be in office that jenner be employed after have failed on stage took interest in man after have dismissed never even heard employer name stole bill suppose ah yes begin to understand came down here to blackmail marwill quite so great heaven can be guilty after will have truth out of at cost be difficult part of geoffrey said with flush can make marwill speak out dread confession by right must give up to law yet disgrace must get at truth first afterwards can decide how to get woman released how to punish wretched brother in law tell what proof have against heron produced pocket book took therefrom bill of exchange gave to mr ca started a though snake have stung forged asked placing finger on signature of geoffrey heron then on nod from young man added did find among father paper be impossible jenner must have have on night be murdered yet if marwill killed to get possession of how came into hand because marwill lost fruit of wickedness never gained possession of bill jenner be too clever for seems a learn from mr jenner that left alone while put child to bed during time fearing doubt lest marwill must try recover sewed up in body of toy horse with boy have be playing neil sent horse to george chisel grandson a child will cut up animal miss brawn saw paper among stuffing gave to doe know have said know nothing of connection of with murder have said nothing for made give word that must not one be aware of existence roper what of roper know nothing about if knew how hated marwill must be glad that be ignorant for must certainly prosecute if got hold of paper doubt if must now seeing that father who alone must give evidence a to falsity of signature be dead why doe hate marwill so bitterly well appears that roper have daughter who fell in love with must have married have given reason to believe that must of course stopped at died of broken heart think there be anything scandalous about affair nothing worse than playing fast loose with affection of unhappy girl always be scoundrel paid large sum to leave firm a feared must do something criminal day then married sister begged to give up be headstrong insisted great heaven cried married very shortly after have committed crime yet doubt very much if must have have courage to kill jenner will tell led to suspect in first place from circumstance of return on night in second link how be must like to know from beginning well marwill be staying here on night of crime looked out of sort made excuse forget what after dinner said be going out for walk be wet misty tried to dissuade sister have gone to bed with headache be alone although never liked wanted to

murder spoke to about swore that have not seen jenner tell about link be yes bought many year ago when be young vain marwill saw took great fancy to so gave set now mr ca clenched hand fear if got desert that must hang quite overcome bowed head on table chapter xxi ruth be comforted presently mr ca raised head looked at geoffrey with woebegone expression that young man started seemed a if merchant have grown suddenly old line appeared on face have never be there before eye be sunken shoulder have bowed a though whole weight of misery have be placed upon transformation be at once startling painful take so much to heart said heron after may be wrong about marwill hope so trust so be hoarse reply if be guilty what be to think of have suspicion on ground of have told yet here have allowed innocent woman to spend year in gaol when scoundrel must have be in place a to that must hardly have accused sister husband be not married to at time if have insisted upon explanation night when came in torn dirty at yonder window might have prevented marriage think that even mad love inez have for must have stood test mr jenner held tongue when must have spoken out so have clue even if have spoken out must have done nothing be silent because fancied that neil in madness have killed father never suspected marwill retrospection can do good thing be done what have to consider now be how best to get out of if marwill be guilty must give written confession leave country without connivance what purpose must serve to have suffer at stage besides from have heard from mr jenner scamp of husband quite deserved fate marwill confession must set free at cost of publicity burst out mr ca how disgrace heron think of sister of ruth of amy married daughter must mean ruin to how must marry into such family oh a to be not afraid to face world must be mean hound if be to visit marwill sin on ruth whatever happens may be certain that ruth will be wife that will receive from love affection due to so charming honest girl thank heron grasped young man hand exclaimed younger man a to marwill when know truth for certain will decide how to act above must not be in hurry say gave link to did what be more wore on night remember calling attention to at dinner humph then alone must have lost that one at turnpike house suppose did not notice if one be missing from cuff when came into room never gave matter thought there be reason why must believed that have be attacked by gypsy know how many there be always about lonely road assault of nature must have be quite enough to account for mud on clothes torn condition never thought have met jenner be there bad blood between well be not quite sure seems that marwill have persecuted mr jenner with attention husband be not of sort to take trouble about that marwill have be boon companion for long time whether parted on account of come row know one thing be clear that jenner saw marwill again when marwill called on julian roper to discount bill finding that be forgery stole to come down here blackmail former friend how must find out that be forgery oh very easily roper might have talked jenner might have listened at event knew truth suppose met that night at turnpike house said heron suddenly recollecting conversation with dead man widow jenner have seen marwill before came to turnpike house of course marwill might have followed watched through window then seeing pocket book supposed must contain bill might have killed cleared off marwill must tell be if can be made to tell will force out of mr ca said grimly sleeve link for instance have to explain how came to lose one at turnpike house remember after marwill went away from here housemaid brought pair enamelled pack of card horse said mr marwill have left in room thought must be tired of that have probably taken other pair with by mistake so put have left into desk thought more about when mildred wanted brooch for doll separated gave one to child one with horse one with pack of card left on table intending to give to ethel have champagne bottle link be dropped under window geoffrey said now what have become of other one ballet girl doubt that also will be found at turnpike house said mr ca must tell that fastening of link be somewhat worn that slight tug must have broken in putting arm through window to grasp knife mr jenner say be on table daresay marwill cuff caught in nail link be torn apart must have fallen to ground one have be found other doubt be still on ground in case must make search to morrow said geoffrey rising must see marwill first mr ca said very decidedly must go over with to night must make inez suspicious want to know anything of after may be mistaken must give explanation will write note to evening ask to come over to morrow call here heron at eleven o'clock will force truth out of very well think must be best hope will be able to exculpate if mr marwill must get to know must fight for husband tooth nail know what tigress sister be when be roused spanish blood suppose by way went on looking at heron with faint smile be half spanish too doubt be credited with fiery temper confess now heron thought from silence have killed man geoffrey nodded with embarrassment did said frankly can blame appearance be against mr ca shrugged shoulder blame said might have given benefit of doubt appearance be against marwill too well will see if be a wrongly suspected a be be going now be early must like to see ruth for few minute well will be quite a glad to see be dull poor girl horror of thing so much a know of at least have got on nerve go see come here at eleven to morrow of course will tell nothing certainly not good night by way forgot to tell that webster be coming down next week be much better think change will do good humph will tell of discovery know what do think must say nothing until be quite certain let own counsel for honour of family think be right said mr ca with sigh heaven grant for happiness of that be wrong in suspicion now go dear hoy leave to think matter over ruth be waiting for heron found ruth in winter garden in tear told be moat miserable girl in world that nobody cared for last statement mr heron be not inclined to hear without venturing to put forward own claim darling girl how can say so asked pressing closely in arm love more than world man say that when can think of nothing else to say replied ruth who be too much disturbed to be wholly just if really loved must have neglected so dear be busy know what took up time yes know wish did know horrid business have troubled morn night wonder hair have turned grey nonsense cried geoffrey be a black a ever black a outlook of life heron must not help smile at grandiloquent speech be so unlike ruth to indulge in what american call tall talk leave wretched affair alone dear said kissing need not trouble pretty head more about must insisted if suspicion be not set at rest will go mad worst of be have promised father to tell nothing if must only speak freely to must ease mind then ease speak freely ruth oh need not shake head know what be talking about sleeve link yes be cried hysterically have nearly killed with anxiety over whole thing oh what wicked girl be dear only very foolish girl can set mind at rest once for father be perfectly innocent of what impute to have nothing do with crime believed in good faith mr jenner be guilty person ruth rose to foot smile of relief dispelled tear oh how delighted be said excitedly sha worry more oh how thankful be what weight be off mind why did tell before have reason reason have explained to need not trouble dear think have better put whole affair out of mind will now that papa be free from stigma doe not know that thought be seriously mixed up in case must never forgive if did ever tell geoffrey wo now worry more geoffrey if mr jenner be not guilty who be ah must find that out replied heron thinking best not to reveal anything about mr marwill explanation must only have caused fresh trouble if be wise ruth will leave matter alone intend to said there be one thing want to tell geoffrey job lovel who be gypsy did tell about yes think did say something about having met at turnpike house well what have be doing nothing except that have taken up abode at turnpike house like impudence cried young man why house be mine if wanted to live in wretched hovel must have come to besides wish anyone to live in shamble intend to have pulled down so get rid of legend haunt neighbourhood wish must pull down be ill omened place blot on landscape sooner be removed better will be for countryside people round here think be haunted know keep up memory of murder if house be pulled down there must be end of sooner better know what aunt inez will say mr marwill cried geoffrey looking at sharply what have got to do with be what want to tell seems that aunt inez have taken interest in job suggested that must patch up house live in have arranged to allow so much week to live on humph be strange mr marwill be not usually so philanthropic that be exactly what thought that made think that papa have something to do with murder aunt inez be shielding shielding how by assisting job went to see other day found aunt inez there be very angry with for having gone saw job afterwards must tell nothing hinted at secret between aunt inez now think think anything about heron said with forced laugh aunt be getting charitable in old age believe there be nothing between gypsy relative to murder whatever may say talked geoffrey daresay wonder did not threaten will for if know anything very much doubt will get out of dear how can think aunt know anything about matter now ruth must promise to leave alone think more about very well said with unusual meekness then think aunt inez have anything to do knowledge mean be quite sure have not be kind to job out of pure charity now must say good night once more worry a drove home came to conclusion that mr marwill kindness to gypsy be meant in way to shield husband that complicates matter thought heron chapter xxii at bay on following morning geoffrey arrived precisely at time appointed by mr ca be shewn at once into library host be there alone for marwill with usual want of punctuality have not yet appeared geoffrey be informed of sudden change in ruth visit did good last night said father with smile told not to worry that be quite right seemed comforted told something seems to hint mr marwill know of husband guilt repeated ruth tale about gypsy mr marwill kindness to extraordinary kindness termed mr ca listened attentively shook head agree with said know inez a do while be still speaking in whisper like two guilty people marwill bustled into room in what must have called breezy fashion in reality manner be simply aggressive noisy gave air of being what wanted to be thought creature too guileless unconventional to conceal feeling good day ca cried loudly to former partner nodding to heron well here be what be matter got into trouble have not got into trouble be mr ca emphatic reply boy then marwill turned smilingly to geoffrey upon whom looked a possible member of family be in trouble eh eh ah well young men will be young men be sure speak from experience marwill said mr ca while heron contented with shake of head there be nothing wrong with heron very glad be sure marwill said insolently seemed a though scented trouble in air thought to meet with bluff a yet have not faintest idea that coming conversation be to be serious for personally well went on a be right heron be good boy why have asked to come over ca guess asked geoffrey angered by man manner lifted eyebrow said tranquilly really be at loss to understand why cast thought back twelve year interrupted mr ca sharply then perhaps will understand why what do mean asked brother in law thrill running through saw now that be going to be serious for do remember night when came in at yonder window muddy ragged mr ca said slowly when told lie that have be attacked by footpad be lie cried man moistening dry lip told what have actually happened oh did for instance never told that have seen jenner uttered faint cry flung back in chair with startled look did not see jenner said did tell that have be at turnpike house continued mr ca not noticing interruption that deny be not near turnpike house with look of scorn mr ca picked up object be lying on table held out do know what be piece of gold so far a can see what be to evidence that be at turnpike house on night tell be not there cried desperately oh trouble to tell lie mr ca said wearily will avail nothing in end since choose to recognise object let tell that be part of set of link gave shortly before murder link only wore once know did on night lost one pair left other in bedroom where be found by housemaid returned to must have be better advised have destroyed marwill why must have destroyed lost one pair be true catch between oval be worn link broke not of own accord mr ca said quickly cuff caught on nail when put arm through window to kill jenner marwill uttered loud cry started to foot face crimson with rage shaking with what looked very much like terror deny that cried deny be at turnpike house killed link be found under window interrupted mr ca man who wore be man who killed jenner be man kill jenner be lie marwill continued to stare at piece of gold brother in law continued to hold up a though be fascinated drew hand across brow a uttered denial in weak voice seemed to be trying to recall something why must have killed asked be now be turn drew from pocket bill of exchange perhaps will supply motive said coldly forgery discounted by julian roper with face now positively purple eye almost staring out of head marwill craned forward head to look at fatal evidence of past recognised only too well for year have be dreading moment now that have arrived sight of document proved too much for with strangled cry tugged at collar then fell like log on floor strong man guilty man have fainted mr ca heron be moved by catastrophe be to decisive evidence of guilt when recalled lifelong imprisonment of mr jenner must find pity in heart for detected rogue rather be full of pity for unhappy people with whom be connected by marriage nothing in eye must expiate guilt must be better if died now said mr ca a watched heron loosen collar dash cold water on face pardon not at replied younger man looking up for moment if died now there must be confession in end brought round placed again in chair pitiable object with damp hair loosened collar imploring look in eye most meritorious of men must not have looked dignified under such circumstance much le frank marwill who be so to speak in dock before two prejudiced judge suppose be going to give up said on contrary want to get out of trouble for sake of family said mr ca coldly though by right must hang hang for forgery stammered wretched creature arranging collar pshaw be not speaking of minor crime of greater be who murdered jenner did not swear did not did be convinced of came down here with bill in order to blackmail killed made attempt to assert dignity can kick man when be down if like said in quavering voice even though be sister husband have right to accuse of crime did not commit tell forged that bill did not kill man knew that be in neighbourhood be a much astonished a must have be when heard of death if be innocent be heron who spoke how did happen that part of link be wearing be found under window of house must have dropped there did not seemed to be reflecting if want to know truth that pair of link be torn from by footpad who attacked daresay killed rubbish cried mr ca looking at with disgust why do tell such lie met jenner on night although denied when questioned be afraid of being implicated in murder knew if have slightest suspicion of must have stopped marriage with inez loved loved money mean well then loved money marwill cried violently be on brink of ruin be only that stood between street have to pay roper five hundred pound must not have prosecuted a bill be missing must have talked must have talked have not paid full sum be only when have possession of money wife money be able to shut mouth knew before then that bill be lost because jenner have shewn to on night marwill turned away sullenly still under compulsion answered yes did have received letter from saying that be coming here with bill must sell to asked to meet at waggoner pond half mile from turnpike house where wife be staying a have money be in power absolutely for by shewing bill to ca must have have marriage with sister broken off be forced to meet did meet at seven o'clock oh so did go out night to meet did said defiantly dare not tell for have always have so many absurd prejudice so told be going for walk stole out to meet jenner at waggoner pond said that if must wait till be married must handle money must buy bill so finding that unless made sister wife must never have penny consented oh said mr ca consented to go without pound of flesh man like jenner bloodsucker thief have to choose between exposing getting nothing waiting being paid said marwill vehemently besides knew that roper be after because have stolen bill that if made fuss row might get into must be in trouble so agreed to wait until have married inez then to accept thousand pound meanwhile kept bill promised to hold tongue about said be going on to see wife at turnpike house that must get money from must enable to lie low for time while roper be searching for be arranged that when be married have paid thousand pound must go to america agreed to must hing else then parted be that truth heron asked sceptically yes be can believe disbelieve a like left by waggoner pond be last saw of alive dead on way back to house be attacked by tramp who took watch wrenched link off be one pair missing pair be about to take other when heard someone coming made off returned here told ca a little a must in case might see fit to stop marriage with sister wish to heaven have stopped mr ca said fiercely believe word say chapter xxiii still in doubt marwill seeing that two men be silent began to recover self command see believe perhaps there be reason why must swear know who killed jenner if have known must have got bill out of oh said geoffrey must have condoned sin so long a gave back evidence of own must man for in world must have told whosoever be that if did not give back bill must denounce to police have not least idea who guilty person be wiped face year have lived in misery fearing daily hourly that bill must turn up knew roper must not spare if got possession of wonder remarked heron seeing how badly treated daughter elsa culprit have grace to blush elsa roper be never penny worse by said when used to go to father office to procure money chose to fall in love with made capital out of a do out of most thing be so shameless man interposed brother in law sharply marwill sickened with fluent villainy oh be always puritan sneered marwill however be neither here there let girl believe that cared for in order to get father to part with money never intended to marry died of broken heart put in heron so old man say a though woman ever died of such thing caught chill be carried off because be not sufficiently well nourished be truth although old roper prefers to put down to if have fed better must be alive now chooser to think killed must do serious injury must be glad bill did not fall into hand where did get asked turning to geoffrey if can tell name of person who have can tell who be assassin of jenner oh be quite true jenner shewed bill night by waggoner pond must have taken by force be stronger than there be chance of getting better of noticed that took out of red pocket book now that pocket book be never produced at trial so assassin must have then think mr jenner killed must have killed fly did not kill if have that red pocket book must have be produced in court have be living in fear ever since wondering who have though always intended to make use of murder must assassin have tried to blackmail who did get bill from heron did not got from anyone jenner evidently thought that might come after to steal so according to wife sewed up in body of toy horse with child have be playing lately neil wished to give toy to george chisel so came into ruth possession boy cut open miss brawn found bill gave to at once saw roper about besides read up father diary found that name have be forged did know have done roper called on to tell so if father have not died mr marwill must have found in prison for forgery must not forget that jenner stole bill one must have prosecuted without producing document know enough law for besides have paid money to roper did only to avoid scandal doe ruth know about miss brawn george know nothing replied mr ca ruth doe not even know of existence of bill george be child took notice of a for miss brawn think signature be right will hold tongue oh be quite safe so far murder feel certain that committed one else must have have so powerful motive still someone else might have have motive for be sure mr jenner be innocent husband have lot of enemy many must gladly have done must have escaped consequence only thing that puzzle be disappearance of red pocket bock understand about bill now must not have be made use of well whole affair be mystery can say be did not kill man knew if came to pinch must always prove that have come to pinch now said mr ca sternly prove innocence if can for part believe be guilty more fool be retort on night if remember have dinner at six light dinner dished up in hurry wife have to go to london told must have supper at nine did not yes remember something of said mr ca after pause be not in to supper yes be remember that too supper be at nine yes be ordered for nine postponed till past because did not feel hungry be here when gave order because asked whether must prefer supper at once wait be true enough well well if will look again into evidence given at trial of unfortunate woman will find that doctor said that jenner have be killed at nine o'clock therefore must not have be who struck blow by own shewing be with at time now be innocent guilty mr ca looked at geoffrey be true enough said quietly begin to believe that did not do after if can be so honest a to admit be in room at nine o'clock must not have killed jenner who be at very time being murdered by unknown person four mile away be forger admit that here became finely scornful be not murderer foolish may have be wicked never be two listener gazed at other in amazement then marwill went on now know where bill be feel relieved said self pity be almost pathetic can sleep in peace more especially when have be destroyed a spoke advanced hand towards table with intention of taking paper mr ca anticipated snatched incriminating document away marwill said putting in pocket keep be too dangerous man to be allowed to go own way use bill a whip to manage behave act decent part for remainder of life one will ever know of try of trick will be laid by heel do call honourable blustered marwill call caution be quite safe with be sure friend heron will say nothing certainly will be guided entirely by mr ca roper might get hold of then must be lost roper will not get hold of keep marwill be for wife sake only that be thus lenient so far a be concerned nothing must give greater pleasure than to see suffering just punishment be most unblushing scoundrel have ever seen have better look out ca said marwill threateningly can make pay dearly for insult can person possibly insult sneered mr ca do what like remember touched breast pocket will exact payment now know a for rest want in house again a might provoke remark on part of inez lead to explanation will permit to call occasionally hope visit will be rare be in place must go abroad now can go man be livid with rage be evidently inclined to make trouble knew that must go pretty far for only direst extremity must force mr ca into creating scandal by producing bill must find nothing to say in face of threat held over cowed by look of two men finally sneaked out of room then left house have recovered sufficiently to make gay remark to ruth jennie whom met returning from walk truly man be bad to core do believe asked heron when be alone yes what say be perfectly correct confess be greatly relieved so be do think know who killed jenner might that will never get out of on other hand be inclined to think doe not know for believing assassin to have have bill must have made attempt to get from what be to be done next mr jenner be still in gaol ill ah that reminds said geoffrey taking letter out of pocket have from neil morning intended to show to interview with friend put out of head be coming down to day what exclaimed mr ca running eye over letter be well enough to travel oh yes have wonderful recuperative power see say there that intends to see mother appears have sent for must have gone to yesterday a be coming down to day be anxious to see for can not help wondering why must have sent for do think might have something to tell mr ca shook head saw other day be quite ignorant who killed husband be in infirmary now very ill think end be far off expect sent for neil to bid good bye mr ca paused for moment know heron said in spite of trail have followed can not help thinking that really killed husband can not believe person who committed murder be man who got link who dropped one under window ah then will never find out marwill might know might have recognised footpad who attacked that night suggested heron then started struck with sudden idea by way be possible that gypsy job be one of must explain how come to be so intimate with sister see that remarked mr ca with frown if knew that job have attacked husband have afterwards murdered jenner must receive short shrift from hand of inez be sentimentalist see persisted geoffrey may think that have bill may be keeping knowledge of murder quiet so job may not produce document incriminate husband inez know nothing about bill heard what husband said be such liar cried heron in disgust nevertheless believe on occasion spoke truth can not believe that sister in spite of love for reptile must go a far a to grovel to gypsy shield murderer no gypsy might have be one of who attacked marwill on night believe that killed jenner trouble more about matter heron have done must with result besides mr jenner poor soul will soon be released from unjust imprisonment if indeed be unjust death will set free what about neil wish to see mother cleared will see what say about replied mr ca closing subject in more peremptory manner than be usual with same afternoon neil webster arrived at hollyoaks looking shadow of former self pale fragile very downcast ruth jennie gave cordial welcome host geoffrey heron be lacking in heartiness kindness attention received served only to make young man more melancholy observing knowing that have seen mother mr ca took first opportunity to draw into library might be that mr jenner have told poor fellow something appeared that have yes saw neil said in reply to mr ca question be dying have seen for last time can not live many day now indeed wanted to stay beside till end must not hear of said be to go away remember always that have loved for rest be to put out of mind live a good life a must then kissed parted be that be except have commanded to stop searching for real assassin of father did say that yes said one must ever find out truth moreover that father have deserved fate be sure have not committed crime swore that be guiltless said that be quite impossible that truth must ever come to light do think know truth neil be sure doe not said if did must have told if only to put mind at rest know nothing poor mother what do intend to do obey command said neil will search more chapter xxiv piece of evidence ruth let miss brawn take entire possession of neil in spite of languid way webster be interesting study to woman so miss ca found trifle dull for geoffrey have returned to own place did not come over to hollyoaks quite so often a thought might have done yet rarely intruded upon jennie neil allowed to drift into companionship devoutly hoped must result in closer tie of marriage jennie continued to give usual lesson to little pupil after school hour ruth took off hand so that might be free to entertain neil after time recovered sufficient interest in music to take up violin with jennie spent long hour going over old music experimenting on new meanwhile ruth naturally found house extremely dull without geoffrey so spent a much time a possible in long walk in riding bicycle in paying visit one day recollected promise to call see aunt inez mr marwill have gone for change to brighton where doubt be enjoying after usual selfish fashion wife have declined to accompany giving a reason that have more to do than waste time among pack of fool a be wont to designate rest of world so remained at home attended to duty in rather joyless way still retained mild love for husband despised weakness hated lack of principle sentiment of love remained at bottom of soul companionship have begotten toleration on whole thought be not worse off than other woman at least must govern husband weaker nature must curb folly somewhat unsatisfactory employment gave plenty to do so succeeded in passing life in endurable fashion fortunately for be not woman who have capacity for being bored nine out of ten woman must have killed out of sheer weariness of flesh mr marwill continued to live on grimly ruth have often wondered in secret soul if aunt be doing penance for hidden sin be only way in must account for asceticism of life lived in ugly house in room be hideous in colour design save be occupied by master of house apartment furnished by be charming in way a stood now in stone hued drawing room melancholy of place struck ruth more than ever moreover glancing round room caught sight of copy of thomas kempis be taking to religion thought turning over leaf really wonder if there be secret in past life to account for at moment grim maid servant entered to interrupt conjecture if please miss said mistress be in garret storing thing want to know if will go up to there oh certainly said ruth wondering if aunt be mad that must invite visitor to go poking about among old lumber even though visitor be niece meekly followed maid up to top of house be introduced into long low wide attic immediately under roof here aunt inez in stone coloured dress with severe face gave icy greeting in spite of summer warmth garret be chilly joined to reception made girl shiver be glad have remembered at last ruth said mr marwill in most metallic tone be beginning to think have forgotten found difficult to leave house aunt neil webster be there of course have have to attend to heard young man be back again said in muffled voice truly wonder that brother must have in house why must neil be good fellow mother be not good woman belongs to criminal class dear aunt cried ruth be sure poor woman be more sinned against than sinning what do know of asked good lady turning terrible eye on niece have father yes have found out great deal for be sure mr jenner did not kill husband know nothing at about mr jenner be minx knew well when lived at hollyoaks taught amy lived there managed house too for poor mother never did have idea of how to conduct establishment mr jenner bold bad woman came down to westham after arrest of abominable husband lived at turnpike house there husband called to see on night be murdered on night murdered corrected mr marwill vehemently will be wiser than law ruth tell be who struck blow say that have not good cause for man be brute have right to take life did did asseverated ruth with quite a much vehemence a aunt have shewn blow be struck through window for sake of getting red why be matter aunt nothing nothing gasped mr marwill have seated suddenly on convenient box with hand to side be gazing at niece with ashen face stitch in side be child why did father tell doe know about red pocket book have heard scrap of information at time said ruth trying to get out of unpleasant position in tongue have placed know very little want to have anything to do with matter please ask anything more about aunt have said so

two men be in flame frightened wayfarer saw fire streaming towards sky saw two men vaguely struggling in flame chapter xxx truth at last be not impossible said geoffrey thunderstruck mr marwill shook head so possible that always thought so said own idea be same remarked mr ca who be third person of party now assembled in mr heron library have told several time geoffrey that believed mr jenner to be guilty young man drew long breath even now must scarcely credit news so really did kill husband there can be doubt about said mr ca pointing to envelope lying on table there be copy of confession signed in presence of chaplain governor of gaol be morning after burning down of turnpike house that conversation took place information that two charred body have be found among ruin have led geoffrey to believe that jerry have perished along with job stephen have informed on previous night that creature have made escape pursuit have be attempted there be doubt in geoffrey mind that jerry have gone to see job at turnpike house why must have done so why have come about that gypsy must have met death together must not think be mystery ever cleared up if death of jerry remained mystery that of jenner did not towards noon mr ca made appearance together with sister to see mr heron after little talk about fire geoffrey detailed what have be confessed to on previous night how did come about asked now be what want to know said inez sebastian have told nothing beyond bare fact a yet because want to tell story once for then put out of mind said brother solemnly see heron sister know about case what have told about jerry hutt visit supply last link brings crime home to mr jenner be not going to tell anyone else how murder took place have asked governor chaplain not to tell neil truth when go up for funeral have have enough trouble poor boy for one want to have more belief now that mother be innocent oh indeed interrupted mr marwill with haughty curl of lip who doe believe guilty job gypsy think that man set fire to turnpike house destroyed so a to escape penalty of crime think only merciful that must be allowed to remain under impression quite agree with said heron heartily mr marwill bowed head have ill will towards young man although hated mother have gone to account so will say no more about a to neil webster a call will continue to call interposed mr ca sternly will say nothing to continued mr marwill taking notice of interruption wish to visit sin of parent upon child with one parent murdered other parent murderess see how young man can turn out well sincerely hope that will not marry that unfortunate jenny brawn if asks to marry will not accept blindly said mr ca for intended to tell whole story suppressing fact that mr jenner be guilty be well put in geoffrey must like to hear story of mr jenner crime can tell to in few word said mr ca clerk tale have brought story up to time when jenner flung on child well mr jenner heard cry rushed down into room jenner be mad with rage at uncanny hatred shewn to by own son have by hair of head shaking a terrier doe rat mr jenner rushed at thought must kill child struggled struck while be going on found near table seeing knife blindly snatched up throwing husband to one side then clutching child to breast holding out knife to keep off infuriated man tried to make escape from house jenner be blind with fury against child against wife who have instilled such hatred into mind of boy rushed at cried out that be holding knife took notice of ran up against blade buried in heart fell wife fainted with insensible child in arm be when came to herself time afterwards that recalled what have done be by accident that have killed swore most solemnly denied that have ever intended murder then fled from house into darkness until fell insensible under hedge rest know mr marwill laughed again at account believe killed on purpose said have reason to do mr ca said coldly same believe have spoken truth jenner died by accident if be so said geoffrey slowly see reason to disbelieve why did mr jenner tell neil have killed father asked that answer be that be afraid if neil reopened case evidence might be brought forward to prove that have really committed murder have told son that be innocent did not wish to learn truth be only on giving promise not to tell that consented to make confession want to think of only a mother who loved not a murderess humph remarked geoffrey doubtfully queer way of shewing love to put into head of imaginative neurotic creature like neil that be guilty will not do harm said mr ca pretend to say that approve of clearing own name at expense of neil peace of mind be not for to judge before died repented of having made that statement did know how red pocket book be stolen asked geoffrey abruptly have be so busy struggling with jenner for possession of child said that took notice of anyone at window be why jerry a say be able to put hand in take book be lucky for clearing up of case jenner have sewn bill inside toy horse if roper have got hold of must have made hot for marwill hate like poison on account of have heard enough of story interrupted mr marwill seem to forget sebastian that if bill have really be in pocket book must have got through job be tired of hope be ended for ever yes inez will hear no more about in few day mr jenner story will be buried will try forget past neil must never know will not tell said mr marwill with for remarkable generosity one know truth ourselves will keep silence what about poor wretch who have be burnt well geoffrey must tell how jerry hutt came to see in way must prove remains to be after corpse what be left of may not be jerry think be said heron indeed be certain of expect job got quarrelling about bill job set fire to house in order to burn jerry did not burn willingly be sure of job doubt detained in burning house until be too late mr marwill shuddered job indeed be wicked a well knew now be relieved from blackmailing have only husband to deal with resolved now that be in possession of bill to make short work of thought still seemed inclined to separation romish church well good bye geoffrey mr ca said shaking hand hope ankle will soon be right ruth be coming over to see remember not word to not word said young man say ca if be must burn copy of confession original in possession of authority will be sufficient to prove mr jenner guilt must anyone else be accused be not likely after burn intend to do so mr ca dropped document into fire only brought back so that might be sure be guilty ah be in ash already wish must get rid of painful memory so easily to end of life will never forget case be last word spoke on subject for mr ca geoffrey ever afterwards carefully avoided mention of be there even turnpike house to remind of tragedy for have be burnt to ground mr heron have site ploughed enclosed in field adjoining so that next year corn waved where blood stained habitation have stood mr marwill carried out intention of separating from husband gave portion of money made present of forged bill betook money to paris neil buried mother mourned for many month then made reappearance in public be more successful than ever now that time be healing wound began to think about future first thing did be to ask jennie brawn to share with poor girl accepted with joy at once sent good news to ruth mr ca thereupon went up to london called upon girl at daughter house for be still teaching mr chisel child told whole story not thinking fair that must marry neil in ignorance of truth at first be horrified declared that nothing must alter determination to marry love said be strange story of burning of two men of murder have taken place in same house

geoffrey heron to mr marwill to governor of gaol chaplain a for story be told with other name scene be laid fifty mile from real locality end
