on whole dear rubina be prepossessed in favour of visitor a appears to be modest intelligent high principled notwithstanding delicate health effeminate look be confident that have strong will somewhat stubborn nature of may be productive in future of good evil if olive be soft yielding married life with young mr carson will doubt be happy easy a requires suspect to be deferred to in way having full confidence in own judgment if on contrary be wilful refuse to acknowledge husband a head of house fear that union will not be so perfect one a must wish to use trite image mr carson resembles iron

wore smoke coloured spectacle gave name a francis hain informed witness that be scientist that required quiet retreat in london in order to carry out certain experiment nature of did not disclose mr

hair be worn in band be dressed entirely in black witness presumed be widow at event looked like one took in bread day paid for on spot saw one else in house although called there up to june th witness never saw deceased richard brass of tottenham court road butcher gave much same evidence same woman called on gave similar account of herself be to call morning for order at athelstane place did so up to june th be paid cash on delivery of meat up to th woman appeared to be only person in house saw last on june th on th th meat be taken in house appeared to be deserted thereupon informed police witness never saw mr hain deceased amelia rankin said that be employed a domestic servant at house opposite to saw tall fair bearded man enter on several occasion also pale dark haired woman did not pay much attention to once noticed young gentleman with dark moustache looking out of first floor front window be laughing talking with one inside whom did not see appeared to be quite happy believed after viewing corpse that young gentleman saw be deceased heard noise saw nothing likely to arouse suspicion in way a rule be in kitchen with mistress who kept boarding house be seldom either of be in front of house during day be possible many people might have gone in out without being aware of several witness resident in athelstane place gave much same evidence saw mr hain housekeeper none save amelia rankin caught glimpse of deceased nearly house on side of opposite to be boarding house from lodger be absent day a landlady servant be mostly occupied in back premise be not observed in special degree indeed there be nothing about house to arouse remark in way dr rayner of bloomsbury square stated a result of post mortem examination that in opinion death be caused by wound in heart apparently inflicted by such instrument a steel knitting needle clothes over breast be to say waistcoat shirt undervest be unbuttoned tending to show that deceased be unconscious when wound be inflicted with instrument of kind supposed must probably be necessary to open clothes right hand have be cut off judging from neatness of operation surgical instrument must seem to have be used for purpose hand distorted swollen be found in grate bone of hand be diseased not sufficiently so to warrant amputation witness be of opinion that hand have be cut off by surgeon did not believe that untrained person must have performed operation with requisite skill deceased have be murdered judging from condition of body two day before discovery of remains on june th be to say on june th in answer to question put by one of jury witness stated that there be smell of chloroform perceptible about clothes of deceased in room inspector jain who discovered body said that be lying on sofa placed behind drawing room door clothing over chest region of heart have be disturbed collar necktie removed shirt stud sleeve link watch of deceased be missing pocket be empty mark on linen have be cut out there be ring on finger of left hand deceased be tall dark complexioned with smooth dark hair small black moustache from condition of body nail for instance be extremely well cared for deceased have evidently be man accustomed to refinement of life underlinen be of finest quality suit of grey tweed be evidently work of high class tailor boot be of russia leather be particularly well shaped witness thought deceased must have be gentleman in easy circumstance on searching house trunk clothes linen paper of kind be to be found in fact nothing must be likely to reveal deceased name position only strange thing have noticed be fact that clothes smelled strongly of sandal wood furniture appointment of house be property of landlord mr hain housekeeper have left anything behind by must be traced up to present in spite of effort clue to whereabouts of tenant housekeeper have be found after brief deliberation jury returned verdict of 'wilful murder against person person unknown part v extract from morning planet july despite triteness of proverb be constrained to remark with regard to athelstane place murder once again truth be stranger than fiction have one of writer of detective story imagined so extraordinary crime a having taken place in heart of busy neighbourhood within hearing almost within sight of hundred of people must have be scoffed at for exceeding bound of probability must assert have be termed exaggeration of wildest order have be proved possible in fact athelstane place bloomsbury now enjoys distinction albeit enviable one of having provided london with mystery so unfathomable that be extremely doubtful whether will ever be plumbed by keenest of detective for unravelling of so complex riddle need sergeant cuff of wilkie collins monsieur dupin of edgar allen poe in word fabulous detective such a have not at present time amongst plainly stated fact be house be taken by man who call by to obviously false name of francis hain beyond fact that wore pair of smoked glass spectacle there appears to have be little about to cause remark payment of quarter rent in advance appears to have answered satisfactorily question landlord must otherwise surely have felt incumbent upon to ask at event usual formality with respect to reference be in case entirely dispensed with ostensibly house be rented with object of carrying out certain experiment of scientific nature nameless woman calling housekeeper be active agent between mr hain so called local tradesman observe butcher baker see one woman of see tenant of deceased by chance domestic servant see naturally enough take small notice of up to june th housekeeper receives food from tradesman pay for in cash of might might not be indicative of preconceived intention to leave house suddenly after th housekeeper be seen more on th house be broken into dead man body be discovered medical evidence go to prove that be done to death on th be from day also that lose sight of mr hain tenant housekeeper vanish a completely a if earth have swallowed up thus be deprived of only two person who at time seem to have have connection with dead man disappearance coincident a be of arouses suspicion moreover by careful removal of mark from linen of deceased be left without what otherwise might have lent important clue to identity here then be problem with detective force be confronted for ourselves in case like where elementary fact be so completely concealed can at most theorise surmise for reason impossible to guess victim must seem to have be inveigled into athelstane place house a right hand be diseased be not impossible that went there a think be more likely be taken there by accomplice ostensibly to have operation performed that surgical instrument be used may safely conclude from evidence of dr rayner mr hain called scientist may have be that only at event if be be evidently skilled in surgery so far a to be able to accomplish amputation at wrist neatly let then assume that mr hain be to operate upon hand of deceased first thing must do must be to administer ansthetic in probability must be chloroform for a body be not discovered until two day after death a air be warm during interval be likely that chloroform must evaporate take therefore that deceased be choloroformed by mr hain with own consent since be about to undergo painful operation up to point assumption be comparatively clear when be asked to say why mr hain must have preferred knitting needle to of two mean be at disposal for accomplishment of end refer of course to instrument must have have at hand to chloroform further why diseased hand when amputated must have be thrown into grate confess absolutely in dark in short assumption such a be becomes hopelessly worthless when separated from evidence wholly circumstantial circumstantial evidence be a know frequently misleading before can hope to obtain data more reliable be necessary first that deceased be identified further that one if not of person who be known to be occupant of house be traced presume that in ordinary course full sufficiently minute description of deceased man will be disseminated by police be apparently gentleman may be said therefore to have occupied certain social position be fair to assume that have friend acquaintance who will recognize if not of characteristic put forth in description further probably have home if not relative somewhere in kingdom if doe not return within reasonable time inquiry will doubtless be made be probably by such mean a that deceased will be identified once be done there may be chance of capturing murderer be remarkable that deceased clothes smelled of sandal wood be essentially eastern perfume man especially gentleman living in england must hardly be in habit of using be not aware indeed if be used even in east a scent though many nation of far east such a indian chinese particularly latter make chest of sandal wood if then unknown man have at time lived in east be possible might have be in habit of keeping clothes in such chest must account for odour detected by inspector jain clue be slight still be tangible be moreover possible to assume from that unknown man came from east further that arrival in england must have be comparatively recent since have be here for length of time must surely have exchanged cumbersome box for portmanteau of western civilization suggest therefore to police that supposing of course nothing be forthcoming from deceased relative friend thorough search be made through shipping office neighbourhood of dock for existence of passenger answering to description of deceased who might recently have disembarked from one of great liner again say clue be slight one in such case a fact however insignificant be unimportant most slender circumstance may if rigorously followed up ultimately lead to result wholly unlooked for disproportionate to here then be splendid opportunity for detective to cover with glory by capture of perpetrator to prevent one of most terrible crime of recent day from being relegated to already too well filled limbo of unfathomable mystery story first scene at casterwell

yet perhaps be knowledge of guarded manner in be received that made cling more to solitary friend possessed people thought people said that there be little about good natured thick headed aldean to attract brilliant young irishman there be who went so far a to hint that boy title wealth explained that albeit mallow be well nigh aggressively independent left orphan with comparatively little money at early age have won prize taken scholarship at great public school have maintained at oxford by early effort left university with full brain empty pocket have undertaken tutorship of aldean to gain breathing time while cast around for choice of career when aldean came of age mallow left fair enough scholar admirable athlete went to london became journalist power with pen attached to weekly

young irishman habitually mallow tongue be razor like in acerbity aldean though took full advantage of friendship between spoke pretty plainly when judged lordship deserved correction invariably spared where must have spared none else have indeed established friendship on very durable basis by extremely simple process of shutting eye to one fault opening very wide to one virtue young irishman have brilliant flash of silence be on occasion that found aldean so agreeable companion in fact boy be a pet dog to mallow agreeable company not given to criticism aldean eh yes what asked lordship looking up from ally sloper have read account of athelstane place murder yes fellow killed with knitting needle be yes thrust into heart devilish queer case morning planet seems to think unfortunate

see good deal more of than will moth candle eh not at aldean simile be quite inapt be not moth can miss bellairs be compared to candle be not kind of girl to scorch poor butterfly that flutter round right old chap need take one quite so seriously a do may a well be serious too do know be thinking of getting married be news to whom do intend to honour so far may ask miss ostergaard if concurs aldean heaved huge sigh by george be ripping girl certainly might do worse replied laurence musingly be very good girl clever too doe reciprocate know laugh at may be just method of showing affection

be proselytising beast that drabble oh be rubbish 'in spring young girl fancy lightly turn to thought of love ' not anarchy be spring said literal aldean miss ostergaard be girl to marry for rank then make love to properly will marry for love wish must be not clever chap like mallow dear boy be not clever on contrary be fool perfect fool for do not love miss bellairs like idiot when while know well be going to marry carson man from india so be be queer said aldean reflectively queer how do mean oh nothing old man be thinking of murder case fact of men coming from india struck that be see carson just on way home now be did know said mallow alertly yes miss slarge know babylonian mark of beast woman told that sister in bombay have written carson be on way home by p o liner pharaoh pharaoh arrived time back said mallow gloomily must be at casterwell by time be not there two day ago when ran up to town well must be quite two week since pharaoh arrived what ardent lover chap must be wish stood in shoe be must let grass grow under on way to 'own true love ' not that miss bellairs can strictly be said to stand in relation to man have never set eye upon very fact that have to marry must be sufficient to make hate by jove what rum go must be if carson turned out to be man murdered in athelstane place mallow stared what on earth put wild idea into head said know do know why must be so ready to call wild man who be killed came from india a say say so be theory of morning planet be just possible that might be carson seeing that have turned up at casterwell continued aldean not heeding mallow interruption really jim did credit with vivid imagination oh of course be merely idea mallow what strike be that if carson arrived two week ago certainly ought to have put in appearance at casterwell before if only out of curiosity to see future wife dear fellow carson may need kit before call on miss bellairs surely must wish to create good impression suppose must present in sandal wood scented clothes never said must even so must take fortnight mallow leaned back pinched chin reflectively have great faith in friend prognostication still must not help being struck by suggestion coupling carson with victim of athelstane place be certainly queer that man from india must be two week in england without fulfilling very object for journey have be made have arrived in pharaoh on th of june murder have be committed on th yet so far have not presented at casterwell prime fact certainly coincided be very odd mallow must not deny that idea be incredible said aloud hundred of men arrive from india week besides carson never be in england in life miss bellairs told so why must be murdered immediately on arrival where be motive have found mare nest jim dare say replied aldean stolidly be bare idea very wild very absurd one boy there be nothing to connect sandal wood man a call with carson perhaps not mallow if carson doe not turn up soon will begin to think that idea be not so ridiculous a say if doe not turn up repeated mallow with emphasis be just will turn up if be only to take from only girl ever really cared about trite saying doubt true one in case fellow say same thing said aldean a train slowed down into reading station here be casterwell lie a one know must know seeing that be one of prettiest village in home county amongst berkshire hill ten mile from

carelessly know like trust carson be quite with said mallow bitterly unfortunately dislike distrust can assist to avert ceremony be true what will be will be with morsel of philosophy parted aldean for ceremony at church mallow to rail at fate for having so cruelly deprived of olive be not until after breakfast that aldean found opportunity of delivering mallow note to olive a slipped into hand

reason of unpopularity olive be who have selected dismal spot in to pas honeymoon one desire be to have solitude solitude deux solitude absolute complete husband in way interfered with desire sauntered about smoking endless cigarette scanning such sample of modern french fiction a came to hand few day ran up to town what did there olive knew not did trouble to inquire did notice that invariably appeared highly delighted with on returning from jaunt left to own device olive amused a best must thought more of mallow be consistent with own peace of mind olive said angus one day at luncheon have paid first year income in to account thank be very kind of replied olive cheerfully be necessary to pay in whole amount at once need only pay quarterly a wished to be perfectly free to handle money thought best to get done be about money that have be so often up to london well yes have be seeing after how be mr dimbal have not seen mr dimbal have nothing to do with business now save in so far a income be concerned affair be in hand of firm of lawyer olive be vaguely troubled of course have confidence in said be sorry did not leave business with mr dimbal be so very trustworthy there be other honest men in london replied carson with usual smile by way how long do intend to stay here have now be exiled for three week be thinking of going home in fortnight so if will suit oh a to consider be going to london surely mean to let return alone really must not think how everybody will talk carson shrugged shoulder care what say replied without least show of temper to tell truth be rather tired of farce refuse to treat in way a husband surely can not complain if betake elsewhere thought relative position be quite clear said mr carson coldly married simply solely in obedience to father dying wish married well married suppose for fifty thousand pound went with in other word marriage be bargain if please matter little what call pleasant position for said carson good humouredly wife sat silently looking at plate while continued to eat luncheon with utmost indifference perhaps position be trying one for said at length dictated term of union very clearly in first instance be perfectly free to accept reject accepted reason be own doubt be good one quite right ours be purely business marriage bargain can call that between if be different kind of man if cared for thing might perhaps be different care for know what love be excuse if say that be hardly in position to judge replied angus quietly be not trifle inconsistent if loved in what position must stand seeing that affection be very definitely engaged excuse if in turn say that be not in position to speak a to that may think so be not blind oh be too late in day to talk of love wish to do duty retorted olive rather weakly must be confessed have done duty said carson amiably have obeyed father have brought fifty thousand pound love do care two straw about then why did marry for money solely replied shamelessly served turn served be in love with do think must rest content with purely nominal position of husband by mean for money sake made wife agreed to term because suited to do so have ever gone contrary to in way fulfil part of bargain admirably said scornfully then can ask more of will not return to manor house with to hold ignominious position mutual end be accomplished let part do intend to leave then asked feeling at disadvantage do will go to london perhaps even abroad at event intend to lead own life think of position will be placed in think of position be placed in replied emphatically people will talk if leave so soon after marriage must leave to make best excuse can position be of own making can say that health be bad that doctor have ordered abroad will pay visit now then to keep up appearance more can not ask of more be not disposed to grant olive rose struck table with open hand protest against attitude cried indignantly a do against yours be not treating fairly said keeping back tear with effort a fairly a treat surely if agree to be wife if interrupted prefer matter to remain a be be useless to feign what of feel having so far humiliated olive be not prepared to go further realized that position be whit a strong a own must resent behaviour in way seeing that original compact be of own making dismayed at predicament in found retired to room to consider what must do finally determined must leave must go to london for few month mr purcell be on way to england have expressed intention of taking house in old lady must gladly have to stay with perhaps might even invite tui to join must blind casterwell people at event must not know that angus have left so soon be only possible solution must think of evening dined in room have fancy for renewal of discussion must avail nothing if husband have made up mind to go go must all must say do must not serve to deter silence be only dignified course open to so brought to bear upon a much of little stock of philosophy a must muster have to confess be poor consolation felt lonely very miserable later in evening maid came to with request that might take walk girl be looking far from well olive did not hesitate to let go have become attached to clara found woman of refinement capacity withal respectful never have shown slightest inclination to take advantage of favour olive might have shown yet there be something strange about girl puzzled mistress not little more than once have surprised weeping bitterly there be time when olive have thought be unnecessarily jubilant olive have questioned about emotional outburst with satisfactory result so in time ceased to notice girl be always perfect in performance of duty saw clara go out for walk sooner have gone than olive felt more restless ill at ease than ever atmosphere of house stifled wished have asked maid for hat thing before went felt must give way to hysteric unless did something must neither read write must sit still felt must get into fresh air put on hat cloak went out night be windy rather cold suited overstrung nerve rapidly up down esplanade walked drinking in keen air watching dark cloud drive across sickly moon up down up down until limb grew weary with fatigue excitement abated at last slowly climbing step to top of cliff returned to hotel way lay through small shrubbery parted from road by slight iron railing beside gas lamp flared in wind must see man woman talking earnestly together did not hear a drew near man stooped kissed woman next moment swept past wrathful resentful have recognized husband chapter ii brooch hour later carson sauntered into sitting room found olive awaiting have not seen a passed in darkness be therefore at loss to comprehend full significance of present expression be at loss to know why be waiting for did not usually seek at so late hour however opened conversation in usual easy going way hallo said not in bed yet will lose beauty sleep will be so kind a to sit down replied olive coldly wish to speak to on very pleasant subject must say returned carson taking chair well what be matter with yawn have regard for decency angus a much a neighbour suppose how have be transgressing by meeting woman to night carson started what woman asked irritably know retorted olive with heat did not see face must have recognized if have associate be not mine still understand said angus composedly seemingly relieved there be none so blind a who wo see be taking walk just now saw speaking to woman under gas lamp opposite hotel dare deny deny why must angus how can be so shameless saw saw well that be more than friendly with seem to have seen great deal sneered carson coolly may ask what right have to spy upon action what right right of wife pardon be not wife returned ironically be partner in business transaction thought be agreed on point once for when do go to london again asked to morrow answered have anything to urge against going claim no right to control action can only say that a agreed for large sum of money to act a nominal husband must fulfil part of bargain so far a to treat with respect how have failed to do so by meeting woman to night nonsense one saw must deny right to call to account in way however have nothing to do with going to london have objection to must advise to stop there never wish to see again wish be mutual assure said carson rising in turn be glad that have come to understanding at last will do a suggest think very much better that must marriage be very great mistake pardon agree with be surely unqualified success inasmuch a have attained aim blame there be must attach to a much a to might of course under ordinary circumstance have have right to object to meeting lady a did a be can have shadow of right to do so at least might conduct a gentleman whilst be here returned olive bitterly suppose be asking too much great deal too much can ask nothing carson shrugged shoulder be hardly conversation added at event must excuse if say doe not interest a say have better part after leave for town in morning will trouble more thank god said olive moving towards door of room at least will be spared indignity of living with allow said carson stretching forward to open door for good night good bye contemptible cur said wife disappearing slamming door behind smiled a looked after cur be be lucky for miss bellairs use teeth more fully to substantiate simile must know ah well drawing long sigh of relief thank goodness be over what weary dreary time have be however at last can enjoy fruit of labour after money be well worth trouble mr carson proceeded to bar to drink toast to release in glass of lemonade temperance be one of good point when olive rose next morning be gone bag baggage said word of farewell did even leave note behind felt immensely relieved yet must not help feeling have debased that self respect be sullied have be fatal mistake olive be not woman to sit down with ash on head bemoan fate suppressing fact that husband have left that intended to explain personally later wrote to miss slarge that after further two week stay at sandbeach intended leaving for london feel like returning to casterwell at present wrote must rather spend winter month in london please let know when expect mr purcell be most anxious to see when be settled in town tui must come up that may be together sent kind message to mr brock to miss ostergaard inquired if mallow be still with lord aldean miss slarge did not omit to answer last query be still there be greatest comfort to to know that few day later came letter from mr dimbal seriously alarmed drew attention to fact that carson have recently sold security in money be invested transferred proceeds to crdit lyonnais in paris suspicious of carson behaviour generally more especially when came to taking thing altogether out of hand mr dimbal have made inquiry have ascertained what now wrote to olive must not understand at have known whereabouts must straightway have written to for explanation have left without address have vanished completely out of life apparently be intention that fund must vanish with probably thousand pound paid to credit be must ever see of position be certainly becoming serious recalled mr purcell letter description of carson read over extract have made with result that wrote again to casterwell time of people to mr drabble that lady reply roused strongest suspicion in regarding husband felt time have come when must no longer cope with thing unaided first impulse be to call in assistance of mr dimbal on second thought refrained little jog trot solicitor be hardly man to deal with clever scoundrel of carson type for scoundrel now fully believed to be there be mallow be capable beyond doubt by love for have not claimed right to serve in time of need must write to without loss of time next day be at sandbeach olive be in sitting room when servant brought up name in adjacent bedroom clara be attending to work ah mr carson said have schooled to say name be indeed glad to see again be not looking after oh be well enough really said olive giving hand be terribly worried worried repeated mallow sitting down near worried what about before olive must reply door leading to bedroom opened abruptly clara came in with hat in hand beg pardon ma'be said maid do wish hat left out from packing yes of course replied olive astonished at asking so unnecessary question thank ma'be girl retired olive must have be more than astonished have seen minute later door be left slightly ajar girl ear be taking in word must catch that young woman be still with see observed laurence yes be very excellent servant replied olive why oh nothing merely remarked fact said mallow who have reason for keeping own counsel to continue conversation why be worried will tell everything shortly meanwhile want to read olive placed in hand extract have copied from mr purcell letter pointed out to one paragraph in particular mr carson have have golden wrist button made to match unique bracelet wrought in same style of vastly inferior workmanship well now look at detached brooch laid on table be circular gold ornament carved with three face of hindoo trinity encircled by lotus wreath handsome odd piece of workmanship indian wrist button said mallow looking at carefully imitated from carson bracelet doubt suppose be one of referred to by mr purcell be be sure of carson gave to no did not be wedding present from margery drabble told be doll locket did not notice particularly at time on reading mr purcell letter again suddenly dawned upon that be one of carson wrist button how did margery come by well wrote to mr drabble about replied that margery have taken from father desk on mine be thine principle now said olive what possible connection can there be between dr drabble husband chapter iii clara letter mallow stared at astonished at earnestness with spoke be afraid quite follow said at length of course carson know dr drabble met at casterwell be just point be for first time met at casterwell suppose so so far a must see be never very intimate with man then why must present with pair of gold wrist button said olive especially pair wore pair have made to match bracelet yes be strange admitted mallow must be if be fact said olive for one moment believe that gave to drabble at then how do suppose drabble came by said olive be just where be at loss where need help be what must find out mr carson one minute mr mallow be mr carson well presume so be married to said mallow somewhat bewildered be married to one yes be that one angus carson mallow jumped up hurriedly be not thinking of absurd story told be not that think absurd now on contrary be coming to believe more in sense of hour said mallow made possible inquiry in london immediately before marriage visited athelstane place questioned police must find nothing absolutely nothing to connect husband in ever so remote degree with murder besides look at fact in favour mr brock recognized simply from resemblance to father appearance corresponds exactly with description of given by mr purcell even to wearing of bangle remember seeing wear wrist button said olive woman know be observant of little thing do remember mr slarge reading out sister letter in presence of angus yes perfectly be then carson showed bangle yes well looked then for wrist button noticed wore silver sleeve link on particular occasion perhaps never wore others retorted olive again again watched for be first have seen come from margery not from angus did speak to husband about a say be busy when margery gave to slipped into pocket without thinking be only on looking at again other day that resemblance to bracelet struck wear a stud rather than a brooch see have catch pin well think perhaps best way must be to ask husband how dr drabble come to posse wrist button so similar to bracelet olive turned suddenly pale hung head can not said faintly have left left repeated mallow scarcely able to believe ear why when nearly fortnight ago be not possible for to continue living together hated did not care in least for be solely for money that married now that have have further use for agreed be best to separate be glad to do so be man left for not of own free will know be victim of circumstance told everything about father letter here be read tell if must have acted otherwise in silence mallow took letter from noticed that hand trembled in silence read through be strange letter have apparently be written under stress of great mental excitement man might have be in mortal terror when penned line warning at close be very cry of anguish what do say now asked olive can say nothing seem to move in world of mystery admit that acted rightly admit that be forced to obey letter answered mallow whether acted rightly be not quite same thing be not just to cried olive passionately loved father dearly be always so good to must have be wicked to ignore so solemn command have be only question of money must readily have surrendered to mr brock father dying wish must not disregard must not admit that said laurence reluctantly what miserable result be olive covered face with hand know know cried sin of father be visited on child oh what can there have be in father life to make sacrifice so cruelly mr brock be father oldest friend might perhaps know doe not know for asked very day before hateful marriage of mine must give answer must not understand letter in india in england said father life be above reproach yet there must be something mused mallow there be few men who have not turned down page somewhere in book of life a rule be not shown even to dearest closest of friend mortal million live alone a arnold put well ca be helped said olive despairingly there be nothing to be gained by probing past in present may be able to do something to return to wrist button in first place carson never wore one moment interrupted mallow must be quite sure of before can accept a evidence of value be always possible may have have by yet not have worn whether gave to dr drabble be matter have perhaps better write get mr drabble to ask husband be exactly what did replied that be more than dared to do know be frightened to death of on contrary implored not to tell lest margery must get into trouble man can hardly blame for following own teaching said laurence grimly have be at pain to teach to look upon other people belonging a own naturally child thought be doing wrong so mr drabble wo speak to husband well must do so then when get back to town have doctor address there yes so happens that have be trying to enlist sympathy towards revolutionary project gave town address asked to call mallow took out pocket book poplar street soho be where life veritable hotbed of foreign rascality doubt well that disposes for present of one more piece of evidence what else have two day ago said olive received from angus producing letter said that be going to london possibly even abroad have evidently gone abroad for be written from florence so see said mallow glancing over letter florence a address be somewhat vague fear may follow suppose pray read letter mr mallow laurence did so there be merely half dozen line to effect that writer did not intend to return that gave wife full freedom apologizing for anything might have done to distress be bad lot said mallow in disgust still can not see how letter be going to help for matter what doubt cast upon identity ca see burst out olive why wrote that moreover wrote with right hand have seen writing of left can be read only with great difficulty be perfectly plain easily legible yet when be here always declared right hand be much too painful to use in way yes admit there may be something in said mallow might not one else have written for perhaps be of course just possible doubt believe right hand be hurt at merely feigned uselessness for own end mr purcell declared that be useless alluded to carson hand man tell be not carson remember one day when be out climbed slight cliff scrambled up first on looking back saw angus climbing up with hand there be other time too when forgot have even seen take arm right out of sling use hand perfectly freely when spoke to about always must have be mistaken tried to get to remove bandage show hand excuse be that doctor have strictly forbidden to do so no believe mr mallow be right that letter be written by man with right hand carson be impostor really be very well argued said mallow puzzled there be flaw however can consider later pray go on what be third reason mr dimbal writes to that angus let call that for present have realized security have placed proceeds to own credit at crdit lyonnais in paris now real angus carson must not do quite see why must not said mallow admit of course be strange still even so find difficult to believe man be impostor without more direct convincing evidence be tell be replied olive resolutely truly believe that man who be murdered in athelstane place be real carson right hand diseased hand remember be cut off doubt to procure bracelet for impostor man clothes smelt of sandal wood most unusual perfume so did of poor wretch who be killed newspaper description of dead man corresponds exactly with man who call husband never by chance spoke to of father of life in india never cared for be only too ready to part from only action of note since be married have be to sell stock transfer proceeds to foreign bank where can deal with be convinced mr mallow that be not angus carson go even further believe that murdered angus carson in order to impersonate be a sure of a be well that be alive god help be married to wretch olive became so agitated that mallow begged to lie down do say what must must not shake conviction when saw somewhat more composed left started off for good brisk walk that might turn thing over in mind be quite dusk when got back to sandbeach hour later must probably have failed to see small white package lying on path way be in narrow side street leading from esplanade to railway station a be not only saw took trouble to stop pick up proved to be somewhat bulky letter addressed to jeremiah trall esq poplar street soho london mallow instinct a soon a read be to drop tall figure of woman coming quickly round corner arrested attention saw that be eagerly searching for something came up to letter sir ejaculated hurriedly dropped thank snatched from before have time to recover be gone clara trall gasped thunderstruck will follow have right to do yet address of letter be address of dr drabble in london more mystery more scheming what on earth can mean be many long day before mallow found answer to question chapter iv more mystery for various reason mallow have not taken up abode in same hotel a olive have found clean unpretentious little place near station suited well enough in present mood here ate solitary dinner cooked served in thoroughly english style invariably fastidious over food laurence be not now inclined to be more particular about than be about lodging ate little good cigar strong black coffee felt must do more for just now than food inquired from waiter how train ran to london for have doubt that on morrow must be necessary for to use curiously enough waiter knew about train notwithstanding fact that be aboriginal a well a waiter on ' y two decent one from 'ere to lunnon said ganymede will see sir in time table there be one leaf ten ' o mornin ' at six at night git to lunnon in about three hour so yer see ai express like even then ten in morning mused mallow ah be trifle too early may a well have day with olive to cheer up evening train will suit can see drabble in soho next morning be if be in town mallow finished coffee cigar then lit fresh one slipped on coat for night be chilly strolled round to big hotel be shown at once to mr carson sitting room found almost a much agitated a have be when left oh laurence said calling by christian name in excitement how glad be that have come have gone have gone who have gone asked laurence pausing in act of removing coat clara maid replied olive can not understand at appeared perfectly content with place said nothing about leaving be only when sent for to dress for dinner found have gone what can mean probably seems extraordinary to replied mallow coolly confess be not surprised clara have gone to join carson olive gasped to join husband said incredulously what have clara to do with be what must like to know carson have be in habit of meeting girl for time past before be married aldean saw together carefully refrained from letting know anything about until quite recently suppose be afraid of what must do to scoundrel save under present circumstance must not have told a have little doubt have gone to be right must know oh cried olive suddenly recollecting then be woman saw night before husband left saw talking with woman quite close to hotel recognized face must not see yes must have be clara scoundrel murmured mallow there be clearly something between girl be probably spy spy on for what reason semberry must probably explain understand that be instrumental in finding girl for be true mr arne whose address gave be anxious to find place for so wrote of course in usual way for reference be excellent one did not hesitate to engage so far a go be first class servant probably be servant at said mallow bluntly have appearance manner of one even aldean noticed that by way have mr arne letter olive nodded keep letter for six month before destroy said rising must have hers wait one moment will go fetch carson returned with letter mallow read through carefully must gather nothing from noted address amelia street kensington commented on firm masculine character of writing mr arne be evidently woman of strong will considerable character said replacing pocket book for know may be mixed up in plot plot echoed olive looking scared what plot well said mallow can hardly say definitely there be certainly plot of kind sooner later will know more about at present must be content to know object be undoubtedly to secure fifty thousand pound for whom be question carson semberry clara trall even dr drabble seem to have something to do with then think there be connection between husband that horrid doctor yes do must tell shortly before six o'clock evening a be coming home from walk picked up in one of small street here letter dropped evidently by clara of yours for just a be reading address on came rushing round corner snatched from hand flew off with before have time to do more than notice that be be more than probable that left by six o'clock train for london think went to london oh see think have gone off to florence to husband yes think that something more mr carson letter picked up be addressed to jeremiah trall poplar street soho clara father suppose well may be father may be dr drabble poplar street happens to be town address gave must not surprise in least to find that in pursuit of anarchistic scheme found useful to have well let call nom de guerre why must take clara name know that trall be clara real name retorted mallow mind be purely hypothetical jeremiah trall may may not be drabble at event address be same soho be hotbed of anarchism in possession of wrist button by drabble seems to clearly to point to intimacy with carson so called carson interrupted olive well have not quite proved that yet link of chain run something like mr arne whoever may be give clara whoever may be character be palpably false mean false a regard identity not capability for proved to be be said for from fact be justified in concluding that mr arne be in way implicated feel convinced that clara be not servant semberry induces to engage prof connection carson meet clara several time clearly be intimate with wrist button must seem to connect drabble with carson soho address associate with clara save address wrist button of course be substantial fact rest be deduction pure simple be logical deduction to thinking point strongly to secret association for secret purpose between people purpose take be to secure sum of fifty thousand pound what make think that clara have not gone to london that letter replied mallow promptly be very bulky believed contained report of conversation here to day clara be in next room remember how when heard voice came in with obviously feigned excuse noticed when returned to bedroom left door ajar overhearing of course became aware of doubt a to carson identity probably became alarmed lest must go further discover connection with think be reason of sudden departure whilst very existence of letter seems to to show that london be not destination have be going there need not have written must have called at poplar street soho said what have to say do follow have probably got out at station on way up be now on way to dover en route for italy olive passed hand over forehead be very confusing said in troubled voice very fanciful might add rejoined be sure have taken box chambermaid said so mallow shook head have better not rest content with second hand evidence when can have first said where be room can go see oh yes must have gone before have be so confused with one thing let go search at once taking lighted candle from side table olive led way along corridor room be not far away must find box there must have removed while be out said olive in dismay took stroll shortly after left head be aching so oh what wicked artful girl be probably quite used to fitting said mallow looking round room hallo torn up paper in grate must look at hold candle moment please mr carson clara have not be fool enough to leave behind anything likely to betray one envelope mallow found proved truth of one of supposition have italian stamp on corner be addressed miss clara trall grand hotel sandbeach inghilterra husband writing cried olive a mallow rose dusted knee yes from florence dated four day back look at post mark put matter beyond doubt mr carson husband wrote to to join in italy have gone to dover not to london surely what can clara be to man accomplice certainly returned to sitting room mr carson sat down looking hopelessly bewildered what be to do now asked communicate with police said mallow have fact to give know carson have possession of money must remember have legal possession of know that be in italy clara have joined there be nothing there for police be there beyond can say nothing not even that carson be impostor will not be long now before be able to settle point mr purcell arrives from india in couple of day time portrait of carson have one interrupted olive be so vain that actually have done by one of men on beach there be copy in room dare say can find tell mr mallow what do intend to do now whilst be hunting for photograph mallow explained think said have better go to london see mr arne then will look up semberry after well then think will drop in on dr drabble in soho will broach matter directly think must be wise to do if thing be a suspect have to deal with dangerous lot will find out can without letting have suspicion be to say from mr arne semberry a for drabble intend to join will become anarchist become anarchist echoed olive turning round photograph in hand yes be only chance of gaining confidence must do if be to get at truth will bring trouble upon oh laughed mallow will stop short of throwing bomb promise oh be dangerous said mr carson sighing how can thank sufficiently for trouble be taking here be photograph laurence glanced at one represented carson standing straight stiff against stone wall for world a if be going to be shot be not work of art likeness be excellent mallow nodded a if be well satisfied will serve purpose capitally said putting in pocket mr purcell must have difficulty in saying if be be not man saw in bombay well mr carson added abruptly must say good night good night what time to morrow do leave not until evening train six o'clock mr purcell doe not arrive for two day yet so have plenty of time good night thus did mallow take first step on dark tortuous way be to follow led downward into under world of crime danger found good even in sordid depth doubt mystery surrounding holding life in hand on on went never flinching never yielding never losing sight of clue until at last led to truth third scene in london chapter mysterious mr arne for long time past mallow have be turning over in mind scheme of new novel upon be most anxious to commence work now that mr carson have called upon to aid to solution of many mystery by seemed to be surrounded be obliged to put thought of from with energy must command threw into business on hand here be romance in real life surpassing most elaborate invention of fiction be task to round off to satisfactory finish be not easy of actual fact have little to guide neither must hope to extract much from chiefly concerned be forced to grope way in well nigh utter darkness only by light of fresh material yet to be gathered must be able to use to advantage be already at command of procuring such fresh material saw small chance at present here a in most thing be first step be so important inclined to think that two head be better than one from sandbeach have written at length to friend aldean telling have taken place there how have shifted olive trouble so far a be able on to own more capable shoulder result be that aldean came up to london almost immediately presented at mallow chamber in moon street full of curiosity anxiety to assist in crusade against carson company in substantiation of belief in old proverb mallow accepted offer here be head at event if not exceptionally brilliant one so aldean took up quarter at house in kensington prepared for exciting time be good of jim said mallow at first meeting know must much rather be at casterwell playing with amaryllis in shade according to habit amaryllis come to london next week replied jim with something of blush mr purcell have invited oh in case patience will not be put to so great test have mr purcell arrived yes be in town now settled in friend house have taken over for winter miss slarge showed long johnsonian missive in mr purcell stated be 'elevating shingle ' in guelph road campden hill how may ask did mr purcell translate 'elevating shingle ' into english oh ca remember old lady long winded sentence be now in guelph road miss slarge with miss ostergaard come up next week of course mr purcell know nothing of mr carson matrimonial trouble dare say must have asked too must ask said mallow hastily will call on mr purcell explain circumstance will never do for mr carson to be left alone in trouble take care mallow interest in mr carson may be misconstrued oh rubbish mr purcell be woman of sense be sure so long a keep own counsel can say nothing want mr carson to revert a much a possible to condition of affair before unhappy marriage when mystery be cleared up will be able to start fresh will depend of course mainly upon identity of man carson said aldean nothing of sort contradicted mallow sharply wincing same whatever be be wife there be getting past fact may get divorce carson gone off with girl quite so have not so far treated with cruelty well know idiotcy of dc for heaven sake jim drop mr carson right assented aldean see nerve be jumpy on subject let get to matter in hand about carson mess what do think of big business jim nasty painful business with strong element of criminality of course be very vague confused on surface beneath be convinced there be very orderly well constructed conspiracy progressing mallow sat down lighted pipe now let look at fact said there can be doubt that semberry forced that girl on mr carson a spy carson too must have known before came to casterwell must not have be meeting on quiet so soon after came there overheard conversation with mistress in sitting room of hotel unfortunately be not till be about to leave noticed have left bedroom door ajar must have closed however lost time in reporting what have heard to poplar street understand be same address that drabble gave a own that consider brings into business then bolted to join carson in florence that think be proved by envelope found in grate of bedroom be main fact really think that drabble be in swindle do from fact of address also from wrist button turning up so far a know must only have got from carson must seem to show that knew carson somewhere before came to casterwell present argue certain degree of intimacy be one view said jim quickly there be if carson be fraud may be sure that be real man who be murdered in athelstane place sandal wood scent form link between true false well admitting that even then wrist button must have passed through false carson hand to reach drabble have nothing to lead to suppose that doctor have anything to do with murder humph paper said remember that only surgeon must have amputated right hand so neatly be wild theory said mallow let stick to fact whoever carson may be forget have yet to prove impostor one thing be sure of be that clara trall be spy do intend questioning semberry about no must put on guard at once will go to amelia street see mr arne same thing applies to surely will merely call on mr carson behalf to inform that clara left mistress service without warning of kind ask if can throw light on eccentric behaviour be quite natural mr carson must wish to know will thus throw onus of explanation on will only lie to may not even do probably will express very great regret confess inability to understand well of course be probable must chance may let fall something of value aldean put on hat coat so intend to begin with clue asked dubiously well think be most likely to bear fruit what about murder asked aldean mallow pointed to neat pile of newspaper cutting be refreshing memory on point for present think will leave alone have not yet anything sufficiently strong to connect carson with sandal wood be not enough believe in going slowly relying on fact only well old man good bye good luck said lord aldean see again soon took off to transact small business of own same afternoon mallow dressed smartly strolled down to kensington through park without difficulty found amelia street proved to be in centre of fashionable locality inhabitant be evidently people of wealth a mounted step of must not help wondering at mr arne connection with very shady matter have in hand for moment clue did not look promising be mr arne at home asked footman who came to door mr arne sir said man with stare know one of name sir mallow felt sudden shock of surprise at unexpectedness of answer be mr arne house surely asked hastily sir replied man mr dacre life here be mr dacre in demanded laurence after few moment reflection be not sir mr dacre be at present out of town sir mr dacre be at home sir in case please give card ask if will be so good a to see for few moment footman departed shortly returning conducted mallow upstairs to magnificently furnished drawing room where be received by pretty though vulgar looking woman shrill of speech horribly over dressed at glance mallow guessed have become possessed of unlimited cash late in life mr dacre have probably made fortune in rapid manner be characteristic of latter day wife be now in throe of acclimatization to altered circumstance in direction there be copious evidence of huge banking account mr mallow said mr dacre assuming dignity suited not at looking at card through eye glass yes have taken liberty of calling upon to ask if know anything of mr arne who lived here mr dacre looked at in surprise do know mr arne be hardly acquaintance of mine only know a dressmaker dressmaker repeated mallow with gasp be not really even that continued voluble lady pray be seated mr mallow mr arne be in fact person who go out sewing be recommended to a intelligent needlewoman by one of friend a wished costume altered employed for few week be here now mr dacre oh dear finished work dismissed week ago do happen to have address indeed have not what must do with person address engaged woman did bidding dismissed be not likely ever to see again may ask with increasing stateliness if person be friend of yours have not even seen replied mallow hastily lady friend of mine in country requires maid heard that mr arne have one for whom wished to find situation mr dacre grew scarlet with anger absurd ridiculous burst out why mr arne be quite common person clever with needle admit quite respectful idea of recommending maid nevertheless did so said mallow taking delight in touching upon weak spot of purse proud little lady friend wrote to mr arne at address received reply a mr dacre eye through medium of double glass fell on letter mallow placed in hand almost screeched own paper gasped hussy must have stolen clara trall recommends clara trall creature of whom have never heard a good maid maid oh sewing woman too common vulgar dressmaker mr mallow mr mallow be lower order coming to be very large question mr dacre at present perhaps have better confine to one do happen to know major semberry never heard of did mr arne ever mention not that know of of course spoke little to will say knew how to hold tongue did major semberry know believe so at event gave friend address a mr arne major too upon word doe sound at respectable lost h simultaneously with temper will know of mr arne recommending maid from 'ouse on writing paper mallow shrugged shoulder have got information be likely to get so prepared to take leave mr dacre be too intent upon own grievance to attempt to stop at door whither followed asked one more question what be mr arne like mr drace can give description of appearance dark foreign looking person with eye always on floor tread like cat think be foreigner for english never never will foreigner enter door again mallow bowed out stopping at door for word with smart footman mr arne be in house for time mistress tell how be did not tell so have only be here week sir replied man mallow gave shilling went off dark foreign looking woman repeated strange again be very much like description newspaper give of housekeeper at athelstane place semberry know carson of casterwell be semberry bosom friend humph must be surprised if murdered man be real carson after chapter ii mr purcell after interview with mr dacre mallow first impulse be to see semberry tax with deception have practised upon olive be not man who gave way to impulse quickly realized that to do at stage must simply be to put major on guard plainly be connected in way with mr arne seemed more than likely from description of given by mr dacre that so called dressmaker be identical with so called housekeeper of athelstane place in dealing with people so astute so dangerous mallow saw that only chance lay in gaining confidence in way next move must be to see drabble if necessary in character of convert to view doctor vanity must be flattered in enthusiasm must not hesitate to welcome a member of band once let become acquainted with scheme of anarchist might hope for much knowledge by other mean must be unattainable risk be considerable that knew well for thus to connect with set of fearless fanatic be to play with fire with vengeance once oath taken be tool of ruffian if broke might be necessary for olive sake became prey have fancy to be blown to piece to be stabbed in dark be risk must perforce accept if be to carry thing through decided to take affiliate with brotherhood mind made up on point found even looking forward with certain thrill of excitement to risk be about to run plainly speaking be spy venturing into unknown land of snare pitfall least false step might prove fatal not only to hope to life however before actually involving called on mr purcell be anxious to tell about olive to induce to take girl under protection for time being presented at campden hill one afternoon about five o'clock be graciously received by old lady with whom be especial favourite tui miss slarge have already arrived be established there a mr purcell guest olive be still at sandbeach shunned meeting even tui miss slarge knew that must ask question must necessitate explaining invidious position in be placed be still under impression that husband be with wondered why happy pair did not return to manor house on point mallow preserved judicious silence for present though have fully made up mind to take mr purcell into confidence must be necessary in order to enlist sympathy for olive to carry out purpose subject be delicate one must require careful handling majestic female be mr purcell with haughty eye roman nose be a stout a sister be lean be draped with funereal pomp in silk crape ornament of glistening jet moved slowly spoke slowly modelled speech on best tradition of hero dr johnson look be monumental conversation ponderous resembled ideal britannia without be said helmet trident in domestic life have flippantly be compared to gibbon decline fall indeed there be something of epic about awe inspiring stately have never made enjoyed joke in life pallas lady macbeth hannah more mr purcell be combination of three mr mallow said bearing down on visitor with full canvas be glad to welcome to temporary hearth with sister a with vivacious miss ostergaard be already acquainted expect lord aldean for time being circle be limited a observe mallow greeted two lady how be book getting on authoress sighed only moderately well mr mallow said wearily be at present employed in identifying etruscan lituus with pontifical crosier of account be so contradictory that be not easy to reconcile how be olive demanded tui irrelevantly be well happy be not that superfluous question under circumstance replied mallow evasively tui looked at hardly must not have asked on contrary letter give different impression fear from that doe not get on well with husband ti difficult observed mr purcell who have returned to tea table for newly married pair to live in complete accord with one effect of respective training have to be taken into account only influence of time coupled with forbearance on side can adapt idiosyncrasy of one to of other olive have be reared in island home mr carson have not therefore be not unlikely that experience difficulty in blending respective disposition into one harmonious whole east be east west be west said mallow two parallel straight line can not meet let hope that in case judicious yielding on part of of young people will create exception to invariable truth of axiom mr mallow can give dish of tea thank mr purcell ah here come mutual friend aldean entered be welcomed by mr purcell with pomp considered due to member of nobility tui be joyous thought be never coming said see that be out 'of sight out of mind ' with by jove wish be sighed jim must be happier man oh surely make miserable never mind be misery must not be without tell how be major semberry good gracious lord aldean how must know have not seen for year 't be to be hoped that will not again come into contact with major semberry said mr purcell wagging turban be not suitable acquaintance for young lady be quite sure be not assented aldean upon tui at once took up arm on behalf of absent major semberry be most charming of men declared with pout serpent rebuked mr purcell be ever beautiful to eye unfortunately be possessed of noxious quality far exceed beauty rubina in letter to think stated opinion of major semberry from opinion have seen reason to depart in plain english mr purcell consider semberry rascal mr mallow consider profligate undesirable acquaintance how dr carson came to entrust son to man can not understand got on very well together then one other must have changed very much lord aldean in bombay mr carson be by mean friendly with travelling companion rigid sense of right wrong did not allow to countenance major semberry laxity of principle like mr carson asked mallow quickly acquaintance with be not of sufficient duration to enable to speak quite so definitely a consider mr carson to be admirably conducted young man calculated to render woman happy in matrimonial state oh lor muttered jim how must have altered well said tui outright like mr carson at never did surprise said mr purcell in most majestic manner judgment be seldom at fault considered mr carson when saw in bombay to be type of be most excellent in male sex discussion have not remotest interest for miss slarge indeed have already drifted back to babylon observing vaguely that great red dragon of revelation be fiery serpent of chaldean worship left room to return to beloved study mr purcell be left with three guest lord aldean be carried off by tui to distant corner where must torment without fear of interruption mallow at once seized opportunity for talk with hostess about olive took mr purcell philosophy to hear unmoved tale of carson treachery mr purcell said mallow plunging at once in medias re be aware that have known mr carson for many year take deep interest in welfare be sorry to tell that be very unhappy in marriage did inform of fact said mr purcell with displeasure did received letter from asking to go to sandbeach where be spending honeymoon on arriving there found that husband have left mr carson have left olive yes be now in italy believe with woman amaze mr mallow may say pain be meaning of terrible state of affair ah be difficult question for to answer only way of doing so be to tell have learned concerning mr carson major semberry leave to judge for will be best mr mallow will then be enabled to deliver unbiassed judgment thereupon laurence related have taken place since carson arrival at casterwell particularly detailed step have led to engagement of clara trall so see mr purcell concluded can hardly help being unhappy husband have left have taken money to spend presume on woman be now alone worried at sandbeach want to ask up here take under wing need friend will be that friend may depend upon doing what be just right said mr purcell vigorously will communicate with olive at once yes will invite to come here that mr carson must behave so basely be matter of most profound astonishment to have read character otherwise can ascribe deterioration to counsel wile of major semberry be one way of explaining said mallow taking out pocket book there be yet more conclusive one be portrait mr carson have taken at sandbeach may ask to look at carefully to tell what think of mr purcell took photograph examined be extremely bad portrait mr carson have altered sadly for worse said at length mallow felt heart beating furiously in what way have mr carson altered asked anxiously oh whole expression be quite different mr mallow when last saw mr carson face be replete with intellectual vigour be sad sombre too not bright smiling a be depicted here moustache be very much heavier certainly be not so tall a picture represents to be must not surprise then mr purcell if be to tell that be not mr carson portrait at mr mallow must not at first glance did not notice many thing appear to a look into mr carson face may of course have changed circumstance of life may have caused expression to brighten be possible too that moustache may be of le luxuriant growth confess understand how can have become le of stature mr mallow man here represented be not mr angus carson chapter iii private inquiry agent same evening laurence have long confidential conversation with mr purcell made known to suspicion theory ground upon based listened attentively to all have to say then read through newspaper report once again scrutinized portrait of carson taken at sandbeach prided upon possession of clear head logical mind brought to bear upon case a mallow presented to arrived at conclusion that carson be actual impostor probable murderer stage further than at mallow have be able to arrive if believe a do that man be impostor argued surely must be guilty of murder also else how must have become possessed of bangle wrist button mr purcell can not absolutely prove that be impostor even though firmly believe to be one sir said lady in most impressive tone human judgment be fallible admit with such evidence a be before there can be possible doubt that husband of olive be not man whose name bear doe not believe in reason be in respect sound dealing with money for instance silence regarding early day in hindoostan use of right hand on several occasion when forgot part be playing letter from italy too be of great weight seeing that writer of also wrote to woman trall be proved by handwriting be in respect identical letter to wife man might possibly have dictated peculiarly private nature of wrote to girl make highly improbable that hand save own be instrumental in penning moreover be left handed writing letter be far too firmly formed right hand of man must therefore have be uninjured again prof that be impostor now although be not actually prepared to swear in court of law that portrait be not portrait of mr angus carson yet feel quite satisfied in own mind that be not for reason have already given make out excellent case against mr purcell said mallow be only right to say that man did know something about india naturally interrupted must obtain information be necessary for purpose from friend major semberry then agree with in making accessory certainly know opinion of major semberry mr mallow be man utterly without conscience without scruple without religion cultivates most extravagant taste while possessing mean insufficient to gratify to place beyond pinch of poverty be convinced that must hesitate at crime so long of course a saw way clear to avert consequence well said laurence there be one method of throwing light on matter must like to propose be that permit to bring semberry here to that may tax with fraud to face in presence by mean do so mr mallow may depend upon acting with discretion in mean time will communicate with olive at sandbeach invite to come to a soon a can mr mallow permit cordially to thank for infinite pain at have be to place completely in possession of fact of very terrible matter together will go into see whether can not unravel what at present appears to be mystery of most complex order good night mr mallow good night good bye mr purcell be afraid will find task light one not light perhaps not impossible what be not impossible be always possible be not mr mallow with consolatory truism mr purcell dismissed coadjutor addressed to task of writing to olive did not tell how much knew of story merely that be aware of husband having deserted invited to come at once to london urged advantage of being on spot while affair be being investigated mr purcell rejoiced in character of dea ex machin poured forth page of ponderous english such a must have done credit to conduct of political intrigue rle appealed to imagined true madame de stal mallow must have chosen better assistant got sleep night mind be full of projected visit to semberry in morning started off for marquis street found that early a be semberry have already gone out on business according to valet though a to nature of business man maintained complete ignorance leaving word that must return about one o'clock mallow wandered about aimlessly until bethinking that be wasting valuable time determined to try luck in soho look up drabble have sooner turned into poplar street than came face to face with semberry judging from expression major be in very good tune be more than probable have be calling upon drabble interview have not be to liking good morning semberry said mallow blocking way be glad to see morning grunted made a to pas move mallow soon thwarted see be in hurry said amiably so will just walk bit of way with there be friend of yours most anxious to renew acquaintance very kind of who be be not mr purcell of bombay a be custom when nervous major finger sought moustache oh mr purcell said with desperate effort to appear at ease what doe want to see carson if can bring nothing to do with carson now better ask wife a to mbeelf time to hang round old woman leavin town mr purcell will be very sorry said laurence smoothly be going abroad know depends what make think so well fancied perhaps might be anxious to join carson join carson stopped short paled trifle what do y ' mean carson on

to paris branch of crdit lyonnais with effort semberry repressed string of forcible epithet be obviously on tip of tongue although be probably aware that carson have left sandbeach be evidently news to major that money be together on continent seems carson wife pull be said fear not said mallow coolly in spite of old adage carson seems to have preferred maid to mistress what d 'ye mean growled major tugging savagely now at moustache mean that girl clara trall have joined carson in florence be lie must dare here major evidently thought have said more than enough for stopped short be not accustomed to be told be liar sir beg pardon mallow excuse slip o ' tongue why must clara trall not dare know replied semberry uneasily must think maid must dare clear out with mistress husband be afraid clara be bad lot major why did recommend did mr arne did who be mr arne friend o ' mine snapped major shortly becuse must be getting on kind regard to mr purcell see when get back brave soldier picking up guilty conscience under fire of mallow too searching question fairly ran away mallow decided to postpone visit to drabble have gained nothing of value from brisk little interview with major on contrary feared have given away very definite piece of information for felt convinced that hour ago semberry have be ignorant of fact that carson clara be in florence be fearful lest must have aroused suspicion in way might perchance act upon knowledge have just obtained mallow determined must have watched there then proceeded to private inquiry office of have informed in case of need asked for agent to be placed at disposal payment of sum down secured without difficulty in due course personage said by employer to be one of cleverest detective in europe be told off to serve in appearance

anarchical doctor drunk with copious inhalation of atmosphere around atmosphere of organized disorder of crime ruffianism bribery be real drabble be at home here one must have known save perhaps wife mallow a looked at found pitying sheer abandonment of man revolted well how be turtle dove getting on asked vulgarly if be speaking of mr mr carson replied mallow have parted believe carson have gone

perhaps word 'thief ' be trifle strong doctor be said after be more question of conscience rather lack of than anything else man with spark of decency must have taken advantage of position gave full possession of wife money by virtue of mere fact of being wife blackguard word be think more applicable be fool said drabble fiercely let take care be not to be trifled with wonder what trall will say to niece bolting with carson oh said mallow recalling clara letter then there be such person a jeremiah trall of course there be be one of how did know mr carson told remarked mallow carelessly clara used to talk about uncle fool muttered drabble always said that girl be not to trusted not to be trusted echoed mallow then too be one of doctor looked at with something approaching scowl wisest plan said be to ask question in place forget be quite uninitiated yet retorted mallow care about committing to definite course unless be quite sure what be about do know what jesuit do with pupil asked drabble irrelevantly yes a rule make scoundrel of rather say make machine of machine because be blindly obedient to set in authority over be one of rule be one of ours also once join think for act for become machine if transgress once have taken oath think will care to do rejoined doctor coldly if do well wo answer for consequence be machine drabble be one having authority direct others execute

will join to speak plainly quite see why want be not for money for posse none be not for influence position for what have of be not likely to serve can only conclude then that be in intellectual

treated with respect be due if can not assure that will be must bid good day sit down dear fellow said drabble hastily know one can not generalize in sort of thing be what have be doing quite agree with say generally speaking whether will apply to individually be impossible to decide for moment rest assured that will have opportunity of exercising capacity ours be not system of government under clever man be repressed government said mallow always understood that government be very essence of being common fallacy replied doctor dryly on part of many who misunderstand aim there be considerable method in so called madness madame death in life will explain to far better than can will see very shortly a spoke distinctive rap came at door on invitation to enter being given by drabble tall bulky man shabbily dressed with puffy red face entered room whole appearance be suggestive of alcohol in severe form at first word mallow recognized that be man of breeding for present be quite sober appeared to be in bad temper probably mallow thought a result of unwonted condition beg pardon drabble said in refined voice did not know be oh be not engaged to extent of excluding said drabble sharply be mr jeremiah trall mr mallow mr mallow echoed trall with stare be evident to mallow that thought straightway reverted to report have received from clara new recruit explained drabble looking at sharply mr mallow wish to be quite sure of aim before finally consent to join aim be to make heaven out of hell said trall taking third chair requires strong measure necessarily replied mallow one doe clean stable with rosewater method be trifle more forcible than chuckled trall when try new there there interrupted drabble be quite enough will not go into detail just at present mallow must see even thus early that there be love lost between two alcoholic man scowled angrily at doctor mallow made mental note of attitude evidently stood in fear of superior what be want asked drabble after having reduced man to silence madame wish to see replied trall sulkily did not know one be with be bringing gentleman down to see very shortly said doctor coolly can go one moment cried mallow a trall shuffled to foot have ever seen before not that know of h be face seems familiar to yes be face of sot said drabble brutally not uncommon sight have to thank for making so stuttered trall savagely must not be what be have not come under thumb take care may be one too many for day be not first time have threatened said drabble take care lest make last drunken hound clear out by way did get letter from sandbeach asked mallow of trall a slouched towards door with fierce resentment in eye eh what cried drabble looking sharply from one to other what letter oh merely letter from clara saying be leaving mr carson answered trall hastily why did tell did think worth while everything be worth while concern carson rebuked drabble where be letter fool in fire there be only dozen line how do know that clara wrote to added trall turning to mallow well happened to drop letter when about to post picked up naturally saw name address oh well be only little letter very little letter mumbled jeremiah slipped out of room little big roared drabble after bring next one to come mr mallow let go see madame mallow followed doctor along dark passage into room in front of house here at window overlooking street sat pale little woman with dark hair arranged smoothly in band wore plain black dress without trimming ornament of kind pallid face be bent intently over wool work be knitting looked up when two men came in rose to foot mr arne said drabble graciously be new recruit mr mallow mallow turned pale felt heart beating wildly in woman introduced a mr arne recognized housekeeper of althelstane place chapter v madame death in life a mallow at drabble elbow stared at demure little figure clothed in black realized that be fate controlling thing in connection with affair have in hand instantly recognized in newspaper description of unknown housekeeper who have vanished so mysteriously so completely from athelstane place by name have just be made known to a mr arne now learned that madame death in life notorious madame death in life who be dreaded throughout europe be one same person be face to face with terrible woman with terrible nick name stormy petrel of anarchy at mere rumour of presence in city in authority be wont suspiciously to look about doubly to safeguard ruler continental police must have given much to have have safe in monte valerien spandau siberia hitherto have always evaded at last moment have thwarted most zealous endeavour carefully laid plan be italian by birth have married englishman be now widow have made husband country permanent home a sat before now so peacefully knitting mallow thought of madame defarge be delighted to see mr mallow said in excellent english with little trace of foreign accent have be expecting for time can go doctor want to can go doctor repeated mr arne in same unemotional voice without word drabble bully stole out of room mallow be amazed be necessary to preserve discipline here said madame observing expression pray be seated mr mallow if mind will continue knitting mind at replied mallow seating mechanically watched firm plump hand clicking shining needle together a wove web of red wool work divined thought wonder at employment said without smile be very feminine be not not quite in keeping perhaps think with reputation see be turning fiction into fact madame defarge suppose

know of that have be making inquiry why because clara have turned out badly have gone off to italy with mistress husband quite so know from major semberry presume be too be what please answered mr arne with odd look will speak of time so be man who be in love with mr carson oh trouble to deny know made inquiry about from mr dacre on behalf man doe not take up woman burden not burden of kind unless have something more than platonic interest in welfare excuse mr arne there be other subject can discus more profitably a please subject have interest for may explain that purposely went to mr dacre in capacity of dressmaker might answer mr carson inquiry from good address be determined that must engage clara a spy yes admitted woman nonchalantly a spy be necessary must have carson watched spy have betrayed so much worse for will die how when have not yet determined mallow shuddered woman repelled there be something uncanny in bare statement of fact even suggestion of melodramatic must have relieved assertion of sheer brutality there be not tinge of merely stated that girl must be killed went on knitting be not used to thing continued death be a nothing to to kill to be killed be always ready have fear gasped mallow of law of god be matter between ah well said laurence recovering self control have better perhaps avoid anything approaching theological discussion tell one thing who be carson why who must be well might for instance be impersonating unfortunate man who be murdered in athelstane place mr arne hand never stopped colour never changed have imagination see observed coldly be pity be apt to get people into trouble oh a to have trouble enough now have determined to join will probably have good deal more be very possible be hunted like rat why do wish to join god know said mallow with shrug also know be because mr carson will have nothing to say to be in despair come to to throw life away mallow breathed more freely now for moment have be unprepared have excuse ready have relied upon supreme egotism enthusiasm of drabble to get over difficulty a to intention here be most excellent of reason already provided for by madame death in life silently acquiesced saw in foolish lover rejected dejected yielding to despair mallow silence convinced be right speak said glancing at well there be need for to do so be usually right in conjecture have to thank mr carson for providing with promising brother mallow protested be not brother yet said emphatically before become one must ask to know exact aim mean by hope to accomplish aim said mr arne laying aside work have one aim to establish equality of man rich oppress poor there must be rich poor oppressed that madame be absolutely impossible arrange a will to day will be where be to morrow think not replied mr arne intend that person will work for general good that will be paid by state if refuse to work then neither will be paid will food be allowed to in midst of plenty will starve to death somewhat drastic arrangement surely said mallow by mean be absolutely necessary one at cost lazy idle must be wiped out under rgime man need starve whilst be willing to work life will be in own hand be by hurling of bomb such like missive hope to bring about millennium mr mallow world ruler will not listen to so long a be what in power choose to call good citizen injustice great wrong under suffer now will remain unaltered if be to be heard must perforce make hearing for ourselves supplication be useless hopeless by terror alone can wrench attention be right be why resort to force be why hear of bomb mr mallow for safety of life even king emperor must heed persistence in direction will in end secure to attention claim attention be right will be dawn of new era mr mallow for will conquer till then there said madame resuming knitting have much to do must leave will place in hand of instructor from whom will learn everything be needful then can come to say if will join not hope will want men with brain money particularly money said mallow contemptuously be not to be convinced by rhetoric deny can not have too much be not pity then to lose carson fifty thousand pound have not lost yet said mr arne with long breath think that italy be in moon that arm can not reach then did intend to have fifty thousand did be scheme to point have be successful one in case said mallow deliberately major semberry be with doubt without must have be helpless major semberry have not taken oath said mr arne coldly be one of how doe reconcile that with allegiance to sovereign mr arne knitted rapidly know power said in grade of society have adherent yes even in army be introduced into mr dacre house by friend of cause be not dressmaker suited to assume capacity for moment told semberry to give mr dacre address to mr carson if must not have got into house must have given address mr carson wrote letter naturally be given to replied secured for girl position designed for

common with generality of workman of nationality be french monsieur rouge be addicted to dark blue wore trouser blouse peaked cap of colour have habit almost equine of blinking glancing out of corner of eye be evidently nervous man seemed poorly fitted for bold daring path have chosen to follow mallow be surprised at appearance a be at fact that mr arne must have chosen for instructor that lady evidently knew what be about after few curt explicit direction conveyed to m rouge in own tongue introduced formally mr mallow said be m rouge at least be name by be known among have be member of brotherhood for three year will find most enthusiastic disciple of cause vive l'anarchie ba le tyrans whispered m rouge in endorsement keep enthusiasm for more fitting occasion friend said mr arne a mallow thought with somewhat unnecessary severity go with gentleman tell be permitted to be known by one who have yet to take oath turning to mallow will come to when have made up mind for present good bye rather au revoir chapter vi link on whole mallow be interested in anarchistic friend possessed goodly supply of right sort of curiosity new milieu in found be unlike anything have experienced

creature of low order creature often needlessly ragged unkempt thought must only conclude that reckless condition be of value to a perpetual reminder of terrible wrong under suffered to fiery crusade against better dressed neighbour to bloodthirsty plan for removal of public building public personage mallow lent patient ever attentive ear be surprised to find crusade directed against aristocracy of intellect a well a against that other larger aristocracy of wealth caste sufficed for man to loom large on horizon of public affair be a warrior orator inventor for to mark bull eye for aim be abominably indiscriminate in truth with very aptly named monsieur rouge at elbow ever ready with fresh diabolical inspiration of turbulent brain mallow must not help likening to modern dante bent on exploration of new more terrible circle of hell with degraded virgil for guide though very fine be not war a french say mallow felt be losing sight of purpose olive be in london safe under wing of mr purcell waiting patiently to see what time endeavour on behalf be to bring for have taken miss slarge tui into confidence for hostess have reserved somewhat abridged version of recent experience with one accord lady be consumed with feminine fire virtuous indignation against husband be downright impostor declared doubt be who have murdered unfortunate mr carson be strenuous in endeavour to induce olive to put whole matter in hand of police to be not to be persuaded although went so far a to consult mallow upon advisability of such course speedily convinced that case required manipulation much more delicate than be likely to receive at hand of police besides said once let police take up will have detail large a life in column of morning paper to say nothing of evening one than be difficult to conceive more direct method of courting failure if not disaster still know that straightest course be not best course after said olive judiciously why not bring major semberry face to face with mr purcell insist upon explanation for two reason first major be keeping out of way second will lie like ananias to save from getting into trouble mr carson let man continue to watch when be caught tripping a will be mark sooner later then will be time to drive into corner can trust man vraik think so have promised large reward if pull case through to satisfaction be kind of man to sell miserable soul for money look like being of lowest type said olive who have seen vraik then look what be be mere accident of course that be with law instead of against dare say find honesty be best possible policy so far a cash go be that concern have fear mr carson money will keep vraik true to if nothing else will unless anarchist find out what be doing treat still more liberally oh be not afraid of find out laughed mallow mr arne gang be by mean so clever a fancy be particularly be blinded by own egotism besides even if did get at vraik must not bribe want money badly people in fact be to fifty thousand pound looked to put in fund unfortunately carson may still call carson have gone off with plunder do think anarchist will kill a mr arne threatened in end doubt not till money be safe in hand at present lie in carson real name may be be possible may induce to hand over will only be to save life while have that money be safe enough must not serve to kill goose with golden egg people may not be so clever a imagine be not fool enough for mr mallow tremble when think of danger to be exposed wretch suspect be one of doe jeremiah trall look queerly at at time because have read clara report of first conversation fancy be suspicious that be something more than zeal for cause have caused to join be safe enough hate drabble have told that letter be burnt be not likely to

country in europe shelter must be off mr carson rouge be waiting for round corner oh laurence do take care of implored poor olive anxiously be sure of for sake mallow left house sighing to think that have now no right to say even so much to olive whosoever carson be olive be wife yet started a thought crossed mind be wife be not possible marriage might be illegal if man be impostor have not made wife under real name marriage under false name be marriage surely by jupiter will lose time in taking dimbal opinion about muttered mallow to there may be way of releasing from scamp clutch after

something important a colourless shrinking a ever rouge stood up cap in hand when laurence entered be glad to see monsieur said in french be that monsieur be aware that madame desire must come to great meeting next week replied mallow carelessly what for rouge spoke again in husky whisper usually affected looked steadily at laurence be to take oath said laurence winced rouge saw momentary hesitancy smiled in uncanny fashion of often caused mallow to think be not quite right in head be not too late if monsieur be afraid said with shrug sneer monsieur be not afraid retorted mallow sharply monsieur be wise enough to consider thing before committing past recall when doe meeting take place on wednesday next monsieur be week hence where in cellar of house in poplar street monsieur

inquiring look rouge with money in pocket glided out of room cat like movement of man glistening eye sibilant whisper inspired mallow with nothing repulsion still be kind to knowing poor wretch often went without meal frequently gave price of one whether rouge be grateful mallow knew not gave sign of gratitude watched young man unceasingly never told real name spoke of past in way conversation for most part consisted of extract from revolutionary pamphlet imprecation upon in power expression of jubilation for day when tide of blood must roll over europe to mallow be veritable creature of nightmare on leaving red hot destroyer of human civilization mallow walked quickly to lodging in moon street walk did good cooled blood cleared brain a passed by hyde park noticed be being followed man be dogging like shadow pausing when paused following steadily at great distance brave a be mallow felt qualm wondered if anarchist suspecting of treachery be having watched felt that suspense be worse than danger so determined to right about face know worst at once turned up side street for dozen yard then faced round walked back by manoeuvre almost ran into arm of follower jeremiah trall exclaimed mallow recognizing in lamplight what do want why be following trall looked round swiftly beckoned mallow into comparative darkness of side street wish to speak with privately said in refined voice be afraid of being watched come to room then replied trall must follow life must not be safe better here led mallow up distance into gloomy corner mr mallow said sinking voice why be joining be that to asked mallow fencing have scheme in head wish to know be true anarchist care two pin about cause mallow reflected man might be trying to trap into incautious speech duly to be reported to mr

foot make suffer a have suffered a have made suffer trall gripping mallow hand shook violently disappeared round corner of street mallow be too much astonished to follow walked on home almost at doorstep hand be laid upon arm turned to see villainous face of vraik smirking at have come to report sir whined spy have seen major semberry in conversation with light haired light bearded man who be francis hain sir man who be concerned in murder be sure of chapter vii unexpected meeting francis hain stammered mallow amazed impossible must be mistaken have never seen francis hain vraik rubbed

responsibility oh a long a do care will just get back to marquis street keep eye on major cove be hard work sir precious dry here be sovereign said mallow tossing coin get drunk on vraik slipped piece into pocket with grin lord bless sir be born yesterday be square be slunk away in darkness leaving more than trifle disgusted at being obliged to come into contact with so degraded animal various side path along mallow have so carefully travelled began now to show sign of convergence be pointing clearly to one principal highway promised to lead directly from soho to athelstane place in way did lose sight of fact that if at possible capture of money be greatly to be desired be additional reason for refraining from putting matter into official hand for in event fearful of extradition pseudo carson must probably cease to affect florence a place of residence on contrary a likely a not must decide to place considerable expanse of water between decided must be best at once to force from semberry complete confession if possible always duly heedful of course of gentleman anarchist connection consequent power must be necessary to be more than ever circumspect next morning therefore proceeded to marquis street st james found warrior busy with consumption of morning meal reception be thought unusually cordial have known major first impulse have be to refuse to see second thought have prevailed determined must be best to brazen out in face of danger weak brain be ever cunning thus be that mallow reception be sufficiently jovial hearty to have disarmed suspicion entirely be on too solid foundation for though outwardly reciprocative be bit a alert a major mornin ' said semberry shaking hand with visitor be out early have breakfast yes thank must apologize for calling at so unusual hour fact be want to consult about carson nothin ' to do with chap now said major wagging head have gone way go mine way perceive be also italy said laurence whose keen eye have not failed to see cook

to see unless go carson bit of rogue know be sure be somewhat more than ' bit major be quite sure be angus carson course be who else must be said semberry with admixture of indignation ignorance in equal part oh ask replied mallow carelessly only be strange be not that mr purcell must say picture taken at sandbeach did not represent friend mr carson of bombay bad likeness perhaps growled semberry be really uneasy now on contrary be very good one of man who married miss bellairs angus carson if like to call so semberry jumped up with scowl do mean to insult doubt m ' word said savagely carson be with since father died did lose sight of till marriage matter fact 'prove way be treated wife be reason be goin ' italy to bring back see thing square before return t'india if can do major will be extremely clever doubt very much being able to persuade stray lamb to return make if only to prove mr purcell wrong oh have nothing to do with carson may be great cham for care mr purcell will not be so easily satisfied know rather interferin ' old cat that be say carson be carson doe what deuce doe woman mean have better ask semberry settle matter offhand will ask said major furiously what be more will bring back carson to give lie hang reflects on m ' honour a officer gentleman oh know what lady be replied mallow laughing observant once get idea into head there be getting out again mr purcell on authority of portrait declares that man who married miss bellairs be not carson idle theory of hers if will one be bent upon proving ca contradicted semberry testily man be carson right enough ought to know say so will bring back tell just to prove whole thing silly nonsense mallow yawned dare say doe interest in least be sorry for mr carson think have be disgracefully treated must like if possible to see husband return to however a be going over to fetch have doubt will arrange did intend to fetch grumbled semberry will now just to shut up mr purcell ca afford to play doose with m reputation when be in service carson box be here if mr purcell must like to see now sight of precious box content must mallow felt be very acceptable must not say so without rousing semberry suspicion in position many man must have jumped at major offer have brought mr purcell to marquis street mallow knew better of thing caution be most essential merely laughed oh will tell mr purcell if like said affably think be box want to see so much a man why not call on before leave what be use must not believe will bring back carson tell can shut up ai going to argue with mr purcell well perhaps be rather difficult subject major when do go to morrow night train ah well pleasant journey by way who be that fair chap be talking to yesterday man saw with in poplar street excuse asking ca help thinking know major started looked searchingly at mallow who remained unmoved oh friend of mine ic man answered carelessly why oh nothing fancied be doctor have met somewhere doctor repeated semberry nervously be not doctor civil engineer build bridge of sort know be be india way last twenty year ah strange too be convinced know said mallow rising just show how apt one be to confuse face

be swindler have peg before go thanks too early for strong water good day day replied semberry curtly accompanying mallow to door when visitor be fairly off premise major drew long breath returned to breakfast time got off muttered wonder what chap driving at be fool to leave ticket about who 'd have ' thought 'd have spotted who 'd have ' thought o seeing now for matter o ' in street mallow be looking for vraik knew be somewhere not far off shortly espied ragged pavement artist at work on series of glaring presentment in coloured chalk within sight of major door mallow strolled across road to drop copper into man hat a did so spoke hurriedly major leaving town to night to morrow watch charing cross victoria wire to room at once when go be fly said pavement artist with grin mallow satisfied that semberry be under proper surveillance went way easy in mind round corner a fate must have ran almost into arm of stout elderly gentleman in black oh dear sir dear sir protested stranger puffing knocked wind out of why be mr mallow mr brock said mallow recognizing vicar who must have thought of meeting here surprising indeed said brock shaking hand be on way to see major semberry perhaps can tell where be marquis street mr mallow just round corner so be visiting major dear young friend wish to speak with about angus carson with pain grief have heard of terrible trouble between old friend son olive have thought possible that major semberry might use good office to bring about reconciliation be afraid be beyond major power sir said mallow shaking head be mr purcell who told of separation be received letter two day back came up a soon a must have not yet seen olive decided must see major first very painful matter must be settled mr carson be not to blame mr brock husband alone be at fault so mr purcell said said brock solemnly dear dear angus be not behaving in way upright father must have have behave father h be said mallow wondering if must be wise to tell brock that carson be impostor on second thought decided to hold tongue open street hardly lent to explanation of kind suggested that vicar must call on mr purcell after have seen semberry certainly be intention to do so mr mallow will put two old head together see what can do good day good day brock trotted off chapter viii light haired man when mallow returned to room found lord aldean seated in most comfortable arm chair expression be extremely thoughtful withal trifle anxious polyphemus a laurence sometimes called in allusion to size be not usually given to gentle melancholy mallow must only conclude there must be something wrong with boy here jim said throwing hat glove on near table what be matter with man look a miserable a owl mallow lack delicacy of perception necessary for correct understanding of feeling of man in condition besides simile be rude oh see miss ostergaard have be crushing a usual on contrary be particularly amiable ought to encourage doe said aldean miserably so much so have made up mind to propose to very day one must think have made up mind to be hanged from expression why so dejected mallow know what fear be now heart be in boot be then have better reinstate before go on knee what be afraid of jackass miss ostergaard wo eat might say 'no groaned wretched jim paled at bare idea of so terrible catastrophe might on other hand say 'yes

then said for have endeavoured to bring to very clear comprehension of feeling upon several occasion cheer up old man clapped jim broad shoulder have chance of success girl in love with do really think so said jim brightening then with deeper groan be always teasing of course be be only way woman be like especially when in love must interpret contrariwise like dream know in case may hope yes hope put fortune to test also if think be in fit condition to do so answer question what be asked aldean accepting cigarette do put love before friendship well er be not friendship seem very certain on point said mallow dryly however be about to ask aid at present can not leave london be too heavily involved with anarchist must remain on spot to watch mr arne drabble now saw semberry morning learned thanks to carelessness in leaving ticket about be off to italy want to follow there watch little game with carson oh will go of course said jim with rather long face how do know semberry be

anarchist repeated clara boldini paled to lip without word left room at last aldean saw how be throughout have be trifle uneasy at extreme unexpected smoothness with thing be progressing have not looked for process of disgorgement to be accomplished with so little difficulty boldini attitude have be subservient clara altogether too unreal to convince in most abject coward there be at least modicum of obstinacy when at bay must not understand how plunder thus arduously come by must be disgorged with so little resistance mention of word anarchist explained everything to effect of upon miscreant left nothing to imagination be thoroughly scared then be what have dreaded for be have be ready to throw everything by board for silence exposure to police must have revealed immediate whereabouts to fellow that meant pursuit speedy relentless that in turn meant death to for minute after have left neither jim olive spoke occupied with rumination with own innermost thought jim broke

glad have sense to climb down be right now have money confession be use to longer yes have circular note suppose be safe said miss bellairs reflecting that cheque lord aldean boldini might stop by

boot riding breech high brown boot shirt scarf collar under wear more le impregnated with scent of wood amongst now useless article not scrap of writing aldean be disappointed have fancied that stray letter journal even card might have be forthcoming to throw light on owner past might have guessed that evidence likely to inculpate semberry drabble mr arne must have be removed by one of before chest left london two out of three at least be old hand at obliterating track with observant eye careful ear aldean overhauled box outside in rapped at side pushing here tugging there so far a must see there be hollow space at side below chest be plainly made of five thick slab sounded dead dull when tapped then aldean turned attention to lid be clasped with two broad brass band dividing into three equal space be carved in laborious chinese way with impossible flower stiffly flying bird rum thing muttered jim shaking lid look like overgrown glove box round lid ran deep rim fitting down on to lower portion of box when locked on examination of inner side of aldean found row of brass nail ostensibly mere ornament with infinite patience pressed one of decoration hard found that one behind hasp yielded with difficulty to pressure two other nail one near end of lid proved equally loose jim pressed pressed three until suddenly with click whole inner skin of lid fell down between top there proved to be narrow space extending to four side with lid fell long blue envelope sealed with coat of arm in red wax clever dodge said jim picking up envelope admiring workmanship so skilfully concealed space in lid chap must hide only thin thing in there be room for anything else looked at envelope rev manner brock casterwell read jupiter be queer wonder what be inside feel like dozen of

not only have extracted from prime mover of conspiracy full clearly set forth confession be in position comfortably to contemplate repossession of money in space of two day have done a now sat at luncheon must not refrain from mutual congratulation only thing about there be doubt in mind be wisdom of accepting from boldini cheque for thirty thousand pound in truth aldean now that pair have flitted blamed heartily for having done so be trifle young inexperienced more particularly in shady financial tactic to be expected from people such a be dealing with at moment did not occur to that risk ran in taking boldini cheque be considerable seeing that there be really nothing to prevent man bolting right away certainly have confessed that have money aldean realized now that obstacle have not proved insurmountable that have not existed long habit have made so accustomed to look upon cheque a equivalent in value to sum represented decided to dismiss uncomfortable sensation be creeping over to hope for best said nothing more about to olive now lord aldean said that young lady joyfully can return home doubt will be a glad a to do that can measure pleasure by own miss bellairs be in same galley think olive blushed at allusion to feeling for mallow thereby of course only accentuated truth when will start asked to night by express said jim promptly unless want to have look round

be to be have in country by window plunged eagerly into semberry confession jim having promised that statement must be kept strictly private major have not be at half hearted about have set forth iniquity in extenso indeed vanity must seem to have led to make most of misdoings a human document confession of major horace semberry be well worth perusal ran somewhat after fashion be one of unfortunate devil who have extravagant taste money with to gratify be brought up extravagantly by extravagant father went from extravagant school into extravagant regiment have have taste so fostered by luxury that be absolute pain for not to satisfy craving in way be always in debt never out of difficulty must willingly dispense with necessary of life if only must procure luxury by nature be not bad man be want of money have induced to do many thing must not otherwise have done led from borrowing to swindling have stopped short at if be accused of murder be wrongly accused angus carson be not killed by by whom be killed know more than man in moon four five year ago while on leave in london met with dr drabble be about a big scoundrel a ever deserved gallows be moreover anarchist by mean of dupe in society of whom there be many contrives to mix with very good people to do justice hate despises 'for good of cause word be never off lip feigns interest in with money position solely that may recruit infernal army of destroyer somebody once called drabble ' wrecker of humanity title fit well enough though by mean doe justice to devilish ingenuity wickedness why must approach with friendly advance must not understand at time when came to know learned truth when like drabble be fascinating man by finding out weak spot in people character usually contrives to net somehow other soon found out weak spot want of money insisted on being banker like fool borrowed at first little then more more until be so deep in debt that have in power to force to leave army be not wealthy be always puzzled to know how came by money when be completely in power told be anarchist said money lent be taken from fund of brotherhood to repay money something more suggested must help in scheme of for

when bring to england introduce to will do rest seeing that drabble must easily have introduced when young man arrived at casterwell naturally asked why wished to employ a go between to answered that be desire carson must join anarchist before seeing miss bellairs be before went to casterwell at a be to fall in love with girl considering be pretty attractive be more than probable might point blank refuse to join drabble in scheme for regeneration of mankind to make long story short agreed to take part in conspiracy provided received twenty thousand pound out of fifty swear solemnly that at first interview at subsequent one with drabble be there mention of murder be to bring carson home be to introduce to drabble when enthusiasm have be roused sufficiently to induce to hand over fortune

miss bellairs presume after several disappointment extending over twelve month obtained leave of absence started out on shooting expedition in neighbourhood of modern hermit a made business to become acquainted with be not long before attained object how there be need for to explain became very friendly with dr carson also with son in time friendship ripened to intimacy got on better with doctor than with latter be solemn prig thought with most puritanical idea still adapted to humour think liked fairly well be easy task to break down stiff reserve for two three year visited regularly elder carson until became so old so good friend in eye that one day told what already knew of course about miss bellairs fortune suggested that a angus be still young possession of so large sum of money might lead into dissipation further suggested advisability of one accompanying to england so that there might be at least check upon there dr carson approved of idea when died about year afterwards made angus promise must accompany to europe at once wrote to drabble assured of success after left india for london with charge so far have gone well lord aldean informs that mr purcell wrote to sister full description of carson of look dress priggish conversation of sacred bangle wore on right wrist hated that bangle seemed to effeminate foolish must not come off owing to carson swollen

perform if carson consented be to take to house in athelstane place there introduce to drabble a surgeon drabble on excuse of hand engaged to keep carson there for week hoped by own persuasion of mr arne anarchist to inspire carson with desire to benefit humanity mr arne hoped to talk carson into state of red hot enthusiasm so that might take oath to brotherhood once did so bound to band of wild fanatic must have to part with money life drabble mr arne be in great need of money there be suggestion that goose with golden egg must be killed followed closely direction in drabble letter talked to carson about necessity of getting hand cured said that knew skilful surgeon called mr francis hain name supplied to by drabble who must cure carson whose hand gave pain readily agreed to try effect of operation be arranged between must take to mr hain house on arrival from plymouth wrote to drabble advising of when pharaoh docked first took carson luggage to room in marquis street have already engaged afterwards to athelstane place luggage including sandal wood chest be left at room with only small portmanteau carson arrived at night at so called hain house mr arne be housekeeper drabble surgeon under name of hain be highly respectable carson have suspicion when drabble said that must have to remain in athelstane place for at least three week while cure be being effected readily agreed to do so gave letter to post to miss bellairs telling how through operation be detained of course destroyed left carson in athelstane place returned to room in marquis street be last time saw poor fellow alive day so afterwards be hurriedly summoned to house in soho by drabble mr arne with much agitation declared that carson be dead have be murdered asked with horror if be guilty denied in strongest manner carson said have be left alone on previous night a be obliged to attend to anarchistic business when returned found dead on examination drabble discovered that death have be caused by knitting needle thrust into man heart have evidently be taken from wool work of mr arne have be left in drawing room where body have be found mr arne searched house must find one door be closed window also however in carson bedroom discovered portmanteau open content tossed about a though murderer have be searching for something declared again that did not know who have killed carson in end seeing that have reason for murdering man believed thought whole conspiracy be at end not so mr arne drabble doctor produced bangle have obtained by cutting off carson hand at wrist declared that mr arne nephew carlo boldini who greatly resembled carson must impersonate dead man wear bangle at first refused then a be in desperate strait for money agreed carlo be called in told that be to represent man called angus carson wear bangle marry olive bellairs done be to hand over money to drabble being already married to clara trall declined at first to act part aunt forced to do so in end be not till long after carlo knew of murder of carson at dressed in carson clothes taken from sandal wood chest afterwards on reading leader in morning planet changed clothes for new one lest scent must arouse suspicion bracelet be placed upon wrist instructed in carson history manner of speech action took time to train in at last be turned out with so close resemblance in appearance personality to carson that might well have be taken for dead man double then accompanied to caster just a olive reached part of confession lord aldean very red in face entered room hurriedly here be pretty kettle o fish cried carson cheque good be very much afraid have lost that thirty thousand lost cried olive starting up be money not then in paris no not to boldini credit at event bank have received reply to wire

pavement let shout kick a must no one other than gaoler be likely to hear be absolutely powerless sole comfort lay in thought that aldean be carrying on campaign when jim returned must find that mallow be missing must undoubtedly guess that be in power of anarchist if latter did not kill in meantime a might in self preservation aldean must surely apply to police have soho house searched then freedom nemesis upon enemy be one hope there be yet monsieur rouge who have brought mallow food to several time have on one occasion thrown off revolutionary mask so far a to promise to aid prisoner escape although mallow did not well see how be to do seeing rouge have not divulged scheme there be comfort in thought that if aldean must fail might succeed so resigned to inevitable waited since

upon in earnest rose garden of july lay covered thick with snow naked wood surrounding fought with whistling blast mallow have recovered from cut scraping nerve be still suffering from recent experience there be doubt that system have received severe shock although pluckily made light of even mr purcell suddenly entering room made jump in chair olive laid hand on arm to soothe two have come together only within last three day at first meeting mallow have kissed that kiss be outward visible sign of engagement dear mr purcell with voluminous skirt sank into chair wide spreading billow dear spoke ex cathedr have be considering position olive dear outside house be still known a mr carson have formed plausible scheme for amelioration of unpleasant state of affair none mr purcell suppose must tell truth seems to extreme view to take truth be so very strange stranger than fiction chimed in mallow if fact will poach on domain of fancy friend will have to enlarge swallowing capacity think be best to be straightforward mr purcell make clean breast of from arrival of carson impostor to soho explosion regret to say mr mallow concur said mr purcell shaking turban exclusive honesty be not best policy in case must only provide daily journal with sensational matter be averse feel sure that be also to dear olive name being in mouth of multitude there be need to be too explicit then how be to account for marriage being false one asked olive by telling truth dear within limitation say that marriage be nominal one contracted with mr angus carson in obedience to expressed wish of father add during honeymoon unfortunately rather fortunately discovered that mr carson be husband of woman at once left to resume own name finally let be known that mr carson true wife have left england together will return more mr carson understand love not signor boldini must make explanation demanded mallow assuredly not be not bound to satisfy curiosity of public though indeed added mr purcell so much a must have reveal must be sufficient to answer question moreover most earnestly advise olive to accompany abroad for few month at end of time to marry mr mallow before returning to england then of can take up position in house without giving cause for scandal public animadversion be true people may talk about dear olive first marriage for want of detail advise strongly to withhold such idle chatter will die of inanition there be good sound sense in what mr purcell said bare statement of fact enabled olive to reappear in society a mr mallow be be necessary none be better calculated to enunciate fact than mr purcell for one reason because knew one in county worth knowing for because very prolixity made impressive what otherwise might have be looked upon a bald feeble narrative must take care that sympathy of one be with beloved olive when after sufficiently judicious absence returned to manor house wife of laurence mallow reception must be something more than cordial what relief sighed olive when old lady have departed in triumph whole thing have be quite nightmare to lately be so thankful that mr purcell have found way out of mr purcell be sensible woman said mallow warmly opinion carry weight what say be perfectly true be so unfortunate at first a to be placed in position of marrying man who be not choice further having married of discovering fact that be already married sequel be think sufficiently obvious to dullest of neighbour at event there be whole business in nutshell will be for mr purcell to present to county to crack word need be said of connection with anarchist people thank goodness diabolical scheme have be very effectually disposed of laurence olive shivered covered face be terrible to think of how narrowly escaped death dearest miss be a good a mile thanks to poor fellow rouge came through right only regret be that death of mr arne of trall drabble doe away with hope of learning truth reason for poor carson murder will remain mystery be mystery to cried olive petulantly mr arne killed denied most solemnly dare say such woman must deny anything to gain end must replied mallow judiciously in case

mr brock deaf housekeeper grim lean spinster might once have be human flower sap be now gone out of have withered on stalk in state of single blessedness even mallow good look polite inquiry failed to impress be sworn enemy of male kind at outset declined to admit mallow indeed be much too ill said in end be so far prevailed upon a to consent to convey message resulted in prompt permission for

missionary in india once know yes know did drabble give to willingly certainly must not have taken otherwise be pretty thing margery tell that gave to olive olive wear a brooch replied mallow gloomily be distinctly puzzled noticed too that vicar be half dozing felt that perhaps be overtaxing strength well must be going now mr brock said producing dr carson letter principal reason for coming be to hand what be asked brock taking blue envelope drowsily letter from old friend dr carson brock woke up with start be clearly agitated from dead man what doe mean message of import doubt said mallow young carson brought home with forgot to deliver voice from grave muttered brock unheeding hand be busy with two paper closely written letter dozen long page of foolscap of aggressively official appearance mallow finger itched to take up judiciously restrained watched vicar skim eye over letter perusal seemed to move greatly wrong wrong said folding up better to let dead past bury dead shuffling paper into envelope slipped under pillow mallow be struck by remark tended to confirm long entertained suspicion mr brock asked after moment be there secret in life of late mr bellairs why must think so said vicar nervously have not forgotten about sealed letter forced olive into marrying carson asked what hint of evil meant told to take notice of be best course said mr brock still agitated so long a married angus there be need for to trouble about letter then there be secret insisted mallow mr brock shifted uneasily whose life be free from sin said in low tone yes there be secret have to do with olive marriage yes if have refused angus there might have be trouble what kind of trouble ask said vicar with shiver must ask olive guess that there be secret wish to know will never know from said vicar face more pallid than ever say let dead past bury dead said that before when read that letter secret be told in enclosed document yes said brock reluctantly then olive must read must read must know truth vicar remained silent brow wrinkled who gain knowledge gain sorrow said aphoristically will do neither olive good to learn folly of young man however will read document if can legitimately do so will send to olive be secret so very terrible then be very terrible be father mr mallow protested vicar wiping wet forehead have said intend to say until read letter if can send to olive will be sent please leave have overtaxed strength bell please a go out although mallow must fain have stayed there be nothing left for to do to obey peremptory request must not acknowledge that mr brock be acting in eminently reasonable way secret of such moment a appeared to be must not be communicated hastily without due consideration when next saw olive mallow told what might expect with characteristic firmness chose to abide by decision must know truth declared at cost so long a be together laurence nothing can hurt tempt god dearest replied laurence sighed event of last few month have shaken nerve be apt at time to give way to despondency mr brock did not seem in hurry to come to decision one two three day passed before word came to manor house having implicit faith in vicar judgment mallow did not urge at did not even go near vicarage curbed impatience that of olive a best must virtue be rewarded if reward be for on fourth day document be delivered to miss bellairs with letter from vicar send history of father in india wrote mr brock though be somewhat against better judgment do so however a can guess that curiosity will allow rest give opportunity of appeasing still even at eleventh hour must most earnestly advise to put enclosed paper in fire unread perusal can only give pain remove from pedestal idol of youth much more mr brock wrote mallow read be alone with olive in library looked questioningly at be silent for answer placed document in hand be to read asked olive bent head a think wise dear will burn a mr brock advises unread olive clasped

from nominal payment that engaged to take part in great rising to folly in respect story be due in day be young poor rash ambitious yet not without think good part mental moral if failed to control one by other blame for such must lie with michael trall be one of rascally adventurer who then infested india in hope of becoming nabob fertile in resource of great courage one of most unscrupulous scoundrel who ever played part of mephistopheles for seduction of weaker spirit to ruin crime whence came not conclude past life be too disreputable to be disclosed knowledge of date from year when appeared at rao court used impudent art to secure ascendency over mind of weak potentate there came into contact with with bellairs mark bellairs dearest oldest friend have come out to india with be then in army having quarrelled with father allowance be cut off be forced to sell out suggested that must travel eastward in company turn military knowledge to account at court of petty rajah a there be nothing for to do in england agreed to try luck in east together arrived in bombay with money great ambition of adventure need not speak a have nothing to do with story wandered here there everywhere until fortune brought to kikat here a rao be in need of resident physician engaged afterwards finding that bellairs have be in english service placed in command of small army swear that before meeting bellairs be quite content with position have power salary be large rao be very good friend in few year hoped to make fortune return wealthy honoured to mother country for trall might have continued in straight path like belial be drew from to earn money lasting shame must admit that trall be most fascinating man handsome strong clever full of conversation tact have acquired complete power over singha then finding that have little say in matter of state set clever wit to work for conquest not without success doubt be weak of to yield man have tremendous strength of will power of fascination must control did control who personally came in contact with remember bellairs believed to be honourable gentleman be not until be well entangled in net that threw off mask then be too late there be ever exception to rule exception to well nigh universal popularity of trall be to be found in person of rev manner brock missionary who have engaged in hopeless task of converting kikat heathen pleasant manner simplicity of brock made great favourite with even rao liked in spite of christianizing propensity placed barrier in way with people brock be candid almost to verge of folly told how stood alone in world without parent relative made acquainted with detail of early life a sizar at oxford a poor london curate made frank declaration of 'call ' to enlighten idolater of india knew brock life a well a did own felt great respect for principle zeal trall be studiously affable to tried hardest to fascinate into obedience somehow brock managed to avoid snare kept out of trall company undermined influence with rao be exercised for good may be sure altogether showed belial plainly that considered rascal naturally trall grew to hate must willingly have done injury a singha protected missionary open warfare be out of question however trall watched opportunity came at last mutiny with when india blazed with fanaticism from north to south rao kept kingdom out of trouble although did not go so far a to side with english adopted neutral attitude doubt must have maintained to end that trall ever at elbow persuaded to revolt singha did not declare open war against foreigner must scarcely have done so while englishman headed army tampered with mutinous prince corresponded with declared that wished to be rid of tributary necessity with devilish ingenuity trall conducted whole intrigue kept urging singha openly to declare bellairs protested at first in way can hardly say how trall involved in scheme what must have be end of have rao taken field hardly know hesitated hung back until be too late mutiny be suppressed puppet at delhi be driven into exile with trall hope of becoming vizier of eastern king for while raged furiously over disappointment then making best of bad job began to look about how best to turn tide of affair to own advantage be at juncture bellairs come into story trouble at end singha naturally wished to make peace with victor be true that have not declared enemy have intrigued deeply have written compromising letter what with knowledge of bellairs trall there be evidence ample to have dethroned exiled grew afraid of what might happen to implored to help at critical moment trall showed in true colour have mentioned compromising letter treaty with mutinous rajah well trall have kept copy of also possessed of original if document have be shown to heic to sir henry lawrence there be doubt that must have ruined rao beyond hope of keeping kingdom singha knew so did trall so did bellairs for letter be shown to trall proposed to blackmail rao refused then be unmasked battery man a then discovered be skilful forger have signed name to many of letter besides actual signature of singha if be guilty be also in worse degree seeing that according to forgery be ready to massacre own countryman be impossible to explain how deeply be involved trall showed clearly that if did not work with must must ruin choice lay between ruin crime for in way must have proved innocence trall have letter treaty with rao real signature false one of bellairs have provided with more than dozen witness to swear that be renegade to british cause have entangled in political criminality of rao saw very plainly that life be ruined must document ever reach governor general bellairs took night to choose between ruin crime next morning blush to set down fact chose shame consider pray position trall a have shown have completely in power guiltless must have appeared guilty must have be punished despised perhaps shot by own countryman declaration of innocence must have done away with forgery evidence of guilt a conspirator with rao against heic be down in black white only word on oath contradicted be a saying go in cleft stick mere pawn shifted on life chess board by unscrupulous intriguer there be nothing for to obey trall if wished to save name from world knowledge a of traitor renegade devil deep sea proverb applies to position well a have said gave in trall proceeded to round off plot money be what wanted money intended to have even though be to share with bellairs saw singha fixed price for inculpating document price be three diamond famous not only in kikat throughout india three stone of purest water be large gem two small one valued together at forty thousand pound more le trall intended to keep most valuable gem for to give other two must advise to clear out then ' said 'for there may be trouble ' be a cool in midst of rascality a though be engaged like brock in missionary enterprise when went to have out with singha expected must be killed there then trall knowing risk knew also how to circumvent of course rao be furious amazed when trall made statement demanded price of course being indian first instinct be to kill man who have deceived trall be ready with counter move told singha that incriminating paper be in hand of third person that if killed must be sent on to government at calcutta a meant ruin singha be not fool enough to resort to violence seeing way out of snare gave up diamond be called treasure of kikat be guarded by priest then blackmailer promised that paper must be sent back to singha two hour later presented with share slipped own jewel into chamois leather bag 'now said 'you have better skip be off ' before must get away rao made trouble afraid lest trall must not return paper made clean breast of whole thing to brock missionary be fearfully angry without trusting to trall mercy started straight away for calcutta there to lay whole matter before government promised to get singha out of trouble have trall arrested for wickedness there be mention of bellairs a rao did not know how trall have be plotting with brock got away though trall heard of mission through spy followed determined to stop visit to calcutta at cost must prove unreasonable bellairs remained with rao made up mind to get away at first opportunity with diamond did not know what might happen thought best to be on safe side save skin at event in time singha received paper of course saw signature applied to bellairs for explanation be absent at time so bellairs saw rao alone what took place at interview hardly knew for bellairs be never very explicit seemed that singha accused bellairs of betraying tried to stab on spot end of struggle be that bellairs passed sword through rao heart then came to tell what have done a saw that everything might come out advised immediate flight same night left kikat shortly afterwards learned how singha heir have found father dead body treasonable paper fearing that if exposed might cost newly acquired throne wisely determined to let sleeping dog lie whether knew that bellairs killed singha not can not say probably guessed that be implicated from disappearance measure be prompt judicious burnt paper gave out that father have died of apoplexy took possession of state a there be nothing to compromise made matter right with government when singha corpse be burnt on pile in accordance with hindoo custom there be nobody to show violence of death new rao did not pursue in case might get into trouble simply let matter die out commenced reign with support of government believe if truth be known be glad father be dead what became of trall never heard mr brock be not afterwards molested by be probably satisfied with spoil mr brock returned to england be presented by bellairs with living of casterwell before leaving put whole fact of case before in power taking into consideration that singha be dead that trall have decamped moreover having regard to then distracted state of country decided to let well alone thus be made very easy for singha son priest believe made fuss about removal of treasure of kikat new rao soon put end to judged better to lose jewel than throne so trouble ended without in way inculpating bellairs made up mind must part from friend friend no longer for must not forgive murder of singha must touch money have be gained by price of dishonour of blood gave diamond to bellairs turning back on went to live like hermit in corner of himalaya that nerve be shaken by late trouble deny must also state that trall treachery singha death bellairs wickedness disgusted with world felt only life must endure be one of solitude bellairs returned to england made peace with father shortly after became squire of casterwell with brock a rector trall have dropped out of sight with ill gotten gain may be dead alive rich poor know not what be more care man ruined life soiled honour hate year afterwards grew weary of solitude married young eurasian lady died when son angus be born alone once more devoted to education of boy a grew up displayed such talent reflected seriously how best to

married be father of only daughter with sudden resolution wrote to casterwell proposed that son must marry daughter that value of two diamond must be given to when became man wife to bellairs replied that gem be not so valuable a have thought have sold for thirty eight thousand pound money have deposited in bank to accumulate father have left well off so have made use of money with interest have

gentleman pensioner of mistress jeremiah collecting rag of gentility supported character well enough never alluded in way to stormy life of past mind taking religious turn dismissed former state a one of sin not to be referred to spent hour reading bible in preparation for summons to existence seemingly that call be not very far away man once bulky frame have shrunk dwindled greatly so that clothes hung loosely upon now after burning of document laurence called at vicarage to tell mr brock of what have done time deaf spinster be successful obtained admission to vicarage mr brock sent out message that be much engaged must see one for week at least surprised somewhat mallow took off on road up to manor met little mr timson doctor pounding along on broken kneed mare at mallow halloo reined up

many of patient be in sad state sad sad state shook little head again poor drabble ah well must come to not necessarily in same way trust well good day mr timson a doctor animal stumbled down hill mallow climbing upward felt somewhat uneasy at news of mr brock industry might be that there be yet more to tell of bellairs wickedness mallow fancied that vicar might be setting down in black white precious queer amusement for clergyman on point of death anyhow muttered to have relative that scribbling be likely to interest that know of same evening leaving aldean tui at whist with old lady led olive into library want to talk to olive about money be saying something other day about getting rid of must use for world thirty thousand of have gone with clara boldini to south america want to give remaining twenty back to indian government h be government will ask question want ca be returned a conscience money even so fancy explanation must be necessary be large sum see besides there be point have overlooked money rather what be left of be not yours not mine then whose be forget will olive in event of not marrying carson money be to go to mr brock well a matter of fact provision of will not being complied with be where ought to go can have with pleasure feel sure wo touch now perhaps not said if got be before read story must give back to want if doe will only forward to proper quarter strictly speaking must be given to rao of kikat there be rao now remember how dr carson said that kingdom be absorbed in empire think will be best to ask mr brock advice not only ask take mr brock be honourable man will agree with that money must be restored be half sorry recovered now be not said mallow grimly at least have done semberry out of haul will see brock laurence do think mr brock knew of father wickedness carson explicitly say that trall did not tell rao about father when singha got paper brock be already on road to calcutta be burnt before returned brock did not know until read carson story must never have published a dr carson wished that be sure must not said mallow warmly carson be quite mistaken in estimate of brock character if angus have lived have refused to marry might have held over a threat envelope be sealed of course still angus knew story a related there dr carson said that told to thing be square now carson be dead with story untold paper be burnt mr brock will keep own counsel for sake after see mr brock dear will never talk of thing again said olive there be one two question feel must ask with sudden recollection of cipher diary possible further revelation mallow withheld approval better let sleeping dog lie dear want to know more of father life at kikat olive what do know have brought nothing unhappiness be just laurence nothing can make more unhappy may a well know everything there be to know well a please must let see mr brock first why to warn suppose n o o think ought to tell of angus carson death what good will do none most likely still think ought to know have always thought motive for carson death be to be found in india there be nothing in story to lead one to think so nothing mr brock may know something at present be under impression that boldini be genuine carson when tell of murder whole conspiracy be possible may recall incident likely to throw light on what be now absolutely cimmerian doubt laurence be still so bent on getting to bottom of murder why not undiscovered mystery be like unfinished tune feel tantalizing desire for closing cadence life will worry about poor fellow death until really know how be killed who killed only one more try olive promise if mr brock fails to help suppose must give up chase well see mr brock then tell story fear will be disappointed who know dear knowledge of father carson life in kikat must be precise for know michael trall may have done ca think laurence michael trall have not be seen heard of for thirty year true true own brother doe know of whereabouts dare say scamp be dead even if be alive ca see where motive must have be true again think will ask mr brock nevertheless chapter vi mr brock addendum in spite of olive fretted trouble have taken firm hold of mind bade fair now to make havoc of body lost flesh rapidly in vain mallow tried to combat brooding over father wrong doing pointed out futility of urged implored to make effort to rouse without result father sin became with ever present enormity be continually dwelling upon tried to get to work to use hand employ actively anyhow at anything so long a for time being be capable of absorbing thus releasing terrible tension under laboured at last mallow saw there be nothing for entire change of scene surroundings must go olive dear away from here away from reminds of will go abroad at once mr purcell will go with later will join in six month time will return dear totally different woman no longer olive bellairs even in name for will be married will laugh at wretched phantom of own raising speak a though be child cried petulantly phantom indeed fact mean father be oh speak of very thought drive beside have to keep to myself oh olive said mallow reproachfully be not help to man never understands doe not feel thing really olive think sooner get away from casterwell better will never be better never never mallow did not argue with saw that be quite useless action not word be necessary if olive be to be restored to proper sense of what be due to herself to others laurence recognized took early opportunity of calling at vicarage again mr brock refused to see next day mallow received note requesting to call promptly on way through village met jeremiah looking distressed lonely want to see clergyman whined peevishly have so many sin to confess can find one to help mallow looked at appeared that trall under stress of religious emotion might confess to priest much more than must be likely to confide to layman in such circumstance be not at improbable that might let drop much must be useful will take to see clergyman trall best in parish be now on way there if will call at vicarage shortly left hand side of church from roadway will leave with then will be able to unbosom mind quite freely oh thank thank mr mallow have many sin to confess many many when will come mallow glanced at watch in three quarter of hour say about four o'clock must take with now only want first to see mr brock on private business trall be more than satisfied with arrangement hobbled off profuse in expression of gratitude mallow continued way to vicarage good day mr brock said a deaf housekeeper showed into study now sick room be glad to see at last indeed must apologize for not receiving before replied vicar wearily have be busy arranging paper against death oh come now be not going to die will never leave house alive mr mallow day be numbered can guess now that reading of carson statement gave severe shock year never suspected that be bellairs who murdered singha indeed did not even know that be murdered for rao chunder heir gave out that father have died of apoplexy did never return to kikat failed altogether to induce governor general to move in matter of blackmailing a rao son be not very friendly to judged wiser to keep away besides heard that bellairs carson have left kikat believed that departure be due to enmity of new rao god forgive never guessed truth rao singha never told that bellairs carson be inculpated in blackmailing trall made out to be own conspiracy entirely kept name out of confession moreover singha have not received incriminating letter with forged name be afterwards burnt by new rao kept own counsel never saw never suspected that bellairs carson have fallen so low do think name be forged do believe that friend be willing accomplice in conspiracy believe name be forged declared brock decisively so far a knew bellairs carson be thoroughly honourable men trall entangled by mean of forgery for own sake be compelled to act a accomplice did bellairs ever hint at truth mr mallow vicar sat up flushed indignantly have be told truth by bellairs do think must have remained vicar of casterwell for olive sake perhaps might have held tongue first act must have be to vacate living bellairs be a silent a grave about kikat hardly ever alluded to life there then only casually guilty conscience doubt suggested mallow a rule man doe particularly care to reperuse smudged page of life book suppose bellairs never told reason for betrothal of olive to angus never never thought be simply solely outcome of strong friendship for carson a to will leaving money in event of marriage not taking place did not know content until bellairs be dead well money be yours now mr brock will take knowing how be earned dear friend believe be superfluous to discus what will do with be dying man by will have restored money to olive can deal with a plea in case be intention to restore to indian government what good will do said vicar with sigh there be rao of kikat now name family very kingdom have died out let olive make restitution if such be wish money will go into wrong pocket if sends there care whose pocket enters doe said mallow main point be to get rid of there be twenty thousand pound mr brock started only that understood that there be fifty true enough have gone across sea with boldini wife boldini who be forgot know story be long one mr brock not pretty one for clergyman to hear a rule hear worst story talk strangely mr mallow understand boldini who be well be man who masqueraded here a angus carson a angus carson do mean to tell that be not really angus carson who will tell about if said mallow with hesitation think be quite strong enough to hear quite strong enough most anxious to hear said mr brock feverishly come mr mallow explain mystery may well call mystery mr brock seems likely to remain one can begin story continue to certain point must finish for then mallow related to astonished vicar intrigue of last few month be most minute in recital giving even reason have induced to take various step mr arne drabble boldini clara introduced people to mr brock placing before in different capacity a vividly a be able refrained from expressing to vicar hope that jeremiah must shortly aid towards solution of mystery must see that old man be becoming exhausted a well a bewildered by what have heard terrible terrible murmured poor olive poor angus oh why why did not tell before there be not much use in telling said mallow gloomily must not have helped be nearer finding out truth than be before why be young carson killed be what want to know what be motive ca think replied mr brock staring before be so dreadful think drabble murdered poor lad drabble interest be to keep alive unless proved stubborn then whew mallow drew long breath from experience in soho house have little difficulty in guessing what mr arne must have done have young carson proved obdurate think killed added be sure did who else must have motive asked vicar wrinkling brow left well say returned to find dead one according to theory must have be in house meanwhile undoubtedly that one be murderer who be be impossible to say angus lived day in india knew one in england perhaps major semberry mallow shook head denied strenuously so far a can see have a much interest a anarchist in keeping carson alive come mr brock be sure there be nothing happened at kikat likely to lead to after thirty year nothing besides carson be not married then boy be not born wonder said mallow musingly if bangle have anything to do with how must asked mr brock amazed well understand be taken from idol brock shook head be not correct singha gave bangle to carson friend with full permission of priest cured rao of severe illness priest approved of reward then michael trall must be murderer how do make out trall disappeared from kikat thirty more year ago have never be heard of since probably be dead probably possibly may be alive may have killed young carson on what ground for what reason said mr brock killing angus must not give money if be what be thinking of be sure trall be dead be too restless ambitious man to remain quiet when have exhausted own share of blackmail must in probability come here for purpose of blackmailing bellairs perhaps knew be here mr brock perhaps so far may have be safeguard to bellairs knowing trall well a do think must have run even risk of denouncing have there be money to be gained when did see last at kikat followed with intention of frustrating plan must have done so at cost of murder make doubt changed route have intended to take be thankful to say missed at moment voice of housekeeper must be heard raised in anger evidently from deeper tone followed against man mr brock grew deadly pale heart beat wildly with sheer nervousness see see what be mr mallow gasped will kill young man ran to door threw open a though have be waiting outside jeremiah shambled into room amid shrill expostulation of sour spinster came a told whimpered trall clutching mallow where be clergyman must see clergyman trall be disgraceful mr brock aha breathed vicar men turned at strangled sound to see sitting up looking at newcomer with vacantly staring eye on side jeremiah released hold of mallow a though drawn by magnet approached sofa sick man visitor gazed blankly at one why whispered trall still gazing be be be be why be michael michael repeated mallow what michael michael trall brother oh michael be so glad to see be jerry man on bed stared stared spoke not word face be blanched with fear repeatedly put out hand a though to keep other back then quietly silently without sign of recognition fell back dead chapter vii cipher diary even in first shock of untimely death though timely discovery mallow kept wit about that brock be truly michael trall made doubt for in truth jeremiah have capacity reason to simulate relationship of kind moreover nothing surely must be more conclusive than fatal effect unexpected meeting have have for brock beside whom now wretched man dropped into prayer supplication called upon to recover implored for sign look wept bitterly mallow did not molest be totally unfit for rational conversation poor brock may still be called so for avoidance of confusion be quite dead mallow slipped hand under clothes on to heart to make quite sure sight of brother knowledge of what must follow have done work snuffed out of life come now trall said mallow must try pull together what be more must not say word about one must know understand trall one a mr brock lived a mr brock died be own brother michael believe trall reticence absolute silence on point be necessary if only for own safety remember brotherhood be quite enough for trall promised implicit obedience will sit in corner a quiet a mouse mr mallow concluded if only will let oh take away well may remain there for present remember not word to one about mallow deemed advisable to alarm household rang bell acidulated housekeeper duly appeared immediately lost control of cried out aloud gesticulated wildly fellow servant followed suit in very few moment usually tranquil vicarage be very pandemonium of weeping wailing promptly mallow sent messenger for mr timson for lord aldean with strict injunction not in way to alarm lady at manor house determined not to leave place until have possession of cipher diary seeing now that without doubt be michael trall expected much in way of revelation from diary be passion with of perverted instinct to set down deed misdeed in black white such document be invariably to be relied upon be usually perfectly unfettered in utterance tangible communion of such people with mallow anticipated difficulty only so far a unravelling of cipher be concerned might prove obstinately difficult might not argued there be cipher invented by man that man must not unravel unravel must even though took year in doing of remained now to secure document within hour mr timson arrived seemed in nowise astonished at suddenness of mr brock death just what expected chirped in pessimistic way cardiac failure pure simple be excited in way presume mr mallow yes became very excited while be talking with said laurence evasively quite so quite so warned told how must be dear dear most regrettable natural same quite natural mr timson be moved not hair breadth from habitual complacency think body must be removed to bedroom said mallow hardly liked to begin search for diary with dead man body lying there certainly certainly more decent quite right so superintended by little man mr brock remains be carried out of study progress to bedroom drew forth further lamentation from female servant timson took off then a went out of hall lord aldean entered be full of sympathy amazed poor old chap said a mallow conducted to study died of heart failure suppose be awfully sorry for poor old fellow be good sort brock yes be sorry too said mallow grimly not quite for reason dead man be michael trall not brock trall what do mean aldean cast glance at jeremiah be not trall then be michael poor brother sighed creature in corner mr brock brother well wait moment aldean will tell about directly then turning to jeremiah mallow asked be brother good man o o replied trall be clever be not good man deserted wife poor little clara be fond of brother be always brother oh mallow paused did not wish to reflect in way upon dead man be afraid to trust jeremiah out of sight lest in weakness must reveal connection with late vicar wish to speak privately with lord aldean said at length go trall into next room for hour stay there mind not word to one about what have happened very well mr mallow replied jeremiah submissively creeping towards door laurence followed made comfortable in dining room sour spinster now very niobe tear be informed that mr trall be suffering from shock at unexpected death of vicar be not on account to be disturbed having arranged thus for jeremiah seclusion mallow returned to study where found aldean in state of intense expectancy situation hint of mystery puzzled what be business about asked when saw friend lock door be about michael trall alias brock who truly believe jim be murderer for whom have searched so long mr brock murderer of carson impossible must be mistaken surely well perhaps think so will give ground for saying so think will agree jim that be pretty strong rapidly tersely mallow related story a set forth by dr carson concealed nothing not even bellairs guilt finally expressed conviction that in mr brock diary must be found key to whole mystery jim be amazed still must not agree with friend murderer write account of crime pronounced decisively not such fool a to make up own brief for prosecution be just where be wrong jim there be not few case on record said mallow can recollect one in particular where clerk wrote in diary day fine hot killed little girl in croft spinney ' line hanged glad did growled jim in disgust for being such fool confess have sympathy for man who give away like perhaps not jim there seems to be peculiar fascination about confession of men ca resist may be that there be great relief for in unburdening mind even on paper if can judge michael trall character from carson story have heaped up goodly pile of wickedness thirty more year moreover if diary be guileless reading must not resort to cipher jim believe man have sought to ease conscience by setting down sin may have mallow cipher teaser doubt anticipate will be child play by mean still be fact that there be cipher invented by ingenuity of man given time application can not be unravelled diary may take day even month to straighten into queen english sooner later will master content if only to learn why brock killed carson speak confidently mallow brock may be innocent even yet possible to mind improbable if brock be not guilty know who be however be use theorizing when have fact before brock key be under pillow sure have right to search mallow will take risk of said laurence with composure forthwith went to work assisted by aldean manifestly most promising hunting ground be escritoire near window at michael trall in clerical capacity have be accustomed to compile sermon mallow first explored pigeon hole paper scrutinizing writing of in turn so far failed to find anything at incriminating unlocked drawer went through systematically from top to bottom in right hand corner of lowest drawer found diary carelessly thrown in without attempt at concealment be contained in stout volume bound in red cloth on back be written in ink oh said mallow examining neat cipher writing rogue evidently posted criminal ledger with utmost regularity where be other twenty be not in desk for by time have searched inch of jim examined bookcase filled to overflowing occupying three wall of room near top of one of found shamelessly exposed remaining twenty volume astute mr brock have evidently acted upon conviction that in attempting concealment aroused curiosity reading have doubt included story of edgar allan poe cheek of beggar grumbled aldean tumbling down ledger promptly have faith in cipher in reputation a rev manner brock said mallow receiving book below arranging on table expect there be material enough for dozen detective novel in lot eh what be up now jim swear aldean suppressing further imprecation scrambled down ladder look here mallow just look watch chain stud missing wrist button counted laurence coolly be more than expected there can be doubt after jim here be dead man jewellery lying brute said that drabble gave other wrist button a curiosity surveyed tarnished gold double pile of red book in silence then said aldean slowly god to think of murderous scoundrel saying be parson make sick to think of might have lived to marry tui by gum jim started a discovery slowly evolved in brain say mallow marriage in parish must be wrong 'uns what be to be done about must wait until read diary before considering matter of such minor importance a said mallow tapping book expect wo be easy to straighten out brock crooked way call brock make feel bad brock must be called jim for present none of lady must know truth until get through book manner brock be dead not michael trall understand jeremiah will manage have there be expect open door jim aldean did so trall looking white agitated crept into room be afraid to be alone whimpered ca stop here must go home now trall said mallow soothingly can read cipher opened out book to jeremiah in faint hope of receiving affirmative answer to surprise delight came can read mr mallow be michael cipher taught to when be boy hurrah sang aldean slapping trall back will translate then michael diary said jeremiah quicker in understanding than might have be expected see ah michael be always clever with pen be sight too clever time muttered jim assisting friend to tie up book in neat bundle here operation ceased for moment mallow aldean with jeremiah in charge returned home after few direction to deaf housekeeper then came difficult task of explaining certain rumour have already reached manor house jim discreetly held tongue left thing to friend who vouchsafed a little information a be consistent with allaying general alarm mr brock have died suddenly from heart failure declared refraining carefully from mention of dead man identity with michael trall of carson story from reference to cipher diary in lamentation ensued further question be spared man must be buried a mr brock said mallow to aldean day two later there be other course open if story be to be kept quiet yes suppose so will save trouble over marriage better let have decent name over tombstone though doe deserve a pseudo brock have relative for mallow insisted that jeremiah must suppress fact of relationship olive a lady of manor charged with funeral so scoundrel be buried in fine style although be only fair to state that have kept false name clean enough so far a concerned parish must not feel loss there be much weeping eulogy by graveside a michael trall of kikat be laid under turf of churchyard in odour of sanctity mallow thought be one of life greater irony good lord be aside to jim how rogue must chuckle at mummery if spirit have eye to see might be canonized saint for fuss make must have have good in replied aldean meditatively a mr brock be straight enough that know serpent in bamboo can not be otherwise than straight said mallow casterwell vicarage be friend bamboo triple murderer faugh triple how triple murdered carson be certain brock be despatched by so that must assume missionary lambskin must be surprised to learn that not bellairs made away with rao singha be capable of a mr brock a mr brock jim there must be inscribed upon tomb couplet of byronic imitator settled with little pious leaven to give fag end of life to heaven jeremiah did not attend funeral mallow induced to remain at home lest in grief tongue might get better of so sat in room painfully translated rascality of michael into plain english taught laurence cipher laurence toiled likewise be affair of many week indeed lasted until mr purcell announced determination to take olive abroad at same time tui received cablegram announcing that delighted parent be on way to england much of diary have bearing on story in last volume so there be note shed flood of light upon much be before hopelessly obscure one discovery in particular be of greatest satisfaction to mallow indeed led to communicate latter portion of diary to olive miss slarge mr purcell tui matter did not concern must not be

waited event a happened new king be afraid lest father conspiracy must cost throne so hushed up matter gave out that singha have died of apoplexy a danger from quarter be over three must now enjoy fruit of success told bellairs carson have killed brock so there be nothing to be feared from government through bellairs returned to england taking with own diamond carson latter have found rag of conscience somewhere since have murdered rao talked of diamond a 'price of blood ' refused to take let carry off although must have liked for however be quite satisfied with share for sold diamond for thirty thousand pound with money went back to europe where married became father of daughter altogether have glorious time carson in fit of repentance retired to himalayan hermitage haunted suppose by what be called guilty conscience fool shooting of brock troubled not in least what did trouble be run of bad luck lost everything returned to london placed wife child in care of jerry who be bachelor must better afford to keep than then determined to look up bellairs who be now squire of casterwell horribly prosperous on making inquiry learned that vicar of parish be dead that living be in bellairs ' gift be terribly weary of wandering occurred to that position must suit very well at event for while be quite simple matter for to impersonate manner brock have paper be well up in detail of early life a well a life in creature have be confirmed babbler have told everything about have trouble with bellairs at first soon saw be no good be desperately jealous of what called good name have everything to lose nothing so did wisest thing must do gave in became reverend manner brock have difficulty in deceiving old bishop of diocese have paper be well up in necessary detail living of be poor one of course bellairs have to alter that told when approached part of subject that have sold two diamond for thirty eight thousand pound then too indulged in silly nonsense about 'price of blood so on said have prevented touching money for last ten year have be lying in bank at compound interest have now reached something like fifty thousand pound soon settled that made invest money securely yet profitably pay interest felt now must settle down in comfort to hardly earned repose have assured position good name most comfortable income there be time of course when grew weary of so much respectability then have to do be to assume disguise run up to london for few day enjoy never went near jerry wife be dead looked after daughter so a reverend manner brock life if quiet be pleasant enough for year went well until one day there came letter from carson regretting that have surrendered diamond suggesting that son have married in mean time must marry olive bellairs that proceeds of diamond must be given to young people on wedding day at first bellairs refused carson replied threatening exposure more than that plainly gave bellairs to understand that must accuse of rao singha murder for sake of jealously guarded name bellairs be forced to yield wrote to carson telling how in person of rev manner brock have become vicar of casterwell how have be obliged to pay interest on money did not wish to be selfish naturally refused to give up income so in end compromised matter be arranged must have interest until marriage took place when be to surrender a must not be for twenty year agreed to arrangement provided that if did not take place money must revert to bellairs made will to effect carson insisted that fifty thousand must be settled on son with discretionary clause that must pay one thousand year to wife did not know at time though learned later that bellairs have left letter for daughter imploring to marry angus a feared did not that dr carson must make known truth thus tarnish memory so matter be arranged year slipped by bellairs died then carson wrote to that have told son story keeping back however own guilt of singha murder have also put story on paper though in doing so have carefully refrained from connecting a brock with michael trall account intimated be sending by son to so might if necessary use to force olive into marriage refused so to further desire angus son be to denounce to accuse of murder of brock needle to say be greatly alarmed at existence of document by knowledge that young carson have in power to ruin even when dr carson died be not reassured a still knew that angus be in possession of document story first must not ruin since identity with brock of casterwell be not shown if angus proved difficult to deal with might be very awkward for to make more comfortable resolved to see angus before arrived at casterwell must then know at event how be disposed towards mr purcell letter have be shown to by miss slarge plainly hinted that angus be religious prig foresaw that might not prove so easy to manage a father have be from letter also learned name of steamer in angus be coming to
