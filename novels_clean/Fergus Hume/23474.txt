saw officious chaplain left behind on platform have secret with uneasiness of loaded conscience fancied that everyone saw that have something to conceal particularly cargrim in presence of good young

suspecting dr pendle to be in serious trouble at end of hour found a ignorant a ever made only one discovery of note be that bishop have taken cheque book with to london to many people must have seemed natural circumstance a most men with banking account take cheque book with when going on journey cargrim knew that bishop usually preferred to fill pocket with loose cash when absent for short time deviation from ordinary habit appeared to be suspicious 'hum thought chaplain rubbing chin wonder if so called clergyman wanted money if have wished for small sum bishop must easily have given to out of cash box going by reasoning must have wanted lot of money argues blackmail hum have taken cheque book only one ' reason of last query be that bishop pendle have account in two different bank one in beorminster a became bishop of see other in london in accordance with dignity of spiritual lord of parliament further search showed mr cargrim that beorminster cheque book have be left behind 'hum said chaplain again man must have gone back to london dr pendle be going to meet there draw money from town bank to pay what demand will have look at butt of cheque book when come back amount of cheque may prove much may even find out name of stranger ' a cargrim very well knew be pure theory bishop might have taken cheque book to london for other reason than paying blackmail to stranger for be not even certain that there be such extortion in question dr pendle be worried be true after departure of strange visitor have be taken ill fact proved nothing after twisting turning in way

have own reason for keeping silent advised cargrim to wait until be consulted in connection with matter before troubling unnecessarily about bey father know own business best finished gabriel stiffly will forgive speaking so plainly ' 'certainly certainly pendle owe great deal to father must do much to save from annoyance by way with abrupt change of subject know that saw stranger who called at

baffled returned with gentle persistence to object have in view however strong of will adversary happened to be will be bound in long run to yield to incessant attack of chaplain at present moment desired to have interview with mr mosk be determined to obtain one in spite of bell refusal however have time to waste on persuasive method a wished to see invalid before bishop returned to achieve

about private affair when have learned wished to know have given advice in tone of command not to be disobeyed must retire leaving evidence of trail behind in shape of nauseous little tract with abusive title be use poor creature refusing to see mr pansey for forced into most private chamber never must retire unless thought fit to do so of own will be for reason cargrim suggested good lady must call upon mr mosk for knew well that father daughter whole assembled domestic of hotel must be able to stop from making way to bedside of invalid in devastated rear of mr pansey chaplain intended to follow principal object in seeing mr mosk be to discover what knew about man called jentham be lodging at derby winner a cargrim ascertained by later inquiry be probable that inmate of hotel knew something a to reason of stay in beorminster mr mosk being a obstinate a mule be not likely to tell cargrim anything desired to learn bell detesting chaplain a took pain to conceal must probably refuse to hold conversation with mr mosk being weak minded ill might be led by dexterous questioning to tell knew what did know might in cargrim opinion throw more light on jentham connection with bishop therefore next morning cargrim called on archdeacon widow to inveigle into persecuting mr mosk with call mr pansey with acuteness must not see that be being made use of luckily for cargrim '

filled with people talking over matter amateur detective swilling beer in public house gave opinion about crime more beer drank wilder more impossible became theory suggested that gipsy camped on southberry heath who be continually fighting amongst have killed miserable creature others asserting that scamp be desperately poor hinted at suicide induced by sheer despair most generally accepted opinion be that jentham have be killed in drunken frolic by one more irish harvester beorminster reporter visited police station endeavoured to learn what inspector tinkler thought have seen body have viewed spot where have be found have examined carter giles crake so be man most likely to give satisfactory answer to question a to who have killed man why have be shot inspector tinkler be most wary of official pending inquest verdict of twelve good men true declined to commit to opinion result of reticence be that reporter have to fall back on inventive faculty next morning published three

left room mab who have be admiring ring during foregoing conversation be so impressed with quaint beauty that again thanked george for having given to piece of politeness led to exhibition of tenderness on part of departing lover during dragon absence foolish young couple talked charming nonsense people in condition particularly affect realism be very good thing in own way to set down actual love conversation must be carrying to excess only exaggerated exaltation of mind attendant on love making can enable lover to endure transcendentalism with bore one then look make arrow of most trifling phrase caress give merest glance most eloquent meaning how can prosaic pen ink paper report fittingly sympathetic reader must guess what george mab said to one must fancy how said must see in mind eye how young beautiful glowing looked when miss whichello a prose of poetry walked into room dear old lady smiled approvingly when saw bright face for too have lived in arcady although envious god have turned out of long since captain pendle when have done talking nonsense with child be ready call george miss whichello ' entreated captain sir not until father give engagement episcopalian blessing nonsense come along miss whichello bark be worse than bite for discreetly left room so that love bird must take tender leave of other captain pendle found standing on step outside with broad

off with twinkle in bright eye little old lady be one of loved by god for must undoubtedly die young in heart still a walked with captain pendle to station in gathering darkness looked worried white george must not see face in dusk moreover be too much taken up with late charming interview to notice companion preoccupation in spite of sympathy miss whichello grew weary of monologue on part of george in name of beab occurred fifty time more be glad when train steamed off with too happy lover promised to deliver kind of unnecessary message to girl george have left behind 'but let be happy while can ' murmured miss whichello a tripped back through town soul if only knew what know a miss have meaning of enigmatic speech in mind did not think be necessary to put into word silent pensive walked along crowded pavement shortly turned down side street led to police station there paused in quiet corner to pin veil round head veil so thick that feature must hardly be distinguished through poor lady adopted a kind of disguise forgetting that old fashioned poke bonnet quaint silk cloak be a well known to inhabitant of beorminster a cathedral early century garb be a familiar to rascality of slum a to richer citizen even police knew well for have often seen charitable wearer by bedside of dying pauper thus happened that when miss whichello presented at police station to inspector tinkler knew at once in spite of foolish little veil moreover in greeting pronounced name 'hush hush mr inspector whispered miss whichello with mysterious glance around ' wish to be known called here ' 'you can depend upon discretion miss whichello ma'be ' said inspector who be bluff tyrannical ex sergeant what can do for ' miss whichello looked round again ' wish mr inspector ' said in very small voice be taken by to dead house ' 'to dead house miss whichello ma'be ' said iron tinkler hardly able to conceal astonishment although be against disciplinarian idea to show emotion 'there be dead man in there mr inspector whom knew under very different circumstance more than twenty year ago 'answers to name of jentham perhaps suggested mr inspector called jentham believe wish to see body ' little old lady looked anxiously into tinkler purple face whichello ma'be ' said ex sergeant with official air request requires reflection do know party in question knew a told more than twenty year ago be then very talented violinist heard play frequently in london ' be name miss whichello ma'be ' name then mr inspector be amaru ' ' stage name take to be ma'be ' stage name ' be real name ca say ' replied miss whichello in hesitating voice knew only a amaru ' here called jentham do know anything about murder miss whichello ma'be inspector fixed blood shot grey eye on thick veil 'no know nothing about murder cried miss whichello in earnest tone heard that man jentham looked like gipsy be marked with scar on right cheek from description thought that might be amaru wish to see body to be certain that be right miss whichello ma'be ' said stern tinkler after deliberation request be out of usual course of thing knowing a good charitable lady thinking may throw light on mysterious crime why will show corpse with pleasure ' 'one moment ' said old lady laying detaining hand on inspector blue cloth sleeve ' must tell can throw light on subject if must must simply desire to see body of man to satisfy that be amaru ' good miss whichello ma'be will see ' 'and will not mention that came here mr inspector give word ma'be word of soldier way miss whichello way ' following rigid figure of inspector little old lady be conducted by to small building of galvanised tin in rear of police station several idler be hanging about amongst being miss bell mosk who be trying to persuade handsome young policeman to gratify morbid curiosity eye opened to widest width when recognised miss whichello silk cloak poke bonnet saw vanish into dead house never ' said miss mosk ' never thought 'd be fond of corps at time of life seeing a will soon be one ' little old lady inspector remained within for five six minute when came out tear be falling fast beneath miss whichello veil 'be that man asked tinkler in low voice 'yes replied miss whichello 'that be man knew a amaru ' chapter xvi zeal of inspector tinkler strange affair of jentham murder continued to occupy attention of beorminster public throughout week on day when inquest be held popular excitement rose to fever heat inspector tinkler feeling that county expected to do great thing worthy of reputation a zealous officer worked hardest to gather evidence likely to elucidate mystery of death in spite of most strenuous exertion effort resulted in total failure collected detail proved to be of most meagre description when coroner sat on body nothing transpired to reveal name even indicate identity of assassin who have provided with body to sit on really seemed a though southberry murder must end in being relegated to list of undiscovered crime ca work miracle explained indignant tinkler when reproached with result somehow case have got out of hand motive for shooting ca be got at pistol used ai to be picked up search how may a for murdering villain who fired if ai down below where ought to be will take oath a soldier ai above ground take how will case be corker mistake have certainly occurred to tinkler bothered mind miss whichello must be called a witness if only to prove at one time dead man have occupied better position in world after short interview with have abandoned idea miss whichello declared that must throw light on affair that have lost sight of quondam violinist for over thirty year recognition of a amaru have be entirely due to description of gipsy look noticeable cicatrice on face pointed out to tinkler that have not seen so called jentham till after death moreover be unlikely that event have occurred thirty year before must have resulted in man violent death at present time miss whichello insisted that knew nothing of creature later circumstance acquaintance being thus ignorant be not to be expected that evidence must be of value so at earnest request tinkler held tongue forebore to summon a witness miss whichello be greatly relieved in own mind when inspector came to conclusion did not let tinkler see relief from mosk officer have learned that vagabond who called jentham have appeared at derby winner three week previous to time of death have given information a to where have last rested so far a mosk knew have dropped down from sky certainly conversation when be intoxicated showed that have travelled great deal that past be concerned with robbery bloodshed lawlessness man have talked generally a traveller might have refrained from mentioning name altogether have spoken so loosely that nothing likely to lead to tangible result must be gathered from rambling discourse have paid board lodging for first week thereafter have lived on credit at time of death have owed mosk over two pound principally for strong drink usually slept at derby winner loafed about street day at time went over to gipsy camp near southberry fraternised with romany be gist of mosk information added a afterthought jentham have promised to pay when certain monies expected came into possession 'who be going to pay money ' asked tinkler pricking up ear 'car y'arsk somethin ' easier growled mosk 'how must know said be goin ' to get dibs who from where from dunno ' for held tongue so far ' 'there be money in pocket of clothes worn by body said tinkler musingly dessay not mr inspector b'lieve cove be expecting money 't be moonshine talk to make trust for bed grub blamed fool have bin doin ' so grumbled mosk pocket be turned inside out though be be mr inspector well doe look queer if there be light fingered business to be done dessay gipsy hev somethin ' to do with ' 'did man go to gipsy camp on sunday night 'bell s did ' replied mr mosk 'but went over to southberry in arternoon about little a be sweet on so know what did save by 'earsay bell on being questioned by inspector declared that jentham have loitered about hotel greater part of sunday have taken departure about five o'clock did not say that be going to camp a often paid visit to presumed that have gone there during evening 'especially a found corpse on common mr tinkler ' said bell 'no doubt poor wretch be coming back from gipsy 'humph be not bad idea ' said tinkler scratching well shaven chin betrikes a will go look up mother jael ' result of interview with iniquitous old beldame proved that jentham have certainly be guest of gipsy on sunday evening have returned to beorminster shortly after nine o'clock have stated that be going back to derby winner a be custom to come go when pleased romany have not taken much notice of departure vagrant like jentham be quite independent of time 'he be one of lot suppose ' said mr inspector taking few note in pocket book secretive little article shut with patent clasp dearie yes lord bless mumbled mother jael blinking cunning eye be one of gentle romany sure enough 'be with long granny 'three week lovey jus ' three week cum to beorminster got weary like of gentile so made comforbal with ' 'blackguards to blackguard bird of feather murmured tinkler then asked if jentham have told mother jael anything about 'he ' screeched old hag niver tol ' word cum ' go 'd kep red rag to did duvel be cunning one jentham ' 'be name jentham mother be something else 'he called so dearie niver knowed one of gentle romany a have gentile name stick to own mos'ly job shud think so ' 'be sure be gipsy be noble gorgio must patter calo jib with best of 'um know 'd lot wot gentile don know ' have eagle beak ' peaked eye oh tiny jesus be romany chal may die for ' 'do know who killed ' asked tinkler abruptly 'no lovey 'twere one of tho ' put allays wust on back job dog do niver eat dog a know dearie ' 'he left camp at nine o'clock ' 'thereabouts lamb jes arter nine ' sober drunk ' ' between lovey cud walk straight ' talk straight ' look arter blessed life 'humph seems a though must ' said mr inspector dryly 'duvel be true sayin '' said jael with nod don ' know wot cum to dearie ' at inquest mother jael be called a witness told jury much same story a have related to tinkler with further detail a to movement of gipsy on night declared that none of tribe have left camp jentham have gone away alone comparatively sober that did not hear of murder until late next day in spite of examination cross examination mother jael must give evidence a to jentham real name about past why be lingering at beorminster 'he cum 'd ' go 'd ' said jael with air of oracle be extent of information delivered in croaking shuffling unconvincing manner carter giles crake who have found body be stupid yokel whose knowledge be entirely limited to immediate surroundings perched on cart have seen body lying in ditch half full of water on other side of earthen mound extended along side of main road spot where discovered be near beorminster about five mile from gipsy camp man have be shot through heart pocket have be emptied turned inside out evidently after murder robber have dragged body over mound into ditch giles have not touched corpse being fearful of getting into trouble have come on at once to beorminster to inform police of discovery be dr graham who have examined body when first discovered according to evidence man have be shot through heart shortly before ten o'clock on sunday night pistol have be fired so close that clothing of deceased over heart be scorched blackened with powder of cartridge from fact ' added graham with one of shrewd glance gather that murderer must have be known to jentham 'how be that doctor ' asked one of jury 'because must have held in talk while contemplating crime sir murderer victim must almost have be breast to breast while attention of latter be distracted in way assassin must have shot at close quarter 'this be theory dr graham ' said coroner who be rival practitioner seems to that whole case rest on theory ' retorted graham shrugged shoulder before evidence concerning matter closed inspector tinkler explained how difficult have be to collect even few detail jury have heard stated also that although strictest search have be made in vicinity of crime weapon with have be committed must not be found a shooting have be done during downfall of rain assassin victim footmark be visible in soft clay of roadway also there be mark of horse hoof so be probable that murderer have be mounted if be so neither gipsy harvester must have killed wretched man a one lot other possessed horse ' 'the gipsy have horse to draw caravan interrupted sharp looking juryman 'to draw caravan admit ' said undaunted tinkler 'but not to ride on besides must remind mr jobson a mother jael declares that none of crowd left camp on night ' 'd declare anything ' muttered jobson who have great opinion of tinkler brain 'have footmark in road be measured 'no have mr jobson ' must have mr inspector can tell lot from footmark a have heard be what french call bertillon system of identification be what be ' ' need to go to france to learn business ' said tinkler tartly 'and if did get measurement of footmark how be to know be jentham murderer how can go round whole of beorminster to see whose foot fit ask that mr jobson sir ' at point judging that discussion have gone far enough coroner intervened said that mr inspector have done best to unravel very difficult case that have not succeeded be fault of case not of mr inspector for part thought that thanks of beorminster citizen be due to effort of so zealous intelligent officer a tinkler sapient speech reduced recalcitrant jobson to silence still held to opinion that over confident tinkler have bungled matter in view be silently heartily supported by shrewd dr graham who privately considered that mr inspector tinkler be little better than as however did not give vent to offensive opinion summing up of coroner called for little remark be worthy country doctor with a much brain a must cover sixpence case be beyond in way remark to jury equally stupid with exception of jobson be to effect that be evidently impossible to find out who have killed jentham that man be quarrelsome vagabond who probably have many enemy that doubt while crossing common in drunken humour have met with someone a bad a have come to high word with that unknown man being armed have doubt shot deceased in fit of rage robbed body daresay gentleman concluded coroner then threw into ditch to conceal evidence of crime a know man be never likely to know can only suggest that must find verdict in accordance with evidence supplied to by zeal of inspector tinkler man have done can to find out cain effort have be vain so must leave punishment of murderer to god a holy scripture say that murder will out have doubt that day criminal will be brought to justice ' after wise speech be not surprising that jury brought in verdict 'that deceased jentham met with violent death at hand of person person unknown that being kind of verdict jury without brain a in present instance generally give having thus settled matter to own bovine satisfaction jury went away after having be thanked for zeal by coroner that gentleman be great on zeal 'hum hum hum ' said dr graham to 'there be too much zeal altogether wonder what m de talleyrand must have thought of cabbage zeal well mr inspector ' added aloud beo have finished off matter nicely 'we have done best dr graham sir 'and know who killed man sir what be more believe anybody ever will know 'humph that be opinion be do read much mr inspector ' ' novel at time sir be fond of good novel let recommend to attention work of french author by name gaboriau there be man in called lecoq who must have found out truth mr inspector 'fiction dr graham sir fiction enough mr inspector most fiction be founded on fact ' sir ' said tinkler with superior wise smile ' must like to see case in hand of mr lecoq ' beo must mr inspector in hand of sherlock holmes bless tinkler 'd do almost a much a have done be pity that be not character in fiction tinkler ' sir why may ask ' 'because author might have touched up in weak part have gifted with brain good day mr inspector ' while graham walked away chuckling at banter of red tape official official stood gasping like fish out of water trying to realise insult levelled at dignity jobson small man sidled round to front of made comment on situation come of not measuring footmark said jobson 'in detective novel clever fellow always do 'd never be put into book not ' 'you will be put into jail ' cried outraged inspector more than jentham murderer will if have got catching of ' said jobson walked off chapter xvii clerical detective time mr michael cargrim have not be idle on hearing of murder thought have immediately centred on bishop to say that chaplain be shocked be to express feeling much too mildly be horrified thunderstruck terrified in fact there be word in english tongue strong enough to explain superlative state of mind be characteristic of man malignant nature that be fully prepared to believe in dr pendle guilt without hearing evidence for against opinion be aware that jentham have be cognisant of weighty secret concerning bishop past for concealing of be to have be bribed when report of murder reached chaplain ear quite believed that in place of paying sum agreed upon dr pendle have settled account with blackmailer by shooting cargrim took extreme view of matter for two reason firstly because have gathered from bishop movement jentham talk of tom tiddler ground that meeting on southberry heath have be arranged between pair secondly because money be found on dead body must have be case have bribe be paid to circumstantial evidence that turned out pocket pointed to robbery mr cargrim at moment strangely enough paid attention in considering case cargrim wish be very much father to thought for desired to believe in bishop guilt a knowledge of must give great deal of power over ecclesiastical superior if must only collect sufficient evidence to convict dr pendle of murdering jentham must show link in chain of circumstance by arrived at conclusion have little doubt that bishop to induce to hide crime must become abject slave to gain such immense power use for furtherance of own interest cargrim be quite prepared to compound possible felony so last case of bishop must be worse than first instead of being in jentham power must be in cargrim in place of taking form of money blackmail must assume that of influence so mr cargrim argued case out so determined to shape plan yet have certain hesitancy in taking first step have a firmly believed knowledge dr pendle be murderer yet although possession of such secret gave unlimited power be afraid to use for mere exercise in present lack of material evidence to prove truth be ticklish job cargrim felt like man gripping comet by tail doubtful whether to hold on let go however uncertain state of thing must be remedied by strict examination into circumstance of case therefore cargrim set mind to searching out have be present at inquest none of witness brought forward by bungling tinkler have made statement likely to implicate bishop evidently suspicion connecting dr pendle with jentham existed in mind of police public cargrim must have set rumour afloat by mere hint that dead man bishop strange visitor on night of reception have be one same did not think judicious to do wanted bishop secret to be alone more spotless be dr pendle public character more anxious must be to retain by becoming cargrim slave in order that chaplain might be silent regarding guilt to obtain such advantage be necessary for cargrim to acquaint with way in dr pendle have committed crime a be obliged to work by stealth be easy task after cogitation wily chaplain concluded that must be best to hear general opinion of beorminster gossip in order to pick up stray scrap of information likely to be of use to afterwards intended to call on mr inspector tinkler hear officially more immediate detail of case by what heard from police social prattler cargrim hoped to be guided in constructing case against dr pendle then there be bishop london journey bishop cheque book with missing butt bishop journey to from southberry on day night when murder have be committed fact must go far to implicate in matter also cargrim desired to find missing pistol paper have evidently be taken from corpse last idea be purely theoretical a be cargrim fancy that jentham power over dr pendle have to do with certain paper argued from fact that pocket of dead man clothes have be turned inside out cargrim did not believe that bishop have paid blackmail therefore pocket must not have be searched for money more so a possible robber must have known that jentham must be possessed of sum worth committing murder for on night on other hand if jentham have possessed paper inculpated bishop in crime be probable that after shooting assassin have searched for have obtained paper to attached so much value be bishop who have turned pocket inside out a cargrim decided for above reason certainly from commonsense point of view cargrim theory knowing what did know be feasible enough having thus arrived at point where be necessary to transmute thought into action mr cargrim assumed best clerical uniform tallest whitest jam pot collar drew on pair of delicate lavender glove spotless neat eminently sanctimonious chaplain took demure way towards mr pansey residence a judged very rightly that must be most likely person to afford possible information archdeacon widow lived on outskirt of beorminster in gloomy old barrack of mansion surrounded by large garden in turn be girdled by high red brick wall with broken glass bottle on top a though mr pansey dwelt in gaol be on account to be allowed out have such thing be possible whole of beorminster humanity rich poor must willingly have subscribed large sum to build wall higher to add spike to glass bottle anything to keep mr pansey in gaol prevent issuing forth a social scourge into gaol mr cargrim be admitted with certain solemnity by sour faced footman whose milk of human

regarding knowledge of dead man ' see what have to do with ' said quietly with intention of arriving at mr pansey meaning 'ah more can anyone else mr cargrim know know ' 'know what dear mr pansey oh

dreadful murder accuse one daisy simply think ' do think ' questioned cargrim rather sharply ' think what think ' be mr pansey enigmatic response shut mouth hard honestly speaking artful old lady be a puzzled by miss whichello visit to dead house a hearer must bring very tangible accusation against mr pansey well knew art of spreading scandal be quite satisfied that significant silence about

to stem torrent of infidelity debauchery lying flattery roll through city 'oh dear how strange be that dear bishop saw nothing of frightful murder exclaimed daisy who have be reflecting rode back from southberry late on sunday night hear ' lordship saw nothing be sure ' said cargrim hastily for be not design to incriminate dr pendle have must have mentioned to know miss norsham there be quite tempest on night so even if lordship have passed near scene of murder must not have heard shot of assassin cry of victim rain thunder must in human probability have drowned ' 'besides lordship be

galloping past asked mr pendle have be out riding on sunday declared that have seen george about eight o'clock when be on heath gabriel shortly after nine a be coming home gave wretched boy good scolding supper psalm to commit to memory ' 'george gabriel pendle riding on southberry heath on night ' said chaplain thoughtfully 'it be very strange ' betrange ' almost shouted mr pansey 'it worse than strange be sabbath breaking father riding also wonder mystery of iniquity doth work when high in land break fourth commandment be going mr cargrim 'yes be sorry to leave such charming company

about what observes behe talk scandal if be what mean ' ' be afraid that word be rather harsh miss whichello ' 'it may be sir be rather appropriate to mr pansey well who be talking about to day ' 'about several people dear lady amongst number miss whichello drew little body up stiffly 'and have anything unpleasant to say about ' 'oh not at only remarked that saw visiting dead house last week miss whichello let fall cup with crash turned pale 'how doe know ' be sharp question saw ' repeated chaplain 'and in spite of veil recognised by cloak bonnet ' be greatly obliged to mr pansey for interest take in business ' said miss whichello in most stately manner did visit beorminster dead house there ' chapter xviii chaplain on warpath miss whichello frank admission that have visited dead house rather disconcerted mr cargrim from circumstance of veil have presumed that wished errand there to be unknown in case conduct must have appeared highly suspicious since be supposed to know nothing about jentham jentham murder ready acknowledgment of fact apparently showed that have nothing to conceal cargrim for acuteness did not guess that of two evil miss whichello have chosen least in truth did not wish visit to dead house to be known a mr pansey be cognisant of judged wiser to neutralise possible harm that lady must do by admitting original statement to be true one honesty must take wind out of mr pansey sail prevent from distorting admitted fact into fiction of hinted wickedness furthermore miss whichello be prepared to give cargrim sufficient reason for visit so that might not invent one only by so open course must keep secret of thirty year old acquaintance with dead man a rule little old lady hated subterfuge in case only chance of safety lay in beating pansey cargrim company with own weapon who can say that be acting wrongly 'yes mr cargrim ' repeated looking directly in face pansey be right be at dead house went to see corpse of man jentham suppose mr pansey wonder why did so dear lady ' remonstrated embarrassed chaplain 'by mean such knowledge be none of business be none of business ' 'you have made business however observed miss whichello dryly 'else must scarcely have informed of mr pansey unwarrantable remark on private affair well mr cargrim suppose know that tramp attacked niece on high road 'yes miss whichello know that ' havery good a considered that man be dangerous character thought that must be compelled to leave beorminster so went to derby winner on night that met in order to 'to see mr mosk interrupted cargrim softly hoping to entrap 'in order to see mr mosk in order to see jentham intended to tell that if did not leave beorminster at once must inform police of attack on miss arden also a be willing to give chance of reforming conduct intended to supply with small sum for immediate departure on night however did not see a have gone over to gipsy camp when heard that be dead must scarcely believe so to set mind at rest to satisfy that mab must be in further danger from insolence when walked abroad visited dead house saw body that mr cargrim be sole reason for visit a concerned alone wore veil so a not to provoke remark seems that be wrong since mr pansey have be discussing however hope will set mind at rest by telling what have told ' beally dear miss whichello be very severe assure explanation be needle ' while mr pansey have so venomous tongue mr cargrim be quite capable of twisting innocent desire to assure that mab be safe from man into extraordinary statement without word of truth in must be surprised if mr pansey have hinted to that have killed creature a be precisely what archdeacon widow have done cargrim felt horribly uncomfortable under scorn of miss whichello justifiable indignation grew red smiled feebly murmured weak apology of miss whichello saw heard with supreme contempt mr cargrim by late tittle tattling conversation have fallen in good opinion be not going to let off without sharp rebuke for unfounded chatter cutting short murmur proceeded to nip in bud further report mr pansey might spread in connection with murder by explaining much more than be needful 'and if mr pansey must hear that captain pendle be on southberry heath on sunday night continued ' trust that will not accuse of shooting man although a know know also mr cargrim be quite capable of doing so ' 'be captain pendle on southberry heath asked cargrim who be already acquainted with fact although did not think necessary to tell miss whichello so 'you say so ' 'yes be rode over to gipsy camp to purchase engagement ring for miss arden from mother jael that ring be now on finger ' miss arden be engaged to captain pendle cried cargrim in gushing manner congratulate ' 'thank mr cargrim '

hear with noise of storm might a well ask if bishop did be on southberry heath on night ' 'oh yes heard nothing dear lady told so ' seem to be very interested in murder mr cargrim ' said little lady

covered with silver dross fancy there be mr panseys in day mr cargrim ' in face of choice proverb mr cargrim beat hasty retreat altogether miss whichello be too much for for once in life be at loss how to gloss over defeat not until be in tinkler office did recover feeling of superiority with man especially with social inferior felt that must deal who can contend with woman tongue be sword shield mouth be bow word be arrow man who hope to withstand armoury of deadly weapon be superfine idiot cargrim not being one have run away in rage at being compelled to take flight almost exceeded mr pansey in hating cause of miss whichello have certainly gained victory have also made enemy beo inquest be over mr inspector ' said ruffled cargrim smoothing plume done with sir corpse be now six foot under earth ' ' sad end mr inspector sad life to be wanderer on face of earth to be violently removed when sinning to be buried at expense of alien parish what fate for baptised christian take on so mr cargrim sir ' said tinkler grimly 'there be precious little religion about jentham be buried in much better fashion than deserved not by parish cargrim looked up suddenly 'who paid for funeral then ' charitable la person sir whose name be not at liberty to tell anyone at own request own request ' said chaplain noting tinkler slip putting two two together with wondrous rapidity miss whichello be indeed good lady do know be aware that miss whichello buried sir ' stammered inspector considerably astonished ' have just come from house ' replied cargrim answering question in affirmative by implication 'well asked not to tell anyone sir a told s'pose can say a buried that corpse with good deal of expense 'it be not to be wondered at seeing that took interest in wretched creature ' said cargrim delicately feeling way ' trust that sight of body in dead house did shock nerve 'did tell visited dead house asked tinkler eye growing larger at extent of chaplain information 'of course did ' replied cargrim be truer than most of remark tinkler brought down heavy fist with bang on desk be blest mr cargrim sir if can understand what meant by asking to hold tongue ' mr inspector good lady be one of rare spirit who do good by stealth blush to find fame ' beeems kind of silly to go on like sir ' 'we be not rare spirit tinkler ' know what world must be if be mr cargrim sir miss whichello seemed so anxious must hold tongue about visit burial ca make out why talked about to to anybody ' ' can not myself fathom reason for such unnecessary secrecy mr inspector unless be that wish murderer to be discovered ca spot ' said tinkler emphatically know about jentham be thirty year old cargrim must scarcely suppress start at unexpected information so miss whichello did know something about dead man after doubtless connection with jentham have to do with secret of bishop cargrim felt that be on eve of important discovery for tinkler thinking miss whichello have made confidant of chaplain babbled on innocently without guessing that attentive listener be making base use of shrug of shoulder with cargrim commented on last remark made tinkler talk further 'besides said expansively 'what doe miss whichello know only that man be violinist thirty year ago that called amaru detail throw light on murder mr cargrim sir ' chaplain mentally noted former name former profession of jentham shook head information be utterly useless said gravely 'and people with whom amaru alias jentham associated then be doubtless dead by time ' miss whichello did mention of friend sir daresay must be much use if did beyond man former name business a fiddler told nothing suppose sir did tell anything likely to help ' 'no think past can help present mr tinkler what be candid opinion about case ' '

farthing have money on when corpse be found ' 'yet body have be robbed 'oh yes body be robbed sure enough for found pocket turned inside out murderer only took rubbish vagabond be likely to have on ' 'be paper taken do think mr inspector 'papers echoed tinkler scratching head 'what paper 'well said cargrim shirking true explanation 'papers likely to reveal real name reason of haunting beorminster ' think there must have be paper mr cargrim sir if there have be 'd have found 'em murderer must have taken rubbish like ' 'but why be man killed persisted chaplain be killed in row said tinkler decisively 'that be theory mother jael say that be half sea over when left camp so daresay met labourer who quarrelled with used pistol 'but be likely that labourer must have pistol ' 'why not harvester trust one be just a likely a not that one of must keep pistol to protect property from other search made for pistol 'yes be pistol be found tell what mr cargrim ' said tinkler rising in rigid military fashion opinion that there be too much tall talk about case jentham be shot in drunken row murderer have cleared out of district be whole explanation of matter daresay be right mr inspector sighed cargrim putting on hat 'we be apt to elevate commonplace into romantic 'or make mountain out of mole hill be plain english said tinkler 'good day mr cargrim day tinkler many thanks for lucid statement of case have doubt that lordship bishop will take very sensible view of matter a be now late mr cargrim returned to palace not ill pleased with afternoon work have learned that

pityingly of wretched victim that be interested in hearing result of inquest in case be guarded in remark at first on hearing of crime face have betrayed at event to cargrim jealous scrutiny expression of relief shortly afterwards on second thought a one might say there came into eye look of apprehension that look seemed to expect drawing near of evil day never left again daily face grew thinner whiter manner more restless ill at ease seemed a uncomfortable a be damocles under hair suspended sword other people besides chaplain noticed change unlike cargrim did not ascribe to consciousness of guilt to ill health mr pendle who be extremely fond of husband be well informed with regard to newest treatment latest fashionable medicine insisted that bishop suffered from nerve brought on by overwork plaintively suggested that must take cure for at german bad bishop sturdy old briton that be insisted that so long a must keep on foot there be necessity for woman folk to make

pendle with contempt 'he be old fashioned quite ignorant of new medicine bishop must go to droitwich 'and dear to nauheim ' at point matter came to issue between for mr pendle who like most people possessed fund of what may be called nervous obstinacy positively refused to leave england on side bishop insisted more eagerly than be custom that mr pendle must undergo schott treatment at nauheim for time argument be maintained with equal determination on side until mr pendle concluded by bursting into tear protesting that husband did not understand in least whereupon a only way to soothe bishop admitted that be in wrong apologised same be determined that wife must go abroad thinking might yield to professional persuasion sent for dr graham by cargrim message be brought that doctor must be with bishop next morning so pendle not to provoke further argument said nothing more on subject to wife here lucy came on scene seemed equally a averse a mother to continental travel

'poor harry added a afterthought need be poor harry about matter said dr pendle rather sharply 'if be what be troubling daresay harry will be glad to escort mother over to germany lucy became rosy red with pleasure 'do really think harry will like to come ' asked in fluttering voice 'he be true lover if doe ' replied father with wan smile run away love be busy to morrow will settle question of going ' when to morrow came cargrim on fire with curiosity tried hardest to stay in library when dr graham came a bishop wished interview to be private intimated fact pretty plainly to obsequious chaplain in fact spoke so sharply that cargrim felt distinctly aggrieved for trained control kept of temper might have said something to show dr pendle suspicion entertained however time be not yet ripe for to place card on table for have not yet conceived plausible case against bishop be on point of pronouncing name 'amaru to see if must startle dr pendle remembering former failure when have introduced name of 'jentham to bishop notice be wise enough to hold tongue must not do to arouse dr pendle suspicion until must accuse plainly of murdering man must produce evidence to substantiate

seems to be gist of christianity what deuce be good of laying too weighty burden on back when have got to strengthen to bear well bishop ' added aloud ' have right to ask for glimpse of skeleton can help in way ' 'yes cried bishop eagerly sent for to request aid can help graham very materially `` m willing to do so what will do beend wife daughter over to nauheim on pretext mr pendle requires

'but have have word with wife ' 'no god forbid graham be a good tender a always be a dear to a ever be wish to go away for time desire lucy to accompany yesterday suggested that must take trip to

rising 'if must tell trouble must can not dare not if help must do so with implicit confidence in knowing that be acting for best bishop place rather in cleft stick ' said doctor looking at agitated

to leave england for time can induce to take journey 'well said graham calmly ' will do so 'thank graham be good of to accede to request ' must do for everyone ' said graham sharply 'and although like

emphatically good lord will do very best to persuade mr pendle daughter to undertake journey 'of course ' said pendle anxiously wo tell have told wish to explain too minutely to ' ' be not quite so

pendle be working too hard that constitution be breaking up that sadly needed rest opinion on last point be unanimous 'for will say remarked mr pansey who be adept at damning with faint praise 'that

thing be clear that mother jael have gone off with considerable amount of loose silver in pocket servant knew nothing of departure so there be doubt that old crone used to dodging hiding have slipped out of garden by back way while guest have be commiserating bishop slight illness a cargrim wanted to see gipsy at once hoped to force into confessing truth by threatening to have arrested with stolen money in pocket followed on trail while be yet fresh certainly mother jael have left particular track by must be traced cargrim knowing something of habit judged that must either strike across southberry heath to tent of tribe take refuge for time being at derby winner be more probable that must go to hotel than run risk of being arrested in gipsy camp so cargrim adopting argument took way down to eastgate hoped to run mother jael to earth in tap room of hotel on arriving at derby winner walked straight into bar found presided over by grinning pot boy noise of singing shouting came from little parlour at back when chaplain asked for mr mosk be informed by smiling ganymede that 'th guv'nor be injiyin ' of hisself goin ' on like one o'clock ' 'dear dear ' said scandalised chaplain 'be

said cargrim gravely 'this will be surprise to bishop feeling unequal to situation made escape father ' said bell 'this be pretty kettle of fish be chapter xxiii in library certainly there be little enough to admire in mr cargrim character still be not altogether bad man in common with fellow creature also have good quality be somewhat rusty for want of use a mr rawdon crawley nee sharp remarked most people can be good on five thousand year if cargrim have be high placed wealthy must no doubt have developed better instinct for lack of reason to make use of worser being only poor curate have long ladder to climb thought must be ascended more rapidly by kicking down who impeded progress by holding on to skirt of who be few rung higher therefore be not very nice in distinction between good evil did not mind by what mean succeeded so long a be successful knew very well that be not favourite with bishop that dr pendle must not give more of levitical loaf fish than must help a holder of

to learn bishop secret set under thumb with will in world schemer be not clever enough to deal with evidence have accumulated bishop have have understanding with jentham have attempted to secure silence a be proved by torn out butt of cheque book have a cargrim suspected killed blackmailer to bury secret in grave have be warned by mother jael that knew of wicked act be evidence cargrim did not know how to place ship shape in order to prove to bishop pendle that have in power needed trained mind to grapple with confused fact to follow out clue to arrange detail cargrim recognised that be needful to hire helper with idea resolved to visit london there engage service of private inquiry agent a there be time to be lost decided to ask bishop for leave of absence on very night there be nothing so excellent a prompt attention to business even when consists of dirtiest kind nevertheless to allow better nature small opportunity of exercise cargrim determined to afford bishop one chance of escape visit to derby winner have given at once weapon piece of information rector of heathcroft be dying so in nature of thing be probable that living must soon be vacant from various hint cargrim be aware that bishop destined snug post for younger son gabriel pendle be engaged to marry bell mosk when bishop be informed of fact cargrim have little doubt that must refuse to consecrate son to living then failing gabriel chaplain hoped that dr pendle might give to if did so mr cargrim be quite willing to let bygone be bygone must not search out bishop secret at event for present although if dean alder died might make later use of knowledge to get elected to vacant post however immediate business in hand be to secure heathcroft rectory at expense of gabriel so mr cargrim walked rapidly to palace with intention of informing bishop without delay of young man disgraceful conduct only at conclusion of interview must determine future course if angered at gabriel bishop gave living must let bishop settle account with conscience if dr pendle refused must then go up to london hire bloodhound to follow trail of dr pendle crime even to very doorstep in thus giving patron alternative cargrim thought very virtuous person indeed yet so far a knew might be compounding felony that knowledge did not trouble in least with pretty little scheme in head chaplain entered library in dr pendle be usually to be found sure enough bishop be there sitting alone looking a wretched a man must face be grey drawn have aged so markedly since mr pendle garden party mr cargrim be quite shocked started nervously when chaplain glided into room nerve storm consequent on interview with mother jael have exhausted bishop vitality seemed hardly able to lift head utter prostration of man must have appealed to anyone save cargrim that astute young parson have end to gain be not to be turned from by display of mental misery put victim on rack tortured a delicately scientifically a inquisition of good old day when mother church anticipating saying of french revolution said to backslider of flock child lest kill thee ' so cargrim like modern torquemada racked soul instead of body devoted very earnestly to congenial talk beg pardon lord ' said making feint of retiring ' did not know that lordship be engaged ' ' be not engaged ' replied bishop seemingly glad to escape from own sad thought 'come in come in have left mr pansey fete rather early ' 'but not so early a sir ' said chaplain taking chair where must command uninterrupted view of bishop face ' fear be not well lord ' cargrim be not well in spite of desire to continue duty be afraid that will be forced to take holiday for health sake ' 'your lordship can not do better than join mr pendle at nauheim ' ' be thinking of doing so ' said bishop glancing at letter at elbow 'especially a sir harry brace be coming back on business to beorminster wish wife to be alone in present uncertain state of health a to own be afraid spring will

restrained by knowledge of incapacity to follow up question be wise enough not to put also a wished to come to understanding with bishop on subject of heathcroft living turned conversation in direction by remarking that mr leigh be reported a dying beo gabriel informed ' said dr pendle with nod be truly sorry to hear mr leigh have be rector of heathcroft parish for many year 'for twenty five year lordship latterly have be rather lax in rule what be needed in heathcroft be young earnest man with capacity for organisation one who by word deed may be able to move sluggish soul of parishioner who can contrive direct guide ' describe ideal rector cargrim ' remarked dr pendle rather dryly ' kind of bishop in embryo where be such paragon to be found ' chaplain coloured looked conscious ' describe a paragon ' said in low voice 'nevertheless must lordship think fit to present with heathcroft cure of soul must strive to approach in degree ideal have described ' bishop be stranger to cargrim ambition a be not first time that chaplain have hinted that must make good rector of heathcroft therefore did not feel surprised at being approached so crudely on subject with testy gesture pushed back chair looked rather frowningly on presumptuous parson cargrim be too sure of ability to deal with bishop to be daunted by look with sleek head on one side suave smile on pale lip waited for thunder from episcopalian throne however bishop be just a diplomatic a chaplain too wise to give way to temper felt at so downright request approached matter in outwardly mild spirit 'heathcroft be large parish ' said lordship meditatively 'and therefore need hard working young rector replied cargrim be of course aware of own deficiency may be remedied by prayer by humble spirit cargrim ' said bishop with smile remember rather heterodox story of farmer comment on prayer being offered up for rain what be use of praying for rain said when wind be in quarter be inclined ' added dr pendle looking very intently at cargrim agree with farmer 'does that mean that lordship will not give living 'we will come to later mr cargrim at present mean that prayer will remedy deficiency unless desire to do so begin in own breast 'will lordship indicate particular deficiency must remedy ' asked chaplain outwardly calm inwardly raging ' think mr cargrim ' said bishop gently 'that ambition be apt to take precedence of religious feeling else must hardly adopt so extreme course a to ask so bluntly for living if deemed advisable that must be rector of heathcroft must bestow on without necessity of asking to give to to be plain with mr cargrim have other design when living becomes vacant ' that case need say more lordship ' must permit to say much said dr pendle in most stately manner 'that desire to continue in present position until have more experience in diocesan work be not young man mr cargrim who have so excellent opportunity of acquainting with internal management of catholic church father be dear friend of mine ' continued bishop with emotion 'and in younger day owed much for sake for own wish to help a much a can must permit to be best judge of when how to advance interest ambition of yours michael have observed on several occasion be dangerous to better quality clergyman of church be man being priest something more than man therefore behoves to be humble religious intent upon immediate work for glory of god must rise must be by such quality that attains higher post in church must remain day in humble position can die content knowing have thought not of of god believe dear young friend speak from experience be better for to leave future in hand sentiment being antithesis to of cargrim be of course extremely unpalatable to one of nature knew that be more ambitious than religious be galling to think that dr pendle must have be clever enough to gauge character so truly mask of humility deference have be torn off be better known to bishop than be at agreeable to cunning nature saw that so far a heathcroft living be concerned must never obtain a free gift from dr pendle therefore only remained to adopt worser course force prelate to accede to request having thus decided mr cargrim with great self control smoothed face to meek smile even displayed little emotion in order to show bishop how touched be by kindly speech have crushed ambition be quite content to leave future in hand said with possible suavity indeed lord know that be best only friend deficiency to allude will be conquered by if possible trust shortly will merit lordship more unreserved approbation 'why said bishop shaking heartily by hand 'that be very worthy speech michael will bear in mind be still friend trust in spite of what consider be duty to say ' 'certainly be friend sir be honoured by interest take in now lord ' added cargrim with sweet smile beay prefer little request be in mind when came to see ' 'of course of course michael what be ' ' have business to transact in london lord must like with permission to be absent from duty for few day 'with pleasure ' assented bishop when like cargrim be only too pleased that must ask for holiday beany thanks lordship ' said cargrim rising 'then will leave palace to morrow morning will return towards end of week a there be nothing of particular importance to attend to trust lordship will be able to dispense with service during few day absence without trouble to ' beet mind at rest cargrim can take holiday ' again thank lordship only remains for to say that if a have heard lordship intends to make mr gabriel rector of heathcroft trust will be a earnest devout there a have be in beorminster ' ' have not yet decided how to fill up vacancy said bishop coldly 'and let remind mr cargrim that a yet present rector of heathcroft still hold living ' ' do anticipate inevitable lord ' said cargrim preparing to drive sting into bishop certainly sooner mr gabriel be advanced to living better will be for matrimonial prospect dr pendle stared understand ' said stiffly 'what ' mr cargrim threw up hand in astonishment 'have not mr gabriel informed lordship of engagement 'engagement ' echoed bishop half rising mean to tell that gabriel be engaged without knowledge ' lordship thought knew most indiscreet of ' murmured cargrim in pretended confusion whom be son engaged ' asked bishop sharply 'to to really feel most embarrassed ' said chaplain must not have taken 'answer at once sir ' cried dr pendle irritably whom be son gabriel engaged insist upon knowing ' that case must tell lordship that mr gabriel be engaged to marry miss bell mosk ' bishop bounded out of chair mosk daughter of landlord of derby winner 'yes lordship ' barmaid son oh be be impossible ' have from lip of young lady ' said cargrim delighted at bishop annoyance 'certainly miss mosk be hardly fitted to be wife of future rector still be handsome betop sir ' cried bishop imperiously dare to couple son name with of of of barmaid can not will not dare not believe ' 'nevertheless be true ' 'impossible incredible boy must be mad 'he be in love be much same thing ' said cargrim with more boldness than usually displayed before dr pendle 'but to assure of truth let suggest that lordship must question mr gabriel believe be in palace mr cargrim ' said bishop recovering from first surprise thank for information be afraid have be misled son must never choose wife out of bar 'it be to be hoped will see folly of doing so lord ' replied chaplain backing towards door now will take leave assuring lordship must never have spoken of mr gabriel engagement have not believed that be informed on point ' bishop made reply sank into chair looking picture of misery after glance at cargrim left room rubbing hand think have given very good roland for oliver lord ' murmured chapter xxiv bishop asserts on being left alone bishop sat motionless in chair for considerable time information conveyed by cargrim struck at pride in heart knew well that have a little right to be proud a to resent blow casting look over past saw that dr graham have be right in reference to ring of polycrates for although be outwardly still prosperous high placed shame have come upon evil be about to befall from moment of jentham secret visit blight have fallen on fortune curse have come upon house in thousand hidden way have be tortured although for fault of own there be secret did not dare even to think of there be enforced absence of wife daughter whom have be compelled to send away there be hidden enmity of cargrim did not know how to baffle now there be shame of gabriel engagement to barmaid of george choice of wife who if rumour must be believed be daughter of scoundrel with ill heaped upon head bishop did not know how must ever raise again still woe be locked up in own breast to world be yet popular prosperous bishop of beorminster impression position be resolved to maintain at cost therefore to put end to last trouble concluded to speak seriously to son on subject of unequal marriage pressure of electric button summoned servant who be instructed to request captain pendle mr gabriel to see father at once in library must seem a though almost expected message for in few minute be in room george with usual jaunty confident air gabriel with anxious look yet of young men guessed why bishop have sent for least of george who never dreamed for moment that father must oppose engagement with mab arden down of ' said dr pendle in grave tone have something serious to say ' bishop took up imposing position on hearthrug two son looked at one 'there be bad news from nauheim hope sir ' said george quite ignorant of meaning of exordium 'no lucy last letter about mother be very cheerful indeed wish to speak seriously to of a be elder george will begin with gabriel will reason with later beason with ' wondered curate be doing anything requires to be

whichello on subject in day have interest for now that find son desire to marry girl must refuse consent until learn about birth parentage ' beiss whichello will tell about ' said george hopefully trust miss whichello dare tell ' 'dare sir ' cried captain pendle gnawing moustache ' used word advisedly george if what mr pansey asserts be true miss whichello will feel natural reluctance to confess truth about miss arden father ' 'admitting a much urged gabriel seeing that george kept silent beurely will not visit sin of father on innocent child 'it be scriptural law son 'it be not law

'by mean see miss arden miss whichello if like tell that be by desire go away 'well sir ' said captain pendle slowly be willing to obey return to work refuse to give up mab ' not trusting to speak further lest must lose temper altogether abruptly left room bishop saw retire with sigh shook head immediately afterwards addressed to gabriel who with apprehension be waiting for to speak 'gabriel said dr pendle picking up letter 'harry have written to from nauheim saying that be compelled to return home on business a wish mother lucy to be alone be desire that must join at once ' curate be rather amazed at peremptory tone of speech hastened to assure father that be quite willing to go reason given for journey seemed to sufficient one have suspicion that father real motive be to separate

cutting tone 'unfortunately candour be not equal to capability for deception so be obliged to learn truth from stranger 'cargrim cried gabriel instinct telling name of betrayer from mr cargrim heard truth from lip of girl informed that be engaged to marry son 'it be true ' said gabriel in low voice ' wish to make wife ' beake wife ' cried dr pendle angrily common girl barmaid ' will not listen to

brilliantly there might not glitter so much when translated to higher sphere placed beside more polished gem therefore must find answer to father speech wisely kept silence 'certainly son be comfort

head have vanished sir harry must need betake to dr graham for easing of mind doctor have known young man since be little lad on more than one occasion have given practical kind of advice result from experience therefore when harry be perplexed over matter too deep for a be now invariably sought counsel of old friend in present instance for own sake for sake of lucy lucy father told graham whole story of bishop pendle presumed guilt of baltic mission to disprove of cargrim underhanded doings graham listened to detail in silence contented with grim smile two when cargrim treachery be touched

sudden return curiosity must have be gratified have be present in dr graham consulting room hour later for after gabriel have bathed brushed up at lodging paid immediate visit to little doctor graham happened to be at home a have not yet set out on round of professional visit be a much astonished a mr pansey when curate made appearance also like mr pansey be struck by young man worn look 'what gabriel ' cried when curate entered 'this be unexpected pleasure look ill lad be ill replied gabriel dropping into chair with air of fatigue ' feel very much worried have come to ask for advice ' havery pleased to give to boy why not consult bishop father be last man in world must consult doctor ' be strange speech gabriel ' said graham with keen look 'it be prelude to stranger story have come to confide in because have known life doctor because be most intimate friend father have 'have be getting into trouble ' story concern father more than doe ' 'concerns father ' repeated doctor with sudden recollection of bishop secret 'be sure that be proper person to consult ' be certain of know know well what do know be something have not courage to speak to father about for god sake doctor let tell suspicion hear advice ' 'your suspicion said graham starting from chair with chill in blood 'about about murder ' forbid doctor not about murder about man who be murdered ' 'yes about man who called jentham be sure be quite private here doctor ' graham nodded walking to door turned key then came back to seat fixed eye on perturbed face of young man 'does father know that be back asked one know that be here save mr pansey ' 'then wo be secret long ' said graham drily 'that old magpie be a good a town crier left mother well 'quite well lucy also made excuse to come back mother sister know what be about to tell ' gabriel made gesture of horror forbid ' said again then clasped hand over white face burst into half hysterical speech 'oh horror of horror of ' wailed 'if what know be true then life be ruined ' so very terrible boy ' terrible dare not question father must tell for only can advise help doctor doctor very thought drive mad indeed feel half mad already 'you be worn out gabriel wait one moment ' doctor saw that visitor nerve be overstrained that unless tension be relaxed must probably end in having fit of hysteria poor young fellow born of weakly mother be neurotic in extreme have in feminine strain made unequal to facing trouble anxiety even a sat there shaking white faced nerve storm came on racked knotted tortured fibre of being until burst of tear came to relief almost in swoon lay back limply in chair graham mixed strong dose of valerian felt pulse made lie down on sofa also darkened room placed wet handkerchief on curate forehead gabriel closed eye lay on couch a still a corpse while doctor who knew what suffered watched with infinite pity lad ' murmured holding gabriel hand in firm warm clasp 'nature be indeed harsh stepmother to with nerve pin prickle of life be so many dagger thrust do feel better now ' asked a gabriel opened eye with languid sigh better more composed ' replied wan curate sitting up 'you have given magical drug 'you may well call that particular preparation of valerian be nepenthe for nerve be not quite recovered yet swell remains after storm know why not postpone story ' ' can not dare not said gabriel earnestly must ease mind by telling to doctor do know that visitor who made father ill on night of reception be jentham ' boy did not know that who told ' 'john old servant who admitted told about jentham just before went to nauheim ' 'did jentham give name ' 'no john like many other people saw body in dead house there recognised jentham by gipsy look scar on face well doctor wondered what man must have said to so upset bishop of course did not dare to ask by time got to germany episode passed out of mind ' what recalled ' beomething mother said be in kurgarten listening to band when hiedelberg student with face seamed slashed walked past ' ' know student in germany be proud of duelling scar well gabriel what then ' curate quivered over instead of replying directly asked what seemed to be irrelevant question know that mother be widow when father married ' demanded in low tone course did replied graham cheerily ' be practising in marylebone then father be vicar of st benedict why be at wedding gabriel very pretty mother looked be mr krant whose husband have be killed while serving a volunteer in franco prussian war 'did ever see husband ' did not come to marylebone until have left rascal deserted poor young thing went abroad to fight why do ask question can not be painful ' 'because sight of student face recalled first husband to mother said that krant have long scar on right cheek immediately thought of jentham 'good god ' cried graham pushing back chair 'what do mean lad wait ' said gabriel feverishly asked mother to describe feature of first husband not suspecting reason for asking did so krant said be tall lean swart black eyed with scar on right cheek running from ear to mouth doctor cried gabriel clutching graham hand 'that be very portrait of man jentham ' whispered little doctor hoarsely mean to say ' ' mean to say that krant did not die that jentham be krant when called on father appeared a one from dead be dead now be alive when mother became father wife ' 'impossible impossible repeated graham who be ashy pale shaken out of ordinary self died died at sedan father went over saw grave ' 'he did not see corpse though tell be right doctor krant did not die mother be not father wife george lucy be in eye of law nobody child curate uttered last word almost in shriek fell back on couch covering face with two trembling hand graham sat staring straight before with expression of absolute horror on withered brown face recalled pendle sudden illness after jentham have paid that fatal visit refusal to confess real cause of attack admission that have secret did not dare to reveal even to oldest friend strange act in sending away wife daughter to nauheim thing gave colour to gabriel supposition that jentham be krant returned from dead after be supposition merely quite unsupported by fact 'there be proof of ' said graham hoarsely 'no proof ' father for proof murmured gabriel dare not ' doctor must understand that speech very well now saw reason why gabriel have chosen to speak to rather than to bishop might be true after frightful fact thought a in flash saw ruin disaster shame terror following in train of becoming known then be bishop secret graham in quick way decided that at cost must be preserved if only for sake of mr pendle child first step towards attaining end be to see bishop hear confirmation denial from own lip once graham knew fact fancied that might in way at present knew not how help wretched friend with characteristic promptitude decided on spot how to act 'gabriel said bending over unhappy young man will see father about at once can not dare not believe to be true unless with own lip confirms identity of krant with jentham wait here until return sleep if can ' beleep groaned gabriel god will ever sleep again bey friend ' said little doctor solemnly have right to doubt father honour until hear what have to say jentham may not be krant a suspect may be chance likeness gabriel shook head ca argue away what know to be true muttered looking at floor with dry wild eye father tell have told will not be able to deny shame disgrace of child 'that will see ' said graham with cheerfulness be far from feeling ' will see at once gabriel boy hope for best again curate shook head with groan flung down on couch with face to wall seeing that word be vain doctor threw one glance of pity on prostrate form with sigh passed out of room chapter xxix confession of bishop pendle mr cargrim be very much out of temper baltic be cause of unchristian state of mind a employer of so called missionary actual inquiry agent chaplain expected to be informed of fresh discovery with view baltic did not concur in solemn way informed cargrim that preferred keeping information method suspicion to until be sure of capturing actual criminal when man be lodged in beorminster jail when complicity in crime be proved beyond doubt then baltic promised to write out for edification of employer detailed account of step taken to bring about so satisfactory result from stern determination cargrim argument failed to move state of thing be more vexatious a cargrim knew that ex sailor have seen mother jael shrewdly suspected that have obtained from beldam valuable information likely to incriminate bishop whether newly found evidence did so not baltic gravely declined to say cargrim be furious at being left in ignorance be particularly anxious that dr pendle guilt must be proved without loss of time a mr leigh of heathcroft be sinking rapidly on day new rector might be needed for very desirable parish certainly cargrim a fondly imagined have thwarted gabriel candidature by revealing young man love for bell mosk to bishop still even if gabriel be not nominated dr pendle have plainly informed cargrim that need not expect appointment so chaplain foresaw that unless obtained power over bishop before leigh death benefice must be given to stranger be wonder then that resented silence of baltic felt enraged at own impotence almost regretted having sought assistance of man who appeared more likely to be hindrance than help for once cargrim scheming brain must devise remedy lurking about library a usual mr cargrim be much astonished to receive visit from dr graham of course visit be to bishop cargrim being alone in library came forward in silky obsequious way to receive new comer politely asked what must do for 'you can inform bishop wish to see if please ' said graham with perfectly expressionless face lordship be at present taking short rest replied cargrim blandly 'but anything can do 'you can hing mr cargrim wish for private interview with dr pendle 'your business must be important 'it be retorted graham abruptly beo important must see bishop at once certainly doctor be sorry to see that look well ' be a well a can be expected beally considering what dr graham ' 'considering way be kept waiting here mr cargrim ' after pointed speech there be nothing left for defeated chaplain to retreat a gracefully a must yet cargrim might have known from past experience that duel of word with sharp tongued dr graham must only end in discomfiture in spite of cunning usually burnt finger at twice touched flame extremely curious to know reason of graham unexpected visit haggard look cargrim having informed bishop that doctor be waiting for attempted to make third in interview by gliding in behind superior graham however be too sharp for after few word with bishop intimated to chaplain that presence be not necessary so cargrim like peri at gate of paradise be forced to lurk a near library door a dared strained ear in vain to overhear what pair be talking about have known that revelation of bishop pendle secret formed gist of interview must have be even more enraged than be for time being fate be against wily chaplain in end be compelled to betake to solitary sulky walk during reflection concerning graham baltic be reverse of amiable a defeated sneak mr cargrim be not credit to cloth dr pendle have bewildered air of man suddenly roused from sleep be inclined to be peevish with graham for calling at so untoward time yet be five o'clock in afternoon be scarcely suitable hour for slumber a doctor bluntly remarked ' be not asleep ' said bishop settling at writing table ' simply lay down for hour so ' 'worn out with worry suppose ' 'yes dr pendle sighed burden be almost greater than can bear ' quite agree with ' replied graham have come to help to bear ' 'that be impossible to do so must know truth god help dare not tell even to ' 'there be need for to do so pendle know secret ' bishop twisted chair round with rapid movement stared at sympathetic face of graham with expression of blended terror amazement hardly must tongue frame to speech 'you know secret ' stuttered pendle with pale lip know that krant did not die at sedan a supposed know that returned to life to beorminster to under name of jentham hold up man give way ' for bishop with heavy sigh have fallen forward on desk with grey head buried in arm lay there silent broken down in agony of doubt fear shame 'play man george pendle ' said graham who knew that father be more virile than son therefore needed tonic of word rather than soothing anodyne of medicine 'if believe in what preach if be true servant of god call upon religion upon deity for help to bear trouble stand up manfully friend face worst 'alas ala many water have gone over graham ' 'can expect anything else if permit to sink without effort ' said doctor rather cynically 'but if can not gain strength from christianity then be stoic independent of supernatural aid ' bishop lifted head suddenly rose to full height until towered above little doctor pale face took upon calmer expression stretching out arm rolled forth text from psalm in deepest voice in most stately manner god be salvation glory rock of strength refuge be in god ' said graham with satisfied nod 'that be proper spirit in to meet trouble now pendle with leave will approach subject with more particularity ' 'it will be a well ' replied bishop spoke collectedly gravely with trace of late excitement when most needed strength have come to from above be able to discus sore matter of domestic trouble with courage with judgment 'how did learn secret graham asked after pause 'indirectly from gabriel ' 'gabriel said bishop trembling 'be at nauheim ' 'you be mistaken pendle returned to beorminster morning a be afraid to speak to on subject of jentham came to ask advice poor lad be broken down ill be now lying in consulting room until return 'how did gabriel learn truth asked pendle with look of pain 'from something mother said ' bishop in spite of enforced calmness groaned aloud 'does know of ' murmured while drop of perspiration beaded forehead betrayed inward agony 'must not that shame be spared ' ' be hasty pendle wife know nothing ' god ' said bishop fervently then added almost immediately 'you say wife ala ala that dare not call so ' be true then asked graham becoming very pale 'perfectly true krant be not killed krant returned here under name of jentham wife be not wife child be illegitimate have name outcast be oh shame oh disgrace dr pendle groaned aloud graham sympathised with man distress be surely natural under terrible calamity have befallen george pendle be priest prelate be also son of adam liable like mortal strongest a weakest to moment of doubt of fear of trembling of utter dismay have evil come upon alone might have borne with more patience when parted from dearly loved wife when made outcast of child be so proud of who can wonder that must feel inclined to cry with job 'be good unto thee thou shouldbet oppress ' nevertheless like job bishop held fast integrity yet that might have comfort in affliction that one pang might be spared to graham assured that mr pendle be ignorant of truth related in full story of how gabriel have come to connect jentham with krant pendle listened in silence inwardly thanked god that at least so much mercy have be vouchsafed then in turn made confidant of old friend recalled early day of courtship marriage spoke of long interval of peace quiet happiness wife have enjoyed ended with detailed account of disguised krant visit threat anguish re appearance have caused 'you remember graham ' said with wonderful self control 'how almost thirty year ago be vicar of st benedict in marylebone how old college friend practised medicine in same parish remember pendle there be need for to make heart ache by recalling past must friend

letter at request of dying comrade ask graham who must have disbelieved evidence of letter tombstone ' one certainly replied graham gravely 'but be pity that must not find leon durand so a to put matter beyond doubt 'find ' echoed bishop passionately 'no one on earth must have found man did not exist ' 'then who wrote letter 'krant a told in very room wicked plotter ' handwriting must not wife

comfort must administer so very wisely held peace however when bishop growing more composed remained still silent must not forbear offering trifle of consolation grieve so pendle said laying hand on other shoulder 'it be not fault that be in position ' bishop sighed murmured with shake of head qui facit peccatum servus est peccati ' have not done sin ' cried graham dissenting from text wife

be not heard of for seven year can marry again after period without being liable to prosecution a bigamist in case second ceremony be not legal ' krant became wife before expiration of seven year know

tried ' graham reflected 'be perfectly certain that jentham krant be one same man asked doubtfully be certain of ' replied pendle decisively must not be deceived in dark gipsy face in peculiar cicatrice on right cheek knew about wife graham about family maiden name amount of fortune taking up parish work in marylebone above showed certificate of marriage number of letter written to by amy reproaching with cruel desertion oh there can be doubt that jentham be rather be stephen krant 'it must seem so sighed graham heavily 'evidently there be hope of proving to be impostor in face of such evidence ' 'he came to extort money suppose ' 'need ask ' said bishop bitterly 'yes sole object be blackmail be content to let thing remain a be provided silence be purchased at own price told that if paid two hundred pound must hand over certificate letter disappear never to trouble again ' doubt if blackguard must keep word pendle moreover although novelist dramatist attach value to marriage certificate be really not worth paper be written on save perhaps a immediate evidence register of church in ceremony took place be important document that can neither be handed over destroyed krant be giving withered leaf for good gold pendle still need must when sir urian drive so suppose agreed to bribe ' bishop grey head drooped on breast eye sought carpet looked like man overwhelmed with shame 'yes replied in low tone of pain ' have not courage to face consequence indeed what else must do must not have man denounce marriage a false one force into presence of delicate wife tell child that be nameless shock must have killed amy must have broken child heart must have shamed in high position before eye of england be innocent be innocent yes fact remained a remains now be not married to amy that child be not entitled to bear name ask graham ask what else must do than pay money in face of such shame disgrace ' 'there be need to excuse to pendle blame in least 'but blame in part ' replied bishop sadly 'as honest man knew that marriage be illegal a priest be bound to put away woman who be not who be not wife think of shame to of disgrace to innocent child must not do graham must not do satan came to in guise yielded to tempting without struggle agreed to buy jentham silence at own price a did not wish to come here again lest amy must see made appointment to meet on southberry heath on sunday night there pay two hundred pound blackmail ' speak with on spot where corpse be afterwards found ' asked graham in low voice not daring to look at friend ' answered bishop simply not suspecting that doctor hinted at murder met at cross road 'you have money with suppose ' have money in note of ten a be unwilling to draw so large sum from beorminster bank lest doing so must provoke comment made special journey to london obtained money there ' think be over careful bishop tell be overcome with fear not so much for a for dear to know how most secret thing become known in city dreaded lest action must become public property must be connected in way with jentham why even tore butt of cheque drew out of book lest record must remain likely to excite suspicion took most elaborate precaution to guard against discovery 'and rather unnecessary one rejoined graham dryly 'well met scamp ' did on sunday night that sunday be at southberry holding confirmation service a rode back shortly after eight in evening met jentham by appointment at cross road be stormy wet night graham half thought that must not come to rendezvous be there sure enough in very good temper at wetting did not get off horse handed down packet of note asked for certificate letter 'which doubt declined to part with at last moment 'you be right ' said bishop mournfully declared that must keep certificate until received hundred pound scoundrel what did say ' 'what must say be in man power at cost if wanted to save dear to have to secure written evidence possessed told that have not extra money with that if met in same place week later must have then rode away downcast wretched next day concluded bishop quietly heard that enemy be dead ' beurdered said graham explicitly beurdered a say ' rejoined pendle tremulously 'and oh friend fear that cain who slew now have certificate in possession hold secret what have suffered with knowledge god alone know day hour have be expecting call from assassin deuce have ' said doctor surprised into unbecoming language may come blackmail also graham ' when run risk of being hanged friend ' forget ' said bishop with sigh 'he may trust to knowledge of secret to force to conceal sin ' 'must be coerced in way ' dr pendle threw back noble head looking intently at friend replied in firm unfaltering tone 'no said gravely 'even at cost of secret becoming known must have man arrested ' 'well said graham with shrug be more of hero than be bishop cost of exposing wretch seems too great ' graham must do what be right at hazard justitia ruat coelum ' muttered doctor 'there be morsel of dictionary latin for heaven above family will certainly fall if speak out ' bishop winced whitened 'it be heavy burden graham heavy heavy burden god will give strength to bear will save according to mercy ' little doctor looked meditatively at boot wished to tell pendle that chaplain suspected of murder that baltic missionary have be brought to beorminster to prove such suspicion at present moment did not see how must conveniently introduce information moreover bishop seemed to be so utterly unconscious that anyone must accuse of crime graham shrank from being busybody to enlighten yet be necessary that must be informed if only that might be placed on guard against machination of cargrim of course doctor never for one moment thought of respected friend a author of deed of violence quite believed account of meeting with jentham bishop simple way of relating episode must have convinced liberal minded man of innocence rectitude accent look candour carried conviction finally graham hit upon method of leading up to subject of cargrim treachery by referring to old gipsy fortune telling at mr pansey garden party doe jael know of secret ' asked with hesitation 'nothing ' replied bishop promptly 'it be impossible that can know anything unless ' here paused 'unless be aware of who killed jentham have seen certificate letter 'do think know who murdered man ' can not say at garden party went into tent to humour lady who wished to have fortune told ' saw go in bishop came out looking disturbed 'no wonder graham for mother jael under pretence of reading hand hinted at secret fancied from what said that knew what be accused of having gained information from jentham assassin however must not speak plainly warned of coming trouble talked about blood grave until really believe fancied have killed man must make nothing of so left tent considerably discomposed a may guess intended to see on occasion a yet have not done so ' 'be belief that woman know secret ' asked graham on consideration concluded that knew little not much at event not sufficient to hurt in way krant be jentham be of gipsy blood fancied that have seen mother jael perhaps in boastful way have hinted at power over still be quite certain that for own sake did not reveal secret after graham allusion of mother jael be vague unsatisfactory although disturbed sufficiently to make anxious for moment 'well bishop agree with mother jael can not know much must have spoken plainer so far a be concerned fancy secret be pretty safe added graham with glance at door about cargrim ' 'he know nothing graham ' 'perhaps not suspect much ' beuspects echoed bishop in scared tone 'what can suspect ' 'that killed jentham ' said graham quietly dr pendle looked incredulously at friend ' murder kill what cargrim say stammered then asked with sharp rush of speech 'be man mad ' 'no be scoundrel a told listen bishop in rapid way graham reported to dr pendle harry brace have told regarding cargrim scheme bishop listened in incredulous silence almost against will be obliged to believe in graham story that man whom trusted whom have treated with such kindness must have dug pit for to fall into be almost beyond belief when truth of accusation be forced upon hardly knew what to say about so great traitor made up mind to one thing ' will dismiss at once said determinedly 'no bishop be unwise to drive rat into corner cargrim may prove dangerous if sharply treated better tolerate presence until baltic discovers real criminal ' like position said bishop frowning 'no man must however be better to temporise than to risk lose better let remain pendle well graham will take advice ' graham rose to depart 'and gabriel ' asked with hand on door to doctor must speak to ' 'you wo scold for seeing first hope becold ' said bishop with melancholy smile friend situation be too serious for scolding ' chapter xxxi mr baltic on trail what took place at interview between gabriel father dr graham never knew indeed never sought to know be discreet man even for doctor meddled with one business unless a in present instance forced to do so even then discretion showed for after advising bishop to tolerate presence of cargrim until baltic have solved riddle be set to guess after sending gabriel to palace abstained from further inquiry discussion in connection with murder secret have faith in baltic quite believed that in time missionary must lay hand on actual murderer when be accomplished cargrim attempt to gain illegal power over pendle be thwarted then chance of public scandal being at end must be moment to consider how bishop must act in reference to false marriage certainly there be possible danger that criminal might learn secret from certificate paper might reveal when captured graham thought best to ignore difficulty until must actually arise for after such contingency might not occur 'the certificate of marriage between krant wife will reveal nothing to man unacquainted with mr pendle previous name without such knowledge can not know that married bishop while first husband be alive certainly might have mentioned pendle name in letter must not write of a lover a possible husband therefore unless assassin know something of story be improbable unless can connect name of mr krant with mr pendle on face of be impossible see how be to learn truth may guess may know for certain that jentham received two hundred pound from bishop can not guess that price be paid for certificate letter especially a found on body know that be not handed over for money on whole think pendle be mistaken in opinion there be danger to be feared from assassin whomsoever may be ' in way graham argued with shortly came to comfortable conclusion that dr pendle secret must never become public scandal now that jentham alias krant be dead secret be known to three people only namely to bishop to to gabriel if none of three betrayed have strongest reason for silence one else must must question of murder be immediate matter for consideration once dr pendle innocence be proved by capture of real assassin cargrim must be dismissed in well merited disgrace with will in world must not then harm bishop seeing that be ignorant of dead man relation to mr pendle other danger there be none of that little doctor be absolutely assured perhaps bishop argued in way also may be found certain amount of relief in sharing trouble with gabriel graham certainly appeared more cheerful le worried than formerly even tolerated society of cargrim with equanimity although detested playing part so foreign to frank honourable nature however saw necessity of masking dislike until sting of domestic viper must be rendered innocuous be sufficiently gracious on such occasion a came into contact with gabriel be le called upon to be courteous to schemer a having come to complete understanding with father rarely visited palace when did so demeanour towards mr cargrim be much same a of yore for good of domestic peace father son concealed real feeling succeeded a creditably a be possible with men of honourable nature be not cunning enough perhaps sufficiently guarded to deceive artful chaplain evil be always on alert to see evil in others wonder what mean ruminated one day after vainly attempting to learn why gabriel have returned so unexpectedly to beorminster 'the bishop seems unnecessarily polite young pendle appears to be careful how speaks surely ca suspect of knowing about murder perhaps baltic have be talking will just give word of warning ' did be promptly told by ex sailor not to advise on point of be ignorant know business sir none better ' observed baltic in solemn way 'and there be few men who be more aware of value of silent tongue 'you may be admirable detective a say ' retorted cargrim nettled by rebuke have only word for will permit to observe have not yet seen proof of capability 'all in good time mr cargrim more haste le speed sir fancy be on right track at last guess who killed man asked chaplain eagerly waiting for bishop name to be pronounced ' never guess sir theorise from external evidence then try with such brain a god have given to prove theory 'you have gained evidence then 'if have mr cargrim will hear when place murderer in dock be foolish to show half finished work ' if mur hard sir interrupted baltic raising head `` ll so far depart from rule a to tell one thing killed jentham be not bishop pendle cargrim grew red angry ' tell be ' almost shouted although conversation took place in quiet corner near cathedral thereby required prudent speech demeanour 'did dr pendle meet jentham on common 'we presume so sir a yet have proof of meeting ' least know that paid jentham two hundred pound 'perhaps did maybe did returned baltic quietly 'he certainly drew out that amount from ophir bank not having traced note ca say if paid to man be sure did ' insisted cargrim still angry 'in case sir why ask for opinion ' replied imperturbable baltic if mr cargrim have not be clergyman must have sworn at complacent demeanour of agent even a be felt inclined to risk relieving oath two knowing baltic religious temperament be wise enough not to lay open to further rebuke so turned matter off with laugh observed that doubt mr baltic knew own business best think can safely say so sir ' rejoined baltic gravely 'by way did not tell that captain george pendle be on common when murder took place ' george be there so be gabriel mr pansey page saw ' 'and where be captain pendle now sir ' 'at wincaster with regiment bishop have sent for to come to beorminster so expect will be here within week be glad of mr cargrim a wish to ask captain pendle few question 'do suspect ' ' ca rightly say sir ' answered baltic wiping face with red bandanna on may form opinion mr gabriel pendle come to derby winner sometimes see ' 'yes be in love with barmaid there ' baltic looked up sharply be daughter sir ' 'the same want to marry bell mosk 'does indeed ' drawled agent flicking thumb nail against teeth mr cargrim might do worse there be lot of good in young woman sir mr gabriel pendle have lately returned from abroad hear ' 'yes from nauheim 'that be in germany take sir did travel on cook ticket do know ' believe did ' humph will say good bye then mr cargrim for present will see when return from london ' going to ask about gabriel ticket at cook ' 'there be telling sir may look in ' think that gab ' think nothing a yet mr cargrim when do will tell thought good day sir god bless baltic with satisfied expression on face rolled away in nautical manner bless indeed ' muttered cargrim in much displeasure for speech manner of man pleased 'ugh wish baltic must stick to religion business at present be kind of moral hermaphrodite good for one thing wonder if suspect bishop two son believe dr pendle be innocent if be george gabriel be guilty well if be so will still be able to make bishop give heathcroft will rather do than see one of son hanged name disgraced still hope baltic will bring home crime to lordship ' with amiable wish mr cargrim quickened pace to catch up with miss whichello whom saw tripping across square towards jenny wren house little old lady looked rosy complacent at peace with whole of beorminster nevertheless expression changed when saw mr cargrim sliding gracefully towards received with marked coldness a yet have not forgiven for unauthorised interference on behalf of mr pansey cargrim be quick to observe buckram civility diplomatically took notice of frigidity on contrary be more gushing more expansive than ever ' happy meeting dear lady said with beaming glance 'have not met must have called to see a bearer of good news ' beally replied miss whichello drily 'that will be relief from hearing bad news mr cargrim have have sufficient trouble of late sighed chaplain falling into professional drawl true be saying of job man be born ' ' want to hear about job ' interrupted miss whichello crossly 'he be greatest bore of patriarch 'job dear lady be not patriarch 'nevertheless be bore mr cargrim what be good news 'captain pendle be coming to beorminster week miss whichello ' said little old lady with satirical smile 'you be day after fair mr cargrim heard news morning ' 'indeed bishop only sent for captain pendle yesterday ' so miss arden received telegram from captain pendle morning ' miss whichello young love young love ' little lady must have shaken cargrim for smirk with made remark however restrained very natural impulse merely remarked rather irrelevantly must be confessed that if two young handsome people in love with one be not happy in first blush of passion never must be 'no doubt dear lady only trust that such happiness may last there be sky without cloud 'and there be bee without sting rose without thorn know consoling proverb mr cargrim apply to turtle dove cargrim rubbed hand softly together 'long may continue to think so dear lady ' said with sad look 'what do mean sir asked miss whichello sharply mean that be a well to be prepared for worst said cargrim in blandest manner 'the course of true love be weary of such trite saying good day miss whichello ' raised hat turned away 'one last proverb joy in morning mean grief at night ' when mr cargrim walked away briskly after delivering parthian shaft miss whichello stood looking after with expression of nervous worry on rosy face have own reason to apprehend trouble in connection with engagement although be unknown to chaplain chance arrow have hit mark thought of little old lady at once reverted to conversation with bishop at garden party pansey again thought miss whichello resuming walk at slower pace ' will have to call on appeal either to fear charity otherwise may cause trouble ' in meantime mr baltic proceeding in grave way towards eastgate have fallen in with gabriel coming from derby winner a yet two have never met save name young pendle knew nothing about ex sailor nevertheless when face to face with recognised man at once a private inquiry agent whom have once spoken to in knowledge of father secret of jentham murder of stranger profession mingled confusedly in gabriel head heart knocked at rib for very fear ' met in year ago said nervously 'yes mr pendle then did not know name did know mine 'how did recognise ' asked gabriel have good memory for face sir ' returned baltic 'but a matter of fact sir harry brace pointed out to ' beir har oh then be baltic service mr pendle be down here on business ' know about ' replied gabriel recovering nerve with knowledge of man name inclination to side with bishop sir who told about ' beir harry told dr graham who informed father who spoke to ' 'oh baltic looked seriously at curate pale face 'then bishop know that be inquiry agent ' doe mr baltic to tell truth be not at pleased that presented in city a missionary ' be missionary answered ex sailor quietly explained a much to sir harry must seem that have told worst kept back best ' understand ' said curate much bewildered beir must take too long for to explain why call missionary can rest assured that be not sailing under false colour a be know a agent know also purpose in coming here ' 'yes know that be investigating mur 'we be in street sir ' interrupted baltic with glance at passer by 'it be a well to be discreet one moment ' led gabriel into quiet alley comparatively free from listener 'this be rather rough sort of neighbourhood sir ' 'rough certainly not dangerous ' replied gabriel puzzled by remark carry pistol mr pendle ' why must ' indeed if gospel be not protection enough earthly arm will prevail name be gabriel think sir ' 'yes gabriel pendle see ' `` m coming to explanation sir g p ' mused baltic beame initial a of father brother eh mr pendle ' 'certainly bishop brother be named george ' g p three ' said baltic with nod travel abroad with cook ticket sir ' 'usually why do ' ' through ticket to say nauheim be about three pound believe ' ' paid that for mine mr baltic may ask why question in manner ' demanded gabriel irritably baltic tapped gabriel chest three time with forefinger 'for own safety mr pendle good day sir chapter xxxii initial a have before be stated dr graham have conversation with persecuted friend in advised to tolerate presence of cargrim until baltic captured actual criminal be also at second interview that bishop asked graham if must tell george truth question little doctor answered promptly in negative what be use of telling ' said argumentatively 'doing so will make uncomfortable george very unhappy ' george must learn truth sooner later ' ' see that be necessary to inform of at retorted graham obstinately at event need not explain until forced to do so one thing at time bishop at present task be to baffle cargrim kick scoundrel out of house when murderer be found then can discus matter of marriage with mr pendle ' ' bishop utterance of name be like cry of pain ' can not dare not tell amy must pendle since be principal person concerned in matter know how gabriel learned truth from casual description of first husband well when mr pendle return to beorminster may say that will mind may speak of krant again since so far a be concerned there be need for to keep fact of first marriage secret ' 'except that may not wish to recall unhappy day put in bishop softly 'indeed wonder that amy must bring to speak of krant to son mine ' 'women friend do say thing at wonder ' said misogynist cynically 'probably mr pendle acted on impulse of moment regretted immediately word be out of mouth still may describe krant again when come back listener may be a clever a gabriel be in putting two two together connecting wife first husband with krant must such thing occur might occur secret must become common property of scandalmongering place last condition must be worse than first also continued graham with air of person clinching argument mr pendle be to part poor friend must be told reason for such separation 'part echoed bishop indignantly bey dear amy will never part doctor wonder that can suggest such thing now krant be dead beyond doubt will marry widow at once 'quite so quite right ' assented graham emphatically 'but in case a can see for must tell that first marriage be null void so a to account for necessity of second ceremony ' doctor paused reflected 'old scatterbrain that be ' said with shrug ' quite forgot way out of difficulty second marriage of course there be riddle solved 'no doubt so far a amy be concerned ' said pendle gloomily 'but so late ceremony will not make child legitimate in england marriage be not retrospective act 'they manage thing better in france ' opined graham in manner of sterne 'there man can legitimise child born out of wedlock if so chooses there be talk of modifying english act in same way of course very nice people with nasty idea shrieked out in usual pig headed style about legalised immorality however pursued doctor in more cheerful tone see that need worry on point bishop can depend upon gabriel holding tongue need not tell lucy george when marry wife for second time thing can go on a before what eye doe not see heart doe not grieve at know ' eye see heart grief groaned bishop 'pish make inquisition of conscience pendle have done wrong like greatness evil have be thrust upon ' ' be certainly innocent sinner graham ' 'of course be now that have found remedy be over done with wait till jentham murderer be found then turn cargrim out of door marry mr krant in out of way parish make fresh will in favour of child there be bishop worry more about matter think that must tell brace that ' ' certainly think that must disgrace daughter in eye of future husband ' retorted doctor hotly bearry wife hold tongue even recording angel can take note of so obviously just course think be right graham ' said bishop shaking friend hand with expression of relief 'in justice to child must be silent will act a suggest ' that being so be man again said graham jocularly 'and now can send for george to pay visit think there be necessity graham sight of ' 'will do good pendle martyrise look on child a so many visible evidence of sin bosh tell bosh ' cried doctor vigorously if ungallantly beend for george send for mr pendle lucy throw morbid idea to wind if ' added graham raising threatening finger will write out certificate for transfer of cleverest bishop in england to lunatic asylum 'well well wo risk ' said bishop smiling will come back at once 'and will be gas gaiter to quote immortal boz good day bishop have prescribed medicine see that take ' be tonic in graham ' 'all men of sense be pendle be salt of earth oxygen in moral atmosphere if be for common sense bishop ' said doctor with twinkle believe must be weak enough to come hear preach ' dr pendle laughed be afraid age of miracle be past friend a bishop must reprove ' a good sensible fellow will take advice well well bishop have have more obstinate patient than college chum good day good day little doctor skipped out of library with gay look merry nod leaving bishop relieved smiling devoutly thankful for solution of life riddle at moment noble verse of psalmist be in mind upon lip be refuge strength very present help in trouble ' bishop pendle be proving truth of text so exiled lover be permitted to return to beorminster very pleased be to find once more in vicinity of beloved after congratulating bishop on recovered cheerfulness placidity george brought forward name of mab be pleased to find that father be by mean so opposed to match a formerly dr pendle admitted again that mab be singularly charming young lady that son might do worse than marry late event have humbled bishop pride considerably knowledge that george be nameless induced to consider miss arden more favourably a wife for young man be at least lady not barmaid like bell mosk so painful fact of gabriel setting heart so low made george superior choice quite brilliant match in comparison on ground bishop intimated to captain pendle that on consideration be disposed to overlook rumour about miss arden disreputable father accept a daughter in law be with joyful news that george glowing eager a lover must be made appearance next morning at jenny wren house 'thank bishop be reasonable ' cried miss whichello when george explained new position knew that mab must gain heart in end behe gained mine in beginning ' said captain george fondly 'and that after be principal thing ' 'what own heart egotist doe mine then count for nothing ' said george slipping arm round waist 'if begin on subject litany will be a long a athanasian creed quite a devout ' pendle ' exclaimed miss whichello scandalised by embrace speech rather trying to religious spinster whichello ' mimicked gay lover 'be not to be received into family under name of george ' depends on behaviour captain pendle be pleased relieved that bishop consent to marriage 'aunty ' cried mab reddening trifle talk a though be favour look upon a worthless by mean 'worthless ' echoed george gaily 'then be gold mere dross diamond pebble be beauty of universe darling lowest slave ' threw at foot beet pretty foot on neck queen ' pendle ' said miss whichello striving to stifle laugh get up behave properly will leave room 'if do aunty will get worse smiled mab ruffling what barber have left of lover hair 'get up at once mad romeo george rose obediently dusted knee obey ' said tragically 'but be not

bohemia romany sorceress ' mab laughed miss whichello heaved quick impatient sigh a though eastern comparison annoyed george be unconsciously making remark cut to heart almost unable to control feeling muttered excuse glided hastily from room with inherent selfishness of love george mab paid attention to emotion departure whispered smiled caressed one well pleased at sweet solitude george spent one golden hour in paradise then unwillingly tore away only shakespeare must have done justice to passion of parting kiss sigh last look final handclasp then george in sunshine of square with mab waving handkerchief from open casement ala workaday prose always succeeds arcadian rhyme with sinking sun dy glory of day with mind hanging betwixt mental heaven earth after similitude of mahomet coffin george walked slowly down street until be brought like shot eagle to ground by touch on shoulder now a there be nothing more annoying than bailiff salute george wheeled round with vigorous language on tip of tongue did not use when found facing sir harry brace 'oh be ' said captain pendle lamely with experience must know better than to pull up fellow unawares 'you talk in riddle good george ' said harry staring a well might at not very coherent speech have just left miss arden explained george quite unabashed for did not care if whole world knew of love beg pardon understand replied brace with broad smile must excuse old chap be be out of practice lately see love be in germanee a old song say wish to speak with ' 'all right where will go ' 'to club must see privately ' beorminster club be just short distance down street so george followed harry into hospitable portal finally accepted comfortable chair in smoking room luckily for purpose of brace be empty at hour two young men ordered cool hock soda lighted two very excellent cigarette came out of pocket of extravagant george then began to talk harry opened conversation with question 'george ' said with serious look on usually merry face 'be on southberry heath on night poor devil be murdered ' 'oh yes replied captain pendle with wonder at question rode over to gipsy camp to buy particular ring from mother jael ' 'for miss arden suppose ' 'yes wished for necromantic symbol of engagement ' hear see anything of murder 'good lord ' cried startled george sitting up straight must have be at inquest have seen act even heard shot carry pistol with on night ' 'as be riding through central africa did not what be meaning of mysterious question brace answered query by slipping hand into breast pocket producing therefrom neat little pistol toy like deadly enough in hand of good marksman 'be yours ' asked holding out for captain pendle inspection 'certainly be ' said george handling weapon 'here be initial on butt where did get ' 'it be found by mother jael near spot where jentham be murdered ' captain pendle clapped down pistol on table with ejaculation of amazement 'be shot with harry ' 'without doubt ' replied brace gravely 'therefore a be property wish to know how came to be used for purpose ' scott brace think that killed blackguard think nothing so ridiculous ' protested sir harry testily 'you talk a if did though ' retorted george smartly thrashed that jentham beast for insulting mab did shoot ' 'but pistol be yours ' ' admit that good lord ' cried captain pendle starting to foot 'what now ' asked brace turning pale cold on instant gabriel gave pistol to ' 'you gave pistol to gabriel when where ' 'in london explained george rapidly 'when be in whitechapel knew that went among lot of rough thief so insisted that must carry pistol for protection be unwilling to do so at first in end persuaded to slip into pocket have not seen from day to ' 'and be found near jentham corpse ' said brace with groan two young men looked at one in horrified silence same thought in mind of pistol have be in possession of gabriel gabriel on night of murder have be in vicinity of crime be impossible ' whispered george almost inaudibly 'gabriel can explain must explain ' said brace firmly 'it be matter of life death ' chapter xxxiii mr baltic explains be miss whichello who on statement of mr pansey a reported by mr cargrim have told george of brother presence on southberry heath at time of jentham murder have casually mentioned fact during idle conversation never for one moment have dreamed of connecting gabriel with so atrocious crime indeed did captain pendle until fact be rudely unexpectedly brought home to by production of pistol nevertheless despite material evidence vehemently refused to credit so gentle being a gabriel have slain fellow creature deliberately in cold blood particularly a on face of reason must be assigned for so hazardous act curate in loyal brother opinion be vindictive fool aimless murderer with latter opinion sir harry very heartily agreed have highest respect for gabriel a man priest must not believe that have wantonly committed brutal crime so repulsive to benign nature so contrary to purity teaching of life be quite satisfied that young man must must explain how pistol have passed out of possession did not seek explanation baltic previous to departure for london have made brace promise to question captain pendle about pistol report to result of such conversation now that pistol be proved to have be in keeping of gabriel baronet knew very well that baltic must prefer to question so important witness therefore while waiting for agent return not only refrained from seeing gabriel persuaded george not to do so 'your question will only do more harm than good expostulated brace have trained capacity experience to examine into matter baltic return to morrow a have faith in judgment discretion will be much better to let handle ' 'who be baltic talk of so much ' asked captain impatiently 'he be private inquiry agent who be trying to discover man who killed jentham ' behalf of tinkler suppose 'he be working with tinkler in matter replied brace evasively for did not want to inform george rash fiery of father peril cargrim treachery 'baltic be london detective doubt ' brain be more equal than tinkler to task of solving riddle 'he wo arrest gabriel hope ' said george anxiously 'not unless be absolutely certain that gabriel committed crime be satisfied that will never arrive at certainty ' must think not cried captain pendle with disdain poor boy must not kill fly let alone man still legal bloodhound be coarse unscrupulous ' 'baltic be not george be quite new type of detective work rather from religious than judicial point of view ' ' never heard of religious detective before ' remarked george scornfully be new departure be not sure that be good one incongruous a may seem ' 'be man hypocrite 'by mean be thoroughly in earnest here in public call missionary oh wolf in skin of sheep ' 'not at man be well be use explaining a will see shortly then can judge for if will take advice george will let baltic figure matter out on own slate a american say mention name actual business to anyone believe know what be talking about ' havery well ' grumbled george convinced by harry earnestness by mean pleased to be condemned to interval of ignorance inactivity ' will hold tongue close eye agree with that gabriel did not kill brute 'of course from first never have doubt on score ' here for time being conversation ended george went way to play part of careless onlooker for promise must have warned gabriel of danger threatened probably have complicated matter by premature anger luckily for thing faith in brace good sense be strong enough to deter from so rash headlong course therefore at home abroad assumed gaiety did not feel so here in episcopalian palace of beorminster be three people one masking real feeling in intercourse with others bishop son scheming chaplain be actor in comedy of life in opinion of last might easily end up a tragedy wonder behaviour be constrained wonder avoided one be a men living over powder magazine least spark must explode with thunderous noise damaging effect baltic be deus ex machina to strike spark for ignition seemed in hurry to do so punctual to promise returned to beorminster heard sir harry report about pistol with grave attention without venturing opinion for against curate asked sir harry to preserve strict silence until such time a gave leave to speak afterwards took way to gabriel lodging in lower part of town there be fortunate enough to find young pendle within door after lengthy interview with on matter connected with crime again sought baronet detailed explanation to gentleman resulted in visit of to sir harry bank interesting conversation with manager when brace baltic finally found on pavement face of first wore expression of exultation while latter in reticent way looked soberly satisfied have reason for sign of triumph for have touched highest pinnacle of success suppose there can be doubt about baltic '

thought of connecting mosk with crime even on seizure by warrant many declined to believe in guilt nevertheless when man be brought before magistrate evidence adduced against by baltic be so strong clear irrefutable that without dissenting word from bench prisoner be committed to stand trial at ensuing assize mosk made defence did not even offer remark accepting fate with sullen apathy sunk into lethargic unobservant state out of nothing person must arouse brain appeared to have be stunned by suddenness of calamity many people expressed surprise that bishop pendle must have be present when man be arrested blamed for having even gone to derby winner disreputable pot house whispered be not neighbourhood in spiritual lord must be found mr pansey for once on side of right soon put stop to such talk by informing one that bishop have visited hotel at request in order to satisfy that report scandal about be true that mosk must have be arrested while dr pendle be making inquiry be pure coincidence be greatly to bishop credit that have helped to secure murderer in fact mr pansey be not very sure what have taken wretch in charge with own august hand bishop be glad that mr pansey to foster own vanity have put complexion on visit to hotel a did away with need of true uncomfortable explanation also have carried home with packet tossed on table by mosk therefore so far a actual proof be concerned secret be still own murderer knew for not only be certificate letter in bundle there be also sheet of memoranda set down by krant alias jentham proved clearly that so called mr

of revenge for share in arrest may tell someone story reveal name of church wherein amy be married to krant then register there will disclose secret to anyone curious enough to search book what will do what can do dare not visit mosk dare not ask graham to see there be nothing to be done to hope for best if miserable man speaks out will be ruined dr pendle quite expected ruin for have hope that
