especially be distracted by splendour of lady dress variety of new fashion many laudable imitation of marvellous frock be visible in country lane village street before easter lady jim husband discreetly sat in body of church distance from pulpit a leah did not wish to come under curate eye thought be quite capable of preaching at in case natural resentment must have led to quarrel prejudicial to exercise of lionel good office with duke moreover leah occupied with own thought did not want to be distracted by sermon of religious platitude stood up sat down mechanically looking too flamboyant to be in harmony with simplicity of building tucked into opening of incroyable coat claret coloured with strikingly large button wore cup shaped nosegay of white pink orchid hat be large with many feather of new titian red resembled nothing in nature did not wear jewellery vivid colour of dress made up for absence of gem there be something tropical about leah in chill grey

destruction of enemy be element composed remarkable petition lady jim be not very clear a to whom be asking have vague feeling mistook for religion that there might be one who must give what required moreover be just a well to be on safe side yet even a tried experiment earthly superstition asserted carefully fingered peacock feather inside muff serving of god fetish may seem ridiculous in woman

poet remark be so superstitious leah pantheress be of feline tribe having made safe with unknown lady jim joined in ensuing hymn bravely thought word dreary tune barbarous fervour of deep contralto voice reached duke ear gave approving glance so be something gained leah must have gone through whole collection of ancient modern to learn precise meaning of look be satisfied with guessing sat down cheerfully to be bored with sermon occurred to that prayer have be heard must probably be granted whether by peacock feather deity of whom lionel now began to speak must not determine name will be called wonderful be curate text discoursed on in simple impressive way speaking of birth of christ of teaching plan of salvation of self denying life unwearying kindness young man grave tender period shamed most inattentive into thoughtfulness lionel be not born orator be very much in earnest preached with emphasis carried undeniable conviction mr penworthy felt suddenly virtuous resolved to repeat a much of sermon a must remember to freddy so that might not grumble so much over what silly thing called extravagance even lady canvey wagged aged head thought that might help few deserving pauper if need must be supplied in moderation leah be impressed to extent of hoping that duke must see that behoved to fill empty pocket of deserving pretty daughter in law jim must have approved of sentiment time be fast asleep woke up cross when pinched to rise for doxology beyond stray sentence here there leah have not paid much attention have heard before though of sentiment be new a thought ridiculous when preacher be fairly started relapsed into own thought being unpleasant permitted hard eye to wander round church after wondering gaze at extraordinary fashion of woman patronising examination of decoration caught sight of face belonging to young man on other side of aisle be so like jim that involuntarily turned to see if husband still slumbered placidly by side double be dressed in grey tweed looked almost like gentleman stooped trifle in spite of square shoulder stalwart figure now then coughed painfully apparently be ill with pulmonary complaint freezing atmosphere of church accentuated leah wondered at resemblance thought of certain traditionary story concerning youthful day of duke after second glance decided that perhaps there be nothing in jim be of pink white bovine commonplace type there be hundred like in manner moral look moreover be so weary of seeing jim inane face over breakfast cup that did not care to gaze at imitation nevertheless being

baited hook with sprat to catch much needed mackerel be useless to explain to jim must not have understood such lavish fishing be really too lovely mr penworthy assured duke at luncheon mr kaimes spoke just thing feel decoration oh really so very tasteful mistletoe duke think there must have be mistletoe round pulpit immoral plant chimed in lady canvey with sharp twinkling eye so useless to

jim ironically be right dear kiss must bear cross a lionel said morning now must go to see old mr arthur one must be good to one inferior result of conversation be that lady frith told husband of leah pointedly correct humbleness whereat marquis laughed shortly quite understood lady jim tactic be resolved that must not succeed frith be one of few men lady jim have never fascinated hated to be under

housekeeper to resume seat then asked about mr arthur cough sailor son married daughter after various other thing in did not feel least interest old woman much impressed with leah condescension not sufficiently clever to see through art expanded like winter rose in aristocratic sunshine in few minute be chatting quite at ease with discursive garrulousness of old age be unguarded mood leah desired for satisfaction of curiosity having created by appearance of deepest interest in mr arthur domestic small beer chronicle proceeded to take advantage of opportunity service be delightful morning observed decoration be charming congregation so attentive suppose know one in village mr arthur ought to lady be firmingham bred born very good representative of place said leah kindly villager be really quite nice looking especially men if saw son be in church morning asked lady jim who knew very well that young man be with ship in chinese water saw rather handsome young fellow in

rising to go hope poor fellow will get well said aloud really be foolish to venture into cold church think mind if be dead alive lady have friend oh yes duke certainly grace who be friend to said mr arthur loyally lady jim laughed went away have learned wished to learn beyond satisfying passing curiosity have desire to pursue subject still thought must amuse to ask demetrius few question concerning patient went in search of somehow subject of harold garth resemblance to jim took hold of imagination must not put out of head while be thinking of other matter thought of strange likeness now fully accounted for must slip in must find pondering afterwards declared that insistence of passing thought be work of providence for so called peacock feather baal served demetrius be not in house having be called out to see one who be ill in village so lionel assured moreover supplied with name of patient be young fellow called harold garth said gravely foolishly came to church morning being already ill be worse from having ventured out never heard parson call going to church foolishness before said lady jim surprised that subject must crop up again in so unexpected manner who be harold garth protge of duke have just returned from canada said curate simply curiously enough be rather like kaimes family perhaps be why duke be so kind to perhaps be said leah wondering how much

paris be difficult to hint without shocking feeling of great lady spotless woman still if skilfully done without too much emphasis lady jim might gather that finance must be put in order without much trouble on part aksakoff have argument induced to risk scene with outraged virtue loved daughter wished to marry highly placed cousin who must be of political use to father in law unfortunately katinka be infatuated aksakoff must find more appropriate word with demetrius marriage with person wanted by powerful of st petersburg meant check to diplomatist handle to many enemy match be not to be thought of yet if demetrius must only prove kind mademoiselle aksakoff must assuredly become wife even if have to achieve marriage by elopement also katinka might be able to procure man pardon of
