not that german desired to do so after interview with mr jeal be most indignant at slur cast upon character of girl called adopted daughter there be scene mr jeal proved to be more than equal to official from portfront never heard anything so wicked in life cried mr jeal poor child may be mad not mad enough to take what be not own wonder at sir that must come here on errand duty be clearly before replied inspector stiffly be girl really truly ill can take word for mr german said raston if believe here be dr james ill repeated doctor when question be put to have bad attack of

german who must not go against evidence be very plain that be in wrong unless there be unless about sir cried mr jeal pearl wasna oot o ' hoose in excitement be falling into scotch speech of childhood wonder at ye do that hoot awa ' wi ' ye baffled in quarter inspector took way into village first examined chapel then started out to make inquiry for quite three day exasperated everyone in village with question suspicion for worry be unable to get at truth tramp have be to village old barker proved innocence with assistance of wrathful wife there be not single person to whom well meaning blundering inspector must point a likely to have stolen cup finally be obliged to state that must hing withdrew underling from colester much to relief of villager whom have grievously offended by unjust suspicion cup have vanished a though have be swallowed up by earth one be able to say who have taken grievous loss sighed mr tempest when became resigned sorrow not so much for theft of cup a for awful sacrilege of thief have be guilty took occasion to refer to terrible deed in wrathful sermon villager shook in shoe when heard of ill likely to befall thief not one be able to say who be guilty for whole week thing went on much a usual excitement died away leo be still in london through pratt sybil have heard from have seen creditor have settled debt be now thinking about enlisting before must do so however sybil sent message recalling to colester to defend good name so happened that barker held tongue for time when first effect of fright lest might be accused passed away began to talk old man be given to babbling in cup thus came about that mentioned that believed mr haverleigh have taken cup seemed that barker have seen leo near chapel a be leaving about past nine mr haverleigh said old man have seemed to shun recognition have hurried past not thinking anything of matter barker have left near chapel door now however hinted that leo might have have reason to be there at so untoward hour also have gone away next morning early be well known in colester that young man be in debt that mother have refused to pay debt what then be more likely people argued than leo must have stolen cup must have taken up to london before loss be discovered must have sold to pay debt in few hour sorry tale be over place so came to sybil ear be father who heard father who told surely believe cried girl when accusation be made have known leo year may have against father know that must never commit so wicked act say nothing until hear what have to say replied vicar who for reason seemed to be biased against leo must admit that be strange must be near chapel at so late hour know that be deeply in debt mr gabriel told that owed three hundred pound in moment of madness wo hear word against leo interrupted sybil pale resolute not if angel came down to accuse must believe guilty how must have got key if did not get key how must have forced through small window say nothing until hear defence said vicar obstinately whole affair be highly suspicious never knew to be unjust before father cried sybil mr gabriel have infected with dislike of leo will say nothing although must say more than think will send at once to leo will come back to rebut wicked accusation without listening to word sybil ran off to see pratt who be equally indignant be disgraceful said furiously leo never must do thing never be comforted dear will ride over to portfront very day send wire to did without delay more than that defended leo heartily when returned so did raston hale kept silent majority of villager be against young man leo returned in disgrace chapter viii haverleigh defence thanks to care of dr james nursing of mr jeal sick girl took turn for better in remarkably short space of time began to improve when leo arrived back in colester be on fair way of recovery although doctor did not like mr jeal must not admit that mother must have be kinder than midwife

wonder what be matter pratt must ask to come back not growled hale know well enough why hale believe stole cup cripple remained silent for time be difficult thing for to say finally remarked know james sister edith be deeply in love with man like never did if must marry sister must not decline alliance put happiness before own feeling well under circumstance really be not prepared to give opinion know that leo be in debt be common talk that mr gabriel refused to pay debt yet informed that went up to london to settle now must have got money from somewhere who must trust look black against confess replied james shaking head still can not believe that haverleigh must sink to being common thief will see when return that will be able to explain if ever doe return growled hale

hale jealously a to there being anything between believe good day james go spreading cock bull story a baronet walked off doctor looked after with smile of contempt knew that hale be madly in love with vicar daughter that regarded leo a too successful rival will be delighted if poor chap come to harm muttered james be viper be sure haverleigh will clear girl like sybil tempest be not likely to be deceived in character of man love must rather believe than sir frank hale james who have great love for spiteful little cripple walked away to see pearl by time opinion be that leo must not return be positive said gossip that have stolen cup in order to procure money for payment of debt most likely thing be that must clear out of country what fool people be said pratt who heard if man intended to leave country certainly must not pay debt only heaven born as must do that must take money leave creditor unpaid gossip did not see matter in light be bent upon thinking worst of leo time mr gabriel said nothing remained shut up in castle knew well enough what be being said about leo must not bear to face anyone more particularly a did not know how to defend denied to everyone even to pratt although called several time to interview on behalf of nephew young man have strong defender in pratt went about everywhere insisting on haverleigh innocence in opinion be supported by sybil by curate strange to say by mr bathurst whole thing be absolute nonsense said mr bathurst why must mr haverleigh be such fool mr gabriel must have paid debt in long run then if have not wished to pay must have enlisted slipped away to africa without anyone being wiser then there be thing must not commit crime for purpose if be in difficulty before must not make worse by putting within reach of law of be common sense although leo enemy be too much bent on thinking worst of to accept such reasonable view be while matter be in state leo haverleigh returned drove up to castle one night without informing anyone of coming mr gabriel be amazed when presented before looked bright cheerful not at like man who have be accused of sordid crime must be remembered that leo knew nothing of new reputation knew be that pratt at instance of sybil have recalled to colester thought that telegram have to do with new difficulty with regard to love affair good evening mother said a marched into

see leo asked to come to vicarage leo be surprised at summons not very willing to obey resented way in have be treated by mr tempest still from what be hinted by mr jeal fancied that might be able to clear character so accompanied raston to place of meeting mr jeal be already in study seated beside vicar desk be dressed in best looked demure a cat tempest reddened when saw leo held out hand leo

to that did not steal cup leo looked at crafty face of woman mr jeal at nod from vicar rose folded hand can prove that did steal mr haverleigh said saw pawn cup in london chapter x price of silence for few moment there be dead silence tempest looked gravely shocked mr jeal triumphant curate much disturbed have be so certain of leo innocence that precise evidence took breath away leo be thunderstruck passed hand across eye to make sure that be not dreaming saw pawn what never have in possession said quietly mr jeal shrugged plump shoulder can say no more than know said of course quite expected must deny story have not heard yet replied accused man slowly will be glad to hear at present moment declare most solemnly that never took cup did not even know be stolen until returned from london where have pawned finished mr jeal vicar interposed be struck by leo calmness be not that of guilty person think have better tell story mr jeal said then can hear mr haverleigh thank for

raston sharply notwithstanding woman story still believe haverleigh be guiltless circumstance have so culminated that appears to be in wrong there be mystery about whole of affair seems to that haverleigh have enemy may be so admitted tempest struck by remark what be to be done ca have leo arrested even if be guilty be now inclined to doubt can not ruin life what need replied curate be clever man who will get to bottom of if can spare for few day mr tempest will go to london see marton marton repeated vicar who be marton raston laughed such be fame said lightly marton be one of best

be taking place leo be talking in chapel with hale haverleigh have gone up to see if sybil be about a wished to tell of new development of conspiracy against leo felt sure by time that there be conspiracy that hale be concerned in be therefore rather pleased when saw cripple walking up hill before leo made up mind to force truth out of hurried on so a to catch hale heard step turned with queer smile on face be not at abashed by presence of man to whom have told lie on contrary welcomed in most friendly manner haverleigh be irritated by false behaviour think innocent wish to be friend said believe that be guilty have reason to be feigning good fellowship must have understanding with hale come into chapel will not be disturbed there a be mid day everyone be at dinner leo without waiting for reply entered door chapel be empty even sybil be not in sight hearing halting step of cripple behind leo led way into crusader chapel where sat down beside one of tomb hale paused before looked down in whimsical manner have chosen strange place said looking round be sacred place replied leo coolly may be le inclined to tell lie presume have religion how dare say tell lie cried baronet scowling because have have experience of capability in direction now must like to know what mean by denying that lent three hundred pound hale shrugged unshapely shoulder sat down with painful effort placing crutch beside be fool enough to speak to in presence of sister said must only say what did say now that be alone be willing to answer question may put to will answer truthfully hope assuredly be time understood one go on lent three hundred pound said leo in form of query in gold assented sir frank coolly why did lend to in gold whim of mine think so said leo slowly have scheme in head believe wanted to deny loan if found convenient be very clever haverleigh be just what did want have given cheque must have proved loan even note might have shown truth wanted to be free to act a pleased so went to trouble of getting gold from bank then seems to that have cup stolen by confederate intended to lay blame on so a to get into trap indeed protested hale so loudly that leo believed be speaking truth stealing of cup subsequent blame being thrown on be unexpected took advantage of opportunity can prove innocence only by help haverleigh give evidence only on condition be prepared for such speech said leo calmly wo do friend must go to tempest tell that gave three hundred pound to pay debt perhaps then may disbelieve ridiculous story of being thief hale sat up alertly then did steal cup certainly not how dare suggest thing suspect know more about loss of cup than do baronet looked down on crooked leg smiled ironically do mean to infer thrust misshapen body through window have plenty of money to pay for rascality be not so fond of parting with money said hale dryly know nothing about cup really thought stole mr jeal tale have leo started up told that why because be woman who be fond of money said hale quietly knowing that sister be in love with haverleigh came to threaten declared that must proclaim thief if did not pay be belief that course must break sister heart what did do told must inform police if dared to speak to in manner again believe then went to vicar if come forward haverleigh state lent money will go long way towards clearing of course understand pawning business woman say saw saw double someone dressed up to resemble said leo vehemently did not see be never near shop so say said hale smiling cruelly however must see that can help will do so on one condition on two can guess two said leo looking at mean face want to surrender sybil so that may marry to make sister wife be that not so hale smiled again save trouble of explanation said then absolutely refuse to do what want hale respect sister who be kind good hearted girl love not for gold in world must marry on other hand nothing will induce to give up sybil will never become wife wonder have impertinence to propose thing to if do what ask said hale very pale venomous will refuse to help will deny lent money deny what please leo walked to door of chapel everything be in favour can have arrested if choose decline to sell love to buy safety good day hale marched away chapter xi london detective sybil have seen leo go into room where father be waiting with mr jeal wondered what woman have to do with lover be called out to see sick woman on behalf of father on way home bethought how must see leo girl be in perfect fever of nervous fear for young man

position of unfortunate young man be undeniably hard here be deserted by aunt mr gabriel have taken up brought up to expect large fortune then for cause at have suddenly cast out on world to earn own living a best must in addition to although be hardship enough poor leo character be gone be accused of sordid crime might have to answer for to law did not see what defence must make certainly if acceded to hale term must vindicate position in measure by accounting for sum of money have used to pay debt in case sybil must be lost to what must life be without sybil altogether leo be in low spirit in spite of fire burgundy memory of charming interview be use lamenting a very truly observed to so tried to shake off feeling of depression went to bed be young world be large hoped in way to sail out of troubled water into peaceful haven hope be silver lining to cloud of black despair meanwhile raston have written to friend marton full account of loss of cup of accusation by mr jeal of

wild story to account for loss have heard of stranger even more daring thing be out of question marton on night cup be stolen mr jeal be watching beside sick girl mad creature have told about be

looking keenly round well furnished room be mr marton said be london detective with bitter laugh leo set down candle on table what said be man with bow string raston scarcely worthy of cloth if wanted to arrest might have waited until morning who be young gentleman asked marton suddenly be leo haverleigh mr detective replied young man sharply suppose have come here at instance of mr tempest to

investigate case think there be chance of being arrested face be enough for be very well added impatiently want pratt will go wake said leo who must make top tail of who be relieved to find that be not in danger of arrest retired from room while marton darted about here there everywhere be like bloodhound nosing trail suddenly stopped before cabinet drawer of be open too late said marton in tone of disgust be bolted how must bolt in fog asked raston dubiously oh will find way somehow tony angel be cleverest of men for getting out of difficulty have evaded police for year see dear chap drawer be open that mean have taken money valuable from be now on way to heaven know what hiding place can be sure of that open drawer may be accident besides must not think must act so promptly indeed be just why have bolted so expeditiously said marton with something of admiration in tone angel have experienced promptitude before several time have be on point of capturing have taken french leave within last two hour for infernal fog must have stuck to till ran down at event might have disabled with shot curate looked at friend aghast shot stammered marton produced neat little revolver must have used have be able said quietly doe not do to adopt half measure with mutual friend besides if hard pressed must have returned compliment haverleigh fellow be long time will be back soon can trust leo surely marton think knew anything of pratt doings with face a that know precious little retorted marton be good fellow not sharp did not steal that cup did help pratt to get away raston criminal

haverleigh be exactly what do mean have clever man pratt came back here straight warning pal walked off leaving empty house to to mr haverleigh did hear leave heard nothing until knocked at door then wondered why adam did not hear other servant be asleep at back of house suppose also expected adam to answer bell be extremely probable well let hope remaining servant will sleep well to morrow must leave house why in heaven name asked leo starting up for very simple reason that police will be put into possession here by to morrow what did pratt steal understand raston what doe man mean who be be wait bit mr haverleigh interrupted marton motioning curate to hold tongue in good time be horace marton detective be asked by mr raston to investigate robbery be telling about at lodging friend mr pratt arrived when saw bolted out into fog followed lost then got back to raston here have be over two hour looking for confounded place during time pratt adam have made scarce why must do asked leo

congratulate on friend mr haverleigh never knew anything of cried leo utterly taken aback be quite sure of haverleigh said curate heartily marton chuckled wait bit harold said be in such hurry how do know mr haverleigh have not be working together with tony angel may know about may have be employed by to steal very cup be given by pratt a evidence of respectability leo jumped up must have flung on marton raston held back how dare make such accusation against cried young man furiously let go raston hear what say wait bit haverleigh urged curate marton doe nothing without motive can explain if will remain quiet thus advised leo sat down again in rather sulky humour be trifle tired of being called blackguard said frowning at marton who regarded with friendly smile know absolutely nothing about mr pratt save that be friend of mr gabriel that have be very good to always thought be what represented to be small wonder did said marton coolly angel must deceive much cleverer man than appear to be mr haverleigh look here may a well tell at once be certain knew nothing about also be equally certain that have have nothing to do with robbery can not say yet whether pratt a may continue to call for clearness ' sake stole cup be innocent mr haverleigh intend to do best to get out of trouble shake hand at first leo hesitated for be still sore about accusation detective regarded in friendly manner smile be so irresistible that in end shook hand heartily felt that man who spoke thus must be good friend know about case mr raston must tell said detective even to fact that borrowed money for be accused of stealing cup from sir frank hale then wish must make acknowledge loan said leo petulantly marton started looked at young man doe not do so no be in love with miss tempest who be engaged to say will deny loan if give up marry sister suppose interposed curate whereat leo nodded humph said marton thoughtfully caressing chin seems to mr haverleigh that have be made tool of by unscrupulous people will give attention to to morrow will get truth out of hale dare to palter with leave reputation in hand haverleigh very gladly said leo heartily what about pratt marton reflected took sip of whisky water be gone think will appear again in colester have left house beautiful thing behind put in raston with glance around see have made comfortable said marton with shrug be always way be not first time have furnished house settled down have be driven out of burrow however time discovered hiding place by accident colester be about best place in whole of england must have chosen one must have thought of looking for here daresay expected to settle down die in odour of sanctity surrounded by ill gotten gain have not gone empty handed haverleigh be too clever for be always prepared for emergency who be pratt well be asking hard question understand be workhouse brat of sort claim to be illegitimate son of nobleman certainly have very gentlemanly appearance have be working for at least thirty year have always contrived to evade english police believe be laid by heel in america have travelled great deal believe know whole world scoundrel in king of crime be what pratt be generality of thief adore for have good point be generous well have talked enough for to night will sleep here haverleigh raston will return to own place said curate rising to go did marton having found burrow of pratt alias angel did not intend to leave be quite a clever a man be hunting chapter xiii interesting document marton did not wish identity of pratt to be concealed on contrary gave a wide publicity a possible hoping that might lead to man capture everyone from portfront to colester knew must be country gentleman so be not unlikely that might be caught considering that only night have elapsed be impossible that must have got far away especially in fog if pratt escaped there be always off chance that adam might be laid by heel examination next morning showed marton that two bicycle be missing so judged that men have gone off together be improbable in marton opinion that have gone to portfront a must not possibly leave before steamer at seven o'clock police must be communicated with by telegraph before must get clear of place at half past six marton routed telegraph operator out of bed set to work wired to inspector at portfront to arrest pratt man forthwith at event to detain until london police must be communicated with warrant for pratt manifold iniquity procured to marton surprise answer be returned from inspector german yet inspector knew pratt well if man set foot in portfront must easily seize later on somewhere about nine o'clock reason that answer have arrived became apparent messenger came from portfront to say that telegraph wire between place portfront have be cut midway there be only one line so communication have be broken off steamer have started without doubt two men be on board at once marton started off to portfront on curate bicycle on arrival went to see german inspector be much astonished when heard story have not received wire therefore have done nothing in marton company hurried to office of steamer see kind of man have to deal with german said marton much vexed be clever dodge to cut wire yet gave away did not think must go to portfront cutting of wire prof did will wire to worthing stop there inquiry at steamer office resulted in nothing seemed that mr pratt have season ticket therefore have not purchased one have adam so might be that be still in town loafer on pier said have not seen pratt go aboard humph said marton sneaked on in disguise be clever at disguising asked german must think so own mother must not know still have time to make up before left colester so may not be so carefully disguised daresay can catch at worthing wire be sent to worthing forthwith to scotland yard requesting that someone might be sent down to take charge of pratt house to identify good have in there be list of house pratt have broken into list of stolen good also so must be easy to have brought down compared with content of nun house having thus done that must under circumstance marton returned to colester where found curate leo waiting for latter have now taken up quarter at inn kept within door a now that identity of pratt be known leo be credited with having be confederate there be tremendous excitement in colester over discovery that village have entertained unawares well known london thief many of villager flattered on stern non committal attitude have adopted towards too fascinating stranger mr pratt have never be very popular now be spoken ill of on hand whole village must have be delighted to have seen in power of law pratt be too clever for wire to worthing produced result neither pratt adam be on board then appeared that steamer have put in at bognor marton have omitted to advise police there of fugitive so be presumed that have got off with rest of passenger captain did not know adam by sight pratt have evidently disguised well at event in crowd two have passed unnoticed although london station be watched sight must be caught of clever man pratt said marton when informed of ill success be perfectly certain of way in went about matter servant got off at bognor alighted at station just outside metropolis got to own haunt by back way do know of haunt asked leo who be keenly interested in matter must not help feeling relieved that pratt have escaped oh change now then besides adam will keep out of sight pratt will so disguise that there will be recognising be got clean away time believe mr haverleigh added marton with laugh that be rather pleased well said leo with hesitation in spite of say ca bring to believe that pratt be bad sort of chap be very kind to be kind to most people pose a kind of modern robin hood who robs rich to give to poor have known to do many kind action be scamp for if must lay hand on 'd get mr gabriel be much annoyed to find pratt be so notorious character determined to clear herself of complicity in sordid crime although one ever suspected that have knowledge of man true character sent for marton have long talk with about pratt incidentally reference be made to leo have asked to see mr marton said because be who introduced mr pratt to colester have known ten year always appeared to to be most respectable american be not american at said marton must assume nationality suited for moment be brilliantly clever man mr gabriel wonder took in got money out of at event said lady grimly ah then escaped easily wonder be did not try marry rich widow be exactly kind of victim must like be not sort of woman to be anyone victim mr marton marton looking at stern strong face quite agreed be too polite to give vent to feeling merely inquired how mr gabriel have become acquainted with prince of swindler have hesitation in giving full detail met at swiss hotel many year ago said be then called pratt posed a rich american met with accident while out walking on hill above montreux lay out till mr pratt rescued from very unpleasant position took back to hotel friendship sprang up between when returned to england called on a be always same for ten year saw much of never suspected that be other than represented to be besides mr marton must admit be most fascinating man much too fascinating mr gabriel a many have found to cost mr gabriel reflected moment do think will be put in prison certainly if catch replied marton quietly be man dangerous to society life have be rogue criminal money come to in wrong way that house below believe let to mr gabriel be filled with proceeds of robbery bought furniture object of art even picture have be stolen in few day will have people down from scotland yard to identify thing restore to owner a to mr pratt fear have escaped out of clutch of law a usual can not say regret said mr gabriel boldly bad a be there be worse people in world mr marton tell sir be investigating robbery adopted son mr haverleigh be suspected be perfectly innocent mr gabriel money be said to have obtained from sale of cup be given to by sir frank hale sir frank denies so mr haverleigh say will see sir frank see what can make of must rather believe mr haverleigh than anyone else have absolutely open nature be fool if be what mean pardon think so man can be straightforward honourable a mr haverleigh be without being fool a yet have not investigated case a attention have be taken up with pratt in day so hope to go to work then be prepared to say that crime will not be brought home to nephew have suspicion not yet have not searched out evidence sufficiently mr jeal saw nephew pawn cup ah be mystery must fathom mr gabriel person resembling mr haverleigh pawned cup be sure be not nephew there be conspiracy against on whose part be not prepared to say yet will find out clear character punish who have be concerned in now mr gabriel must bid good day a time be fully occupied let however inform that there be need to excuse association with mr pratt quite understand how wriggled into acquaintance be in way to blame once more good day marton bowed out have seen enough of mr gabriel to note strong hatred bore towards leo wondered what must be reason also saw that for moment have flinched at mention of conspiracy set on alert a to whether detestation of nephew have carried so far a to plot against good name if there be anything matter hale be man to know murmured detective lent money now decline to acknowledge loan believe there be something bad at back of poor haverleigh seems to be most harmless of men yet be being ruined in underhand way well will settle pratt matter then clear name before marton must do providence took task out of hand for next ten day

picture be replaced in gallery of country house in one way by time nun house be denuded of what belonged to other people there remained very little furniture even choice article of furniture be found to be property of other people be really wonderful amount of stolen good that pratt have collected must have thieved for year to have got together such collection will start more burrow said marton when be at end never expected must find here therefore collected treasure life be not long enough to enable to bring together such collection of thing again besides have not same wide field for knavery police be one too many for now marton said to vicar who be deeply shocked to hear of wickedness of man from whom have accepted cup do think that sacred vessel be stolen also mr marton asked good man be perfectly sure of replied detective promptly have not got cup down on list one have come forward to claim have not be advertised mr marton pardon sir have be advertised by someone in place

daughter really know who can have inserted mr marton said seems to be carefully worded too reward of fifty pound have be offered dear have rival who be investigating case said marton with smile be description accurate vicar perfectly even inscription if will permit to take away mr marton will see if can discover who have put in be annoyed that thing must have be taken out of hand mr marton before leave let state to conviction that young friend leo haverleigh did not steal cup ah indeed mr tempest said marton eyeing old man keenly what have led to such happy conclusion have ground for save inward conviction there be story of mr jeal know mr tempest looked troubled most remarkable story said have heard of many case of accidental resemblance mr marton fear have be unjust to leo wish to withdraw charge may have made against heard defence saw face while be making unless face be not index of mind can not bring to believe that lied mr marton can not give reason be convinced that misjudged leo be prejudiced against by mr gabriel asked marton for leo have told suspicion on point mr tempest hesitated admit be said at length said something to be not at liberty to repeat doe make mr haverleigh out villain by mean said vicar hastily what told be sad not wicked more misfortune than fault can say more can keep paper mr marton thank sir good day good day vicar walked away leaving

gentleman gave address have posted letter at general post office so that even district where be hidden must not be traced letter a marton said afterwards be one of consummate impudence took time to read with patience a human document possessed certain value letter ran a follows marton swore a read dear marton so have let slip through finger again be not about time that stopped setting wit against mine several time have tried always have be beaten really must take lesson in art of thief catching if want to deserve reputation posse be bound to say that for fog must have be caught thanks

london in very comfortable circumstance if be clever enough to find think be promise to give up a soon a appear there be chance of seeing better remain in colester dear marton turn farmer be be fit for upon honour be one thing must like to know how devil did manage to find out retreat never thought have in went to see raston on business likely to enhance popularity in parish dropped across for first time in life be taken aback be design accident found there wish to compliment undeservedly well have driven away must find new place in to pas old age be too bad of marton on soul too bad be getting so popular in colester now suppose everyone of honest men be swearing at yet never robbed one other thing if came down to investigate robbery of cup presented to church can spare trouble stole went to heart to lose so valuable object be sorry when have given must not ask for back so resolved to steal went to church a be small man climbed in through leper window got cup climbed out again went back to house then be afraid lest cup must be seen by chance popularity must go therefore resolved to pawn be way have kept safe many piece of jewellery must not go sent adam be rather like leo haverleigh so that fool of mr jeal made mistake need not look for cup in battersea now a have redeemed took ticket from adam went be now in possession again intend to part with more know how fond be of beautiful thing dear marton well daresay guessed that stole cup here be confession can tell fool at colester including vicar leo haverleigh be perfectly innocent have not enough brain to steal

clever man dangerous to friend so with kind regard best wish until meet believe dear failure yours never in flesh richard pratt chapter xiv unexpected meeting have be much to blame said vicar set up a judge when have right to do so leo must forgive forgive freely replied young man grasping hand held out by mr tempest appearance be against so be little wonder that did not entirely trust still mr tempest must have known better than to think guilty of such crime know know have be wrong well let drop subject character be now clear have wish to recall very disagreeable past conversation took place in study of mr tempest in presence of sybil marton detective have shown vicar insolent welcome letter have received from pratt confession therein entirely exonerated leo must again hold up head mr tempest be quite reconciled sybil with hand in leo looked thoroughly happy never lost faith in leo said sooner later knew that must be well have to thank marton for clearing of character sybil faith be wrong there said marton smiling thought be innocent a have not looked into case saw mean of proving have not pratt sent confession must still be in dark be scoundrel be good friend to haverleigh agree with said tempest sharply for be still sore on subject of cup pratt knew that leo be suspected must have come forward long ere to put matter right ask too much from man of pratt nature said marton dryly be wonderful that must have confessed guilt even at eleventh hour however close case can go back to london know now who stole cup know also that can not be recovered pratt will stick to time be only vanity desire for popularity made give away in first instance if came back to must never accept said vicar emphatically stolen cup must never have be put to sacred us wonder at daring of man oh man like pratt be capable of anything said marton with shrug will never see again mr tempest now mr haverleigh think must see sir frank hale make confess that lent money there will be difficulty about replied leo hale told only two people that repudiated knowledge of loan one be aunt other myself be too cunning to tell world untruth told besides character being cleared can have further hold over fear will be angry be certain will let see together leo be quite willing to do so after taking fond leave of sybil cordial one of father set out with detective to bring sir frank hale to bearing on way marton asked leo permission to touch upon delicate subject haverleigh told to speak freely owe too much to take offence at anything may say observed have be very good friend marton oh be right replied detective brightly really deserve thanks help have given have be purely accidental if pratt have held tongue must still have be in same position a before be bound to say haverleigh even before arrival of letter mr tempest expressed belief in innocence be glad of said leo treated badly be pleasure to to hear that own good sense told be innocent before have actual proof be anxious to stand well with marton ah be matter wish to discus see that miss tempest be much attached to one do think vicar will consent to marriage really ca say even before scandal seemed to be displeased with kept away from house a much a possible did not want to see must not let see sybil have to meet by stealth now may have changed mind if have what then then can announce engagement to sybil said leo see be not in position to marry may not be for long time have to make way in world to make money also thought of enlisting for war of fighting way through rank to commission even then see how must marry might gain commission not money until worldly prospect be more secure think must engage to miss tempest be straight speaking marton gave permission to speak out like haverleigh after trouble have come through think must be rewarded by getting heart desire if love miss temple will not marry until can give comfortable home even if be successful in south africa baggage waggon be not place for delicate girl can offer nothing better than true enough admit that what say be correct what be to do well said detective after pause seems to that have claim upon aunt took charge of brought up understand intimated that must be heir received education to fit for position if intended to send adrift a have done must at least have have taught profession trade whereby must earn bread butter yes think have right to demand assistance from leo shook head flushed ca bring to do that said in low voice have insulted so deeply that go against nature to eat humble pie must rather make own way in world a to sybil will not ask to engage to until a say can offer home can hing enlist suppose soldiering be be fit for now that name have be cleared will bid farewell to sybil enlist straight away will wait for be certain get commission can perhaps see way to make wife if be shot well leo shrugged shoulder there be end to thing haverleigh said marton after pause will tell what reason aunt have for disliking so much know have always be stern hard with lately have openly hated be why left there be something connected with be wrong not to knowledge have be foolish not wilfully wicked know that mr gabriel know something may be about parent have prejudiced vicar against be influence that made turn against admitted a much to refused to say what have told guessed said leo quietly what can do insist upon knowing have be said have right to if vicar will not speak out have given word not to mr gabriel may be forced to do so be haverleigh must see insist upon explanation wo give must force out of said marton determinedly oh know be hard woman if persevere must give way leo thought for few moment well marton said at length will see vicar first speak to on subject of sybil from what say may see reason of attitude towards then can call upon mr gabriel may be sure will do best marton nodded said more for present a by time be at door of hale house demure servant opened door took in name shortly ushered into room where sir frank be seated in chair by window reading to sister edith hale looked pale ill lay on sofa started up blushed rosy red when saw leo there be doubt that poor girl be deeply in love with young man leo in kindness of heart felt pang seemed to that be treating cruelly although position be none of making good day said hale without rising including leo marton in one swift glance be surprised to see haverleigh thought did not care about keeping up acquaintance leo must have replied sharply a edith be present cast meaning glance in direction must like to speak with alone said be in presence of mr marton before hale must reply marton interposed wait bit said in smooth voice with glance at girl there be something to be said first in presence of miss hale in presence exclaimed turning red while brother scowled yes something will be pleased to hear know that mr haverleigh have be accused of stealing chapel cup never believed never cried edith eagerly leo gave look of gratitude made turn pale with emotion sir frank hale shrugged shoulder never thought much about subject said lie coming at once to practised lip evidence be against haverleigh admit tried to think best of speech be rather contradictory sir frank be dry response of marton think must have thought well of haverleigh must not have helped out of difficulty by lending money oh frank did do cried edith taking brother hand love for how good be hale face grew blacker blacker have be alone must have lied in presence of sister loved so deeply must not bring to deny truth moreover have kind of instinctive feeling that marton have come to proclaim innocence of leo else why must come at plot of getting leo into power have failed be clever enough to see so only remained for to retreat with a much dignity a possible be only too glad to help haverleigh said quietly with marked courtesy be in debt three hundred pound gave be of use believe beg that will say no more on subject how good be how good be gasped edith caressing brother leo marton glanced at one hale masterly retreat took by surprise when leo remembered conversation in chapel must hardly believe ear only thing to be done be to beat man with own weapon will say no more hale save when be able money will be repaid thank heartily for kindness sir frank bit lip summoned up sufficient dignity to be gracious leo be wearing mask for benefit of edith pay money when like said sitting up be shortly going abroad with sister think will see one for long time however solicitor at portfront will attend to matter of loan then there really be loan said marton determined to get plain truth out of hale in presence of witness certainly gave leo three hundred pound in gold have already said so be with loan paid debt pursued marion yes said leo seeing drift paid with money good people here declared that sold cup to pay how must how must muttered edith because be fool cried sir frank seeing that be completely beaten for part never believed that haverleigh did thing thank said leo inwardly smiling at lie then will be delighted to hear that thief have be found a marton spoke hale suddenly turned pale rose with effort thief have be found stammered yes replied marton with swift glance thinking at once of theory of conspiracy seems that man angel beg pardon know a pratt stole cup be mr pratt who gave cried edith quite so miss hale afterwards be sorry that generosity have led to make so great sacrifice therefore stole what have bestowed what about story of mr jeal asked hale trying to be amiable oh be part of business sir frank pratt thought cup must be seen here even if kept in house so sent up to london to be pawned for safe keeping understand why must be done then have never come into contact with man like pratt however for reason need not explain pawned cup servant adam be rather like mr haverleigh be thus that mr jeal not having clear view made mistake understand sir frank quite replied hale in strangled voice be pale anxious looking leo thought that be anger at escape marton took more serious view be sure be pleased that haverleigh character have be cleared be pleased very very pleased said edith joyfully so be frank be not frank yes very pleased hale forced to say so much then walked to door be not well said turning for moment will excuse gentleman sister will see out if paused darting look of hatred at leo left room haverleigh be more surprised than marton who have captured fresh idea be already building up theory leo remained only short time be most embarrassed by look of edith escaped a speedily a courtesy permitted when left house be distance on road marton spoke think there be insanity in family said why do think so girl be queer woman in sane sens must give away a doe brother be cripple queer too never marry into lot haverleigh have hereditary taint have intention of marrying anyone sybil said leo dryly did see how hale backed out of false position yes believe have more to do with matter than think must not be at surprised to find that mr gabriel for reason have be working together against oh there have be there may be yet conspiracy against can understand hale conspiring said leo want to marry sybil wish edith to become wife mr gabriel why must have yet to find out interrupted marton go see what vicar say must be alone for time want to think matter out at event hale have acknowledged that lent money in presence of witness be right in quarter daresay will make attempt to best though nonsense did not hear say that be going abroad with sister think will leave alone now perhaps replied marton thoughtfully will see will believe be going abroad when be across channel be off for long walk detective set off at brisk pace leo thought more about especial matter leaving entirely to marton forthwith returned to vicarage saw mr tempest then there asked if objected to a suitor for sybil at very direct question mr tempest wriggled looked uncomfortable put very painful question to leo said after pause be ashamed of for having thought so ill of must like to make amends if possible know that be attached to sybil now that be at variance with aunt see that be justified in asking to consent to engagement know what mean said leo proudly intend to engage until be in better position ask be that will not force sybil to marry hale when be away must not let marry hale in case cried vicar angrily must never give child to cripple moreover hale be not so sane a might be leo will not force sybil inclination in way can remain unmarried life if plea be want said leo gladly be going to enlist mr tempest if get commission there may be chance of asking sybil to be wife will be true to while be away know will humph said vicar doubtfully commission eh leo interpreted

husband for daughter mr gabriel have informed of something make unwilling to countenance marriage ask what be can not tell ask to tell mr tempest very night will ask mr gabriel what have be saying better not advised vicar will only cause much distress leo looked at in astonishment what must aunt have be saying about parent likely to make vicar take so strong view of matter if there be anything wrong have right to know said at length will insist upon explanation mr tempest if discover valid reason why must give sybil up be quite ready to yield when next see mr tempest will either have given up idea of marrying daughter will insist upon marrying in spite of mr gabriel can not say that be treating unfairly go now dear boy called out mr tempest much distressed spoke to empty air leo have already left room be out of gate after leaving nun house leo have taken up residence at colester arm marton be there also leo expected to see at dinner be anxious to tell what vicar have said

concerning stolen good in nun house be so great that there be ill deed with villager gentry of colester be not prepared to credit mr bathurst be particularly virulent in denunciation of rascal always knew that be bad lot said mr bathurst did not say be incredible that wealthy man must come down to pas day in dull place like colester how lucky be that found out wickedness thanks to dear mr marton who be be sure perfect gentleman in spite of being police officer will always look upon a having saved peggy creature so always called former favourite wanted to marry peggy saw in eye perhaps might have yielded then what must have happened must have have jack ripper in family oh scarcely a bad a mr bathurst said raston to whom be speaking pratt be never murderer how do know that mr raston for part believe be capable of most terrible crime if have married peggy very idea make shudder dear child have escaped snare of evil hope to see shortly wife of good man here mr bathurst cast look on

mr pratt have be likely to keep come father forgive let see lord kilspindie be filled with curiosity be wicked girl said vicar indulgently gave kiss if do again never will father unless leo be again in danger vicar sighed conscience pricked about leo did not know how to act towards making amendment certainly if gave consent to marriage leo must be more than repaid for ill thought entertained about tempest be filled with pride of race must not bring to give beautiful daughter to nameless man however must not consider matter now since illustrious visitor be waiting in drawing room so with sybil went to greet miss tempest said lord kilspindie coming forward with look of admiration at beautiful girl before sir sybil allowed father to speak a be right proper be vicar of place lord kilspindie said tempest politely be daughter be who put advertisement in paper presume that be to that owe pleasure of company nothing else said lord kilspindie taking seat pointed out to by vicar have be looking for cup for over twenty year be not in possession be for few week replied vicar who be very curious have better tell whole story then can judge for if will be so kind replied lord kilspindie courteously listened attentively while mr tempest narrated event in connection with cup from time pratt have arrived in colester story be strange one visitor be much interested however did not offer one interruption sybil watched meanwhile be tall grey haired man of over sixty still vigorous straight face be lined however a though have undergone much trouble have soldierly look about time vicar be speaking tugged at long grey moustache only hair wore on face sybil thought of line in ancient mariner about long lean brown a seashore sand must not quite recall quotation to described kilspindie perfectly be rather sad looking quiet grey eye looked a though have known bitter trouble indeed have sybil learned that later very interesting story said politely when mr tempest have finished disappointing in ending say man pratt have now cup in possession confessed a much lord in letter to detective in charge of case be pity have escaped with great pity responded other suppose there be chance of being captured from what mr marton said must think not put in sybil say that pratt have baffled cleverest detective in england for great number of year kilspindie sighed chance of getting back murmured luck will still be bad luck echoed sybil catching word will think superstitious said with smile fact be that cup be said to be fairy gift have be in family for generation luck of family go with cup like luck of edenhall said sybil remembering longfellow poem precisely responded kilspindie legend be curious one must tell to time of course opinion be that cup be of roman manufacture recognised from description especially from latin motto set down in advertisement think that goblet be dedicated to bacchus be probably lost by roman general when scotland be invaded by caesar time mr tempest be trying to recover from horror of thought pagan cup gasped stolen cup oh lord be used a communion cup pratt said that have brought from italy where be so used by romish church thought be sanctified by use did not hesitate to put again on altar really know what to say be like sacrilege be sorry mr tempest cup have be at kilspindie castle for five hundred year never be used in service of church over twenty year ago be stolen by woman by woman echoed sybil have quite expected to hear pratt name chapter xvii lord kilspindie explains before begin story lord said vicar will please inform how came to know of loss of cup have already done so mr tempest saw advertisement offering reward for recovery description quotation of latin motto be sufficient to show that be heirloom wrote to office of paper afterwards received letter from miss tempest here asking to call have taken up abode at inn a may stay here for few day want to know can about matter if can only trace recover cup through agency will be eternally debtor can not tell more than have related replied vicar man pratt took back cup be now in london where one know fear cup be a lost a though have be swallowed up by ocean be enough that know in whose possession be said kilspindie with determination in way will find man for may tell mr tempest besides recovery of family treasure have more important object in view recovery of son who be stolen from at time cup disappeared tempest expressed much astonishment at information sybil opened eye wide have never thought that attempt to clear character of lover must lead to result father knew what to say seeing silent lord kilspindie continued to speak how cup came into possession of man can not say be taken from castle by nurse called janet grant who also carried away child why did do asked sybil horrified out of revenge for fancied slight received from wife replied kilspindie with sigh be best must tell from beginning first must know legend of cup that may understand value grant attach to possession be fond of folk lore murmured vicar settling down for pleasant half hour family name be grant then lord yes title be kilspindie earldom son who be stolen only son only child ala be lord morven if be still alive who know if will ever see again hope for best said vicar gently god be over be right mr tempest how many weary year have waited have have to comfort in fashion now when have lost hope advertisement roused again if find cup may discover boy at event may find out if be alive dead be sure be alive said sybil impulsively dear lord kilspindie if there be chance of finding must not have be guided to put in advertisement be entirely own doing have consulted with father must never have appeared certainly must not said vicar promptly have placed matter in hand of mr marton be angry when saw advertisement very angry indeed must not be angry more mr tempest said kilspindie with smile seeing that may lead to discovery of son owe much to miss tempest indiscretion a doubt call said sybil resolutely be sure papa doe not call did to help leo must do again tell legend lord kilspindie old man laughed if have not imagination of celt will think poor thing said in day of bruce on border nigel grant head of clan ancestor mr tempest be riding home from foray against english have be successful have collected large mob of cattle be being driven to castle by follower be anxious to get home for when have left two week previously wife be expected to give birth to child chief eagerly desired that might be boy for have few relative have be bitterest enemy what said tempest scotch so clannish be more clannish in highland than on border replied old lord many of border family fought with one clan did also for many long day although be friendly enough now however know reason nigel grant be so eager for heir must girl have done asked sybil mischievously by mean chief wanted brave boy to bestride horse wield sword govern unruly grant clan with strong hand have prayed to virgin to give heart desire be roman catholic in day remember so may guess rode home at top speed a neared castle be far in advance of follower alone then came fairy fairy echoed sybil be interesting laughed call good neighbour in scotland know because fairy like to be talked about with disrespect to go on with story nigel grant be on wide moor alone although lance of men at arm glittered on verge of horizon suddenly from viewless air apparently since there be rock tree shelter of kind there appeared small woman dressed in green with golden crown at sight of chief horse stopped at once a though stricken into stone fairy queen for be same suppose who appeared to thomas rhymer ah be mounted on horse said sybil half to herself indeed well queen be on foot in arm carried child stopping before nigel placed child on saddle bow told to take home for year day return to safe sound ' continued good fortune will befall grant if anything wrong be done to then will sorrow come ' so speaking vanished horse suddenly regaining motion galloped home to castle bearing amazed chief with child in arm child lord asked vicar smiling have to be child for year day found that during absence wife have given birth to fine boy that day so after be born cradle be found empty lady grant be in great state of terror a may imagine when chief told story declared that child have be carried off by good neighbour be wish to kill changeling chief mindful of prophecy must not permit be supposed that fairy child required to be nursed by mortal woman be why chief boy have be carried away never heard version of old story before said tempest be usually said that fairy want child for in story what have told be believed lady grant hoping to get back own child in year day nursed changeling be peevish cross whimpering creature marvellously ugly when fed with milk grew fat strong became good tempered on night when year day be up there be heard sound of galloping horse round castle wind swept into room down corridor everyone in castle fell into magic sleep in morning true child be found smiling in cradle fairy changeling be gone in cradle also be cup be seeking scroll saying that while be kept in family ill must befall that if lost line must be in danger of extinction did prophecy ever come true asked sybil twice replied kilspindie with most profound conviction in reign of first james of scotland cup be stolen three brother of chief be slain in battle only child of one of lived for chief have family then cup be brought back must tell how

cup taken family be killed nurse managed to save one child with whom fled after series of adventure cup be restored child regained inheritance how strange said sybil now that cup be lost again kilspindie smiled well see miss tempest have one son be lost if find title estate must go to distant cousin prophecy of fairy will be fulfilled be why be so anxious to get cup if can find bring back to kilspindie castle be certain that will find boy wild story said vicar after pause there be oftentimes grain of truth in folktale tell how came that cup be stolen third time be about to tell replied

one of worst temper in world also be evil in disposition have known then what be told to afterwards by other servant must never have re entered service be afraid of janet wicked way therefore remained silent when be duty to speak out when boy be two year of age may be trifle over head nurse died janet expected to succeed wife appointed woman did not trust janet hinted vicar by time janet be not so careful in behaviour wife began to suspect true character janet be very angry at slight a called swore must be revenged of course knew legend of cup so struck doubt that if stole cup usual disaster

kilspindie stopped shook head what happened after asked sybil curiously there be more to tell miss tempest woman vanished utterly with child cup wife poor soul died of grief employed manner of mean to

something will astonish speak in confidence raston anything tell will be sacred replied curate with dignity leo nodded quite satisfied with assurance then related have taken place in castle on night when have discovered mr gabriel pratt in company raston fairly gasped with surprise a recital proceeded when leo confessed that pratt claimed a son sprang from seat believe word of cried bringing fist down on table man be vile liar whomsoever may be leo be certainly not son of wretch can bad tree bear good fruit can give proof have not done so yet let speak to leo may be able to get more out of than be friend know that so if will place matter in hand promise to find out truth somehow well said leo with hesitation rather thought of coming with to london pratt expects have not written to

have held by in time of trouble besides quite approve of wish to introduce to lord kilspindie if oh raston stopped short what be matter raston suppose must be long lost son of lord kilspindie

smile saw before singularly splendid young man with graceful slender figure handsome face best of be kindly look in eye kilspindie shook hand heartily with leo sighed a thought that lost son might be just such have known of what raston young man before have talked about on previous night might have be more particular in inquiry might perchance have be brought to think a raston did however knew nothing leo said nothing conversation resolved into common place tempest be kind to leo kilspindie be friendly three got on very well meanwhile sybil pearl be walking across moor after time stopped at turf altar erected by mad girl explained to companion reason have made place master be angry with poor pearl now said sadly have taken sacred cup from be not good enough to keep when master be pleased

pearl be sure be roof here to stop cup from floating up to new jerusalem in chapel must have stayed because bad roof kept down here went up up up to sky sybil did not know what to make of talk soothed girl a much a must tried to bring back to old happy state of mind mr jeal have destroyed with gloomy calvinistic creed be of use only restoration of cup must make pearl believe that be good again however sybil induced to talk of other thing of bird flower poor creature be in quieter state of mind when sybil brought back to cottage go morning to altar said pearl a went inside cup will come back when master be sorry for pearl at moment mr jeal pulled into house scolded for being away when saw sybil became more civil still behaved in covertly insolent manner sybil grew angry have behaved very wickedly in putting idea into pearl head mr jeal said severely poor creature be not responsible doe not understand understands more than give credit for miss retorted mr jeal coolly be not fit to be left alone when go away will put in asylum indeed will hing of sort cried miss tempest indignantly poor thing must die liberty be in to when be going away go with sir frank hale miss be going to be

asked about lord kilspindie why seemed afraid to meet have be clever enough might have guessed truth a be matter passed out of mind after there be very pleasant evening at vicarage leo felt almost happy in spite of trouble must not a yet bring to tell sybil that must never marry besides be hoping against hope that raston must bring back good news from london not indeed that leo haverleigh be lost son of lord kilspindie that such good fortune must be never entered leo head that pratt be not father leo felt that must rather be proved to be illegitimate a mr gabriel have told vicar be than have such father a criminal pratt yet at time felt sorry for man be certain that have in good quality whenever leo thought of a father became enraged against thing be too horrible lord kilspindie took wonderfully to leo vicar be pleased to see owing to leo want of honest name must not bring to consent to marriage so hoped that scotch lord might take fancy to young man carry off thus sybil must be safe leo must be provided for mr tempest have evidently forgotten own youth must have remembered that loving heart be not so easily severed leo sybil loved one too well for aught to come between on saturday night raston returned be so late that leo have not expected so did not meet until next morning then be on way to church well leo asked eagerly what doe what doe pratt say will tell after service said raston hastily at present ca think of thing one word raston urged leo be pratt father replied curate emphatically be not before leo must ask question ran off filled with joy at intelligence much bewildered leo went to church to offer up thanks kilspindie be also in church with sybil in vicar pew mr tempest allowed raston to preach a have be arranged took very minor part in service indeed did little else read lesson church be filled a everyone be anxious to see lord kilspindie mr bathurst be there wondering if lordship must be induced to marry peggy quite forgot that have promised daughter hand to curate be already scheming to get at old nobleman that be old did not matter to mr bathurst must have sold daughter to anyone provided match be good one curious to say must have considered that have done duty a mother moral nature be decidedly warped service be almost over church warden be handing round bag for collection when sweet voice be heard singing in distance everyone recognised voice be pearl vicar kneeling at communion table looked rather disturbed knew eccentric way of girl feared lest might come in distract attention of congregation fear be fulfilled pearl still singing entered church scandalised church warden must have kept out that bore something made open eye congregation also became aware of pearl burden gasp of astonishment went round still singing wild vague melody mad girl walked slowly up aisle bearing sacred cup lord kilspindie did not see until be almost at chancel step then gave cry of astonishment in spite of building occasion surely might have be pardoned for fairy cup upon depended fortune of grant glittered before eye there be dead silence everyone be too astonished to speak move vicar be staring from communion table at miracle raston who have come down to receive collection stood quietly waiting till girl reached came up singing placed great gold cup in hand fell on knee master have forgiven pearl said in voice must be heard over church be saved cup will be here to watch over for ever ever amen amen bowed face in hand raston paused for moment in hesitation glanced at vicar then at lord kilspindie then made up mind walking up to altar placed cup in old position there glittered gold gem with sunlight striking down on until became almost too glorious to look upon lord kilspindie stared with tear in eye cup must be again must soon have son never doubted that restoration of one be prelude to discovery of other raston pronounced benediction organ broke forth into jubilant music shortly congregation streamed out everyone be much excited old nobleman came out with sybil waited at porch for vicar leo also be with suddenly woman broke through crowd in churchyard be mr jeal be seeking pearl in haste never noticed lord kilspindie until almost ran into arm suddenly saw face started made one stride forward to clutch by arm cup then heir said loudly while looked on amazed janet grant where be son lord morven chapter xix story of past half hour later lord kilspindie be back in vicarage library with janet grant a may be more convenient to call mr jeal mr tempest be present together with leo mr raston have assembled to force truth out of mr jeal be easy matter evil in woman be uppermost with shawl wrapped round tightly sat there defied may burn may put in prison said mr jeal savagely wo open mouth will have arrested unless tell truth said lord kilspindie arrest then snarled mr jeal there be policeman handy lord why be behaving like woman asked vicar sternly why retorted violently because be badly treated by lord there served faithfully for many year yet in place of giving position to be entitled set woman woman hated over head paid out said revengefully oh many sad hour have have lord many more will have know where son be wo tell have got back cup son lord morven sneered will remain in humble position in have placed something be gained said kilspindie have revealed that son be alive well will get rest out of never mr jeal shut mouth with snap shook will not speak word what wicked woman be said vicar sadly mr jeal eye flashed wicked glance at true to determination held peace seemed impossible to do anything with so pronounced vixen hitherto raston have be silent now came forward be able to deal with matter said quietly have way of making woman speak mr jeal shook head glared vicar kilspindie looked at curate so did leo be beginning to have faint hope that scene must end in discovery that be rightful son of lord kilspindie with anxious face sat in corner drank in eagerly word fell from raston lip mr jeal maintained self imposed silence mr tempest said raston when asked if might go to london did not tell errand tell to now be to see man known a pratt what exclaimed vicar saw that man two day ago wrote asking to see hinting that have something to tell about cup stole said kilspindie lord pratt did not steal cup took blame upon so a to clear name of friend haverleigh old men looked at leo who winced be sure of asked vicar pratt wrote to marton remember to take blame upon quite so be not guilty for that record be so black when marton unmasked that thought crime more le must not matter why must shield haverleigh asked mr tempest leo started forward saw that time have come for to speak out can answer that said pratt told that be son tempest uttered exclamation must be mistaken said mr gabriel informed that be illegitimate must not have made difference said leo bitterly might a well be illegitimate son of pratt a of anyone else a matter of fact however told that be born in wedlock wife mother died placed with mr gabriel to bring up believed be nameless orphan what told mr tempest be true so far a knew telling be none le spiteful however be that made unwilling must marry sybil yes said vicar with flush did not like to think that daughter of mine must marry nameless man visit sin of parent on head of innocent offspring said leo have not treated well mr tempest thought guilty of theft scorned because be nameless be conduct of minister of gospel grey head of vicar drooped admit have be wrong leo said in faltering tone have vindicated character ask pardon more said when leo grasped hand even although there be stain on birth said leo want to bind to anything wait till mystery be cleared up at present so far a know be son of criminal if be true must refuse to marry sybil here mr jeal burst out into taunting laugh lord kilspindie frowned upon took leo disengaged hand vicar held other be good man haverleigh said lordship far from suspecting truth wish have for son mr jeal laughed again when quiet be restored raston went on with story first said must tell how recovered cup went up met pratt a promised not to deliver into hand of law much a deserved punishment spoke to freely be with three hour know if be right in letting dangerous criminal escape said curate looking round if have given information to police must never have heard truth about leo must have secured cup then be not son cried leo eagerly pratt gave word for who be will hear presently here raston gave glance at mr jeal who be moving hand restlessly seemed to be ill at ease meantime must go on with story of cup seemed that pratt knew pawnbroker penny having learnt from mr jeal story that have cup went to get back to learn who have pawned who did asked vicar sharply raston gave answer least expected mr jeal pawned said woman sprang to foot found tongue be lie shouted furious with rage then made rush for door lord kilspindie put hand on shoulder forced back into chair be beginning to suspect truth said sternly sit still will have punished scowled relapsed into dogged silence raston went on to tell how cup have be stolen seems that when pearl darry be ill said woman watched by bed poor mad creature be delirious raved about cup mr jeal persuaded that must be eternally punished what for heaven only know be child of sin groaned mr jeal be a pure good a angel cried curate frowning be who be evil doer mr jeal well mr tempest girl thought in half delirious state that must test goodness of god proposed to take cup out of chapel place on altar of turf have prepared on moor be idea that if god wished to save must take cup up to heaven then replace at later date on altar therefore while mr jeal be absent dressed herself ran out of house went to house of old barker sexton door be not locked told lie about to save knew where key of church hung be in hand in moment went to church sometime about ten o'clock entered took cup then replaced key on nail after relocking door one moment interrupted mr tempest scratch on leper window thought if remember that robber have entered that way shrewdly suspect that old barker made scratch to save own skin said raston have better ask may here be mentioned that vicar did learned that what raston said be true old sexton finding cup gone feared lest might be accused of robbery so conceived idea of making mark a though someone have entered at window fat body must not possibly have squeezed through be clever idea misled old barker be punished by being sent to portfront after have confessed be when pearl left barker cottage with cup mr jeal met went on curate have missed out of bed thinking that mad girl have gone to chapel followed met at door of cottage saw that have cup be then that idea came into wicked head to steal cup be lie cried mr jeal again be what told old penny anyhow a be prepared to swear in court said curate coolly must not give what asked for cup until told where got for wonder told truth yes mr jeal followed pearl on to moor saw set cup on turf altar waiting till got back to cottage took cup concealed under shawl took home found girl back again in bed very ill from effect of exposure for time nursed while hue cry be being made about cup then made excuse that father be ill went to london have father mr jeal old penny in answer to letter of yours sent wire told have something for so aided with plot took cup to london pawned to old penny after telling story got five hundred pound for did not did not mr jeal tried again to rise again have to remain lord kilspindie kept heavy grip on shoulder in rage at duplicity must have slain spared for moment that might learn truth after many year of darkness dawn be breaking mr jeal saw that end be in sight began to sob then continued raston banked money came down to tell wicked lie about leo haverleigh know that be never near place that be innocent that be guilty however pratt got out of old penny then gave five hundred pound for cup took to own place when be with handed to come said kilspindie there be good in man have to make reparation to lord said raston solemnly for be woman husband be by direction that son be stolen yes here curate pointed to leo there be son leo rose slowly a pale a corpse have expected yet when came thing be too much for must only look at newly found father in silence lord kilspindie gasped too turned pale then made one stride forward grasping leo hand stared into face yes muttered believe have turned on mr jeal woman be true demanded mr jeal with cruel smile on fat puffy face still sat silent must strangle muttered lord kilspindie exasperated by obstinacy can make speak said raston taking envelope out of pocket here be mean of doing so still holding leo hand lord kilspindie looked at curate mr jeal remained quiet contemptuous smile on lip eye on floor tempest much interested in strange scene sat waiting for end must seem that result be in raston hand after have received cup have heard story curate continued began to question pratt about leo at portfront leo have already told of claim pratt have made to being father did not believe for know haverleigh upright nature must not think that be child of such bad man at first pratt insisted that be father then appealed to better instinct told how leo have made up mind to give up miss tempest rather than make wife of man with such antecedent a think pratt really love leo for after time yielded to entreaty told truth be sure like said haverleigh quietly be always very kind to bad a be at least have reason to complain of treatment what did say asked lord kilspindie anxiously will leave mr jeal to tell can repeat to story pratt told will not say word muttered woman resolutely can compel replied raston sternly try be mr jeal disdainful retort curate turned towards kilspindie pratt story have great deal to do with wife lord on several point referred to told that must never speak for well know how obstinate be pratt then agreed to help 'for leo sake ' said wrote out something placed what have written in envelope did not see what be know now envelope be sealed a see now added curate looking at mr jeal who be beginning to show sign of uneasiness if tell story of how stole child prove mr haverleigh be really lord morven will hand letter to with seal unbroken if refuse will open envelope now act on content pratt assured that what be contained herein must cost much more than liberty three men looked at woman face be livid perspiration beaded forehead twice tried to speak

give letter yes with seal unbroken know what iniquity have be guilty of be willing not to know so long a inform of minor fault have promise to give letter a be asked mr jeal yes said raston other

hand there be silence for few moment be thankful to god that have spared to see son again said kilspindie solemnly vicar added solemn amen thank god have father unsullied name said leo almost too moved to speak be emotion unmanly on part of father son least sentimental person must grant much kilspindie remained seated in chair holding hand of newly recovered son men fixed eye on mr jeal who in
