chapter extraordinary crime frank darrel be young man of twenty five with sufficiency of good look comfortable income of five hundred year also by way of employing spare time be realistic novelist of particularly new school founded on axiom fact invariably poaches on domain of fiction neither conceived adopted set down actual detail of life around with so rigid adherence to truth that published work read like police report re written in decent english in word held mirror up to nature presented reflection beautiful ugly to criticism of british public to preach thoroughly gospel of art a conceived darrel lived in london that microcosm of life in phase good bad indifferent usually worked in morning slept in afternoon amused in evening devoted night from twelve to five to exploring deep of metropolitan ocean in disguise of decent poverty more threadbare than ragged enthusiast must exploit dark corner of strand penetrate into whitechapel slum explore least known recess of city on occasion must view west end civilised vice by gaslight make expedition into suburb of known respectability when weary of observing middle class virtue must haunt le reputable district in search of character adventure gleanings be then transmuted into vigorous prose figured under picturesque title a novel of fact improved into fiction method of shifting commonplace into romance be adopted by one honor de balzac with result known to intellectual world darrel with le genius than persevering observation be disciple of great man one evening late in summer of last year darrel disguised a respectable mechanic found observing humanity within narrow limit of drury lane hour of midnight have just boomed in twelve stroke from tower of near church ragged hoarse voiced crowd be beginning to thin into scattered group vendor of various ware have extinguished flaring light have wheeled home barrow playgoer chattering about evening pleasure be disappearing into side street shop be being closed hotel keeper be driving forth late customer more le intoxicated whole machinery of quarter civilisation be running down rapidly to stop altogether somewhere about small hour of morning frank with short pipe in mouth keen eye in head stood observingly at corner took note of slackening be at moment that attention be attracted to red headed man individual be tall stout be dressed in seedy suit of greasy broadcloth hair beard be violent red seemed restless ill at ease passed re passed young darrel looked into window of still open shop glanced at near policeman with obvious nervousness conducted so uncomfortably that novelist began to watch that fellow want to do something thought ca make up mind to take first step will bet criminal matter occupies thought will keep eye on shortly red headed man walked past frank with resolute air disappeared down dark lane to left darrel after hesitation be about to follow when creature returned again began restless wandering in more populated lane once twice paused near policeman a though wishing to ask question once twice heart so failed that turned away with look of anxiety then caught sight of darrel advanced directly towards again flinched wilted away at once interested puzzled frank turned to observe shop window in meantime watched red headed man out of corner of eye appearance behaviour promised adventure for third time vacillating individual stepped up to policeman almost opened mouth to speak before must utter word shrank away placed at shop window next to frank young man apparently indifferent out of diplomacy became aware that be being scrutinised judged that man be debating advisability of speaking to next moment judgment proved correct beg pardon whispered red haired man in husky tone must tell whereabouts of mortality lane be close at hand replied frank readily will take there if like thank said other hurriedly just tell where ca explain answered darrel cutting short must not be able to find in network of street if trust ask policeman to guide man winced drew quick breath then looked again at frank be educated man said gentleman might say same of rejoined darrel who have noted refined accent of man be neither here there mortality lane be to left good night sir stay stay cried red headed man a darrel moved away trust please guide to place ever sparing of word frank nodded turned down side street followed by companion who walked beside in cat like way in narrow street there be scant light a gas lamp be few far between still luminosity of summer night revealed to darrel that companion kept at respectful distance have right hand in breast of seedy coat evidently be nervous of guide feared sudden assault in dark corner from obvious fear darrel concluded that companion be not criminal moreover carried valuable about dreaded might be stolen on further reflection novelist decided that red headed man be disguised gentleman who be venturing into strange place stranger company on disreputable errand darrel wondered what purpose might be did not think advisable to ask question a mentally admitted have right to do so two men walked onward in silence one little in advance of other turning down one street crossing second walking up third at length emerged into small open space in stood three four wheeled cab opposite first of on further side of square a might be called there be narrow alley to darrel pointed yonder be mortality lane said be not very safe place for single person if like will go down interrupted red headed man eagerly have shewn where be be wish to know be not going down lane asked darrel in surprise on contrary be going home replied man then adding in abrupt tone good night walked towards first cab spoke few word to driver darrel saw that gave cabman money then disappeared into cab closing door after for two three minute driver occupied in taking blanket off horse adjusting harness then mounted box drove off slowly in direction of strand at once wild desire came on darrel to ascertain reason of red headed man strange behaviour almost without thinking crossed over to second cab opened door follow that first cab said to driver will give sovereign hullo replied man noting suspiciously dress of fare wot yer little game police business worth sovereign be darrel diplomatic reply blimme be right sir said driver accepting explanation with alacrity jump in will ketch up keb in two shake confident that driver must earn money darrel lay back on cushion wondered what must be outcome of pursuit that red headed man must have turned away at very goal towards have requested guidance be most extraordinary if have special business in mortality lane why have inquired for if have reason for going reason be innocent one why did not ask policeman in drury lane instead of applying to complete stranger frank ever on alert for romance asked question must find answer to however hoped to gratify curiosity when caught up with stranger who be cause of provided stranger be willing to afford explanation cab presumably following other vehicle drove down bell street turned into strand now almost emptied of traffic rolled along thoroughfare a far a trafalgar square then turned down northumberland avenue passed along embankment up arundel street into strand again darrel be greatly puzzled by circular route more so when found cab driving up drury lane then sudden thought struck red headed man fancied be watching said to drove away to get rid of must not be surprised if first cab with inside return to entrance to mortality lane proved to be case for following almost same route a have conducted stranger first four wheeler drove into little square took up old station at mouth of lane by time third cab left behind have disappeared 'ere y'be sir said darrel driver opening door have come back 'ome ' never stopped whole bloomin time car mek out wot 'enry fare bin arter frank a puzzled a cabman jumped out walking to first vehicle looked inside to surprise red headed man have vanished wot wrong with moy keb mister said gruff voice of driver man man with red hair inquired amazed darrel oh ' e right y fret about 'im wot y ' poll pryin 'ere for eh y best taike care remarked other cabman sauntering up gent to do with perlice insolence of henry gave place at once to respect did know be 'tec sir might cove with carrot be wanted might be said darrel not thinking wise to disclaim profession attributed to by two cabman when did get out well y ' see sir be never in so to speak what do mean 't be way sir carrot cove come 'ere ' sez ' man sir `` e follerin ' will give y ' five bob to let pas through yer keb down thet there lane then ' sez 'jes ' drive orf drive back ' y ' can pick up taike 'ome ' so while be talking blannkit orf whip in at one door out of t'other down thet lane like mad drive orf ' larfs when see be follerin ' so 'ere be back agin t pick 'im up see bloomin cove concluded henry with glance round be with great amazement darrel listened to story of cabman strange indeed must have be errand of red haired man to mortality lane when be so suspicious of stranger took such elaborate precaution against discovery word discovery sooner flashed into darrel brain than repeated aloud discovery of what with perhaps unpardonable curiosity frank made up mind to acquaint with reason of man strange conduct well said in reply to henry will wait here with until man reappears y will wait by then said henry getting on box be past one o'clock ' fare fare ai goin to stay night when drove off darrel be left alone with other cabman turned towards in perplexity be going too asked yes sir moy missus will be expecting replied man added taking down one of cab lamp if y think gent in lane will go down with yer look up then can drive y ' t bow street with great alacrity frank assented to went down middle of lane a gas lamp be few cabman flashed light carried from right to left mortality lane be not very long be soon close to end where open into lincoln inn field here cabman uttered oath a stumbled over body darrel looked in circle of light cast by carriage candle beheld red haired man stone dead with ugly wound over heart chapter ii blonde lady on monday morning darrel lingered over breakfast considering woful issue of saturday night adventure alarm having be given by bike cabman police have taken charge of body of case have requested darrel to hold in readiness to be called a witness novelist although willing to give evidence wished to take more active part in matter desired to learn motive for crime to discover criminal ascertain by what mean murdered man have be lured to death in mortality lane in word darrel wanted to change from spectator into actor to turn detective for unriddling of extraordinary enigma to experience a conceived must be liberal education in literary work while thus meditating card be brought to inscribed rather abruptly with curt name torry who might be darrel must not guess owner of baronial appellation seemed to think that be sufficient to introduce a one not unknown to renown somewhat amused by hinted vanity darrel gave order that visitor must be admitted speedily found face to face with short little man smiling voluble mr torry be extremely stout with plump red cheeked face clean shaven very white teeth fringe of scanty brown hair encircling polished bald head at first sight looked kindly frivolous creature closer inspection shewed that eye contradicted opinion be of greyish blue keen penetrating changed colour in accordance with emotion in owner mind man with such eye must not be fool with characteristic caution darrel held peace until visitor must explain business be done in moment have called said mr torry taking chair uninvited to see about mortality lane affair from scotland yard from new scotland yard to be precise be torry detective case spoke of have be placed in hand for elucidation be very glad to see mr torry cried darrel eagerly evidence can give be at disposal have favour to ask of favour cried mr torry in turn granted love doing favour then do one said frank let assist in conduct of case mr torry eye flashed like steel mouth shut with snap on curt query why well said darrel slowly see be novelist who try to set forth thing a be for benefit of b p have written one two detective novel have explained mystery of diver crime simply because in first instance invented crime to parody gilbert song made crime fit discovery so to speak built up house of card to be knocked down in final chapter now here mr torry pursued young man with uplifted finger here be crime in actual life of chance own making not having conceived can not elucidate therefore wish to set wit to work in order to learn if will serve a well in fact a have done in fiction desire to take active part in working out of real problem to see if literary method of detective analysis be correct on ground purely selfish one fear ask to let assist mr torry who have listened to long speech with head on one side like elderly bird nodded at conclusion need not take time to consider request said briskly will be right hand if will more gravely on one condition be that let guide in way that take step without consulting surely be only too glad to bow to experience judgment then that settle be partner hand mr darrel novelist detective shook hand on agreement after coming to conclusion settled to discus important matter have brought together task be to find out who killed red haired man suppose said darrel slowly well not exactly sir see know who killed replied detective nodding frank jumped to foot know who killed cried in amazement yes lady with fair hair be sure going by circumstantial evidence be be sure how do know be arrested question poured out of darrel mouth until torry stopped with gesture be beyond power of law said be dead dead cried darrel recoiling murdered crime precisely committed within hour of other red hair be murdered presumably between hour of twelve one o'clock fair hair be stabbed between one two also presumably seems presumption mr torry naturally replied detective must continue so until post mortem examination take place to morrow at three where be woman body found on embankment to be precise added torry using favourite phrase corpse be discovered on step of cleopatra needle leading down to water oh said darrel thoughtfully then presumption be that assassin tried to throw body of victim into river think so probably be interrupted while dragging down step be forced to fly who found body tramp who went to wash hand in river at six o'clock in morning be busy examining clothes of red haired man when heard of new murder learning that be woman hurried off to view body have particular reason for haste asked frank have theory rejoined torry reflectively rather far fetched to be sure still feasible theory see here from breast detective produced narrow strip of black lace much torn threw on white cloth of breakfast table darrel looked at casually then glanced inquiringly at torry lace explained torry be in left hand of red haired man therefore judged that when stabbed by assassin put out hand to ward off blow mechanically clutched at garment of assailant now men wear lace so naturally concluded that person who killed be woman follow darrel nodded yes theory be natural one how did connect one woman with other well said torry smoothing bald head in puzzled manner have there for exactly know how can explain idea be flash of genius suppose thought peculiar that man must have be murdered by woman then on same night that woman must have be killed also man be stabbed to heart woman be stabbed to heart first be killed in mortality lane second on embankment very great distance away fact made fancy that one crime might be outcome of other wonder at fancy said darrel with coincidence same thought must have occurred to so went to look at woman body yes found lace on mantle similar to also yard torn off front there be about yard there said torry pointing to lace on table in fact have doubt that woman murdered man seems like assented darrel who murdered woman ah be problem have to solve mr darrel there be mark on woman linen letter in pocket name on handkerchief seems to have be well to do woman in easy circumstance a clothes be of good material well made how to establish identity really know there there be absolutely point whence one can start why not start from red headed man suggested frank why said torry pinching chin between thumb forefinger might do that if have not be disguised disguised yes red hair be wig red beard be false deceased be gentleman of age nearer sixty than fifty have plump face bald head with fringe of white hair something like said mr torry in parenthesis only hair be brown man be clean shaven have several teeth stopped with gold think be rather be gentleman be sure of hand foot be carefully attended to linen be beyond reproach have linen be there mark on there be changed outward garment not linen sock show that be amateur in disguising man who be in habit of masquerading for evil purpose must have changed from top to toe poor creature not expecting to be murdered never thought be necessary to change anything outward aspect be there name on shirt then there be initial on shirt undershirt pant on sock be two letter ' initial of name must think so replied torry underclothes be in good taste of expensive quality judge to be rich man speak of in present instead of past said darrel grimly be not man now thing well mr torry ca trace identity by initial doubtless especially a name of firm who made shirt be stamped on neck of harcot harcot of bond street oh think there will be difficulty in identifying man will be more difficult to discover name of woman think so argued darrel one crime includes other find out motive of woman in killing man will doubtless be led to discover reason be killed must begin from clue of initial perhaps will said torry thoughtfully failing that clue will try other other what other why said detective looking directly at companion clue of blue mummy chapter iii mr torry theory blue mummy repeated darrel wonderingly what do mean why said detective must rather say clue of two blue mummy here be out of pocket torry produced two little clay image in shape of mummy six inch in length coloured deep blue lifeless face swathing bandage of rigid form be perfectly modelled in clay on breast of be representation of sun rayed round with spiral flame idol a doubtless be appeared to be of great antiquity be undoubtedly fine specimen of ceramic art that relic of dead gone civilisation must be connected with modern criminal case amazed frank not little egyptian workmanship without doubt said examining one of little figure although be not learned in such matter where did get one be found in pocket of dead woman other on ground near body of man proof to mind that there be connection between two crime curious murmured darrel eye fixed on one of image wonder what symbolise if must learn might discover motive for double crime know meaning of idol suppose sir darrel shook head said be acquainted with egyptologist who might tell about will take to if like mr torry take one a be precisely same replied prudent detective ask friend what represents god doubt look here mr darrel added torry in livelier tone have answered question now must reply to of mine willingly what be wish to know tell took place from time saw red headed man in drury lane until moment discovered dead body to natural request darrel assented at once narrated saturday night rather sunday morning adventure in drury lane detective listened in silence keen eye fixed on narrator when darrel ceased put series of question to noting reply to same in little book may be here remarked that mr torry used cypher known to one so even if lost pocket book there be chance of content becoming known say that man spoke like educated gentleman certainly accent be most refined at what time did address first shortly after twelve o'clock how long did take to walk to mortality lane ten minute more le must think altogether be twenty minute past midnight when left drive to throw off scent took time suppose darrel calculated about forty minute more le said got back to mortality lane shortly after clock struck one then have talk with cabman who have misled according to instruction remember saying be going home because be after one o'clock then murder must have be committed between half past twelve one o'clock in morning yes be sure be bike found corpse shortly after one o'clock be still warm said darrel with shudder red haired man be not at ease with suppose on contrary kept safe distance between time have right hand in breast of coat oh be revolver said torry indifferently found when body be searched added detective with emphasis did not find valuable carried valuable what valuable ca say paper jewel money one of three be certain what reason have to think that carried valuable asked darrel becoming questioner in turn torry shrugged plump shoulder must have carried revolver else remarked that might have be to protect against bad character such a suspected to be objected frank captiously replied torry decisively think so purposely assumed shabby clothes so that there must be nothing in appearance to suggest that be worth robbing threadbare vagrant slinking through midnight street must attract notice save that of policeman must not dare to use revolver in case why not asked darrel rather obtusely because must have run risk of arrest real name obviously be anxious to conceal must have come out mr darrel dead man have valuable object perhaps money in possession carried revolver to protect against possible robbery supposition concluded detective rubbing plump knee brings to theory to theory torry pointed to image held by darrel to be precise must say to clue clue of blue mummy quite see how bring into matter well said torry be theory admit belief be red haired man carried valuable money jewel paper to woman in mortality lane when delivered up jewel for sake of clearness will say jewel gave blue mummy why a kind of receipt suppose red hair took image in right hand intending to put into pocket at moment having jewel in possession woman struck at with knife carried thrusting out left hand to protect caught at tore lace of mantle naturally a have received death wound be stabbed to heart know blue mummy fell from clasp be found on ground near body very ingenious admitted darrel sceptically pure theory doubt detective must theorise to extent in order to have basis to work on must admit that theory be feasible one certainly a regard second blue mummy oh believe that after committing murder woman went off to meet assassin near cleopatra needle gave jewel doubtless expected to receive gave also a receipt image of second mummy put in pocket be turning away when stabbed then tried to throw body into water being interrupted fled leaving work undone objected darrel finding flaw with true instinct of criticism why do suppose that assassin gave image to victim in other case when be assassin gave mummy to red hair be possible therefore that have second one in pocket not if theory be correct retorted torry nettled woman gave mummy to red hair a receipt for jewel in turn received second figure on delivering up jewel to assassin well admitting a much why having obtained what wanted must have killed find out will find murderer said torry grimly well mr darrel here be detective novel in real life what do think of plot provided by chance plot echoed darrel must rather call riddle one quite impossible to guess ah sir will never make detective if mystery discourages so early see how intend to begin well said torry in first place there be clue of initial will go to shop in bond street find out what letter stand for thus may arrive at identity of man thereby be able to learn about past life in past life may discover motive for crime in marked shirt be good starting point there be also clue of four wheeler four wheeler repeated one driven by henry red haired man used a blind second owned by bike in followed be alluding to third cab be not on stand when returned at one o'clock see what cab have to do with business mr darrel mr darrel cried torry gently may be good novelist if will pardon saying so sir be very bad detective be not reasonable to suppose that woman anxious to get a far a possible from scene of crime must come up mortality lane jump into third cab also must not forget that have rendezvous at cleopatra needle perhaps have to drive quickly to be in time yes coming into contact with cabman ran risk of being recognised must have known that when murder be discovered police must probably guess flight in four wheeler inquire about from driver must give description oh be very well said torry dismissing objection with wave of plump hand woman never guessed for moment chance must intervene that by mean of death must obtain evidence of crime thought must escape scot free also daresay be disguised might be that be too agitated to pay attention to risk ran anyhow be certain that used third cab to get away be going to look up driver how will find by questioning henry bike moreover may be on cab stand tell what mr darrel cried torry getting on short leg let make division of labour go to harcot harcot in bond street to find out what be name attached to letter will see to cabman very good mr torry when where be to see detective pencilled address on card threw across table private office where wo be disturbed said eighty craven street strand come at four o'clock afternoon by way might then be able to give information about idol there will try said darrel friend life near british museum so will have time to run up see there be one thing be not certain of yet sir replied mr torry drily there be many thing of be not certain special thing know if individual who killed woman at cleopatra needle be male female male man will stake professional reputation on why be so sure why echoed detective because woman ran too great risk in committing murder must only risk so much for man chapter iv dead man name doing be better than dreaming year of experience be worth century of theorising life darrel have sat in study laboriously weaving romance out of such material a have collected in wandering now by happy chance of fortune be about to step out of ideal world into actual life take active part in real story already fate have laid foundation of intricate plot be business to work out to fit conclusion criminal problem presented to in own mind darrel considered task impossible conceive difficulty of case man name unknown meet with be murdered by woman woman also unknown go to keep tryst with individual male female be killed by be material upon darrel have to work may be guessed that heart failed at meagre detail afforded by affair sole clue be two clay image coloured blue initial ' marked on murdered man linen possible chance of extracting useful information from cabman yet starting from three point torry hoped to arrive at goal aimed at viz to capture condemn hang guilty individual darrel must not with hold admiration at determination of little man detective fiction be easier to follow than detective fact said darrel to a prepared to go out with material supplied by mortality lane case must work out very fair novel fate fortune destiny whosoever be designing actual romance will develop in quite different way doubt well put on hat be one of actor in drama be turn to step on to stage here go for elucidation of blue mummy mystery rather amused by own idea darrel stepped into hansom drove to friend room near british museum in pocket carried grotesque little image from hoped to learn so much luckily egyptologist patron be name proved to be at home long lean savant with grizzled hair spectacle received darrel very amiably for be old friend have be fellow student at oxford frank looked still young blooming a be natural at age of five twenty patron though barely thirty be already aged by hard study misanthropic temperament in hand of prematurely old individual darrel placed image look at egyptian mummy old fellow said taking seat tell what think of mr patron stroked cheek chin examined azure idol through learned spectacle contradicted frank in clear calm voice a usual dear darrel speak without thinking said image be not egyptian at be representation of mummy protested frank always understood that egyptian be only people who salted dried dead then understood wrongly contradicted patron ancient peruvian also embalmed dead be image of peruvian mummy how do know asked darrel rather amazed at remark see representation of sun on breast snapped other ancient peruvian be sun worshipper judging from solar symbol must say that mummy come from tomb of inca be what call tomb image what be questioned visitor patron cleared throat adjusted spectacle prepared for long historical lecture in common with certain asiatic nation said ancient peruvian practised barbarous custom of immolating victim at obsequies of great men sometimes according to prescott thousand attendant favourite concubine must be slaughtered so that might accompany dead inca to bright mansion in sun on occasion however actual slaughter be dispensed with image of clay in form of mummy such a see here said savant pointing to blue figure be substituted for human being for counsellor slave wife attendant clay image be placed in sepulchre of dead so in such instance there must be many hundred of fictitious mummy arranged round corpse figure have here be example of tomb image hope make clear perfectly rejoined darrel slipping image into pocket lecture doe not help in least in what way where did get mummy questioned patron disconnectedly out of murdered woman pocket bless how strange why be murdered how did become possessed of so unique curiosity a peruvian tomb image patron friend be two question to be trying to obtain answer if can help darrel thank patron fear can help further good day good day good day replied egyptologist hastily for mind be already reverting to own particular work be becoming oblivious to story told by visitor good day after soared into cloudland darrel went away little satisfied with visit have obtained certain historical information none likely to throw light on mystery of double crime blue mummy be connected with murder in concealed way independent of archological merit be hidden connection darrel desired to discover at present however must not see slightest chance of gaining necessary information therefore especial clue be absolutely useless at event for time being later on value might be discovered utilised in meantime frank dismissed to follow up clue of initial on linen of dead man to accomplish drove directly to bond street mere fact that red haired man a in absence of actual name be convenient to call be in habit of dealing with harcot harcot shewed that must have be if not rich at least fairly well off shop a darrel knew be very expensive one good supplied be sold at much above market value from fact that be supposed to be particularly fashionable darrel carried with shirt of dead man have be confided to by torry displayed to eye of senior partner mr harcot be tall stately looking man more like duke than shopkeeper after examining shirt through pince nez inquired loftily what be mr darrel desired to know darrel promptly supplied information wish to learn what initial stand for said laying forefinger on letter may ask why darrel reflected see reason why must not know remarked must respect confidence certainly sir certainly replied harcot whose curiosity be now excited please come way where will not be disturbed tradesman led way into small room partitioned off from shop by glass screen on closing door of handed darrel chair with great politeness await explanation sir said smoothing out shirt on table one moment said frank quickly if tell reason for asking question agree to answer can rely on being able to give desired information assuredly sir will observe under letter 'jg there be number one thousand four hundred twenty well sir index so to speak shirt of manufacture in way must reason for seeking information satisfy have only to look up number in book to learn for whom shirt be made then have better do so at once mr harcot for thereby may be able to capture criminal tradesman looked amazed capture criminal repeated yes on sunday morning last after one o'clock man to whom that shirt belonged be murdered murdered sir yes stabbed to heart in mortality lane dear dear cried mr harcot in much agitation say so noticed account of tragedy in star early issue mr darrel published at two o'clock did not think that customer of ours be victim how very dreadful who be unfortunate gentleman be what wish to tell mr harcot with pleasure with pleasure if will excuse saying so sir did not know that be officer of law be rejoined darrel drily be novelist detective in charge of case have permitted to assist oh indeed sir replied mr harcot considerably astonished if will permit sir will look up book washing hand with invisible soap bowing politely mr harcot vanished leaving darrel to own thought in about ten minute returned looking very pale concerned frank be trifle surprised at agitation dear dear gasped man sitting down with air of consternation be shocked really such respectable gentleman so old customer what be name cried darrel anxiously grent sir jesse grent of wray house wraybridge grent grent muttered darrel thoughtfully seem to know name everybody doe mr darrel grent leighbourne of fleet street what banker yes sir yes mr jesse grent be head of firm now be angel hope so for be good man sir who paid bill most regul thank mr harcot said frank cutting short lamentation be trifle mercenary have told wish to know mr jesse grent banker h be so be red haired man mr harcot be about to protest that late mr grent have white hair that frank with curt nod walked smartly out of shop whereupon harcot senior went to inform harcot junior of loss of good customer to suggest immediate sending in of bill to executor be now too late to call at torry private office a be long after six o'clock before frank terminated inquiry so went back to room pondered over discovery have heard of mr grent who be rich banker much respected that must be found dead in disreputable neighborhood in disguise added to mystery of case frank thought over matter night until brain be on fire be glad when morning came that must see torry just a be considering advisability of paying visit detective made appearance looked considerably disturbed say mr darrel burst out there be two murderer two yes man woman chapter v de mortuis nil nisi bonum man woman repeated darrel thoughtfully who told that mr torry third cabman replied detective main be name found along with henry bike on cab stand near mortality lane have difficulty in making speak not least be quite willing to give information assist police in way why do suggest difficulty why said darrel if man woman be actually assassin be possible might have bribed main to silence hereby roused suspicion retorted torry sharply nothing of sort main did not know what lay down lane so there be need for pair to purchase silence came out of mortality lane yes main say that after other two cab drove away almost decided to go home a despaired of getting fare at so late hour however on chance waited for twenty minute so patience be rewarded shortly before one o'clock man woman came out of mortality lane got into cab drove off then left just before cab came back doubt assassin ran thing very fine well woman told main to drive to northumberland avenue near theatre there two alighted dismissed cab what did do next suppose main noticed in direction went indeed replied mr torry with vexed air got money went straight home leaving man woman standing on pavement in front of avenue theatre what route did take from mortality lane to northumberland avenue down street along embankment replied torry promptly suppose said darrel reflectively that did not notice one near cleopatra needle a drove along asked if did declared that be too much taken up with managing horse be rather unruly to cast look to right left drove to destination then returned home by going up avenue can describe pair h be said torry dubiously not very clearly woman be tall fair haired dressed in black veiled know that a have seen dead body dress man be not so tall a woman with black beard wore soft hat long overcoat almost to heel be slender silent leaving woman to give direction pay fare be agitated man seemed more agitated than woman perhaps killed mr grent perhaps did have evidence to shew who struck blow who be mr grent dead man be rather be mr jesse grent banker oh said torry rubbing plump hand with much satisfaction have found out that much case be becoming important for mr jesse grent be well known can tell be very rich very philanthropic two year ago stood for parliament in conservative interest now wonder what took so respectable man into so disreputable neighbourhood in disguise too h be look queer mr grent be not so good a thought may a well speak in past torry man be dead dead murdered said detective thoughtfully sad ending for virtuous man tell that learnt from harcot have told replied darrel shirt be made for jesse grent of waybridge of grent leighbourne banker fleet street quite so said torry getting on foot well where harcot information end mr leighbourne may begin come along mr darrel let pay visit to fleet street very good wait till put on coat while frank be getting ready for visit torry employed time in making note in secretive little book incidentally inquired about blue mummy on receiving explanation about ancient peruvian custom evinced disgust at unsatisfactory result of darrel visit to archologist still thought information worth noting doe seem to bear much on case said philosophically still there be knowing how important may be agree with there said frank taking up hat glove that blue mummy to mind symbolises something may elucidate whole mystery sound too romantic to have practical value grumbled a went out be far cry from london to peru notwithstanding diversion of opinion subject seemed to be of so little importance that novelist detective dropped discussion in few moment found in hansom rattled quickly eastward until descended before unpretentious building be one of most famous

torry that mr grent have taken longer journey than be aware of longer journey how do know because be detective leighbourne became even paler than before pushed back chair with quick nervous movement detective muttered faintly why why doe detective call on to inform of mr grent death interposed darrel astonished at unnecessary display of emotion dead mr grent dead frederick leighbourne rose in indescribable state of emotion why on friday last when said good bye to be in excellent health health have nothing to do with death said torry drily have heard of mortality lane murder yes yes be saw saw something about in evening paper stammered banker hurriedly have nothing nothing have everything to do with mr grent if be what mean said darrel on sunday morning last shortly before one o'clock partner be murdered murdered leighbourne voice leaped octave oh god stabbed to heart by whom by whom by unknown woman leighbourne face have changed from white to red then back again assumed expression of profound astonishment woman repeated murdered by woman impossible thought here checked on observing attentive attitude of auditor be woman in custody asked calmly replied torry who have noted hesitation of young man be dead also dead also repeated leighbourne not murdered yes be stabbed to heart by unknown man have be arrested darrel must not forbear dry laugh if have be arrested mr leighbourne must not be unknown murderer escaped have come to ask to assist to find leighbourne resumed seat with what appeared to be air of relief murmured good heaven gentleman how can possibly

answered dear sir said detective know that when there be trouble one must always look for woman now there be woman in case interrupted leighbourne sharply oh pardon sir mr grent be killed by woman short time ago be beginning to make remark thereon when stopped changed subject leighbourne coloured looked embarrassed did so because thought impossible that mr grent must have met death at hand of woman so far a know be never connected with one be not married asked frank oh yes of course mean with other woman than wife donna inez be different donna inez who be mr grent a be spanish american prefers to be called so spanish american repeated darrel from south america yes be native of lima lima be in peru strange darrel looked at torry torry gazed at darrel mr grent came from peru blue mummy have be obtained from peruvian tomb coincidence if be one be strange chapter vi secretary quite unaware of clue chance remark have given to visitor banker touched electric bell send mr vas to said when clerk appeared then turning towards torry added mr grent private secretary will be here in few minute will be able to answer question better than be mr vas in confidence of deceased sir entirely be mr grant right hand may inform a proof of confidence poor friend put in that mr vas have have key of mr grent private safe will leave alone with vas while send wire to father in paris advising of tragedy paused moment then continued may also add that mr vas have be ill since saturday have be confined to bed returned only morning to work oh thought mr torry smiling blankly to conceal real thought so mr vas confidential secretary have be ill absent have now wonder what be meaning of perhaps mr torry be too suspicious a saw meaning evil meaning in everything leighbourne explanation be perfectly reasonable one still a torry considered be uncalled for why must take trouble to explain absence of secretary there be need to do so darrel be also struck by needle explanation thought that there be something doubtful about affair altogether detective helper be prejudiced against secretary by very innocent remark of mr leighbourne made probably in good faith vas made appearance in few minute proved to be pale clean shaven fellow of about twenty eight wore spectacle have rather dry pedantic air a one given to study comparative seclusion mr vas said leighbourne when clerk entered room have sent for to give gentleman information about poor mr grent why poor mr grent asked vas with mild surprise forgot know well will leave gentleman to explain must send telegram recalling father will come back said torry a banker walked towards door if wish to replied leighbourne with frowning reluctance do wish said detective decisively must come with to identify body be possible that may be required to give evidence at inquest evidence evidence cried young man passing tongue over dry lip what evidence can give want to attend inquest must sir leighbourne looked defiantly at detective for moment so pair eyed one in silence then weaker of two yielded if must must said leighbourne sullenly will come back passed out closing door behind with such unnecessary violence that be plain have departed in bad temper while dialogue be proceeding darrel have kept eye on face of vas although have heard be said word body inquest must have piqued curiosity expression be one of absolute unconcern only once did betray emotion be when leighbourne left alone with two stranger when torry turned towards face be again calm composed frank wondered what must be meaning of well acted comedy mr vas said torry intent upon trying effect of sudden surprise have to inform that master have be murdered mr vas stepped back threw up hand grent murdered cried in voice rendered shrill by excitement great heaven when where in mortality lane near strand on sunday morning between twelve one o'clock be stabbed to heart secretary received news with unfeigned horror evidently having womanish vein in nature burst into fit of hysterical weeping in spite of what have beheld darrel felt suspicion melt away before undeniable sorrow in own mind decided that vas might know intelligence of master death be new to have taken completely by surprise torry said nothing smiled approvingly when beheld outbreak of vas perhaps secretary perceived composure with emotion be received by stranger regained nerve out of pride be cause shortly became calm expressed willing to answer question might be put to with sign to darrel not to speak torry promptly availed of offer cause of mr grent death said may be found in past life so wish to tell know about have be secretary long for over five year be best kindest most generous of master replied vas with much emotion hm ' said torry who did not put much faith in posthumous praise master be much respected certainly never heard word against be married believe be to donna inez sandoval spanish american lady native of peru how be that mr grent met ten year ago voyaged to peru for sake of health rejoined vas understand met with donna inez at lima be married there in romish church certainly mr grent be roman catholic wife also be there child said vas then added with hesitation mr grent finding childless adopted niece of wife donna maria sandoval how old be lady twenty year of age replied secretary colouring very beautiful darrel noted expression of face enthusiasm of reply be rather in tone of voice than substance of remark oh thought novelist can be proverbial woman who have caused trouble how long have donna maria be with mr grent two year more le of course speaks english extremely well answered vas promptly be taught by miss lydia hargone who be quite like daughter of house left only six week ago nature of reply seemed to strike torry for made note of last name without comment resumed inquiry mr grent lived at wraybridge yes in wray house large mansion on bank of thames did entertain much largely be fond of company so be donna inez mr grent mean do replied vas tartly prefers to be addressed in spanish style do know if mr grent have very intimate friend one two said secretary with little hesitation can give name of one two asked torry politely well mr roderick blake for one be irishman so must judge from name said detective drily friend mr vas man hesitated finally came out with spanish name if insist upon knowing said with reluctance there be captain manuel captain manuel oh indeed also from peru yes came over to see donna inez who be relative of for last three month have be constant visitor at wray house may ask question said darrel at moment torry threw inquiring glance in direction of friend nodded if like said graciously wondering at darrel meaning in case said frank looking at secretary will ask mr vas if there be love affair at wray house love affair stammered vas plainly taken aback quite catch meaning oh be romance cried torry with sly hit at darrel imagination novelist shook head two young men two young woman said solemnly be not in nature that there must not be love spring up between four well sir said vas smiling little say what be not right captain manuel be paying address to donna maria must admit that miss hargone be greatly admired by mr blake thought so said darrel triumphantly signed to torry to continue examination detective did without further remark do know if mr grent have enemy asked secretary so far a know have not one replied vas promptly mr grent be singularly popular when did see last on friday at four o'clock then said good bye to a be going to italy next day for four month be reason one be alarmed at absence probably so far a bank be concerned replied torry thoughtfully in own house oh can explain said vas easily mr grent have chamber in town probably took leave of wife on friday purposed to stay at chamber until left for south dare say donna inez think that husband be in milan by now where be chamber in duke street st james mr grent lived there by so there be one likely to be alarmed at absence have not valet butler who kept house attended to a mr grent came went a fit seized man must think nothing of not coming back to room h be said torry quite see did mr grent take much money with drew cheque for twenty pound for immediate expense when abroad always used cheque book a more convenient than circular note torry be disappointed with result of inquiry certainly have great deal relative to social position daily habit of dead man have discovered nothing likely to throw light on mystery of crime be to dismiss vas with discontent when darrel rose to foot for reason of own produced image of mummy held towards vas perhaps can explain said imperatively to surprise of men secretary gasped turned pale then quietly fainted away chapter vii evidence at inquest a may be guessed double tragedy caused great sensation in london that respected banker must be murdered by unknown woman in turn must be assassinated by unknown man be such unusual occurrence that for quite week nothing else be talked of newspaper have leading article on subject pointing out how negligent police must be when such terrible event must happen in heart of most civilised capital in world people of busy body type wrote letter to different editor suggesting various course to be adopted to discover capture unknown assassin in street drawing room club discussion on same subject waxed hot furious however nothing tangible resulted from storm in teapot word word word hamlet remark applies peculiarly to newspaper inquest be held on two body on tuesday afternoon three day after committal of crime torry a having conduct of case in hand have summoned three cabman a witness also have called upon darrel to tell story have subpoenaed leighbourne to identify body have requested vas to give evidence relative to behaviour of deceased before final departure from fleet street office in fact detective did must to reveal truth to jury in spite of effort assassin of unknown woman must not be discovered even indicated never be there so mysterious case most important piece of evidence brought forward at inquest be production of weapon with crime have be committed on step of cleopatra long cruel looking spanish knife be kept open by strong spring for safer delivery of blow have be found by tramp who have discovered body at first have kept weapon to on chance of making money out of have taken knife to torry who gave ten shilling for later on figured before eye of intelligent jury along with clothes of victim two blue mummy last excited great deal of curiosity a lifted murder from commonplace tragedy up to level of romance sort of wild idea be afloat a to reason for presence about body of victim not one person be able to give feasible explanation on whole evidence collected be sparse unsatisfactory so that jury directed by coroner be only able to arrive at commonplace verdict that dead man woman have be killed by person person unknown public press be furious at tame verdict on consideration confessed that must think of better one afterwards arrival of eastern potentate in london attracted notice of fickle public blue mummy case be quite forgotten after inquest people said that truth must never be known tacitly relegated double tragedy to shelf kept for undiscovered crime mystery have begun in mortality lane be greater mystery than ever might a well look for needle in haystack a try to find out truth of affair grumbled darrel when matter be in position if be opinion sir have better climb down replied torry drily came into case at own request so be quite reasonable for to withdraw if feel inclined do intend to go on with matter asked frank surveying little man with amazement of course be not play with a be with work have to earn bread butter guided by evidence have in hand intend to proceed immediately victim be dead buried truth about be not known be duty to find out punish wrongdoer wrongdoer mean said darrel speaking in singular know who killed mr grent pardon mr darrel be just what know woman who be murdered did not kill banker be sure of female of slight build must not have have muscular energy to drive weapon through cloth wool straight into heart of strong man so a to kill at first stroke pistol yes for weapon be a fatal in hand of woman a in of man strong long steady stroke involving unusual muscular exertion to say nothing of nerve power necessary mr darrel decline to believe woman guilty depend upon be victim not assassin well said darrel quietly victim not be certainly accomplice else must not have emerged from mortality lane with man must admit that must have killed grent of course assented torry calmly thought a much from time heard evidence of third cabman what wish to learn be why man required woman to be present why did permit to interview assassin by how do intend to obtain answer to question by finding out name of dead woman be impossible declared darrel emphatically by mean replied torry coolly in fact have done something already towards discovering name discovery narrow still more ground be exploring to be precise mr darrel everything point to motive for crime being discovered in wray house in what way asked frank much astonished will answer question by asking sir do remember how traced name of grent by mean of initial on shirt yes remember quite well resolved to apply method to discover dead woman name there be mark on linen cried darrel know said torry rubbing plump hand together there be name of fashionable milliner stamped on lining of hat dead woman wore went to see milliner madame vert of regent street discovered that hat be made for miss sandoval for donna maria said darrel then on receiving nod from detective asked how did hat come to be worn by dead woman must find that out from lady replied torry can see for that discovery connects wray house with crime possibly doe never strike that bank in fleet street may have connection also for part mistrust leighbourne have cause to do so there be absolutely nothing to connect with crime what about agitated demeanour pooh pooh cried torry briskly of course man be agitated on hearing of grent terrible death ca judge man in such circumstance now to mind fainting of vas at sight of mummy be more suspicious thought explained that doe in way likely to upset theory vas declares that saw blue mummy on grent table be sight of again in connection with crime made faint explanation be rather feeble still if grent have mummy in possession must not have received from assassin if did not how be found beside dead body ca say admitted darrel thoughtfully of one thing be certain that blue mummy be clue to whole mystery what about captain manuel why do mention asked torry abruptly well said frank slowly seems to that double tragedy have to do with peru everywhere turn be met by peru in first place mummy be tomb image from sepulchre of inca of peru in second knife discovered be spanish american bowie must only have come from new world in third grent wife adopted child be spanish lady from lima finally captain manuel be from peru be confidential friend of dead man what do make of grent be murdered by manuel sneered torry that must look in south america in peru in lima for motive of crime grent be there many year ago brought home spanish wife so who know what might have made enemy there who swore to kill accomplished tragedy of other night might explain grent death said torry nursing chin in hand doe not reveal why unknown woman must have be killed yet be sure that same motive will account for death oh cried detective in despair if must only find out that motive question donna inez suggested darrel if anyone will explain reason why so because if theory be correct may remember if husband made enemy in peru peru peru have peru on brain said torry may see donna inez later first intend to search room of grent chamber in duke street yes leighbourne be going to meet there afternoon be going through grent private paper in search of possible clue wonder did not search there before there be time replied torry tartly have have lot to do in getting evidence for inquest now be over victim be buried can go forward be week since murder said frank someone may have be in grent chamber to remove incriminating paper assassin mean possibly well said detective there be something in doubt a butler who keep room must not be likely to let anyone into during absence of tenant however will see will come thank replied darrel find detective fever have passed away torry uttered prophecy on first discovery of note will get fever again said chapter viii robbery room belonged to jesse grent be in duke street st james be very comfortably furnished in plain unpretentious manner evidently dead man have be simple in taste notwithstanding wealth have refrained from indulging in luxury chamber be looked after by landlord of house retired butler who appeared dignified enough to be bishop yet who be plainly afraid of law a personified by torry answered many question of detective with anxious humility information gave be worth little mr grent be good tenant said capricious in coming going in butler opinion might be due to fact that house at wraybridge be very great distance from town be only when mr grent be very late that remained night at chamber on day of murder be saturday mr grent have notified that be going to italy must probably be away two week be at five o'clock that have said then have dined at club evidently have gone to theatre butler saw when returned at in evening be last saw of did not know if mr grent have gone out that night did go out said torry never returned must not see in morning that bed have not be slept in beg pardon replied butler meek be name meek nature mr grent be very peculiar gentleman sir told never to go into room unless rang bell so a did not ring bell did not venture into room when heard that be murdered did found bed unslept in yes sir must have gone out about eleven did not hear did mr grent ever receive visitor here sometimes sir replied meek have one in afternoon of saturday tall dark gentleman who looked like foreigner be in foreign army too added garrulous mr meek for when took up card to mr grent saw be captain captain manuel be captain something sir really ca remember exact name h be said torry thoughtfully have doubt be same person have in mind other visitor lady came sometimes sir came shortly after captain on saturday what be name ca say never gave card always wore heavy veil must not identify in way not by personal appearance sir did wear peculiar ring on saturday be paying cab took off right hand glove to find piece of gold have slipped into corner of purse then noticed that on third finger wore silver ring set with three blue stone turquoise stone doubt said torry will make note of a must like to know who woman be sir cried meek in dismay think lady have have anything to do with murder torry shrugged shoulder a to that remarked tritely can only say that woman be at bottom of trouble may be woman concerned in especial affair at moment mr leighbourne arrived according to appointment with torry be conducted up stair into chamber of late mr grent have damp musty smell a though have be uninhabited for time bedroom sitting room be in state of great confusion travelling rug dressing bag portmanteau be scattered about sitting room in bedroom there be pile of shirt heap of clothes impedimenta of man bound on long journey what particularly struck torry be presence of large american trunk half full of wearing apparel be big box to take on short journey said thoughtfully call journey to italy short one replied leighbourne who looked worried ill spoke sharply take two day two night to reach florence maybe sir mr grent intended to stay only two week according to meek here yes sir chimed in deferential butler only two week in case continued detective must hardly need so many clothes portmanteau of size dressing bag must have contained ample unless added torry looking at leighbourne mr grent be masher young banker laughed indeed said with assumed lightness poor friend cared nothing for dress then said torry decisively may be sure intended to take much longer journey than suppose said be going to italy might have said so a blind certainly did not intend to go there added torry with emphasis if did be to reach naples brindisi catch out going liner to australia have torry stopped speaking slapped thigh what be matter sir asked butler nervously oh be there said torry turning sharply on then can go downstairs if need will ring ca be of service here sir urged meek who be filled with curiosity if need will ring repeated torry pointed towards door butler be obliged to go withdrew with manifest unwillingness torry saw descend stair locked outer door of chamber after returned to leighbourne who watched conduct with ill concealed nervousness why do send meek away asked with hesitation because wish to speak to privately replied torry promptly be not open with mr leighbourne what do mean demanded young man flushing be bank solvent asked torry in turn other jumped to foot in violent rage solvent cried of course be solvent how dare hint that anything be wrong with business hint replied torry because wish to know reason mr grent intended to run off to south america to south america repeated leighbourne in stupified tone how do know thought of going there because believe mr grent intended to go to genoa take first boat to peru why peru oh be fancy of mine rejoined torry with shrug mr grent have spanish wife murder be committed with spanish knife two tomb image from peru be mixed up in matter therefore believe that if mr grent chose place to fly to must go to lima why must fly be what ask said detective coolly be sure will be able to supply reason so to give time to make up mind will look for ticket to italy leaving leighbourne sitting much astonished in chair torry crossed room to writing table placed directly under window so a to get available light on lay many paper tossed about in confusion through torry looked rapidly without finding ticket to italy middle drawer be not locked in detective discovered bunch of key one of fitted drawer of escritoire within be letter bill memoranda none of did torry examine very closely a at present moment be bent on discovering ticket to genoa naples search proved futile so desisted with lowering race glanced round room leighbourne who have be biting finger brightened up at failure sneered see thing be not a think said in tone of relief one moment returned torry be not yet at end of resource keen eye have caught sight of fur travelling coat hanging up in distant corner towards walked on purchasing ticket thought mr grent must probably put in breast pocket of travelling coat so a to run risk of leaving behind a have be disguised on night of murder be improbable that must have taken with if anywhere said torry putting hand into breast pocket of fur coat will be here hullo exclamation be drawn from in sheer astonishment have found not one ticket two be made out by cook from london to genoa two ticket cried torry in amazement then intended to take someone with leighbourne jumped up looked at two ticket over torry shoulder be very strange said at length be right mr torry mr grent intended to go away why to genoa to catch boat to lima of course there be line to lima from italy there be line of steamer to buenos ayres however said torry briskly know that for fact wonder who woman be woman yes need tell mr grent intended to take male companion have cried torry suddenly intended to bolt with woman met with woman who killed impossible bah woman did not kill be man who struck blow yes yes murmured detective eye lighting up with joy see grent met woman in order to bring back here fly with while be talking in mortality lane be interrupted by man probably lover husband of woman out of jealousy killed grent be a plain a day be impossible tell cried leighbourne furiously mr grent be devotedly attached to wife must not leave for woman then must have contemplated bolting because of money trouble said detective promptly own truth mr leighbourne be grent in difficulty before banker must reply there came furious knocking at outer door two men looked at one in startled manner torry recovered at once without word ran to door threw open to surprise vas secretary looking much agitated ran past into room be followed at more leisurely pace by tall dark man who looked like foreigner who be also agitated in lesser degree than vas captain manuel cried leighbourne quickly mr vas what be matter robbery gasped secretary robbery what be saying said banker while torry listened attentively mr grent private safe have be robbed cried vas robbed of ten thousand pound in note yes said captain manuel in very good english money belongs to chapter ix captain manuel spaniard be even darker than be usual with people of race also have eagle nose hair very straight glossy black eye be large brilliant mouth rather full trifle sensual lean alert figure be peculiarly straight upright added to advantage wore heavy black moustache twirled at time with insolent air so that on whole be remarkably handsome man there be something uncivilised about strange wild look suggested soldier of fortune probably be what represented to be peruvian gentleman serving a captain in army of republic to torry who be well read for man of position seemed like buccaneer filibuster be captain kidd in frock coat at present moment seemed much agitated leaning on stick with hand challenged regard of leighbourne torry vas have thrown into chair a pale face testified seemed to be overcome with consternation on unexpected surprise of sudden arrival there ensued short silence so finding that spoke captain manuel addressed to three on subject of robbery gave mr grent ten thousand pound three week ago said foreign accent becoming more pronounced in excitement went to bank day to obtain dios what do find find that mr grent be dead said torry smoothly yes sir money gone sir to leighbourne know be master in bank will return to money that entirely depends on circumstance of case seor manuel replied banker who looked pale composed vas perhaps can throw light on subject on soul ca sir cried vas starting to foot only know that mr grent told have received in bank note sum of ten thousand pound from captain manuel three week ago kept money for time down at wray house a be going to italy did not think must be safe to leave there so brought up to bank told to place in private safe did so in presence locked door afterwards went away heard nothing more of until news of murder came if be true money must be right said manuel sharply be not in safe cried vas wildly when captain manuel came to day to ask for money told must not give to a have authority to do so wished then to see if be right so in presence opened safe only to find that note be gone well mr grent must not have taken said leighbourne said vas did not tell locked safe in presence must not have returned asked torry not without someone in bank seeing after office hour even then porter must have seen groaned vas who seemed very wretched there be only two entrance to bank james porter have key of one can go come without passing be bound to see who enter did ask if mr grent returned yes say like saw mr grent last on friday here captain manuel interposed sharply be well sir to unnecessary money be what wish give to will speak to father about said leighbourne quickly will not lose money if can help must point out to sir that bank be not responsible for amount not responsible echoed manuel striking stick furiously on floor answered banker firmly money be not deposited with firm placed by in keeping of mr grent therefore be responsible for safety be dead can not repay estate be doubt large enough to repay will speak to father a said before be one of executor have doubt will refund ten thousand pound out of property left by mr grent on receiving proof that paid money have paper signed by mr grent stating that received money said manuel sullenly gentleman waving stick towards vas be told by mr grent that money be mine vas looked up eagerly mr grent said that money belonged to society said doe to society of be representative oh oh oh cried torry in three different key be struck by new idea looked directly at manuel have society anything to do with peru possibly returned manuel superciliously society sir have nothing to do with ah said detective ironically be not blue mummy time captain manuel be fairly taken by surprise evidently random shot of detective have unexpectedly hit mark spaniard flushed dusky red stepped forward on second thought stepped back recovered former serenity with effort know what mean said sullenly torry whistled softly said nothing attitude of spaniard confirmed suspicion entertained concerning blue mummy evidently be badge of secret society to manuel belonged if so a token of blue mummy have be found near victim must have be murdered by order of association for what reason plainly because ten thousand pound represented fund of society have be stolen who be thief here torry came to pause a reason imagination must lead further however to discover more determined to have manuel watched in meantime be wise enough to hold tongue seeing that detective made reply manuel turned back on with shrug of contempt walked smartly towards door there turned addressed leighbourne will expect repayment of money within fortnight said coldly otherwise well cried banker defiantly otherwise will have to deal with society replied manuel with grim significance disappeared a suddenly a have entered three men left behind looked at one doe mean by threat asked leighbourne uneasily mean assassination fancy said torry coolly assassination cried vas staring up mean well said detective thoughtfully of course may be wrong strike that secret society to manuel refers of apparently be treasurer be association somewhat after fashion of italian carbonari that society be founded for patriotic purpose tempered by assassination probably manuel association be formed to overturn present government of beloved country to do so fund be needed ten thousand pound given to mr grent be doubtless money of society failing mr grent who be dead society represented by manuel will doubt hold bank responsible if money be not refunded may attempt to kill who represent bank stay mr leighbourne mr vas here bah cried leighbourne with forced laugh be trying to frighten people do such thing nowadays rejoined torry drily what about anarchist will tell one thing gentleman whichever one of be killed image of blue mummy will be found beside what cried vas aghast do think that society speak of killed mr grent going by circumstantial evidence do for what reason because fancy mr grent stole that money intended to bolt to america with impossible said vas tell saw money in safe after left well if did not take someone who have key of safe must have done so by order secretary rose with very red face do mean to say that took money be not aware that accused mr vas said torry do accuse only mr grent can open safe be in private room swear did not take money on oath declare that be guiltless believe sir cried vas turning appealingly towards leighbourne yes believe replied banker emphatically be sure never took money out of safe must be such fool said vas turning again towards torry money be in bank note in two bundle of five thousand pound twenty note of five hundred pound ten in one bundle same number in other manuel have number of note so be unlikely must do anything with bank note of such value of number be known to owner must not change single one without being found out then what benefit must theft do be neither fool criminal mr torry detective must not be struck by reasoning be feasible enough in face of known value known number of note be ridiculous to suspect vas to steal money under circumstance must have be simply to court arrest detective taking common sense view of question acquitted vas of robbery believe to be innocent said genially who be guilty know said secretary gloomily other than mr grent one must have stolen note mr grent did not did not so ca see how have disappeared might not key of safe have be stolen vas produced bunch of key out of pocket selected one here be key said holding up be never off chain out of possession torry nodded crossed over to desk on mr grent bunch of key still lay amongst found key similar in respect to shown by vas so here be mr grent key said comparing with secretary safe on chain in room one must have entered since murder be very strange exactly see way scratched chin thoughtfully then cried hat what hat asked leighbourne amazed at irrelevancy of remark hat of dead woman be made for donna maria sandoval must question at once about then then well will see chapter x donna maria wray house be charming villa on bank of thames view of mansion from river be singularly picturesque from bank smooth green lawn of closely shorn turf diversified by oval flower bed brilliant with scarlet geranium sloped gently up to terrace bordered by balustrade of white marble on plateau rose house fairy edifice of two storey upper smaller than lower colonnade ran

summer however have proved particularly hot so that wray house be perfect residence during sultry month of june august used to ardent heat of south america donna inez a mr grent loved to be called found warmth delightful basked like snake in golden sunshine in large degree niece be charmed with unusual splendour of summer two spanish woman passed most of time lounging in colonnade swinging in silken hammock suspended from branch of convenient tree to house life summer recalled languid lazy existence of far distant lima there laziness be art idleness have be reduced to silence when news came of grent tragic death donna inez weak lymphatic woman have given way to intolerable grief have shut up to indulge in domestic economy of house be thus upset for moment be speedily restored to order by maria sandoval who have much more character self control than aunt mr leighbourne senior came hastily over from paris on receiving news of partner death at once paid visit to wray house must hing with donna inez who be hysterical from grief so insisted that donna maria must take command of household young girl not without misgiving agreed to do satisfied on point mr leighbourne returned to london in order to arrange affair of dead man so far a will be concerned a one of executor took trouble on shoulder at wray house responsibility of looking after aunt managing servant devolved on maria shortly found that task be too difficult more so a be foreigner comparative stranger to english way so requested lydia hargone to come down assist miss hargone be woman of twenty seven good looking extremely clever have be engaged to teach maria english when young girl first arrived from lima have stayed nearly two year at wray house then have announced that maria spoke anglo saxon tongue excellently well that a there be necessity for further teaching miss hargone must seek situation everyone in house have protested against for lydia be general favourite maria be quite overcome with grief at thought of losing however miss hargone have own way a usual have departed three month before death of grent when tragic circumstance urgent message of former pupil recalled to wray house be to miss hargone credit that accepted invitation at once strove in way to pacify donna inez lighten domestic burden of donna maria thing be in position when torry accompanied by darrel paid visit to house of dead man that visit be first step in dark tortuous path led to discovery of truth at first darrel have be unwilling to come even to continue partnership with detective in following up various clue now in possession excused on ground of incapability can not assist in way urged see now that unravelling of actual criminal problem be far more difficult complex than thought have not indomitable perseverance rebuff never daunt make nervous doubtful nonsense nonsense cried torry cheerfully have set heart on going through with after why must be discouraged have found out good deal have said darrel sceptically of course have learnt that dead man name be jesse grent that be attempting to fly with woman ten thousand pound that be killed probably by lover of woman whose name have yet to discover also have learnt that stolen money belongs to secret society who use image of blue mummy a token come now think discovery be very encouraging must be if must prove replied darrel be mingling fact fancy can not prove that grent stole money indeed on face of if vas be to be believed be innocent also can not say for certain if grent intended to fly with woman that be killed by lover finally

small forest of pine fir tree here there be villa mansion cottage occasionally through intervening tree glimpse must be caught of smoothly flowing thames winding silvery way through flowery meadow in twenty minute traveller arrived at wraybridge village quaint picturesque hamlet with old fashioned house peaked roofed many gabled through narrow crooked thoroughfare misnamed high street passed emerged again into stretch of open country marching with river ultimately stopped before pair of elaborate iron gate gave admission to wray house having arrived at destination torry paid off cabman followed by darrel entered ground must be confessed that frank did not feel altogether easy in mind to visit unsuspecting people with idea of worming secret out of inexperience seemed to like getting into house under false pretence torry not being gentleman be not troubled by fine scruple indeed there be need that must be be officer of law be acting entirely in interest of justice be only natural that must attempt by mean in power to bring wrongdoer to gallows darrel mentally tried to assure of for salving of own conscience same felt uncomfortable devoutly wished that have not embarked on career dealt with life in so underhanded way however have gone too far to retreat so with philosophy made best of bad bargain followed torry up to house here found difficulty in entering servant brought back torry card announced that mistress be too ill to receive anyone thereupon detective requested permission to see donna maria who also sent back message that be not to be seen on second refusal torry lost smiling demeanour at once became stern officer of justice sharp tongued peremptory tell mistress said to servant that if will not see must permit to converse with donna maria sandoval be detective from new scotland yard have be charged to discover if possible assassin of mr grent in official character donna maria dare not refuse to see apparently peremptory speech carried weight for in few minute servant returned shewed two men into small room here waited torry amused by admiring beauty of apartment be luxuriously furnished in contemplating exquisite view from open french window led on to colonnade scene be worthy of praise at foot of emerald lawn ran great river flashing diamond in strong sunlight on further bank be row of tall poplar slender stately in leafy pride beyond be smooth green meadow dotted with grazing cattle line of rugged hedge clump of tree occasionally cluster of red roofed house square tower of village church be very pastoral peaceful torry eye left scene to gaze upon two people man woman who be walking to fro on gravelled path beside river be young be handsome be deeply engaged in conversation wonder who be speculated torry ca guess who man be daresay lady be donna maria donna maria be here said sweet voice behind torry darrel rose to foot to behold beautiful woman in first blush of girlish beauty donna maria be not very tall figure be perfect walked with graceful undulating gait peculiar to spanish woman hair eye be a black a midnight have pale oval olive hued face charming mouth when smiled displayed row of pearly teeth air be haughty imperious looked at visitor like queen whose privacy have be intruded upon be donna maria said coldly may ask sir why insisted upon seeing looked at darrel who did not respond so amazed be by beauty so after glance of disapproval lady turned towards torry repeated question detective immediately unwrapped parcel carried held hat out towards be hat yours asked donna maria looked at closely then bowed be mine admitted week ago gave to maid what be name julia brawn say 'what be name ' why because replied torry looking steadily at julia brawn have be murdered chapter xi unexpected evidence when torry stated so coldly that julia braw be dead donna maria turned pale trembled violently must have fallen that darrel noticing fainting condition sprang forward in time to catch in arm in moment however hastily withdrew from embrace recovered self composure seating on sofa remained silent for few moment pallor of face trembling of lip shewed how difficult be for to command feeling when found voice again be to explain reason of emotion after death of uncle said in low tone anything of same nature frightens that poor girl seems terrible that must have met with same tragic end a mr grent donna maria spoke excellent english with slight foreign accent so be evident that teacher miss hargone have instructed thoroughly well darrel who a writer have claim to be judge be amazed by fluency of speech extent of vocabulary apparently young girl be born linguist since spoke almost faultlessly tongue other than own perhaps undeniable beauty affected heart of darrel sufficiently to render enthusiastic in judgment torry le susceptible paid little attention to girl beauty intelligence saw in merely witness to be interrogated not woman to be wooed forthwith proceeded to examine in cold blooded manner sufficiently exasperating to ardent companion will permit miss to ask few question said politely on what subject asked donna maria with haughty astonishment on subject of murder know nothing about know name of dead woman if wore that hat gave only fortnight ago believe to be maid julia brawn on other hand sir may have given hat to someone else be very true replied torry gravely while darrel sat silently admiring beauty of maria sandoval woman be tall fair with blue eye scar on right temple be be julia cried maria quickly got that scar from falling from tree when be girl poor creature when be killed little over week ago donna maria started fixed black eye on torry week ago repeated on what day on sunday morning hour more le after mr grent be murdered holy virgin cried girl half rising where near cleopatra needle on thames embankment read in newspaper that crime have be committed there said maria hurriedly did not think that there be connection between murder that of mr grent finished torry with significance time maria fairly rose to foot seemed much agitated connection stammered impossible what must julia have to do with mr grent be what wish to find out miss julia brawn met mr grent in mortality lane killed be accompanied by unknown man who did afterwards confederate went to cleopatra needle there be killed by confederate darrel uttered ejaculation be new idea said approvingly might be so impossible said torry roughly if julia be killed by accomplice there must have be need for second blue mummy eh query be drawn from detective by sudden start on part of maria when mentioned blue mummy what do know about miss asked brusquely about about what said nervously ever confident in power of surprise to extort truth by unexpectedly startling nerve torry drew blue mummy always carried with from pocket tossed lightly into lap of maria about that said abruptly girl gave faint cry looked down into lap a though snake be coiled in then quietly swooned away ah said torry unmoved guilty conscience brute cried darrel starting to foot see poor girl have fainted ring bell call servant do neither shouted detective savagely leave matter to get water out of vase of flower sprinkle on face have smelling salt here always carry for case of kind oh be not first time have seen lady faint when brought into contact with law what do mean asked darrel angrily a sprinkled white face with water mean said torry holding bottle under maria nostril that will have strange revelation when lady recovers be recovering now cried frank eagerly thank god donna maria heaved long sigh colour began to come back slowly to cheek then opened eye languidly sat up with effort torry have be judicious enough to put image into pocket again at first moment of recovery maria must not collect scattered sens sufficiently to remember what have occurred at once memory came back flushing deep crimson staggered to foot made a if to leave room torry placed in way madam said sternly leave until explain excuse sir be not well faltered maria appealingly detective be not to be moved by such feminine wile must remain answer question said coldly torry cried frank who be moved by obvious distress of girl lady be ill can question time intend to question now will not do so unless consent oh said torry sneering of course if miss sandoval be afraid afraid interrupted maria courage coolness coming back at contemptuous word enough sir will remain answer question choose to put to seated like queen about to receive homage of courtier found time to flash glance of gratitude on darrel for championship young man felt pulse thrill at look in glorious dark eye sat down with rapidly beating pulse torry cold blooded long past age of sentiment merely nodded in dry approval of lady sense produced notebook in order to set down reply why did faint at sight of blue mummy miss because be connected in mind with mr grent memory of tragic death be too much for nerve what have mr grent to do with mummy know one day saw image such a one shewed on desk asked what be explained that be symbol of society of secret society yes let say of peruvian secret society maria hesitated mr grent said that image came from peru did not explain that society belonged to same place what do know about society nothing more than have told be native of peru miss be daughter of mr grent brother born in lima came over to england to be companion to aunt then must have heard about secret society in native land mistake sir replied donna maria coldly heard nothing be mention made of blue mummy not in hearing sole knowledge of image speak of be gained from mr grent have told everything said everything torry reflected do know if mr grent be mixed up with society in way never said so can not say well said torry rather disappointed at failure of effort let return to subject of maid name be julia brawn be how long be in service close on year when did leave about week before murder of mr grent dismissed said maria calmly be excellent servant be sorry to lose left of own free will for what reason understood be about to be married aha murmured torry so there be lover after daresay killed grent out of jealousy perhaps julia be not so much accomplice a victim thought for few moment then continued examination do know name of man intended to marry never heard mention name do know if man called to walk out with sir cried maria indignantly take sufficient interest in servant to spy on beg pardon beg pardon said torry hastily quite right must not have asked that question so julia brawn left yes gave that hat when went away did mr grent take notice of while be in house not that know of replied donna sandoval coldly think be even aware of existence strange yet met in mortality lane say so said maria scornfully oh be true can prove trouble to explain sir if julia met mr grent must have have motive tell quite overlooked here can think of reason why gentleman of uncle position must make appointment with servant about a much reason a have for disguising maria sighed shook head be mystery declared can not understand at do wish to ask further question sir yes did visit mr grent room in duke street on day of death girl bit lip clenched hand said coldly humph thought torry be lie chapter xii chance meeting although torry doubted truth of donna maria answer be too clever to let face tongue betray to contradict so high spirited woman must be to reduce to haughty silence perhaps to send out of room with chance of resuming conversation detective desired to learn knew while be in humour to speak therefore held peace in face of doubtful statement then recollected that meek have declared that lady who have visited duke street chamber on fatal saturday have worn peculiar ring silver hoop set with three turquoise stone incidentally looked at maria hand noted with chagrin that wore ring at discovery made doubt own perspicuity half believed that might have spoken truth after last time saw mr grent said maria seeing that man did not speak be on friday evening dined here afterwards said good bye to wife a intended to leave for italy on sunday few day afterwards heard that be dead who informed mr leighbourne mr vas came down to break news a gently a possible to aunt suppose two young gentleman be often here said darrel with afterthought one might love beautiful creole naturally replied coldly especially mr vas who be secretary to uncle duty brought often to wray house miss said torry looking sharply at lady have idea who murdered grent exclaimed passionately swear by saint know have enemy none know of did julia brawn ever speak ill of certainly not must not have dared to do so to under pain of instant dismissal surely suspect confessed torry dismally be man arm dealt fatal blow what be maid doing in mortality lane be sure be julia certain found dead near needle on embankment lace of mantle be torn portion of be in death grip of former master oh be same woman without doubt how be dressed said maria with feminine curiosity in hat fawn coloured mantle trimmed with black lace why why what be matter fawn coloured mantle stammered maria who have half risen from chair be staring at torry with horrified eye with lace black braid yes yes do know do do mother of sorrow have pity on crossed rapidly walking to window looked out quivering with emotion two men stared at one then torry walked forward touched girl arm shrank away with cry what do know of mantle asked softly maria hesitated shook head then evidently making up mind turned to face torry have to ask pardon said in low tone doubted if woman who met uncle be julia now know that be gave that mantle ah god to think must be so evil know replied torry accepting explanation a sufficient may have be more sinned against than sinning in case have paid for folly with life poor wretch who killed know be sure lover man went away to marry killed mr grent if must only learn that fellow personal appearance must have done courting here a julia be in service for so long never saw miss servant might have done so excellent idea cried torry rubbing hand mr darrel will be so kind a to remain here miss sandoval please take to see butler if anyone will know truth failing will try housekeeper very well sir said donna maria rising walking towards door hope will be able to discover truth wish to punish assassin of uncle said darrel more for sake of asking last question than because needed reply punish cried girl drawing up to stately height must give ten year of life to see rope round cowardly neck after passionate speech passed out of room spice of temper there chuckled torry went after leaving darrel alone in room young man walked up down to calm spirit quiet brain always of passionate sensuous nature have hitherto curbed instinct by strong will subdued love of pleasure in order to serve art more faithfully have never be in love in somewhat cold blooded fashion have regarded other sex more a object study to be analysed mercilessly for creation of type in fiction god of love who will not be denied who sooner later asserts empire over born of flesh have come to frank darrel in might heart free man of hour since be now in danger of becoming slave of woman be incredible darrel argued that must have fallen in love with one whom have known scarcely hour who have entered into life only on day yet how otherwise be able to account for strange excitement possessed be hot one moment cold next burning a with fever chilled a with ague ever before eye appeared that lovely face with glorious eye rich colouring donna maria be tropical flower burning gorgeous splendour of beauty passion of spirit flamed in eye governed inflexion of voice moved heart of darrel strangely miracle of man life have occurred although scarcely knew be in love why must not love be born of glance improbable be always possible taken up with own thought darrel did not observe that man woman who have be walking in garden be entering room through one of french window exclamation of astonishment from lady roused from brown study turned to explain presence a did so man light haired fresh coloured young fellow of thirty ran forward with smile outstretched hand darrel dear boy be cried heartily roderick mortimer said darrel clasping stranger hand not now be

will very shortly be changed into mr roderick blake of rainbow castle cloud cuckoo land roderick how do rattle on said lydia smilingly be very glad to see mr darrel governess be fair haired bland woman with grey eye rather hard mouth be not beautiful possessed attractive manner be dressed with quiet perfection shewed excellent taste in spite of lack of good look there be that about what italian call simpatica must attract at least eight men out of ten a pressed frank hand smiled at with grey eye felt that here be woman who must have made love miss hargone a frank judged needed to employ art of vivien to capture heart whereas a in own case same heart be thrown at foot of donna maria merely because of splendid beauty woman be attractive in own way what be doing down here said blake throwing into chair did not know knew mr grent do replied darrel flushing little came down here with detective lydia started with little shudder raised hand in dismay not about dreadful murder yes miss hargone about dreadful murder be assisting detective in charge of case to investigate be now cried blake whose brogue became marked when grew excited sure be not thief catching have taken up oh be merely investigating case in amateur way have discovered anything mr darrel asked lydia softly frank shrugged shoulder few thing said nothing likely to lead to detection of assassin there be two of say remarked blake be in paper one man killed poor old grent other murdered that wretched woman well said darrel deliberately for part believe that crime be committed by same man really cried lydia much astonished how do know be too long to explain theory upon belief be founded said frank be sure that man who killed grent also assassinated julia brawn julia brawn said blake starting up why be name of donna maria maid so be maid who left to get married fortnight ago said lydia maid who be murdered week since remarked frank much amused at astonishment of pair well cried blake slapping thigh if doe beat bannagher bannagher beat devil two people from one house begad darrel 'd like to help be fine work man hunting will have to ask mr torry permission first blake torry who be detective in charge of case said frank at present be with donna maria examining servant ah here come at remark quite in style of old transpontine drama door opened donna maria followed by torry entered room darrel explained to lady that have discovered old schoolfellow in mr roderick blake presented detective to friend to miss hargone accomplished asked torry if have be successful said detective dismally have found out nothing not one of servant have seen fellow a spoke torry mechanically looked at miss hargone face be staring at hard therefore with embarrassment eye dropped to hand then made discovery for on third finger of right hand be silver ring set with three blue stone chapter xiii soldier of fortune having garnered obtainable evidence for time being at wray house detective coadjutor returned to town before departure however blake noted address of old schoolfellow promised to pay visit at early date darrel knowing that roderick wished to assist in finding out mystery resolved to ask torry if must permit to do so request made when be in train on way back to waterloo what do think of friend blake asked abruptly nice fellow flippant replied torry not much earnestness of purpose there be sorry think so a blake be anxious to assist in matter seems that be great friend of mr grent be naturally angered by cowardly assassination also have nothing to do wish to employ time what do say humph mr blake be lover of miss hargone yes be engaged to marry be that bar to utilising service may be sir see lydia hargone be woman who called at grent chamber on saturday be sure said frank somewhat startled a sure a one can be in world of mistake replied torry drily at event wear on third finger of right hand silver ring set with three turquoise stone meek noticed that ring a worn by veiled lady who visited grent at first owing to confused manner of donna maria fancied might be individual however be wrong evidence of ring assures that lydia hargone paid that visit why there be nothing peculiar in paying visit to employer grent be not employer then have left service time now donna maria be wo hear word against lady interrupted darrel hotly because be beautiful romance again well a please must admit that be strange must faint at sight of blue mummy vas fainted in same way know did miss sandoval give same explanation for fainting a did of saw blue mummy on grent desk connection with murder came so forcibly to memory that fainted now said before say again that explanation be feeble untrue surely think donna maria guilty of crime jump to conclusion think vas be innocent enough fancy know something likely to clear up mystery of death if must speak torry cried darrel earnestly be sure donna maria wish to discover assassin of uncle heard say so oh yes heard say so word word word why doe not own up own up what inquired frank obstinately truth doe know may not know of know half vas know other half if two must only put half together might arrest mysterious assassin why must not speak out argued darrel because be shielding someone whom torry looked straight at young man let say donna inez be mad bah be only theoretical retorted torry coolly listen so far a can see by imperfect scattered evidence have collected there be choice of two motif to account for crime one be that grent be murdered for sake of ten thousand pound ca prove that have money vas say know what vas say that money be in safe after grent went well that seems to dispose of robbery motive same must have remember that when met grent have on valuable fancied might take from suggested at first conversation that might be jewel now know that if carried anything to rendezvous with julia brawn be that stolen money rubbish say again that ca prove how came into grent possession vas might have taken out of safe given to master next day torry said darrel gravely when vas left bank on friday night money be in safe be certain of be leighbourne told that saw there before left office vas left bank along with leighbourne next day be ill who be vas leighbourne former remember leighbourne told so ah yes cried torry with recollection of conversation with banker thought be unnecessary piece of information leighbourne said that vas have be absent from bank from saturday till day called be tuesday then said frank gravely see how unjust suspicion be vas must not have given grent money since grent be murdered on sunday morning h be that disposes of robbery theory still cried torry striking knee with open hand be content to believe that grent have money on night however let that pas let come to second motive jealousy jealousy repeated frank contemptuously surely believe that donna inez be jealous of julia brawn might have be jealous of lydia hargone why so far a can see grent have nothing to do with governess so far a can see said torry significantly nevertheless on evidence of ring miss hargone paid visit to grent chamber on day so to speak of murder doe prove that there be love between prof that there be communication understanding retorted torry tartly well said frank wearied of discussion be only spinning rope of sand in talking theory what about blake can tell case say will let assist yes replied torry promptly may help by revealing secret doings of lydia hargone will never do rejoined darrel coldly blake be gentleman be engaged to miss hargone dare say say that will assist purposely in way dear sir friend be chatterbox ca keep secret will say thing must say will regret revealing afterwards tell enlist service added torry significantly let talk seems rather shabby thing to do said darrel reluctantly be fair in love war detective work sir conscience be too fine spun be afraid be replied darrel gloomily however promised to help will keep promise evening a torry be off on man hunt of own did not require darrel assistance young man sat down a usual to work in spite of resolution to write be unable to do so for beautiful face of maria be constantly before eye deep rich voice sounded always in ear image be indelibly impressed on mind notwithstanding endeavour must not rid of charming phantom in place of scribbling realistic prose felt more inclined to compose amorous poetry for have entered into kingdom of love lured thither by woman loveliness be enduring in very patient spirit torment be there inflicted on new comer woman face woman voice woman absence of such part be torment composed darrel recognised that be impossible to write while in vein so threw down pen in despair wandered forth on nightly quest for adventure spirit to seek did not move in place of observing life around turned eye inward to contemplate loved image of maria sandoval disappointed worried racked with thousand doubt lover of day turned homeward where retired to bed did best to sleep for most part of night courted slumber in vain towards morning exhausted nature claimed right darrel slept heavily until ten o'clock while be idling over breakfast with tired face appetite roderick blake be announced entered fresh a rose to greet friend how be boy said irishman who be in exuberant spirit see have lost much time in looking up breakfast be ham egg fish mighty good notion of meal be faith mind assisting to clear table sit down welcome have got appetite myself said darrel blake required second invitation taking off glove drew chair up to table did wonder a trencherman food melted like snow before healthy appetite time be chatting laughing making generally agreeable sunny clean shaven face twinkled over with humour incessant flow of conversation more le trivial did much to raise darrel spirit even acknowledged service blake have done in banishing care be glad to see added that have not lost appetite for be renowned at school faith be little chance have have of satisfying that appetite replied blake airily what have be hard up be hard up now yet talk of marrying said frank reprovingly not at present lydia will wait till be rich replied other be young can wait how do intend to become rich not by working dear boy rejoined blake lighting pipe by inheritance irish uncle faith grand aunt who be mighty ill at present will come in for money when take last vacancy for angel darrel must not help laughing at oddity of remark more especially a be accompanied by sly wink then became grave be afraid be awful scamp blake just so said roderick complacently be rolling stone faith have be rolling over world ten year oh remarked frank with recollection of case have be in south america bet sir in part of in peru yes in lima rather for two year know good deal about place suppose blake shrugged shoulder knew more than be good for said with gloomy look have ever come across sort of thing asked darrel produced blue mummy heaven earth cried blake florid face growing white where did get accursed image chapter xiv secret society frank be amazed by look on blake face be quite livid expression of horror be in eye brow be wet with perspiration strong frame trembled seemed to be overcome with terror at sight of tomb image recollecting behavior of vas maria novelist began to think that blue mummy be of nature of basilisk rendered insane who looked at from being gay composed blake be now terror stricken nervous that fatal image have transformed bold confident irishman into trembling abject coward so astonished be darrel that must not speak be roderick who broke silence said in hesitating manner be not member of infernal society what society asked darrel pretending ignorance to learn more society of blue mummy set mind at rest blake know nothing about society strain on roderick nerve relaxed fell back on chair with exhausted look have brandy murmured faintly sight of devilish idol have given turn still greatly amazed by roderick speech manner darrel hastened to side board brought thence small glass of cognac on drinking courage of blake revived blood came back to cheek strength to limb sat up briskly with apology for momentary weakness put fear of god into dear fellow said with shudder indeed did thought be done for how do mean done for well fancied that produced that blue mummy a sign of death oh be usually sign of death invariably how came into possession still alive be more than can make out explanation be very simple replied darrel image be found beside body of grent blake opened eye whistled so that explains mystery of death said under breath society killed why why oh know reason replied blake how can expect to if have be killed by society blue mummy must not have be left by corpse a symbol of vengeance what be society kill people in barbarous way will tell know said roderick gravely can judge for one moment looked into frank bedroom glanced out of sitting room window opened outside door to assure that one be on stair then returned to seat found frank eye fixed on with expression of amused contempt why be making theatrical display said sarcastically be quite safe here assure suspect society of yours be only bogey to scare weak minded people did more than scare grent retorted blake significantly darrel shrugged shoulder will reserve opinion until hear story said good humouredly first where doe society talk of exist in peru in lima then how be grent have fallen victim in london know hear story judge for must tell darrel that be fairy tale relate stubborn fact people for instance might not believe because be not in newspaper be true for terribly true a have reason to know glanced round room again passed handkerchief over dry lip then began tale in hurried nervous fashion a though half repented of resolution to tell be in peru two year ago said very hard up quite alone without friend foe in whole country managed to get billet a clerk in office of scotch merchant although pay be not large still be sufficient to keep alive in own way managed to enjoy to gain fair knowledge of spanish tongue a may guess be by mean satisfied with position wished to improve hearing much about gold silver mine unexpectedness with be discovered used to lurk about low quarter of lima in hope of gathering information regarding discovery from stray indian knew that peon frequently knew about mine of great rich from detestation of spaniard must never reveal whereabouts fancied might learn locality of rich mine precisely for purpose haunted native portion of town a may guess met with many adventure more le perilous one of bore on mystery of blue mummy let hear mystery said frank may explain mine possibly may darrel well one night when be returning at late hour to poor lodging have to take way through rather lonely street night be dark few people be about street be badly lighted so recollecting thing walked carefully vigilantly lest must be attacked by footpad suddenly a be nearing lodging heard terrible cry for help dashed round corner of street to find man lying in middle of two other men ran away at sound of footstep found that victim be seriously wounded still be sufficiently conscious to speak asked in faint whisper to look for blue mummy ah two men have left a token yes found image on ground shewed to wounded man gazed at with terror swooned from dread loss of blood be bent on saving if only to learn about blue mummy for own so strange object piqued curiosity a man be small light be a be still very strong picked up in arm carried to lodging be great distance away then sent for doctor who after examination told that poor devil be dying die did on very night four hour after rescued out of gratitude for interference told secret of blue mummy good said frank much excited let hear man name resumed blake wiping perspiration from forehead be pablo mendoza have be person of position wealth a be therefore desirable personage likely to be useful have be induced to join secret society of pp who be pp society of patriotic peruvian explained blake so far a can understand be formed mostly of indian who desire to restore empire of inca of spanish adventurer disaffected towards republic of peru symbol of society be tomb image now image know about interrupted frank be substitute for living people placed in ancient peruvian tomb exactly well society be shewn one of inca sepulchre by old indian found therein over thousand blue image placed on shelf round embalmed body one for member of dead man household on discovery society took blue mummy a symbol whenever man hostile to society be to die image be sent to when man be killed image be placed beside body in case must think supply must soon be exhausted oh for after image have done mission be to intimate who have slain victim be recovered in way restored to society for instance when mendoza died by way have be killed for betraying secret of society well sir pursued blake when died kept blue mummy nearly cost life how so after death of mendoza society became aware know how who have rescued be possessed of symbol of death henceforth be nearly always in danger of death several time ran risk of stabbing drowning poisoning many other way of being got rid of friend of mine who knew about society advised to get rid of blue mummy so one night placed in niche outside door disappeared within hour so after have further trouble what be object of society to restore native indian rule like anarchist work by secret assassination in order to startle intimidate in power have society money oh yes believe be well supplied with fund see indian know of many buried hidden treasure concealed at time of spanish conquest of peru so suppose devote rich to plot for reconstructing empire of inca be very clear plausible so far a peru be concerned said frank after pause see how system of political plotting wholesale murder come to exist in england can tell darrel about year ago peruvian government resolved to put end to society many people be arrested tried to get hold of money owned by society who have charge of fled with to england took up abode in london be captain manuel one of people ca say for certain be pretty sure be have fund of society in possession portion of maybe replied blake society be too clever to put egg into one basket in one country in france italy germany spain there be representative who look after have in possession portion of fund so if one man prof traitor embezzles money others will probably remain staunch know much about captain manuel save have met once twice at wray house be opinion that be treasurer of society in london quite believe that blake amount of fund be ten thousand pound really cried roderick much astonished how do know because captain manuel have amount before grent death placed in hand grent be dead so where be money now know know echoed blake jumping up what do mean what say rejoined darrel drily money have be stolen stolen good lord by whom frank shrugged shoulder be a ignorant of a be of man name who killed grent listen have torry permission to tell case be attention said blake resuming seat at once frank began story narrated detail of affair from time met mr grent disguised in drury lane down to vas announcement of robbery for obvious reason did not speak of torry discovery of turquoise ring on lydia hargone finger blake listened with profound attention when narrative be ended sprang to foot after what have told see cried surely putting story yours together can guess who killed grent julia brawn can not who do think be murderer who why captain manuel to be sure murdered chapter xv woman scorned can not be said that torry have be particularly lucky hitherto in elucidating mystery of double tragedy certainly have collected quantity of evidence none likely to indicate directly name of assassin suspected that vas donna maria for reason of own be shielding mr grent belief have real foundation in fact be incredible that donna inez must have have anything to do with murder of husband to whom be fondly attached yet torry must not explain conduct of maria vas on other ground than that knew of something implicated elder woman in affair putting vas out of question there be one save aunt whom maria have interest in screening torry be confident that spanish girl be screening someone knew truth believed kept silent for sake of certain person be that person donna inez must not so far a known evidence went answer that question darrel have be careful to inform detective of interview with blake that irishman have told related story of blue mummy society ended with account of roderick denunciation of captain manuel torry believed first disputed second although blake with red hot enthusiasm made out very ingenious case against spaniard declared that grent must have taken ten thousand pound to deliver to julia brawn in mortality lane that when have given money have be attacked killed by manuel a having stolen fund of society manuel not finding money on dead body have surmised that be in possession of julia brawn having followed to embankment have killed near cleopatra needle then have taken money off have sent to paris afterwards to conceal crime gain for society additional ten thousand pound have applied to grent bank for missing money be a clear a day said roderick captain manuel be assassin rubbish said torry when detail of accusation be submitted to by darrel clear a day indeed clear a mud mean in first place have absolutely proof that grent be in possession of money on night of death in second a theft be not discovered until three four day after murder manuel must not have known beforehand that fund of society be missing therefore have motive to commit crime again have be clearly proved by evidence of third cabman that julia brawn with unknown man drove to embankment in most leisurely manner a there be fourth cab near mortality lane at time manuel even presuming to have be present must not have followed sufficiently rapidly to have caught finally concluded torry man who be with julia might have let manuel kill grent must not have permitted to assassinate julia man might have be manuel urged frank might have be if go by evidence of two blue image manuel a representative of society might have placed by body ignorant of loss of money manuel have motive to kill grent mr darrel killed unlucky people be not spanish gentleman yet if go by story of blake two victim undoubtedly be killed by order of society grant that admitted torry quickly a manuel represents cut throat association will have watched why not have arrested because have not sufficient evidence to obtain warrant for arrest said torry also added with emphasis prefer to play waiting game from position torry be not to be moved nothing must convince of captain manuel guilt certainly spaniard acted in way like innocent man came daily to see detective ask after case offered to submit to authority for examination offer having be accepted gave account of patriotic peruvian society story be similar to of blake denied that

torry with significance intend to have watched detective will not lose sight of so if be really concerned in murder will sooner later betray by indiscreet action now miss added detective cheerfully must answer few question certainly replied donna maria with embarrassed look know be only too happy to assist in way h be said torry doubtfully what about mr vas met on day yes in piccadilly be by appointment no by accident did see uncle not that know of then what be doing in west end so far from bank casually mentioned that be executing commission for mr frederick leighbourne do know what commission be replied maria haughtily saw mr grent believe yes for ten minute so on business on private business said maria with emphasis h be must mind explaining what that private business be about mind very much refuse to explain yes said miss sandoval refuse absolutely chapter xviii strange occurrence educated by experience necessity of profession torry be not man who lost temper easily when left wray house be in a great rage a well must be never have met with so obstinate woman a donna maria one who knew better how to keep secret steadily refused to explain reason of visit to grent to reveal conversation have taken place between threat laughed at persuasion smiled at torry who flattered on cunning be forced to take departure without gaining confidence went a wise a came on arriving in town first have something to eat after drove off to darrel novelist informed that lydia have duly arrived with small box have pointed out to detective procured from scotland yard man have followed at once darrel having discharged mission have returned home in return for news torry not without display of ill temper detailed unsuccessful attempt to make donna maria confess darrel commiserated detective must not forbear eulogising girl much to torry disgust upon soul said grumbling believe sympathy be with merely because have pretty face pretty echoed frank indignantly if there be one word in english tongue doe not apply to donna maria sandoval that word be 'pretty ' why man be one of most beautiful woman in world be certainly most obstinate said torry drily be satisfied know something likely to lead to detection of criminal bah be fancy be belief insisted torry seriously also be certain that there be connection between vas what do mean cried darrel indignant that slightest slur must be cast on character of woman worshipped oh need get so angry said torry with shrug be convinced there be love affair between be not so sure in case never mind said novelist blushing go on with explanation be very simple donna maria vas have understanding relative to murder believe know assassin cried darrel aghast have got so far a know something of blue mummy society for sight of tomb image have same effect even worse one on a have on blake society according to blake be responsible for grent brawn murder by hand of manuel said frank deny guilt yes do retorted detective energetically argued point before let pas to return to vas donna maria be strange that must have met in west end on very day so to speak of murder accident bah believe in sort of accident well have failed to extort truth from lady perhaps gentleman may be more amenable to reason will see vas to morrow there be short silence during darrel reflected seriously about aspect of case in moment so raised head seems to said that while suspecting donna maria vas over much suspect lydia hargone sufficiently know so much about said torry with dry smile be having watched doe not know acting in fancy security may betray explained to donna maria what do think of mantle affair why incline to miss sandoval view believe that grent be in love with lydia that for own purpose whatever may be encouraged folly so openly a to incur suspicion of donna inez also believe that promised to elope to italy with grent instead of going sent julia grent recognising mantle not seeing face if remember cabman evidence be veiled thought be be then torry stopped then queried darrel impatiently faith a blake must say will have to supply rest of story from imagination mine wo carry further well said frank humouring fancy say that julia have lover who followed by stealth to rendezvous killed grent out of jealousy torry shook head that explains one death not other besides added gravely have questioned servant at wray house can not find that julia have lover mystery be not to be explained by such simple mean what doe blake say insists that manuel be guilty even in face of argument be fool what about manuel saw to day declares that if lost money be not found restored there will be trouble from society be fool also doe think be peru to assassinate innocent people with impunity have have enough of mysterious murder enigmatic blue mummy well good night mr darrel will see vas to morrow find out what know went off briskly confident that must succeed easier with vas than have with donna maria secretary be weak minded man spanish lady strong minded woman so if pair be confederate a detective suspected to be determined to learn secret of partnership by examining most easily terrified of two be vas who be effeminate hysterical creature hardly worthy to be called man if anyone must be coerced into revealing truth of conspiracy next day shortly before twelve o'clock torry called at fleet street bank requested interview with vas secretary appeared unwilling to grant one a have option in face of detective authority be reluctantly compelled to accede to request conducted unwelcome visitor into private room of mr grent torry who have retentive memory recognised famous apartment ah said playfully be private safe what pity can not speak tell truth truth repeated vas unsteadily about stolen note look so pale sir know did not steal wish knew who did number have not be traced by of people vas shook head have made inquiry can learn nothing did come to speak about note not exactly came to ask what be doing in piccadilly on day mr grent be murdered be murdered on sunday be not in west end on day oh said torry noting quibble need not be so accurate a to time dear sir know a well a do grent be murdered on sunday morning after midnight for sake of convenience will say saturday be in west end on saturday who say be miss sandoval donna maria yes met in piccadilly on afternoon of saturday why not mr torry be after office hour have right to go where like if wish to explain be quite willing to do so be in piccadilly executing business for mr frederick leighbourne explanation be same a given by donna maria so torry deemed to be true one therefore abandoned point to take up one introduced latter by glancing round room have comfortable apartment here mr vas be late mr grent private office replied secretary sullenly remain in by order of mr leighbourne senior to sort out paper of dead partner did sit here when mr grent be away always then on saturday speak of be sitting here be aha said torry with satisfied nod now who came into room when be here various people connected with bank mostly connected with bank did donna maria sandoval call asked torry suddenly yes said vas quietly did see reason to deny visit be made openly for purpose what purpose vas wriggled uneasily in seat be obliged to answer question mr torry not unless like not unless donna maria came here for purpose of be ashamed detective said purposely to insult donna maria so that might discover if vas loved secretary never changed colour lost temper so torry be convinced that have not given heart to beautiful spaniard donna maria never doe anything to be ashamed of replied in calm tone if wish to know reason of visit can tell came at request of mr grent to get travelling ticket oh ticket two ticket for italy yes mr grent left here by mistake donna maria called for found gave to believe visited uncle in duke street to deliver to then explained miss sandoval visit to duke street reason be apparently innocent one so innocent indeed that torry wondered why girl have not confessed unless thought be lying explanation arranged for between donna maria vas to quiet suspicion be about to ask few question with view to discover if suspicion be correct when there be knock at door almost immediately opened to admit spaniard seemed greatly excited advanced towards vas stopped short when saw torry policeman said aha very good so much better wish to see be matter asked torry vas together note yes ten thousand pound captain manuel placed package on table here be bank note said in excited tone returned to last night chapter xix puzzle decidedly case be full of surprise torry with life long experience must recall affair in connection with so many unexpected thing have happened reappearance of long lost bank note be not least of strange occurrence detective secretary be so startled that must only stare stupidly at parcel lying before on table wait to hear what captain manuel have to say spaniard sat down lost time in detailing how lost property have come again into possession yes said twisting moustache be really strange stay a know mr policeman at guelph hotel jermyn street well last night on nine of clock parcel that parcel be given to porter of house by stranger with word to give to be amusing at theatre not until midnight did return to find pointed to package in room on table open find money of society so be much astonished night sleep not wonder morning go to office of mr policeman be out then come to tell mr vas that lost money be with find mr policeman be here enter tell story voil tout finished manuel with french expression french grace how strange said vas who appeared to be fascinated by manuel recital most extraordinary chimed in torry with eye fixed on parcel of bank note be trying to fathom meaning of restoration of stolen property must not thought crossed mind that manuel might have stolen money be playing comedy of restoration to save from figuring a corpse with tomb image beside then captain have need to become thief since money continued always in possession if have risked neck to get certainly must not thus tamely surrender plunder be not manuel who be thief torry must not conjecture who be must fathom motive of thief in thus making restitution be inexplicable what do make of sir asked manuel looking at torry thoughtful face know what to make of responded detective at event cried vas eagerly restitution show that mr grent did not take money a be dead must not have restored be true said torry ironically grent might have be robbed of money then assassin feeling compunction might thus give up manuel sneered if be have to say think foolish said man must not commit two murder for money then give up what have cost so dearly to gain true again said detective thoughtfully well must find other explanation may arrive at one by making few inquiry did not see man who brought back note captain amused a remarked said spaniard to porter spoke of did porter say that man possessed red hair beard aha cried torry cracking finger same disguise a assumed by grent be man gentleman manuel shrugged shoulder who can say replied man have on large coat hat on eye only beard hair did porter see still mode of speech mr policeman said four word what must be known of rank by four word be four word for captain manuel repeated spaniard then sir man gave packet departed humph wonder if be assassin cried vas with energy murderer must not run risk of arrest for part added secretary emphatically believe that two crime have anything to do with one in case be strange that must occur almost simultaneously coincidence may be mr vas said manuel unrolling parcel shewing note here have something be not coincidence can explain not note well sir asked torry what about be bank note not really number be different oh oh oh murmured detective with interest must seem that assassin be very ingenious fellow in hiding trail so number be different yes number have list here of number marked on bank note bestowed on mr grent look for mr policeman there be number in note equal to number in list be strange be maddening cried torry with vexation believe will ever unravel mystery let see took list presented by manuel compared number on with of bank note not in one instance be same there be twenty note for five hundred pound in ten thousand number in case be different be strange a say captain manuel observed torry frowning five hundred pound bank note be not easily changed yet assassin have changed twenty of can not trace one of transaction why do insist that assassin changed note asked vas trifle pettishly because believe that note be motive of murder of mr grent in case must have have in possession on night be murdered whereas whereas dear mr vas deny that took out of private safe do replied vas stoutly be there after mr grent departed then whosoever took must have possessed key since safe be not broken open suppose so ca suspect sir mr leighbourne saw with that note be in safe on friday a be ill for two three day absent from bank must not have taken also continued vas defending with vigour if have stolen must have put captain manuel off with excuse not having jeopardised character liberty by confessing that money be gone quite so assented torry sweetly have be employed in copying list of captain manuel number of note into pocket book permit to observe mr vas that talk too much one so far a know have accused of theft secretary turned red with confusion sat down manuel who have be listening with ill concealed impatience restored note list to pocket so for a be concerned said putting on hat connection with matter be at end money of society have be recovered have further interest in mr grent death have interest in niece captain dios swore spaniard reddening have to do with oh nothing understand that be in love with donna maria may be may not be returned manuel in haughty offensive tone in case be not for common people to criticise private affair of superior with scathing glance captain strode out of room owe one for good sir thought torry rather mortified more so a vas be smiling however annoyance did not betray in face be a suave bland a ever turned sharply on still smiling secretary be mr leighbourne in office asked of mr leighbournes be here one do inquire for father wish to see what about stammered vas nervously be business go ask if can see vas did not like to be ordered about in fashion especially by inferior a be secretly afraid of detective obeyed without argument result be that in five minute torry found alone with mr leighbourne senior wish to see believe said banker torry looked at portly old man who resembled so closely son frederick replied with promptness yes desire to ask few question be detective charged with discovery of late partner murderer be to assist in doing so wish to question by mean replied leighbourne graciously be most anxious that scoundrel must be caught punished killed good man ah do consider that late mr grent be good man sir most certainly excellent upright gentleman have no fault have fault said leighbourne enigmatically be question wish to put to of if will permit to conduct examination in own way may arrive at result very well sir said banker with stiffness be at service then tell what consider be mr grent gravest fault to mind be too speculative aha speculated yes not in safest way lost money leighbourne hesitated yes lost money be reply in fact interrupted torry sharply if mr grent have lived must have be ruined man how dare say so cried leighbourne much agitated because be true say so oh can guess truth from what say mr grent be ruined seeing way of recovering in england resolved to fly in way know how became possessed of ten thousand pound be in private safe be prepared to fly with miss hargone to south america when be killed now what do say say echoed leighbourne word have uttered be false chapter xx unexpected happens if torry have found that donna maria be obstinate woman speedily discovered that mr leighbourne be fool old narrow minded egotistical banker be one of pig headed men who be despair of reasonable mortal once idea be put into head must not be got out again constantly referred to age worldly experience a legitimate reason for entertaining most preposterous idea resembled closely dogged mulish king charles louis xvi be a bad to deal with a two of rolled into one never be there man le open to conviction unpleasant old person regarded late partner a martyr beyond tendency to rash speculation must not be got to see grent have fault denied that grent must by possibility have taken money declined to believe that good man have contemplated eloping with lydia hargone pointedly insulted torry for daring to make such statement end of interview be that torry left in rage vowed that must not see mr leighbourne again until must prove truth of declaration might have saved trouble for banker be determined to canonise partner in true spirit of bigotry must rather have suffered death than believe single statement detrimental to intention by time conversation with leighbourne be ended torry felt inclined to commit murder regretted that patriarchal as have not be killed instead of grent in hope of finding consolation after late trying interview torry flew a hard a hansom must take to darrel room here fell out of frying pan into fire for blake be with novelist appeared to be in great rage be quarrelling with darrel who be trying to pacify on seeing detective immediately left friend to attack newcomer here be man cried roderick furiously come sir what have to say to scandalous way in have behaved towards miss hargone oh oh said torry leisurely taking seat so have set on to have have almost shouted blake complained that insulted if did mr blake be in exercise of duty asked miss hargone for certain information knew possessed declined to give to a to insulting lady did such thing there blake said darrel soothingly be very reasonable polite explanation so instead of bawling at pitch of voice suppose sit down discus matter like christian still looking red angry irishman flung petulantly into chair be willing to hear what have to say mr torry growled sulkily with dignified air of one who awaits explanation have nothing to say have rather something to ask what be why did miss hargone send julia to meet grent in mantle did not mantle gave to girl a wedding gift strange that must give to her on very day of murder not at seems to mr torry that suspect miss hargone of complicity in crime fancy know something about then permit to tell sir that doe not that old scamp of grent tried to make love to repulsed why then must have agreed to go away with leave to whom be engaged be engaged finished blake oh said torry sarcastically have money what of grent be ruined by speculation when died have money beg pardon have ten thousand pound money of society ca prove that have hope to do so soon retorted torry nettled by sneer blake rose to foot put on hat will argue more said wrathfully believe that lady who be to be wife be connected with crime so to become personal matter wanted to assist in finding assassin out of sheer idleness now intend to discover truth in order to clear character of miss hargone hope will be successful murmured darrel certainly will be successful retorted blake pausing at door be convinced that blue mummy society killed two wretched people tell be criminal when see again mr torry will bring such proof of guilt that even will be convinced in meantime wish success warn that be working on wrong line leave off suspecting lady who be innocent devote a intend to do to hunting down iniquitous association of mummy then will learn truth good day finishing thus abruptly blake put on hat took off leaving torry darrel looking at other in doubt there be good deal of sense in what say remarked darrel after blue mummy be main clue clue not said torry know that manuel be innocent how do know that because ten thousand pound have be brought back say so cried frank greatly surprised well fact doe beat fiction in realising impossibility same bank note brought back well well be most extraordinary not same bank note corrected torry cautiously same amount of money number of note be different stole note have changed returned others see manuel can not have killed grent for sake of money a in case must not restore plunder be innocent a said before then who be guilty man who restored note said torry promptly how be restored red haired red bearded man called at manuel hotel last night gave to porter red wig again same a grent wore said frank musingly be strange there be possibility of man being traced came out of darkness fulfilled mission vanished again into night nothing be known of still may find exclaimed frank amazed jest indeed be quite in earnest protested torry listen left tracing of number of stolen note to grent bank week bank have failed to obtain information fear therefore that have bungled matter wish to place in more capable hand yours for

complimentary to detective profession detective said torry with shrug only work miracle in novel after making statement torry walked to door there pausing for moment so turned towards darrel by way said restoration of bank note be known only to four people vas manuel need not mention fact to anyone else must be wiser not to do so why asked frank looking up because person who restored may inadvertently hint at restitution if nothing be said about openly will thus condemn perhaps so torry there be one person must like to mention matter to who be that donna maria like fancy know something be shielding someone must trace person who changed note may turn out to be individual be shielding if tell name assure restitution have be made may tell know torry nodded head approvingly

freely naturally to save own neck what think leighbourne killed grent think anything about be torry impatient response be not capable of thinking a news have taken by surprise oh what ignorant fool best of be well will see if leighbourne junior have explanation a turned out young frederick have explanation on tip of tongue very feasible one proved to be in place of shrinking from inquiry into motif of conduct assumed attitude of outraged virtue courted torry question by own explanation there be never so upright badly treated gentleman a frederick leighbourne esquire dare to connect with committal of crime because changed note cried white with suppressed fury what right have one of to make so scandalous statement changed note said torry feebly wondering if be wrong in suspecting man yes sir did changed note at request of mr grent at request of mr grent repeated darrel why because captain manuel who gave grent note wished be true cried torry manuel be a astonished a that note have be changed know about retorted leighbourne sullenly know be that fortnight before murder mr grent asked down to wray house told that wanted assistance in rather delicate business a be partner father of course professed willingness to serve do blame quite right quite natural what be business mr grent explained that when in peru have become mixed up with native society year government of republic tried to break up seize fund so member fled to other country with money of society one of member be captain manuel who brought to england sum of ten thousand pound changed into english bank note valued at five hundred pound a knew that grent sympathised with aim of society be aim of society interrupted patriotic rubbish of restoring inca rule said leighbourne crossly at event grent sympathised with aim so manuel asked to take charge of money be kept down in wray house then according to grent story manuel came to said be afraid that peruvian government might discover number of note render valueless by explaining to english government that be forfeited money to prevent asked grent to change note for others of like value different number grent being so well known in banking world be unwilling to change note personally so asked to do so agreed did so why did not change at bank of england manuel objected to that being done on account of peruvian government so by grent direction went round to several suburban bank so explained matter got note changed without difficulty gave back to grent who kept at wray house then on friday before intended to start for italy brought up here gave to vas to put in safe be know quite sufficient said torry wrathfully why did not tell before for two reason one be that grent asked to hold tongue other because be afraid lest must accuse of being concerned in murder a have done finished leighbourne with scowl well well said torry good humouredly have defended very well against implied accusation implied accusation echoed frederick with scorn very word retorted torry drily did not accuse of being accessory to crime criminal did not even ask if have stolen note merely asked how came about that changed well now know said leighbourne insolently a have explained perhaps friend will take off deeming rude speech unworthy of reply darrel left room without taking leave of banker torry halted at door to fire parting shot young man said wagging admonitory forefinger at leighbourne pride go before fall remember leaving young man to digest unpalatable proverb at leisure torry followed novelist what be going to do asked

deceived manuel leighbourne have note on when be murdered oh sighed darrel with groan how hold to theory because be true one said torry sharply sooner later be sure will be able to prove be fact good bye frank shrugged shoulder drove off to waterloo station where in hour took fast train to wraybridge have not much faith in torry theory a with trained sense of logical argument must not see how grent in face of vas assertion must have become possessed of money tried to think about matter love a usual interfered with business when recollected that must soon see donna maria surrendered to delicious fancy about coming interview frank have got length of calling donna maria must be cold must be amicable must smile must frown must do hundred one contradictory thing not likely to occur truly frank darrel be very foolish young gentleman to indulge in so confused reverie be only twenty five be in love two excuse that cover folly of majority of mortal shewn into presence of goddess worshipper grew red confused rather to surprise of donna maria a have notion of inflamed state of heart to put at ease sought to induce speech by asking what wished to see about then frank became more confused than ever for did not very well know how to begin however a beginning have to be made spoke to point in brusque way by reason of modesty have come to tell how case be getting on said hurriedly be very kind of replied donna maria half smiling at humour although secretly wondered what must be cause of have anything be discovered about poor uncle murder not so much that a about bank note bank note donna maria turned pale spoke nervously yes ten thousand pound be stolen from safe money have be returned to captain manuel donna maria rose suddenly ca be cried making step towards astonished frank tell ca be be miss sandoval captain manuel have money now in possession then assassin of uncle have be arrested be sorry to say have not arrested cried donna maria colour rising eye

hand across forehead sighed true true what be to do oh wrung hand if must only speak must speak said frank seizing opportunity else condemn innocent man innocent man who mr frederick leighbourne have found out that changed of note so be just possibly that may be accused of robbery cried maria much agitated can not be mr leighbourne did not take money out of safe can prove then do so save from possible arrest girl looked wildly round room then ran to window sprang back to open door close again finally paused before frank seized hand touch thrilled mr darrel said hurriedly be gentleman will trust have kept silent out of fear of blue mummy society will do so no longer mr leighbourne did not take money out of safe can tell who did captain manuel asked darrel with start said slowly maria sandoval took money gave to mr grent chapter xii locket information be so unexpected terrible that frank felt blood leave cheek pale a ghost rose from chair looked at donna maria with dilated eye from confession fancied that must be implicated in double crime feeling of terror seized at idea of woman loved having brought within reach of law donna maria saw expression with swift instinct of woman guessed thought with haughty gesture hung back head eye sparkled like star on frosty night a spoke to oh think have done anything wrong cried defiantly what did be at request of uncle sit down mr darrel will tell story in detail pointed to chair with regal gesture when resumed seat faced with wonderfully composed look began confession a may be called tamely enough a story became more dramatic warmed to work finished with fire fury gesticulation of southern nature frank sympathising with quick spirit be enthralled by beauty moved by eloquence felt that here be woman to die for when uncle took leave of here to go to italy said called into study after asking not to reveal what be about to tell made confession reveal now be to save innocent man from arrest true enough miss sandoval

be authentic by blue mummy only member of peruvian patriot posse tomb image be not obtainable in england for matter of in peru h be suppose be right to believe in letter well so resolved to obey hand money over to mysterious centa yes wished to do so without letting manuel know a be afraid lest manuel enraged at want of faith shewn to by society might take law into own hand assassinate darrel must not help laughing dear lady said be afraid mr grent must have be very credulous man law doe not countenance wholesale murder in country whatever may do in peru forget cried donna maria angrily uncle foreboding came true be murdered by society a token of blue mummy left beside prof whether by manuel centa can not say why said frank thoughtfully there be something in will discus point later please continue well mr darrel uncle determined to take money up to bank in fleet street put in private safe then intended to write letter to manuel asking to call at room in duke street on saturday afternoon designed to tell manuel that money be in bank that if wanted to see there must ask mr vas to show to in meantime be to go to bank on saturday morning on pretence of getting ticket for

that have seen captain manuel yes know manuel called meek said so suppose grent told to look into safe on monday a matter of fact did not do so until tuesday wednesday then vas discovered loss tell how did mr grent hope to pacify manuel by absence intended to write from italy tell that have given money to centa a proposed to remain abroad for time thought that manuel anger must abate must not wish to harm when returned see said frank thoughtfully must say that mr grent provided for own safety remarkably well in vain poor man sighed maria since be killed by society believe be said darrel bluntly mummy blue mummy what about returned money miss sandoval why must society instruct manuel centa to kill grent rob body then give back money to be robbing peter to pay paul with vengeance so be ca understand at then again said frank warming did not take two ticket from bank know mr grent mentioned only one ticket be in envelope now mention mr darrel envelope be rather thick there might have be two ticket there be one for mr grent other for miss hargone have arranged to elope with grent at least fooled into believing so instead of going sent julia brawn disguised in fawn coloured mantle then grent be killed by whom asked maria much agitated ca say perhaps that centa speak of got wind that grent be bolting with money to italy followed to kill who can tell be mystery wish to speak ill of dead said maria with sigh seems to that uncle be acting very badly that must deceive poor aunt who loved so tear trickled down face darrel said nothing be quite satisfied that knew extent of grent villainy have stolen ten thousand pound in such way a to throw blame on vas have intended to fly to south america with lydia hargone deserting wife for woman who have deceived at last providence rule thing have thwarted evil plan instead of getting away with fruit of iniquity have met with cruel death at hand of unknown man a have sown so have reaped let ask one thing said darrel a took leave why did not tell before because in first place promised uncle to keep silent in second told that if spoke society since hoped to escape might kill aunt be for sake kept silent lie lie lie thought darrel what liar grent be when got back to town saw torry told whole story whereat detective be much pleased did say grent have money said slapping thigh what plot to get cunning old fox be almost to catch hang man who killed hare run yet on mountain said darrel drily took leave of jubilant detective to go home dream of maria interview with have left more in love than ever next morning be hardly awake when torry wildly excited burst into bedroom executed kind of war dance have found tramp who robbed dead body of julia brawn cried gave up locket took from neck see see be of gold with letter to jb be lover to lass lover of julia brawn said darrel jumping out of bed yes man who be with on night man who killed grent name name look at initial gv gustavus vas be murderer chapter xxiii confession here be discovery of men torry have least suspected vas a have doubted courage nerve of so effeminate creature yet if according to evidence of locket be lover of julia brawn if have followed out of jealousy on fatal night there be doubt that have killed grent torry explained to darrel a young gentleman be dressing if if if other thing said frank doubtfully much virtue in if a shakspere say admitting that vas be julia lover certainly seems probable judging from initial on locket can not prove that be with julia on night alone must give evidence be dead torry nodded admit there be link wanting said a be absolutely certain that vas be man want only remains to force confession out of by sheer terror how can do that detective smiled meaningly from breast pocket produced warrant against vas got hour ago said a soon a learnt truth from locket have sent note asking vas to come here see then by mean of warrant will so play on fear that will confess truth so fall out of frying pan into fire said darrel cynically if hold tongue arrest on suspicion if confesses arrest on certainty so in case be bound to go to gaol silence be golden in case torry wo confess might not if be hardened criminal said detective coolly man be weak hysterical fool alive with nerve wept at news of grent death fainted on seeing blue mummy man who have so little command over will not be difficult to coerce into confession when be to be here torry glanced at watch ten thirty said be almost that now say mr darrel be lucky thought of mine that tramp might have robbed dead body be what made think of well stole knife in first place so judged must help to whatever valuable must find seems did pawned locket stole then saw one of handbill offering reward turned up last night to tell truth went with to pawn shop redeemed locket paid friend two pound congratulated that initial on locket implicated vas be sure initial be quite sure when first met ascertained that name be gustavus so gv can stand for nothing else than gustavus vas name be uncommon one besides must have guessed that unexpected visit of donna maria have to do with transference of money to grent oh oh said frank turning round from mirror at be brushing hair so think motive of crime be robbery not jealousy motive of first crime be robbery of second jealousy perhaps trifle of vengeance understand be not difficult replied torry with shrug listen in way ca say how vas became aware that julia at instigation of miss hargone be to meet grent in mortality lane watched followed witnessed interview when grent gave money to julia sprang forward in fit of jealous rage killed then forced julia into cab drove to end of northumberland avenue took down to cleopatra needle on pretence killed out of revenge for betraying robbed of money then tried to throw body into river be interrupted fled be theory very nice one be must be better responded darrel drily if be not so full of flaw flaw yes omit blue mummy altogether make vas decoy julia to embankment without shadow of excuse why ca even invent impossible one finally forget that money be returned so be ridiculous to suppose that vas must act so honestly after committing two crime to gain also nervous idiot like vas must kill two people in cold blood have spunk to do torry laughed at so called flaw regarded a puerile out of sheer contradiction be about to contest when faint timid knock sounded on outside door vas said torry promptly even in knock recognise sneaking vacillating nature now to try game of bluff with nod to frank went to door shortly returned with vas at heel secretary be smartly dressed looked cool composed never thinking that sin have found out that smiling little detective have set trap for into have walked blindly there be something ironical in situation got note said vas addressing frank when be seated came on here at once have anything new be discovered oh yes replied detective politely something quite new will interest very much really relative to robbery no relative to murder not to keep in suspense mr vas said torry slowly may tell that know who committed double crime vas turned colour of chalk captain manuel said faintly no man whose name be in warrant of secretary put out shaking hand towards warrant displayed by torry then drew back with start warrant of arrest repeated yes for for eye almost started from head a pushed back chair stared terror stricken at detective for gustavus vas who murdered master sweetheart be lie cried young man trying to rise killed neither murdered said torry sternly intend to arrest in ten minute leave room for prison be innocent innocent tell screamed vas brow beaded with perspiration can can explain in moment torry whipped out locket held out on palm of hand then explain that ah murmured vas falling back in chair be lost thought so confess guilt accusation seemed to galvanise wretched creature into life confess confess shrieked be innocent swear 'd swear anything to save neck said torry coolly come sir be tired of let put darbies on a in dream vas sat limply in chair while torry approached with handcuff at first touch of cold iron on wrist leaped up plunging past detective fell on knee before frank mr darrel mr darrel implored with tear streaming down face help for god sake oh poor mother in heaven name be innocent let drag to prison what can do said darrel moved by abasement be not above law if be guilty must pay for wickedness be innocent then prove innocence cried torry with sneer be always open to conviction ca speak dare not speak moaned vas hiding miserable face in hand then keep silence hang poor wretch shuddered convulsively at ominous word wept loudly cried like woman lay on floor moaning groaning a in pain even darrel be disgusted at unmanly conduct advised sharply to leave off whimpering torry went further get up milk sop will kick cried be not way to meet trouble say can explain do so save neck if can finding howling did good vas rose to foot dried eye driven like rat into corner turned to shew fight give glass of water said will tell truth how killed grent said torry while darrel got water did not kill grent never saw on night bah be liar have better hear what have to say before call said secretary with spirit then drank water arranged disordered clothes with more composure than might have be expected from former agitation made strange confession detail startled two hearer not little gentleman said in rather oratorical way be a know secretary to late mr grent frequently went down to see at wray house sometimes stayed there for day therefore saw great deal of household about year ago fell in love with julia brawn handsome girl who be donna maria maid gave that locket showed promised to marry a soon a be rich enough to keep wife

julia that grent intended to fly to america with ten thousand pound have asked to go with said have promised to go if grent must show money in possession to see have made appointment with in mortality lane be to be disguised why because grent be terribly afraid of society have made miss hargone afraid also thought better to meet in out of way spot where there must be chance of being disturbed that be why mortality lane be chosen when miss hargone be convinced that grent have money be to return home to lodging in bloomsbury meet grent next morning at victoria station be to go to genoa sail for south america very nice plot said darrel how about julia going in place of lydia chapter xxiv queer message vas paused before answering question drank more water now that have commenced confession be much more at ease seemed disposed to tell have hitherto kept back smiled faintly repeated darrel remark before making reply how about going in place of lydia said well be because miss hargone never intended to go to italy south america with grent bought double ticket for genoa exclaimed torry know did looked into envelope contained when be left in grent private office lydia be only fooling old man in case why did make mortality lane appointment because wanted ten thousand pound yes fear of society be feigned suggested meeting place disguise to grent so that in event of trouble over loss of money might be accused by reason of suspicious conduct loss of money echoed darrel then intended to rob on night did believe intended murder on friday night when be arranged with grent refused to meet in mortality lane asked julia to go in place why did julia consent to undertake so dangerous task oh be doing said secretary complacently doing yes julia called at bank next day at noon to acquaint with miss hargone proposal saw chance of getting ten thousand into own hand without suspicion so urged to go knew from mr leighbourne that have changed note at grent request so that must not be traced

crack in door saw rob safe then guessed that grent intended like scoundrel be must be accused of robbery be so enraged that wished to thwart when julia came with story advised to get money for mutual benefit since by grent cunning scheme to save own reputation be to be accused a thief did not see why must not have money felt might a well be killed for sheep a lamb so see that can blame well well said torry impatient at moralising let pas when one be soaked through rain doe not matter how about julia obeyed rendezvous with grent be at midnight in mortality lane so arranged to meet at cleopatra needle at one o'clock on sunday morning why not at own lodging because be not wise to leave trail to one own door retorted vas with cunning look well julia went to rendezvous disguised a miss hargone

lest must meet manuel be questioned by why did return money asked torry sharply because have use for if julia have lived must have taken money to australia a said before a villain killed have heart to

with emphasis be not murderer after conversation detective went away to seek for more evidence darrel remained to muse over have be obtained in spite of be known case seemed a complicated a ever mystery a deep if darrel have be writing criminal matter a fiction ingenuity must have suggested fitting ending must not see how fate intended to work out perhaps fate designed to leave matter of fact romance unfinished perplexed by problem apparent impossibility of solution frank left fate to conclude own story turned to continue one of own in few moment be oblivious to word be rapidly filling paper before under influence of brain hand seemed that be doomed to be interrupted just a be warming to work blake entered to make morning call a there be chance of writing while rattle pated irishman be in room darrel put away paper with vexation well said blake after first greeting have passed how be case getting on have found new evidence replied darrel none likely to please why not because prof
