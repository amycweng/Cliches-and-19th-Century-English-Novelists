discovery have made on night of ball mona bantry be about to become mother to appearance believed that father of coming child be none other than husband far from thinking that have be murdered have be waiting for return in order to upbraid for profligacy to demand divorce mona bantry have disappeared immediately after discovery of ruin mr larcher professed that did not know where be story be feasible enough satisfied police authority for moment retired only to return three day later with warrant for arrest of mr larcher in interval dagger have be found in ground of laurel on bank of river a be stained with blood exactly fitted wound be concluded that with weapon crime have be committed inquiry resulted in information being obtained that mr larcher in character of mary queen of scot have worn dagger on night of ball hence be evident so said police that have killed husband theory of police be that captain larcher have returned from london on night of ball have witnessed parting of wife jeringham at door filled with jealous rage have upbraided wife in sitting room window of looked out on cliff overhanging river in moment of fury have doubtless snatched dagger from girdle stabbed to heart then terrified at what have done have thrown body out of window trusting that stream must carry away so conceal crime river have done for body have be discovered four mile down where have be carried by current a to dagger being in ground in place of room police never at loss for theory suggested that mr larcher have stolen out of house have thrown dagger over bank where be subsequently

when returned at three o'clock be mona denis of first have gone away to hide shame inquiry advertisement failed to find at trial denis much broken down at ruin of sister swore captain larcher have not

be lost by at ball knew not into whose hand have fallen trial took place at canterbury be nine day wonder opinion be divided a to guilt of erring wife one party held that have committed crime in manner stated by police while others asserted that jeringham be criminal have disappeared in order to escape consequence of guilt doubtless said have be met by larcher after leaving house have killed during quarrel use of dagger be accounted for by wiseacre by belief mr larcher have given to jeringham a love token when parted from at door of laurel evidence of denis that have be with near mr larcher till retired to bed that captain have not set foot in house on evening turned tide of evidence in favor of unfortunate woman be acquitted of crime went to london there died a appeared from

london crowd who have be present at tragedy at laurel be scattered far wide new matter attracted attention of fickle public larcher affair be forgotten in due course mystery be never solved who be guilty of crime that question be never answered accused mr larcher despite acquittal death others insisted that jeringham be criminal one must be certain of truth hilliston seeing that mr mr larcher be dead that mona denis jeringham have disappeared wisely kept matter secret from claude deeming that must be folly to disturb mind of lad with insoluble riddle of so terrible nature so for five twenty year matter have remained in abeyance now seemed a though be about to be reopened by mr bezel who asked claude of a finished history in gray dawn of morning who be mr bezel to say least have right to ask question for be curious that name of mr bezel be not even mentioned in connection with undiscovered crime of five twenty year before chapter v strange coincidence in spite of tait

with difficulty father be murdered murdered repeated tait looking aghast a well might yes mother be accused of having murdered there have be little time before tait must face skeleton so unexpectedly produced from larcher cupboard hitherto acquaintance with crime have be mainly derived from fiction after style of john parver from column of press now be brought face to face with tragedy indirectly connected with dearest friend naturally enough did not like situation nevertheless like wise little man be made comment on truth so suddenly blurted out pushed friend into comfortable chair proposed breakfast breakfast cried claude clutching hair must not eat morsel have feeling little monster to propose breakfast to after hearing such hideous news why give sympathy try help instead of sitting at confounded rasher of bacon like graven image will do in power later on said tait quietly be upset by news wonder try eat little then can tell about will give best advice in power thus adjured claude drew in chair managed to eat morsel of toast drink cup of coffee after lighted pipe smoked furiously while tait anxious that friend must regain self control made lengthened meal talked of diver matter breakfast over also filled favorite pipe drawing chair close to of larcher waited for explanation well claude said after pause during other showed disposition to speak tell trouble have told grumbled larcher angrily if want to know more about read paper must take too long a happens be already tired with reading tell about affair a shortly a possible then can go through paper together say father be murdered who committed crime one know criminal be still at large after five twenty year be likely to remain so no cried larcher vehemently striking table will hunt down find out put rope round neck so help god say mother be accused of crime said tait ignoring outburst yes be acquitted on evidence of father valet shortly afterward died in london wonder at said poor claude distractedly shame disgrace if survived be bitterly punished must like to see man who must dare to asperse memory one will do so said tait soothingly control dear fellow will look into matter together have just be reading about crime did not think must be so soon concerned in dealing with one will help tait will stand by dear friend can ask be completely at service together will do in power to discover murderer of father clear memory of mother be clear be acquitted by jury dare to dare to say anything interrupted tait impatiently do be reasonable good fellow so long a be ignorant can say nothing tell particular may arrive at conclusion now then give precis of case dominated by superior calm of friend claude related larcher affair a succinctly a possible detail of case have impressed too strongly on brain for to hesitate in narration keeping emotion well in hand managed to give fairly minute account of tragedy have taken place at horriston in year effect on tait be surprising look of blank astonishment overspread face a larcher proceeded with story when be finished looked anxiously at friend apart from detail of case be deeply interested in matter from point of view larcher waited to hear what friend thought of case instead of commenting thereon tait acted spoke in apparently irrelevant manner without word heard claude to end then rose from seat walking to other end of room returned with three volume bound in red cloth book be called ' whim of fate ' said placing volume at larcher elbow have read confound what do mean burst out claude with justifiable wrath tell of serious matter nearly concern prattle about last fashionable novel wait minute said tait laying detaining hand on friend coat sleeve there be more method in madness than give credit for what do mean story tell be most extraordinary information be about to impart to be more extraordinary still say crime at horriston be committed five twenty year ago yes can see by date of newspaper have very likely faded out of memory of course suppose anyone be now alive who give thought well said tait be certainly curious what be curious explain story tell now be known to last night larcher looked at friend in unconcealed surprise promptly contradicted what seemed to be foolish assertion be impossible tait heard only last night nevertheless read last night read last night repeated larcher skeptically in book said tait laying hand on novel what do mean demanded other impatiently mean that john parver author of book have utilized event took place at horriston in for purpose of writing work of fiction story tell be told in page family tragedy be talk of literary london chapter vi truth be stranger than fiction astonishing statement be received by claude with disbelieving smile so convinced be of untruth that affected anger at what really believed to be flippancy of tait conduct be doubt very amusing for to ridicule story said with cold dignity be hardly act of friend matter be too serious to form subject of jest be not jesting interrupted tait eagerly assure that tragedy concerned parent form subject matter of novel can read book so be convinced that be speaking truth name place be doubt fictional whole story be narrated plainly enough larcher turned over three volume with puzzled expression that story with have only become acquainted within last twenty four hour must be printed in book that book must be brought so speedily under notice seemed to quite inexplicable strangeness of occurrence paralyzed will contrary to usual self dependence looked to tait for guidance what do think of asked irresolutely ah that requires consideration friend before go into matter let understand position toward other believe story of father death certainly mr hilliston must not tell untruth moreover bundle of extract from provincial newspaper confirms statement truly believe that father george larcher be murdered at horriston in by there have know not by whom own opinion be that jeringham be one moment claude let settle preliminary be resolved to take up matter be must clear memory of mother avenge death of father must not be better to let sleeping dog lie suggested tait with hesitation think so replied claude quietly be not sentimental man a know nature be of too practical kind to busy with weaving rope of sand yet in instance feel that be duty to hunt down punish coward who killed father when find punish ghost of ' will be laid aside otherwise will continue to haunt torture life business will lay aside business till matter be settled to satisfaction a know have private income be not compelled to work for daily bread moreover last four year have brought in plenty of money so can afford to indulge fancy fancy added claude in grim tone be to dedicate rest of life to discovering truth do not approve of decision yes said tait evasively think hunt for undescribed criminal whose crime date back twenty five year be rather waste of time clew must have disappeared seems hopeless for to think of solving mystery if do continued little man earnestly if do what possible pleasure can derive from such solution father be mere name to so filial love can have nothing to do with matter moreover criminal may be dead may be have thousand one objection said larcher impatiently none of have weight with be in hand of fate factor have entered into life have changed future knowing what now know can not rest until learn truth do know story of mozart added abruptly know several story of mozart special one may not know be told either of mozart mendelssohn forget pursued larcher half to when mozart let say mozart be ill in bed one of friend struck discord on piano required what be technically known a resolution for completion omission so tortured sensitive ear of musician that when friend departed rose from bed completed discord in accordance with musical theory till be done must not rest point of parable can not see incomplete case of murder be discord must complete by discovering criminal so round off case submit to be tortured by hinted mystery life be not filial love be not sentiment be not even curiosity be simply desire to complete matter hitherto left undone till know sequel to horriston tragedy will feel in state of suspense suspense added claude emphatically be torture to men of temperament reason be trifle whimsical said tait smiling at application of musical theory to present instance can understand feeling indeed feel same way why not in reading ' whim of fate ' must not go to rest without knowing end feel like curiosity toward tragedy of real life will not be content till learn truth feeling be precisely same a own therefore pursued tait with emphasis propose to assist in search will discus matter calmly see what be best to be done in spite of lapse of five twenty year who know what may lay hand on murderer of father who be doubt now living in fancied security unless be dead who be making objection now said tait smiling well claude will accept a brother detective in matter willingly thank for proof of friendship be afraid there be element of selfishness mixed up in offer said tait shrugging shoulder be not day that one can find interesting case like to dissect excitement be joy of life rather think will be able to extract great deal from investigation come now understand one larcher grasped hand held out to gratefully accepted aid thus offered from moment two dedicated to hunt down criminal at whose hand george larcher have met death be a strange compact a have ever be made halting nemesis who have rested year once more resumed stealthy progress before ran two young men a minister of long delayed revenge junction of unforeseen circumstance savored of dramatic first thing to be done said tait when compact be thus concluded be to read case case repeated claude curiously yes remember how browning give dozen aspect of same case in 'ring book ' in minor degree benefit in same manner there said tait pointing to roll of newspaper be case from real point of view here in three volume will find same case a considered in fictional fashion by novelist by reading may come to conclusion whence to start in talk last night read newspaper novel to day will reverse process will view affair a set forth by provincial press will devour three volume of john parver a did last night afterward eh who can say replied tait shrugging shoulder several sojourn in paris have left trace in gallic gesture possibly in gallic flippancy must know what foundation have before build claude nodded be of same way of thinking commented on friend speech after own fashion yes said trifle vindictively must build gallows stanch strong can proceed with toilet afterward will read novel newspaper a suggest result of reading must appear in action rather think added slowly that result will be visit to mr hilliston without doubt be eye witness be always preferable to obtain evidence first hand then said claude reflectively there be mr bezel quite so enterprising lady who started whole thing be also eye witness ca say name doe not appear in newspaper humph muttered tait scratching chin in three volume can find character likely to develop into mr bezel of hampstead wonder who can be said claude curiously what can have to do with case that must find out depend upon there be more in case than in newspaper novel must find out about mr bezel said tait with emphasis must learn be to be learned concerning john parver who be john parver who be man in iron mask replied tait in bantering tone can not say whomsoever may be know about case there be that possibility certainly assented other smoothly think hardly likely man of to day must not readily come across account of tragedy occurring in little known town twenty five year ago do know added after pause that occurs to that publication of book containing account of case may have be cause incited mr bezel to write letter thought so myself mr bezel may think that john parver be nom de plume assumed by claude larcher alternative mr bezel may be john parver be fashion nowadays for woman to write under name of men there be few minute silence during man be intent on own thought tait whose brain turned quicker than of larcher be first to break silence well said moving briskly toward bedroom door before can say do anything must learn fact of case a vanished into room claude laid hand on first of three volume chapter vii let sleeping dog lie on journey of life sometimes come to dead stop obstacle arise bar further progress circumstance impossible to do away with confront on side can not go back for in life there be retrogression can not proceed owing to blocked path so stand hopeless powerless waiting for word action of fate unseen almighty deity alone can remove hindrance prevents progress until speaks act can hing wait be on such occasion that feel how truly be puppet of unknown power francis hilliston have arrived at such stoppage hitherto keen brain strong will capability for decisive action have carried onward from past to present through present to future when obstacle have arisen have be easily swept away with own life in hand be perfectly satisfied of power to mold to liking possibly fate who be somewhat jealous deity felt angered at egotistic self reliance of man for without warning brought to dead stop then grimly waited to see how boasted cunning must outwit a probably foresaw man did nothing await decision be only thing must do for five twenty year horriston tragedy have be unmentioned unthought of hilliston deemed that be relegated to category of unknown crime having in mind friendship for parent love for son be not unwilling that must be so did not wish claude to know of matter be not desirous that must come in contact with mr bezel hitherto have managed so well that contingency have eventuated congratulating on dexterity remained lulled in fancied security when fate observant of complacency sent bolt from blue brought up short now hilliston forced by circumstance to tell truth to larcher did not know what to do must only wait for fiat of higher power grimly satisfied that have brought home fault have shown moral weakness fate made next move sent larcher friend to lincoln inn field to again set hilliston on former journey paralysis of will have seized elder man did not extend to younger for claude arrived full of anxiety to begin search for undiscovered criminal first result of compact with tait be visit to lawyer claude larcher spenser tait muttered hilliston glancing at card brought in by clerk thought a much matter be out of hand now show gentleman in added sharply clerk departed hilliston walked quickly to window where stood biting nail geniality have vanished from face looked older than year unaccustomed frown wrinkled expansive forehead crisis have come knew not how to meet so after fashion of men when feel thus helpless left decision in hand of fate be precisely what fate wanted good morning claude good morning mr tait said hilliston welcoming young men with artificial enthusiasm expected to see today surely did not expect to see said tait in silky tone a placed hat on table indeed did where damon be phintias be sure to be claude perusal of paper must result in accompanying to office felt sure be right here be mr hilliston affected cheerfulness be far from feeling with increasing age distaste have come for violent excitement with one of claude temperament knew that chance be that ensuing quarter of hour must be somewhat stirring contrary to expectation however larcher be eager calm hilliston assuring that calmness be genuine began to hope that interview must pas off better than expected still none of like to reopen disagreeable chapter of book of life mr hilliston against will inclination be about to do well sir said claude when be seated hush of expectancy be in air have read paper yes said mr hilliston interrogatively what do think of matter think be very black case be quite right claude be very black case indeed did in power to bring criminal to justice without success who be criminal asked larcher with keen glance at guardian hilliston shuffled foot uneasily by mean relishing directness of question be difficult question to answer said slowly in fact impossible one suspicion point to jeringham from point tait made third in conversation be because jeringham disappeared on night of murder said leisurely yes think that circumstance alone be very suspicious be never found again never advertised in paper employed detective inquired privately to result last person who saw jeringham be mr larcher parted from at door of laurel vanished into night still hide what do conclude from sir asked claude after pause can only conclude one thing replied hilliston with great deliberation that father suspicious of jeringham returned on night from london saw parting result be not difficult to foresee be own opinion that there be word between men possibly struggle that matter ended in murder of father by jeringham hence discovery of body thrown into river hence flight of murderer be generally received opinion at time yes can safely say that be believed jeringham be guilty have fled to escape consequence of crime in case how be that mr larcher be arrested asked tait skeptically can not have read case carefully to ask that replied hilliston sharply be arrested on evidence of dagger without doubt crime be committed with dagger a have worn inference be drawn that be guilty person be acquitted left court a saying be without stain on character nevertheless died mr hilliston shame killed said lawyer sadly be foolish woman in many way pardon claude for so speaking be not woman to commit so foul crime indeed believe be fondly attached to husband till jeringham came between ah interposed tait composedly be john parver view john parver repeated hilliston with well bred surprise know name in connection with case do know name of mr bezel said claude quickly hilliston started looked at claude a though must read very soul inscrutability of young man countenance baffled turned off remark with dry laugh with mr bezel will deal hereafter said shortly who be john parver be author of book called ' whim of fate ' novel yes novel embodies whole of case be strange said hilliston quietly doubt author have come across detail in old provincial journal made use of larcher affair caused great deal of talk at time be certainly remarkable that novelist must have made use of for fictional purpose after lapse of so many year must read book just note name of here mr tait if please tait did so hilliston continued be character in book think so under name of michael dene trust author have be flattering to by way who doe say committed crime michael dene hilliston went gray on instant a though sudden blow have be struck at heart two pair of keen eye be fixed on face with surprise uneasy at scrutiny strove to recover composure upon word said with quivering lip be infinitely obliged to john parver for describing a murderer what motive doe ascribe to rather to michael dene for committal of crime love for wife said tait smiling eh be rather role of jeringham must say replied hilliston color coming back to lip cheek must read novel if possible discover identity of author oh will do claude cried lawyer in astonishment tait intend to follow out case to end be useless five twenty year have elapsed nevertheless be determined to hunt down murderer of father said claude decisively besides have two eye witness to tragedy mr bezel ah mr bezel forgot certainly will do in power to help claude father be dearest friend will only be too glad to avenge fate if must not do at moment how can hope to do so now after so long period have elapsed leave to sir tait will attend to active part of business ask to do be to give such information a lie in power will do with pleasure said hilliston who by time be thoroughly master of be wish to know wish to know about mr bezel who be have to do with case why be not name mentioned in page for answer to question have better apply to lady have address why not call on intend to do so to morrow old man rose from seat took turn up down room then paused beside claude laid trembling hand on young man shoulder have be good friend to claude have be second father real father said larcher gently will never forget kindness must return if must then do so by letting sleeping dog lie what do mean by mr hilliston asked other with subtle change in tone abandon case call on mr bezel can do good by reopening affair be mystery year ago be mystery still will remain mystery till end of time not if can help be sorry to disoblige sir mind be made up be determined to find out truth hilliston sighed passed hand across forehead returned to seat hopeless baffled be sufficiently acquainted with claude character to know that be not easily turned from purpose that resolution to solve mystery must be resolutely carried out yet made one more attempt to bend young man to will if be wise will not call on mr bezel why not sir will give great pain pain be past replied claude quickly can suffer more than did when reading paper must call on mr bezel must know truth added significantly have promise to assist will do in power answered hilliston wearily know what be doing be older more experienced than give best advice see mr bezel leave larcher affair alone result of well meant advice be that claude called next morning on mr bezel chapter viii side of question man life have frequently be compared to river in childhood be trickling thread in youth stream in manhood majestic river finally in old age be swallowed up in ocean of death very pretty parable somewhat stale be time that life be indicated by new metaphor let therefore compare life of man to ocean like ocean life have calm storm sullen rage caressing moment like ocean for be main point of illustration have profound depth containing hundred secret unknown to outer world francis hilliston be like ocean knew surface few be acquainted with depth below man who lead double life need never feel dull may be nervous anxious fearful lest secret must be discovered constant vigilance required to hide preserve from curse of ennui ever keep best side of nature uppermost smile be for world brow be smoothed to lull suspicion to continue simile of ocean in depth lie many terrible thing never come to surface thing scarcely dare admit even to francis hilliston be one of men everyone knew hilliston of lincoln inn field thought did be quite different thing be widely respected in profession be popular in society hand glove with prominent wealthy personage house at kensington gore be richly furnished wife be handsome fashionable gave splendid entertainment at none be more jocund than host be outwardly be prosperous popular in professional capacity be repository of thousand secret of none be more terrible than one locked up in own breast long year of training constant necessity have taught how to control emotion to turn face into mask of inscrutability yet succeeded ill at time a witness interview with two young men not power of self repression must keep face from turning gray prevent perspiration beading brow steady voice to well bred indifference usually succeeded in masking emotion time have failed worst of knew that have failed be not claude that feared for young man be not of suspicious nature even have be so must certainly have scoffed at idea of attributing evil to one who have be to father tait silent observant cynical be person to be dreaded accustomed by profession to read face hilliston have seen that quiet little man be possessed of one of inquisitive penetrative nature suspect men from look gesture pause can draw evidence to support suspicion may entertain certainly tait have reason to distrust hilliston when entered room during interview appeared dissatisfied with lawyer manner that hilliston must attempt to dissuade claude from prosecuting search for father murderer seemed strange that must betray such marked agitation at idea of such searching taking place be stranger still altogether tait left office in very dissatisfied state of mind hilliston have sufficient penetration to note when left alone be at wit end how to baffle unwarrantable curiosity of intruder mind claude said pacing up down room have not sufficient brain power to find out anything want to know tait be dangerous be one of dogged creature who put nose to scent never leaf trail till prey be captured be with have to deal not with claude agitation almost mastered hurriedly took small bottle from drawer in desk dropping content of into glass of water drank off draught in short space of time regained composure in measure then sat down to think plot plan how to baffle vigilance of tait that infernal woman have done muttered savagely have lighted fire let see how will put out can not put out added striking forehead with clenched fist will blaze burn will burn with unless there be strange smile on lip a idea entered mind glanced quickly at watch four o'clock claude ca possibly call on margaret to day so have yet time to prepare for visit must silence at cost must hold tongue ruin great heaven to think that must break out like after five twenty year be enough to drive mad by time have put on glove stretched hand toward hat stood on side table glance in glass showed how old gray looked sight be so unexpected that started in dismay bah look a though be going to fail said to must not fail dare not fail at sixty rich honored respected be not going to fall from pedestal have reached will reassure claude will baffle tait will silence margaret first move in game be mine calm dignified easy left office stepped into brougham waiting at door to judge by appearance one must have thought most respectable upright man in london one knew what lurked behind benevolent expression mask have fallen for moment when tait be present now be on again went forth to deceive world yet have uneasy consciousness that one man at least guessed real character never mind thought a footman closed door of brougham will be strange if with age experience reputation money can not baffle did not go direct home a be yet early have one two thing to do in connection with new task first drove to tait chamber ascertained from porter that two young men be within never mind sending up name wo disturb said when porter requested card only wished to speak to mr tait about box at theater if be lyceum mean sir have just got two stall for mr tait ah may see there replied hilliston negligently a drove away reflected good have not yet be to hampstead do intend to go to night mr tait have yet to learn value of time driving through piccadilly stopped at bookshop with difficulty for demand be large obtained copy of whim of fate began to read in brougham skimmed page so rapidly that by time reached kensington gore have nearly finished first volume did not recognize in character of michael dene became more convinced than ever that coincidence of larcher affair forming plot of novel be due to author reading case in old provincial newspaper on page betrayed that to story be hearsay fortunately mr hilliston be driving in park so lawyer shut up in library went on reading story did not see wife till dinner took place at eight o'clock then descended in ordinary clothes looking ill pale something have read in novel have startled more than cared to confess even to must excuse dress louise said on taking seat have be so engrossed with novel did not hear dressing bell have not have pleasant effect on replied wife smiling look at well be not well said hilliston who merely trifled with food must excuse going with to lambert to night a think will call in see doctor be so bad a questioned mr hilliston anxiously why not send for dr bland prefer going to see louise will probably not be back till three in morning so will go to bed immediately on return have fear dear be only trifling indisposition after plain statement be rather strange that hilliston in place of driving to dr bland who lived in hill street must direct cab picked up by park railing to drive to hampstead chapter ix mr bezel one can not always judge by appearance a regard human being house mr hilliston be one excellent illustration of rule clarence cottage be be in narrow crooked lane trending downward to right at summit of fitzjohn avenue unpretentious two story building divided from public thoroughfare by well cultivated garden therein grew thyme lavender marigold pansy for owner of cottage loved homely flower daily gazed at from bow window wherein couch be placed mr bezel never walked in garden for sufficient reason that be helpless paralytic have not used limb for over ten year still moderately young woman of forty five possessed remains of great beauty ravaged by year of anxiety mental trouble passing along lane usually saw pale face at window pitied suffering written in line suffering be apparent even to casual glance noting homely garden mean looking dwelling anxious expression of invalid deemed to be poor sickly creature scapegoat of nature world who have sought secluded spot in order to hide trouble view be not entirely correct be in ill health be true dwelt in small house certainly anxious expression be seldom absent from face be in easy circumstance untroubled by pecuniary worry interior of cottage be furnished with magnificence more suggestive of park lane than of hampstead outward aspect of house like of mr hilliston be lie sitting room resembled boudoir of mayfair beauty curtain be of silk carpet velvet pile wall be adorned with costly picture corner of small apartment be filled with sumptuous furniture art must contribute affection must suggest be confined in tiny space have mr bezel possessed mine of golconda must not have be more luxuriously lodged house be gem of kind perfect splendid mr bezel took little interest in material comfort life be passed between couch in bow window well cushioned chair by fire downy bed in next room have little appetite did not enjoy food mental anxiety prevented interesting herself in splendor around only pleasure took be dreary journey in bath chair when weather permitted then a inhaled fresh breeze blowing across heath gazed with longing eye at london almost hidden under foggy veil far below always returned with reluctance to familiar splendor of narrow dwelling fortune have given much by way of compensation have deprived her of two thing most desired of health of love even on warm june evening fire burned in grate for mr bezel be chilly creature who shrunk at least breath of wind according to custom have left window couch at seven o'clock have taken simple meal while seated in large chair to right of fireplace after dinner took up novel be placed on small table at elbow tried to read attention be not fixed on book gradually fell from hand while gazed idly at fire what saw therein heaven only know have moment of retrospection can picture past in burning coal even picture future there be none for woman be old weary diseased worn out therefore saw in fire only shadow of past year face looked out of flaming valley scene arranged in red confusion among there be always one face one scene never vanished a did others special face particular scene be fixed immovable cruel insistent chime of clock striking half past nine roused from reverie again addressed to novel with sigh tortured by own thought mr bezel be not accustomed to retire before midnight there be nearly three hour to be got through before time life be a dreary weary heart breaking a of mariana in moated grange tread of firm footfall in distance roused attention looked expectantly toward door faced chair newcomer passed up narrow garden path entered house after pause in hall presented in sitting room mr bezel knew who be before door opened for standing on threshold be man with face have lately pictured amid burning coal francis hilliston woman who called mr bezel looked steadily at one sign of welcome passed between be first to break awkward silence how be evening margaret asked advancing toward better hope there be more color in cheek more brightness in eye be same a ever replied coldly while drew chair close to fire stretched out hand to blaze why have come here at hour to see doubt with what purpose hilliston pinched nether lip between finger thumb frowning while at fire have be there be now love between woman on occasion have noted so hostile tone in voice be aware that duel of word brain be about to ensue knowing antagonist took button off foil there be need for fine speaking veiled hint in conversation be advisable that must be plain straightforward for knew other too well to wear mask when

that man whom desire to see be in london will doubt answer kind invitation in person mr bezel stretched out hand selected letter from little pile on table if will look at said coldly will see claude intends to call on at three o'clock to morrow taking letter in silence hilliston turned frightfully pale perspiration stood in large bead on forehead expected such appointment to be made yet evidence in hand startled same promptitude of action spoke volume to one of acute perception to defend good name must require skill experience for have to do with men of action who acted a quickly a thought duel must be more equal than have thought be still determined to tell said in low tone crushing paper up in hand yes monosyllable be uttered in so icy manner that hilliston lost temper completely before woman there be need for to retain smiling mask in frenzy of rage hurried into rapid speech frantic unconsidered ah must ruin cried springing to foot must drag up folly of make london too hot to hold have not implored threatened beseeched commanded done everything in power to make hold peace miserable woman must drag man love down to man loved mean responded mr bezel in nowise moved by torrent of abuse pray be theatrical francis know well enough to be aware that when mind be made up be not easily moved man of brain added scornfully must know that loss of temper be prelude to defeat recognizing truth of remark hilliston resumed seat subdued anger only look of hatred in eye betrayed real feeling otherwise be calm suave self controlled have weighed cost of action demanded quietly yes mean ruin to loss be yours not mine helpless deserted life have further charm for mr hilliston doubtless feel differently margaret said entreatingly why do speak like what harm have done that what

settled on sale of furniture will produce sufficient money to last life ca live long now will deny statement do so will have declared insane shut up in asylum mr bezel laughed scornfully pointed toward door if be have to say have better go said jeeringly know well enough that can not harm without jeopardizing own position looked at one fiercely trying to outstare other hilliston eye be first to fall hastily turned toward door so be said with hand on knob want war will have see claude tell can defend on leaving house few minute later paused irresolutely by gate looked back if must only find paper muttered must hing a be made gesture of despair plunged into darkness chapter x few fact connected with case when two young men left lincoln inn field after momentous interview with hilliston walked on in silence for distance busied with own thought like most solitary tait have habit of speaking aloud unmindful of presence of claude stopped short at gate of new law court to give vent to feeling be decidedly suspicious said in low tone quite inexplicable what be talking about asked claude irritably whereupon tait became aware that be not alone nevertheless showed disposition to balk question be thinking of mr hilliston returned quietly be not at satisfied with conduct be hostile to claude hostile impossible be doing in power to help so appears answered tait dryly nevertheless think that intends to thwart in plan if can now be talking nonsense said claude a resumed walk why first brought case under notice why because wanted to be beforehand with mr bezel if have not told must have done so naturally enough wished to be first in field ca think ill of protested larcher have be second father to doubt there be such thing a remorse remorse be mad not at be suspicious will discus mr hilliston later on when will give reason for speaking thus meanwhile have decided to play game against nonsense have motive pardon think have what be be unable to say a yet however will make two move in game within next twenty four hour indeed said claude ironically perhaps can tell what two move will be certainly answered tait serenely a to first will call at room to find out if have gone to see mr bezel to night why at room because think be staying with moreover knowing that be acting together know movement will coincide with mine ah second move will write letter asking to stay with at kensington gore see what there be suspicious about said claude petulantly know be belief that be afraid of investigation in case wish to keep under eye good heaven man advised to pursue matter on contrary advised to let sleeping dog lie so did cried claude with sudden recollection of interview why what harm can investigation do to ah be difficult question to answer said tait reflectingly to mind will show that hilliston be not friend of father pretended to be according to paper acted like friend throughout yes according to paper larcher faced round suddenly struck by significance of remark be clever young man must not see clearly before honest be far from suspecting dishonesty in others instead of agreeing with tait in estimate of hilliston vehemently defended lawyer must not speak like tait said angrily mr hilliston be honest man have be like father to owe to perhaps do retorted tait significantly however need not quarrel over matter be content to wait will bet five pound that inquiry be made to night letter be sent to morrow larcher did not accept bet thus confidently offered walked on stiffly with head in air be seriously annoyed with tait for daring to cast imputation on character of man to whom owed never must bring to believe that hilliston intended evil deemed that lawyer despite manifest reluctance must help by mean in power to discover assassin nevertheless tait proved to be in right a two young men passed down stair on way to theater whence tait insisted on taking claude with view of distracting mind be met by porter beg pardon sir addressing to tait gentleman called time ago asked for mr larcher who be why did not show up must not give name sir did not wish to come up only asked if have box for theater when said have stall drove off ah can describe appearance not very tall sir clean shaven with white hair red face looked like country gentleman sir thank will do replied tait quietly left house with claude for few minute enjoyed companion astonishment at proof of hilliston double dealing be not till be in cab that spoke well said smiling be not right when said that must make first move be right so far muttered claude who looked ill at ease can not bring to suspect guardian want proof perhaps well will wait for invitation to kensington gore claude shook head seemed so indisposed to talk that tait judged wise to humor silence young man thought be anything pleasant have be accustomed to look up to hilliston a model of english gentleman honest honorable upright noble if then suspicion of tait must prove correct last act of hilliston certainly gave color to where be to find honest honorable men if hilliston proved false then claude felt must no longer trust human race still fought against supposition secretly hoped that second prophecy of friend must not be fulfilled ala for hope at eleven next morning while be discussing situation letter be delivered to claude by special messenger proved to be from hilliston contained warm invitation for larcher to take up abode at kensington gore house a may only be in london for short period dear claude wrote guardian wife must see a much of a possible with bitter smile claude tossed letter across to tait see be right said latter for second time after skimming note mr hilliston be playing double game wish to keep under eye thinking that a trust will keep informed a to doings so that being forewarned may be forearmed do really think be enemy tait be really not prepared to say replied little man with hesitation behavior of yesterday struck a suspicious seemed unnecessarily agitated moreover urged not to see mr bezel perhaps think will tell too much taking fact into consideration can not help thinking that hilliston be asking to house for motive in connection with search showed paper know a told yesterday be hobson choice with if have imparted information mr bezel must have done so of two evil chose least by showing paper proved to outward appearance that be firm friend must bring charge against will meet by very argument have just made use of good heaven groaned claude in despair be everybody a treacherous a think to be good number of people be replied tait suavely long residence in london doe not strengthen one belief in human nature be city of wild beast of wolf fox who rend betray for gaining of own end if hilliston be what believe to be must do best to baffle so must continue to be friend how can if wish to betray ah be so unsophisticated claude said hardened man of world betray feeling too plainly in city be worse than madness to wear heart on sleeve if be convinced that hilliston bear ill be not convinced ca believe man must be so base ah bah be want of experience retorted tait raising eyebrow will pick out dozen of decent friend who be a base baser than believe to be respectability be question of concealment nowadays must be confessed that guardian wear mask very prettily do think be never mind what think interrupted tait impatiently hilliston may turn out to be angel after conduct of yesterday morning appears to be suspicious in dealing with matter have in hand be a well to be careful keep faith in hilliston if assist to continue friendship must suspect nothing do then wish to accept invitation why go into lion den write thank decline have excuse indeed then will provide with one be engaged to stay with at thorston for month by end of time will know sufficient of hilliston to decide for a to wisdom of accepting declining invitation if go to thorston can not prosecute inquiry yes can tell that book contains story of father murder also contains description of thorston recognize scene well well repeated tait sharply ca see author of book must either live at thorston have stayed few month there else must not have described village so accurately must make inquiry about there must be fortunate enough to discover must extract secret what secret upon word claude be stupid cunning why find out where got material from may put on right track now write to hilliston then go up to hampstead find out what mr bezel have to say wo come too said claude going to writing desk have own business to attend to be connected with enterprise must think so be intention to call on firm who published ' whim of fate find out can concerning author when return from mr bezel will compare note on what information obtain will depend future movement chapter xi startling discovery in one of novel balzac make pertinent remark that be impossible for man to understand heart of woman seeing that creator doe not understand be not precise word sentiment be same who indeed can understand woman heart who can aver that have complete comprehension of character very young men lay claim to such knowledge a grow older vanity of youth give way to modesty begotten by experience no longer pretend to such omniscience humbly admit inability to solve riddle of femininity have sphinx proposed enigma to oedipus must not have be able to guess so meeting fate of other victim must have deprived thebe of king sophicles of tragedy yet if bear in mind that woman work rather from impulse than from motive may arrive at knowledge of organ in question if woman be impulsive most woman be act directly on impulse so startle men by paradoxical action a rule male intellect have logical reason wherefrom deduces motif upon to act not so with woman obey impulse of moment reckless of consequence to to anyone else consequently be impossible to foretell how woman will act in given circumstance may be asserted that will obey latest thought in mind even from point of view feminine mind be still riddle one be more capable of explanation for example mr bezel read whim of fate thus after five twenty year horriston tragedy be freshly impressed on brain seized with remorse terrified by memory of crime acting on impulse wrote to hilliston stating that intended to see claude larcher reveal dismay of lawyer at mad proposal steady opposition thereto turned what be originally mere whim into fixed idea saw way of punishing man for withdrawal of love ten year before when lost beauty became paralyzed delighted at learning that have still power to wound persisted in project so wrote letter to larcher received day after arrival in london to baffle hilliston prevent from intercepting letter be obliged to use wit so hit on idea of learning name of young man club how managed to obtain be best known to herself hilliston never dreaming of pertinacity be unable to thwart scheme beyond writing to claude telling to call must hing have guessed that must address invitation to club might have called obtained in character of larcher guardian knowing helpless condition thought that might be there never entered mind so letter arrived be duly answered claude be coming to day at three o'clock to hear what mr bezel have to say visit though due to own action be source of considerable anxiety for be not at certain of what must say be impossible to tell without inculpating hilliston for reason of own mr bezel be unwilling to do talk of previous night have be so much rodomontade to frighten man hated be too well aware of dependent position to think of doing injury impulse have led into deep water a knew instinctively be woman who have lived moment of life now stretched on bed of sickness missed former triumph excitement visit promised great deal of amusement use of much diplomacy therefore be unwilling to abandon plan at same time determined to give young man a little information a possibly must must not be through agency that mask must be torn from hilliston face be resolved on point yet matter starting originally from impulse have now gone too far for to draw back claude have seen paper therefrom must have guessed that desired to impart certain information with regard to crime have cost father mr bezel therefore compromised matter settled in own mind to tell truth at event only sufficient to interest without aiding have be man have taken decision must have gone well being woman reckoned without impulse betrayed moreover have revelation to make must effectively tie larcher hand must learn too much did not intend to make unless driven into corner be in corner before interview be finished though little expected to get there hilliston clever a be must not understand present action did not understand else must not have ventured to receive claude duly arrived at three o'clock mr bezel glanced approvingly at stalwart figure handsome face claude have one of sympathetic yet manly nature to woman be instinctively drawn by law of sex mr bezel proved exception to rule be too thoroughly woman not to relish masculine society despite perplexity be glad have sent invitation if only for sake of talking to splendid looking young man there be reason revealed in moment of impulse be later on meanwhile claude seated by couch in window be wondering who be why have sought interview be certainly aware that have information to impart concerning fate of parent a have not seen name in paper containing account of case be at loss to fix identity doubt be soon set at rest mr bezel be more prominent actor in horriston tragedy than have idea of be doubtless astonished to get letter said mr bezel when first greeting be over especially a remember parent name be also unknown to be friend of parent madam asked claude too anxious for information to reply directly to remark yes knew be lived at horriston stammered mr bezel passing handkerchief across dry lip lived at horriston at time of murder mr bezel nodded be not yet sufficiently controlled for speech in case continued claude eagerly must know detail of crime only be reported in paper still must be acquainted with concerned in tragedy with father with jeringham denis bantry with mona sister yes said mr bezel calmly knew have idea who committed crime not slightest must have suspicion oh yes may be wrong believe that mr jeringham have something to do with oh said claude remembering hilliston opinion believe to be guilty can not say for certain replied mr bezel shaking head flight of mr jeringham certainly showed that have something to conceal what kind of man be mr jeringham tall fair amiable a rule liable to violent passion be not in love with mother before married father mr bezel turned away head color rose to face nervous movement of hand plucking at dress showed how profoundly be moved by question believe so mr larcher loved husband then why be father jealous of jeringham said claude who must not reconcile statement with evidence given at trial how must know cried mr bezel turning on with sudden passion if george larcher have not be so blinded by jealousy must have seen that there be nothing between mother knew jeringham life be like brother sister be true wished to marry when saw that heart be given to father bowed to decision came to horriston a friend not a lover be constantly with do dare to speak thus of mother sir can not help doing so stammered claude startled by anger in voice god know wish to revere memory of mother can not help seeing that be morally responsible for tragedy be not be not said mr bezel vehemently how dare speak thus father neglected left to companionship of mark jeringham while indulged in predilection for literary work day long shut up in study let wife sit alone miserable be wonder then that must turn to old friend for consolation there be nothing between nothing to pharisee must have taken exception surely father be sufficiently sensible to see saw nothing what did see be distorted by jealousy police in endeavor to fix crime on mother took same view of relation between jeringham oh know what read in paper shown to by mr hilliston so surprised be claude by unexpected introduction of guardian name that must not suppress start how do know that mr hilliston showed paper mr bezel saw that have said too much unable to go back on word rapidly resolved to make revelation have hitherto intended to keep a last resource mr hilliston told that have done so do know yes said mr bezel seizing opportunity to lead up to revelation know a best kindest of men know a one who have be good friend to orphan a thought orphan a thought muttered claude turning pale be not true be not orphan great heaven what be tell father father be dead be murdered a know then mother mr bezel looked at agonized face of young man covered own with quick indrawn breath life mother life be mad died in london shortly after acquittal so be supposed be not true must expect that unhappy woman to face scorn contempt of world after having be accused of husband murder did not die save to world fled from society sought refuge here here where lie helpless invalid mr bezel be not mr bezel be mother god mother chapter xii revelation be only natural that silence must ensue between two so strangely brought together claude seated pale anguished in chair tried to collect thought stared wildly at mother with face buried in cushion sobbed bitterly after way in son have spoken be cruel that must have be forced to make such revelation at moment condemned reproached conduct in past again tasted full bitterness of cup have be held to lip twenty five year before on part claude did not know what to say hardly knew what to think convinced by perusal of paper that mother be morally guilty of father death be overwhelmed to find that be still alive capable for knew of offering defense for share in tragedy after have right to judge until heard what have to say blood be thicker than water be mother now saw reason why hilliston objected to calling at hampstead why advised to let sleeping dog lie after so long period be worse than useless to bring mother son together thought aim life be entirely diverse only pain must be caused by such meeting claude silently acknowledged wisdom of hilliston judgment at same time must hardly refrain from condemning for having kept so long in ignorance of truth mr bezel a must still continue to call be astonished at long silence raised head to cast timid glance at claude brow be gloomy lip be firmly set looked anything overjoyed at revelation have made guessing thought unhappy woman made gesture of despair spoke in low voice broken by sob too condemn mother replied mr bezel winced a heard acknowledge relationship condemn have heard one side of question must now hear other from what more can tell than what already know said drying eye must know reason why let think dead year be by own wish by advice of mr hilliston claude bit lip at mention of name cast hasty glance round splendidly furnished room frightful suspicion have entered mind be mother did not dare to give utterance mother guessed thought spared pain of speaking with womanly disregard for truth promptly lied concerning relationship son suspected to exist between guardian need not look so black claude think ill of be unfortunate not guilty that see here be mine purchased by own money own money replied claude heaving sigh of relief yes mr hilliston who have be good friend to saved sufficient out of marriage settlement to enable to furnish cottage live comfortably be just a well added bitterly else might have died on street why did let hilliston bring up to think be orphan did not wish to shadow life did not wish to change name have to change mine retire from world be part of punishment still if be impossible tell claude interrupted mother impatiently when grew up must have asked question then must have be forced to tell yet in spite of precaution do know if took trouble to hide truth why reveal to now mr bezel pointed to three book lying on adjacent table claude quite understood what meant see remarked before must speak think that author of book know about father murder be certain doe what know how know can not say still be certain of one thing that tell story from hearsay what make think that must take too long to tell reason be sufficient to state that fictitious case differs from real case in several important particular for instance added with derisive smile guilty person be said to be michael dene be be drawn from mr hilliston how do know that asked with startled air claude shrugged shoulder have eye to read brain to comprehend said quietly there be doubt in mind that lawyer of fiction be meant for lawyer of real life otherwise think writer drew on imagination be necessary for to end story by fixing on one of character a criminal owing to exigency of plot a developed by chose michael dene otherwise mr hilliston a murderer think oh think mr hilliston be guilty read trial very carefully moreover see what motive must have to commit crime motive of michael dene be love for murdered man wife in other word author assumes that hilliston loved said claude coolly have assurance that such be not case speak to like cried mr bezel angrily to mother larcher expression did not change turned trifle paler compressed lip firmly otherwise gave outward sign of emotion knowing so much of case a did must not look on woman in light of mother have indirectly contributed to father death have deserted for twenty five year now that claimed filial reverence be unwilling to yield to perhaps be unjust harsh to think natural tie between be so weakened by time ignorance that must find affection in heart to bestow on to be stranger nothing more let understand other said coldly that be mother be doubt true ask if have performed maternal duty obliterated from life left to be brought up by stranger in way only consulted own desire can then expect to yield that filial obedience mother have right to expect from son if enough sir said mr bezel white with anger say more understand only too well now regret that sought interview have resulted so ill hoped that must be glad to find mother still alive that must cherish in affliction see be wrong be a cold bitter a be father father yes do think that wrong be on side have nothing to forgive ah see by face that know to what allude be father husband who betrayed for mona bantry have proof of said claude in low voice have proof girl told with own lip returned from ball at three o'clock in morning mr jeringham left at door entered house alone proceeded to sitting room there found mona husband ah did return from london on night yes returned thinking be out of way in order to see mistress in presence confessed guilt looked to for denial hung head then hardly knowing what did overcome with rage snatched dagger wore a part of costume killed shrieked claude springing to foot for heaven sake confess to why not did wrong did not kill fainted before must cross room to where stood when recovered be alone husband mona bantry have disappeared then retired to bed be ill for day know more of case be true asked claude anxiously why must not be true do think must invent story like to asperse memory of father vilely a treated loved know who killed dagger wore disappeared with be found in garden body in river four mile down declare to solemnly that be ignorant of whose hand struck blow might have be mona jeringham hilliston be wrong there replied mother coolly else judgment have be perverted by book mr hilliston be still at ball when tragedy occurred evidence at trial proved that say word against have be good friend to to deny that can not when be arrested tried for crime never committed stood by when left court alone friendless stood by decided to feign death to escape obloquy attache to suspected criminal found refuge installed here a mr bezel took charge of brought up looked after money mine dare to speak against exhausted by fury with have spoken unfortunate woman leaned back in chair claude already regretting harshness brought glass of water placed to lip after few minute revived feebly waved away be not to be so easily dismissed be sorry spoke a did mother said tenderly arranging pillow now have heard story see that have suffered greatly be not right to reproach doubt acted for best therefore say word against mr hilliston ask to forgive tear be rolling down mr bezel cheek a spoke thus without uttering word put hand in in token of forgiveness claude pressed lip to faded cheek thus reconciled a much a be possible under circumstance began to talk of case what do intend to do asked mr bezel weakly find out who killed father be impossible after five twenty year have told know see can not help know whom to suspect surely have suspicion mother have suspicion killed father took dagger out of sitting room perhaps mona think not have reason to kill have wronged cried mr bezel vehemently talk more of thing claude know nothing more can tell nothing more then must try find john parver learn how became acquainted with story be why sent for why revealed why told have suffered find john parver tell who be what be claude promised to do a mother be worn out by long conversation shortly afterward took leave a descended fitzjohn avenue thought flashed into mind a to identity of john parver wonder if john parver be mark jeringham said claude question be to be answered on very evening chapter xiii on track be nearly six o'clock when claude returned to earl street tait already dressed for evening be waiting arrival with considerable impatience usual imperturbability have given place to self satisfied air a though have succeeded in accomplishing difficult undertaking uttered joyful exclamation when saw claude enter look of apprehension passed over face when noted altered appearance of friend what be wrong asked a claude threw into chair with sigh of fatigue do bring bad news dear fellow be completely worn out here dormer glass of sherry for mr servant who be putting finishing touch to dinner table speedily obeyed order tait made friend drink wine without delay then proceeded to question regarding reason of pallor with usual caution first sent dormer out of room only when be alone did venture to speak on subject about be thinking well demanded anxiously saw mr bezel yes be with for two hour ah said tait with great satisfaction must have told good deal in time did told more than expected did concern parent did good then doubt heard version of crime yes unsatisfactory reply dropped so strangely from larcher lip at once puzzled irritated questioner seem anxious to confide in said in piqued tone will tell be anxious to tell replied larcher finding tongue know how to begin oh will save that trouble by asking question in first place who be mr bezel mother tait bounded from chair with expression of incredulity unexpected information so abruptly conveyed be too much for self control mother stammered hardly thinking have heard aright be in earnest can not believe according to notice in newspaper according to hilliston mother died in london in did not die death be feigned one to escape notoriety gained by trial at canterbury did mr hilliston know be alive yes be by advice that changed name oh oh said tait with marked significance hilliston knew hilliston advised humph john parver may be right after tait be silent be speaking of mother beg pardon dear fellow really understand will shortly will tell story of mother trouble hilliston kindness hilliston kindness repeated tait in skeptical tone nevertheless resumed seat signified willingness to hear narrative wine have done claude good restored self possession so now master of related have passed between mr bezel gifted with retentive memory mean power a narrator succeeded in giving tait vivid impression of conversation little man with head slightly on one side like bright eyed sparrow listened attentively not till story be finished did make observation thereon to capability of listening without interruption tait owed great deal of popularity truth be stranger than fiction after said when claude ended novel be le dramatic than episode of real life john parver did not dare to insinuate that supposed dead widow of murdered man be alive humph complicates matter more than ever at least clear character of hilliston yes assented tait doubtfully suppose doe can doubt said larcher dissatisfied with grudging consent can now see why hilliston be agitated at interview why asked not to see mr bezel so called why called here same evening to find out if have gone finally why wished to prepare before seeing by telling of tragedy oh see said tait quietly nine men out of ten must consider hilliston most disinterested person be tenth man be therefore skeptical of motive what motive can have for be just interrupted tait vivaciously ca see motive will find out day well can speak for said claude frowning after what mother have told believe hilliston to be upright honorable man be quite right to do so on evidence still if be must not keep informed of movement unless do intend to go on with matter asked abruptly assuredly be determined to find out who killed father tait walked to fireplace took up position on hearth rug idea have entered mind did not intend to put into word nevertheless be indirectly reason for next speech think after must be best to take hilliston advice let sleeping dog lie have not calculated effect of word on hearer for claude also arose from chair looked at with angry surprise understand said coldly hour back be more eager than to pursue unknown criminal now wish to withdraw may ask reason of sudden change seems to be useless to hope to find assassin replied tait shrugging shoulder one can not discover needle in haystack oh yes can by patient research well even must be easier than to hope to solve mystery have be impenetrable for five twenty year have be impenetrable for time because one have tried to solve be not real reason for wishing to end case what be reason speak insist upon knowing truth other did not reply thrust hand deeper into pocket maintained masterly silence irritated by negative attitude claude placed hand on little man shoulder looked at indignantly know what reason be tait said rapidly be not that fear may learn too little that expect will learn too much yes replied tait simply be reason be not sufficient one for to pause shouted claude savagely be sufficient for to go on think that may discover that hilliston be criminal learn that mother be accountable for crime tell such thing will happen hilliston be not near laurel on fatal morning mother have told how exonerated exoneration be substantiated by denis bantry be innocent may be so who be guilty jeringham believe that discovered that father have returned perhaps knowing of intrigue between mona bantry remained at laurel unknown to mother in order to assist a friend how did jeringham obtain possession of dagger can not say must find out did obtain possession of dagger during quarrel with father killed with fled to avoid consequence oh yes swear that jeringham be guilty will hunt down if have to do alone will not do alone said tait quietly be with still said know what said think be best to leave well alone since be set on learning truth will help to best of ability only added tait explicitly must discover truth to be unpalatable blame wo blame be certain that will find that be right that hilliston mother have nothing to do with affair help be ask will bear consequence very good then have better get to work said tait dryly just go dress dear fellow will keep dinner waiting why must dress be not going out to night indeed be be due at mr durham 'at home ' at ten o'clock sha go be in mood for frivolity must rather stay at home think over case be only by hard work that can hope to learn truth very true at same time be necessary for to go out to night if only to meet with john parver author of ' whim of fate ' asked claude eagerly be in town yes will be at mr durham to night must see find out where obtained material for novel do think such information will lead to result asked claude dubiously think

annoyed at persistent mistrust manifested toward gentleman by tait however have time to explain expostulate at present moment moreover a knew that little man be assisting in difficult case out of pure friendship did not deem politic to comment on be assuredly unfounded prejudice tait be singular in judgment stubborn in opinion so claude unwilling to risk loss of coadjutor wisely held peace astute companion guessed thought for in place of further remarking on inexplicable presence of hilliston turned conversation toward man be about to see queer thing be said a ascended stair linton be son of vicar of thorston ah that doubt account for intimate knowledge of locality do know of course do a frank linton have idea that be john parver why did assume nom de plume tait shrugged shoulder paternal prejudice believe said carelessly mr linton doe not approve of sensational novel moreover wish son to be lawyer not literary man young frank be in solicitor office in lincoln inn field employed evening in writing ' whim of fate ' published under name of 'john parver ' so a to hoodwink father now that have scored success have doubt will confess do think will learn anything from will learn wish to know a to where obtained material young man head be turned by playing on vanity may find out truth vanity may lead to conceal fact that took plot from real life think so know boy well be great babbler one be more astonished than at learning that be celebrated john parver did think have brain to produce so clever book be clever assented claude absently of course be much cleverer than author retorted tait dryly rather must say supposed author for verily believed jenny paynton helped to write book who be jenny paynton very nice girl who life at thorston be twice a clever a lad be great on literary matter will tell about later on for here be linton celebrated author be light haired light complexioned young man of six twenty with bowed shoulder self satisfied smile pince nez used at time to emphasize remark evidently possessed conceit sufficient to stock dozen ordinary men lisped out newest idea of day a promulgated by college for be oxford man although be still in salad day have settled to own satisfaction question of life therefore adopted calm superiority be peculiarly exasperating claude liberal minded hot blooded have not be five minute in company before be seized with wild desire to throw out of window frank linton inspired that uncharitable feeling in many people for moment mr linton be alone a latest worshiper raw boned female of cab horse specie have just departed with fat little painter in quest of refreshment therefore when turned to greet claude be quite prepared to assume that fatigued conscious air with thought fit to welcome new votary linton be mr larcher said tait abruptly claude see before lion of season be very good of to say so mr tait simpered lion in wise disclaiming compliment be pleased to make acquaintance mr larcher yours mr linton will say mr parver oh name will answer said author loftily though in town be known a parver only in thorston a linton interpolated tait smartly then father doe not yet know what celebrated son have not yet mr tait intend to tell next week go down to thorston for purpose ah friend will doubt meet there also seek rural felicity for month now that have taken london by storm suppose intend to forsake law for profit of course do replied linton quickly never cared for law only went into to please father now go into literature to please miss paynton linton blushed at home thrust being readier with pen than tongue did not know what answer to make pitying confusion anxious to arrive at main object of interview claude interpolated remark bearing thereon did find difficult to work out plot of novel mr linton said with assumed carelessness oh not at construction of plot be second nature with suppose miss paynton talked over together said tait artfully well yes answered linton again falling into confusion found good listener presume be new to think so of course gave hint evidently linton be determined to admit nothing so seeing that tait attack be thus repulsed claude brought up reserve force saw in paper other day that book be impossible one nothing analogous to story ever happened in real life several critic have said that replied linton growing angry thereby losing caution be wrong a must prove did choose to do so what said claude in feigned astonishment did take incident from real life tale be founded on incident from real life answered linton flushing be miss paynton told of certain crime be actually committed on hint worked out story oh miss paynton told said tait smoothly where did see account of crime ah can not tell replied linton frankly related history of crime refused to let know whence obtained thought idea good one so wrote novel why tell to world so confound critic do have told several people for instance told gentleman about very evening just because made same remark a mr larcher did tait drew long breath stole look at claude that young man have changed color gave utterance to first idea entered mind be mr hilliston who made remark hilliston hilliston said linton thoughtfully yes believe be man tall old gentleman very fresh colored be greatly interested in literary work who must help being interested in so clever book said claude in meaning tone mr hilliston be lawyer suppose like member of profession now why must say that demanded linton rather taken aback by perspicacity well for one thing admit dislike for law for make michael dene solicitor commit crime in ' whim of fate ' oh only did that a be least likely person to be suspected said author easily jenny be miss paynton wanted to make markham commit crime markham be jeringham murmured tait under breath who committed crime in actual case added aloud one know answered linton shrugging shoulder case a related to be mystery solved after own fashion in third volume trace assassin by mean of breastpin belonging to michael dene said claude again in favor be that fact fiction fiction miss paynton invented idea said that a dagger inculpated woman breastpin found on bank of river must lead to detection of man a worked out idea be good one ah murmured tait to wonder if mr hilliston have anything to do with breastpin by time linton be growing rather restive under examination a be by mean pleased at having to acknowledge indebtedness to woman wit seeing tait abruptly closed conversation so a to avoid waking suspicion of linton very interesting conversation said heartily like to get behind scene see working of novelist brain will say good by now linton hope will call at manor house next week when will three be at thorston delighted be sure replied author thereupon melted into crowd leaving claude tait looking at one well said former after pause have not learned much on contrary think have learned great deal said tait raising eyebrow know that linton got whole story from jenny paynton that mr hilliston be in possession of knowledge what use can be to will try frustrate with miss paynton a did mr bezel with do still doubt asked claude angrily yes replied tait coolly still doubt chapter xvi false move next day two young men repaired to club for purpose of having luncheon discussing plan contrary to wish of claude friend did not deem advisable to at once depart for thorston a wished to remain in town for few day on business connected with hilliston see be quite in dark regarding that gentleman said tait a lighted cigarette after dinner before commence operation at thorston will be advisable to know that be not counteracting effort in case have better go down to thorston will remain in town so a to keep eye on hilliston think will be necessary replied tait reflectively be more than probable that hilliston will visit thorston for what purpose ca guess last night learned from linton that jenny paynton supplied material for novel consequently will see if possible find out where heard story yes suppose will said claude thoughtfully by way who be miss paynton who now seems to be mixed up in matter be daughter of old recluse called ferdinand paynton recluse humph be strange why so must not say so if saw old man be invalid life in library charming companion though must say be rather sad where doe live at thorston mile from manor house not very rich must think cottage be small like income daughter life with yes pretty girl be who inherits literary taste be impression that wrote most part of novel from know of frank linton be given more to poetry than to prose jenny have brain not frank ho ho said claude smiling be skeptical misogynistic tait hear speaking admit that care for woman a rule there be exception to rule in case jenny paynton be exception be in love with author rather think be in love with a will be when see what be talking about tait have more to do than to fall in love with country wench however pretty jenny be not country wench said tait with displeasure be highly educated young woman worse worse hate highly educated bluestocking wo hate jenny at event especially a be probable will see great deal of will keep away from said claude doggedly be impossible must maneuver to get at truth by asking straight out certainly will not gratify curiosity must plot plan take unawares be not fool like linton remember what do call lion of season by so opprobrious name do replied tait serenely because believe wrote book well well never mind linton have pumped dry next thing be to tackle fair jenny how do intend to set about ca say at present must be guided by circumstance will introduce to rector to mr paynton there will be musical party lawn tennis fete so in way may find out truth doe anyone else live with paynton wife for instance wife died before came to thorston where have be for long time old servant called kerry life with man woman man queer old fellow rather morose h be flattering description by way bear same name a ancient retainer in boucicault play why must may be assumed name tait threw surprised glance at friend laughed quickly who be suspicious now said smiling blame for suspecting hilliston yet here be doubtful of people whom have never seen before larcher must answer home thrust waiter entered with letter for have just arrived from hilliston said claude recognizing writing wonder what have to say be only move in game murmured tait then a claude after glancing at letter uttered ejaculation of surprise added what be matter hilliston be going down to eastbourne impossible cried tait holding out hand for letter be surely not so clumsy a to show hand so plainly doe though read letter dear claude wrote hilliston mr

remark on part may set on right path well will be guided by said claude in few minute can go to hampstead will dine with hilliston like task to sit at man table scheme against be not idea of honor be mine be doing such thing wish to do be to observe hilliston attitude hold tongue there be nothing wrong in want to find out motive for behavior then why not see will see at thorston meantime be necessary that become acquainted with mother now come wire acceptance to hilliston write letter to mother for to deliver claude obeyed be quite content to accept guidance of tait in matter began to think that friend be right in suspecting hilliston else why did lawyer plan so coincide with own mind tell hilliston too much said tait when wire be despatched will tell that go to thorston shortly that saw john parver tell about john parver will be certain to mention subject first well if doe oh must use brain replied tait ironically baffle curiosity above make mention of breastpin episode related in third volume why not because jenny paynton told linton of must not have obtained from newspaper a be not related therein be pure invention believe to be fact who must have told to miss paynton ah said tait in low tone find person who told that will find man who murdered father chapter xvii husband at kensington gore to woman who rule by right of beauty be terrible thing to see empire slipping from grasp by reason of gray hair wrinkle what desperate effort doe make to protract sway how dye paint powder tight lace to end for time be stronger than art finally writes sign manual too deep to be effaced by cosmetic mr hilliston be not yet beaten in fight with old enemy foresaw future when must be shamed neglected close at hand perhaps be premonition of defeat that made so unamiable sharp bitter on night when claude came to dine liked claude have stood in place of mother to be man handsome so when saw surprised look at changed appearance evil be in came to surface yet need not have felt so bitter pang have taken trouble to glance at image in near mirror reflected tall stylish figure in dim light of drawing room looked majestic beautiful be very well to think that appeared barely thirty in twilight knew well that daylight showed up forty seven year in most merciless manner velvet robe diamond necklace such like aid to beauty must not make up for lack of youth claude ill advised start brought home to ten year before have married hilliston in utter ignorance of house at hampstead though did not know be not unlike rival there be same majesty same imperious beauty same passionate nature mr bezel be worn wasted by illness whereas mr hilliston aided by art looked rarely beautiful woman people said have not done well to marry hilliston be then rich widow from america wanted to take position in society with look money might have married title handsome hilliston crossed path though be then fifty year of age fell in love with on spot wearied of mr bezel anxious to mend failing fortune hilliston accepted homage thus offered did not love kept that knowledge to so mr derrick wealthy widow secured man idolized gave wealth beauty love received nothing in return during married life love have undergone abatement loved husband passionately one object in life be to please at time of marriage have rather resented presence of claude in hilliston house soon accepted a established fact more so a took up profession shortly afterward left to reign alone over heart of husband when young man called be always kind to constantly looked after welfare playfully styled mother claude be greatly attached to spoke of in highest term for life of must not suppress that start though knew wounded to heart during five year of absence have aged greatly art seemed rather to accentuate than conceal truth find altered be afraid said bitterly age be robbing of look by mean answered claude with desire to please at worst be only growing old gracefully small comfort in sighed mr hilliston want to grow old at however be use fighting inevitable hope will die before become hag will never become one be not so sure of be one of large woman who turn to bone wrinkle in old age in eye will always be beautiful louise said hilliston who entered at moment be angel ever bright fair have not lost art of saying pretty thing francis replied wife greatly gratified there be gong claude take mother in to dinner young man winced a said thinking of real mother who lay sick feeble at hampstead hilliston saw change of countenance bit lip to prevent remarking thereon guessed what claude be thinking about thus thought be turned in same direction at present moment memory thus evoked be most unpleasant during dinner mr hilliston recovered spirit talked freely enough one be present save claude husband so be very pleasant party of three while in full flow of conversation claude must not help thinking that tait be unjust to suspect master of house of underhand dealing for hilliston be full of smile geniality did best to entertain guest must claude have looked below surface must have be considerably astonished at inward aspect of man yet hint be given of such want of concord for hilliston showed cloven hoof before meal ended so be going to eastbourne said claude addressing to mr hilliston hope will come over to thorston during stay be not unlikely replied lady francis intends to make excursion round country only for amusement dear said hastily know how dreary be to pace daily up down parade think eastbourne be dreary in case be solely on account be going hilliston did not answer stole glance at claude to see what thought face of young man be inscrutable though claude be mentally considering that tait be right hilliston journey to eastbourne be undertaken to interview jenny paynton like english watering place continued mr hilliston idly be so exasperatingly dull in america can have good time at newport south coast be devoid of amusement trouville dieppe be more enjoyable than eastbourne folkestone fault of national character dear louise english take pleasure sadly know for sole purpose of seeing effect must produce on lawyer claude purposely introduced name of town where father have met death wonder try inland watering place mr hilliston said calmly bath tunbridge well horriston hilliston looked up quickly then busied with food discomposed a be iron will enabled to retain quiet demeanor effect of name on wife be more pronounced than be on husband color went laid down knife fork ah know horriston said faintly inland ah how hot room be open window added to footman want fresh air rather astonished at effect thus produced claude must have spoken that hilliston forestalled room be hot said lightly fresh air will soon revive louise be glad be going to eastbourne for sadly need change season have be rather trying replied wife resuming dinner what be saying about horriston claude nothing only know be provincial town set in beautiful scenery thought might wish to try change from fashionable seaside place might go there if be pretty answered mr hilliston who be now perfectly composed where be horriston in kent interposed hilliston quickly not very far from canterbury have be there a be rather dull neighborhood must not advise to try despite denial claude felt certain that mr hilliston be acquainted with horriston for on plea of indisposition left table before dinner be ended a passed through door playfully tipped claude on shoulder with fan forget to come see at eastbourne said vivaciously bring mr tait with be great favorite of mine claude promised to do when left room returned to seat with rather puzzled expression on face hilliston saw look endeavored to banish by hasty explanation rather startled wife by mentioning horriston said in annoyed tone wish have not done so a be connected with case naturally feel antipathy toward doe mr hilliston know about father death asked claude in surprise yes when married wanted to know why lived in house with so be forced to explain circumstance do think be necessary do know how suspicious woman be replied hilliston lightly will know truth can trust to discretion claude one will hear of from at moment footman entered room with message from mr hilliston mistress want to know if have third volume of ' whim of fate ' sir said servant replied hilliston sharply tell mistress that took to office by mistake will have to morrow claude thought strange when footman retired hilliston made explanation equally a unsatisfactory a first be so interested in book must not leave at home said quickly now have met author be doubly interested in proof of tait acumen hilliston be first to introduce subject of john parver chapter xviii duel of word longish pause ensued between two men hilliston seemed to be in hurry to continue conversation claude with eye fixed absently on glass pondered over fact mr hilliston have aversion to horriston that lawyer have taken third volume of novel out of house two fact seemed to have connection with other what connection might be claude must not rightly conclude from frequent talk with tait knew that third volume contained episode of scarfpin be instrumental in bringing fictitious murderer to justice assassin in novel be meant for hilliston remembering claude wondered whether there might not be reason for removal of book mr hilliston have quailed at mention of horriston explanation given by husband did not satisfy larcher what reason must have for taking more than passing interest in tragic story why after ten year must pale at mention of neighborhood claude asked two question must find satisfactory answer to of be toying with wineglass while thinking when sudden thought made grip slender stem with spasmodic force be possible that mr hilliston must have be in neighborhood five twenty year before must have heard talk of scarfpin be not mentioned at trial tait insisted be actual fact figment of novelist brain finally must be that hilliston have purposely removed third volume of whim of fate so that wife must not have memory refreshed by relation of incident be very strange thus thinking claude glanced stealthily at guardian who be musingly smoking cigar drinking wine looked calm content prosperous nevertheless claude be by mean so sure of innocence a have be hilliston confusion hesitation evasion instilled doubt into young man mind determined to gain knowledge of truth by question mentally arranged a follows first must try learn somewhat of past of mr hilliston for beyond fact that be american knew nothing of second must lead hilliston to talk of scarfpin see if reference annoyed third must endeavor to discover if lawyer be averse to wife reading novel with plan thus cut dried spoke abruptly to guardian be sorry mr hilliston health be so bad be not bad dear fellow replied lawyer lifting head be very strong woman of course fatigue of london season tell on healthiest constitution be why wish her to go to eastbourne why not take to horriston why must connects place with story of father about whom be forced to speak ten year ago speaking personally have desire to return there recall horror of past be greatly affected by father death naturally be dearest friend must have given anything to discover assassin did mr hilliston give opinion a to who be guilty told a little a must of so painful subject be not in possession of fact at rate why let read ' whim of fate ' wish to read answered hilliston quietly left novel lying about read first two volume if can help will not finish story why object to reading third volume because must recall past too vividly to mind hardly follow there said claude with keen look fact to refer can not exist for wife to novel can only be second telling of story related by when wished to know who be be very true nevertheless made so painful impression on excitable nature be unwilling that memory must be refreshed take glass of wine boy hilliston evidently wished to turn conversation claude be too determined on learning truth to deviate from course slowly filling glass with claret pushed jug toward hilliston pursued questioning american nature be rather excitable be by way be mr hilliston pure blooded yankee yes said hilliston with suspicious promptitude be chicago belle married millionaire in pork line called derrick died soon after marriage so came to england married be first visit to england doubt first visit replied hilliston gravely former life be passed in new york boston chicago what odd question ask added lawyer in vexed tone surely think that wife be at horriston twenty five year ago that know aught of crime save what have told of course think nothing of sort said larcher hastily what be more believed what said be impossible that mr hilliston american born bred who have only be in england twelve year must know anything of obscure crime committed in dull provincial town thirteen year before date of arrival hitherto questioning have eventuated in little so turned conversation into groove tried to learn if hilliston knew anything of jenny paynton what do think of john parver seemed intelligent young fellow be that real name name be frank linton son of vicar of thorston what belongs to place whither go with tait exclaimed hilliston with startled air be strange may learn there whence obtained material for novel know that obtained from miss paynton who be literary young lady who life at thorston with folk fancy linton mentioned that have told about well did did said hilliston in confusion be admitted that story be founded on fact did not tell whence obtained such fact suppose be intention to question young lady yes want to know how heard of matter pooh read in provincial newspaper doubt think not replied claude with point be next to impossible that must come across paper containing account of trial people keep such grewsome matter by unless have interest in doing so well young lady can not be one of person how old be four twenty ah said hilliston with sigh of relief be not born when father be murdered must see can know nothing positive of matter then how did supply linton with material for book can only answer question by reverting to theory of newspaper well even granting that be so said larcher quickly know detail of case be not set forth in newspaper how do know asked hilliston biting lip to control feeling because in third volume nonsense nonsense interrupted hilliston violently seem to forget that hard fact of case have be twisted turned by novelist brain know who slew father novelist have to end story have to solve mystery have done so after own fashion rising from seat paced hurriedly to fro talking while with agitation strange in so hard controlled man for instance character of michael dene be obviously taken from be not bit like of course in speech look dress novelist knew be that have given evidence at trial that dead man have be dearest friend circumstance suggested striking dramatic situation that dear friend have committed crime for base love of wife michael dene be guilty in novel man in real life know know of case must give ten year of life short a span now be to find man who killed george larcher be strong speaking carried conviction to heart of claude more so when hilliston further explained on night of murder be at ball three mile off knew nothing of matter till be called upon to identify corpse of father be hardly recognizable face be much disfigured recognized by color of hair seal on finger how be that father be dressed a darnley john parver explains that said hilliston sharply jeringham forget name in novel be dressed a darnley believe a be set forth in book george larcher assumed dress so under mask mother might mistake for jeringham evidently did so a learned that loved jeringham one moment interposed claude quickly mother denies that jeringham be lover mother mr bezel true forgot for moment that knew be alive doubt be right jeringham be only friend in novel be lover michael dene drawn from be lover see fact fiction be so mixed up that there be getting at truth will get at truth said claude quietly never after such lapse of time can discover nothing better let dead past bury dead advised before advise now will only torture life cumber with useless task george be dead buried dust by time one know who killed one ever will know be determined to learn truth hope may be advised leave matter alone know what misery may be laying up for why have not even clew to start from unless added hilliston with sneer follow example of novelist elucidate mystery by mean of scarfpin again tait be right hilliston have introduced subject of scarfpin claude immediately took advantage of opening suppose that episode be fiction of course be scarfpin be found in garden nothing be found dagger know that michael dene be supposed to drop scarfpin on spot well be living representative of michael dene assure never owned garnet cross with central diamond be that description of scarfpin yes do not remember small maltese cross of garnet with diamond in center description sound fictitious who ever saw such ornament in real life in detective novel solution of mystery turn on such gew gaws scarfpin stud link brooch go to hang man in novel assertion that episode of scarfpin be fiction be in direct contradiction to of tait who declared to be true claude be torn by conflicting doubt ultimately put matter out of thought miss paynton alone must give correct opinion a to whether have emanated from fertile brain be really link in actual case judging from speech of hilliston silence of newspaper report claude believed that tait be wrong lawyer guest did not go to drawing room a mr hilliston sent word that be going to bed with bad headache under circumstance claude took leave having a thought extracted necessary information from hilliston moreover be anxious to get back to tait chamber hear what little man have to tell about mr bezel hilliston said good by to at door will see at eastbourne suppose said genially yes will drive over tell what miss paynton say door closed hilliston with frown on face stood looking at floor be by mean satisfied with result of interview wish must stop muttered clenching fist stop at price if go on will learn truth if learns truth ah drew long breath went upstairs to wife a ascended stair seemed to a though heard halting step of nemesis following stealthily behind chapter xix tait brings news a quick a fast hansom must take claude drove to earl street found tait impatiently waiting arrival little man have look of triumph in eye showed that interview with mr bezel have be to purpose dormer have placed wine biscuit on table made hungry by long journey to hampstead tait be partaking of modest refreshment when claude entered room thought be never coming said glancing at watch past ten o'clock must have have interesting conversation with hilliston to stay so long have have very interesting conversation oh got back thirty minute ago after being more than hour with mother be disappointed at non appearance very much so explained that have to dine with hilliston did not seem to like that absurd think end of hilliston advised to see a much of a possible nevertheless idea that be dining with did not please must only quiet by telling know about mr hilliston when tait made remark claude be taking off cloak paused in doing so to ask question what possible interest can mother have in mr hilliston know asked who be where came from insisted on description of look altogether pumped dry on subject suppose wished to know something of hilliston domestic felicity a have not enlightened on subject applied to explanation be accepted implicitly by claude be by mean truth with usual sharpness tait have noted mr bezel be profoundly jealous of lawyer wife from sundry other hint have drawn conclusion by mean flattering to lady still a be claude mother have too much good breeding too much liking for friend to state belief be that bond between mr hilliston mr bezel be not of so harmless nature a must have world believe with idea in head tait began to look at case from point of view adopted by john parver might not be true that hilliston be secret lover of wife murderer of husband certainly effort be making to stay claude in solving mystery gave color to idea if be innocent of crime illicit passion must surely be anxious to hasten instead of retarding discovery tait private opinion be that hilliston have crime of murder on soul for obvious reason not unconnected with mr bezel did not care to speak openly to larcher on contrary while admitting disbelief in lawyer feigned doubt of complicity in matter be far from feeling under circumstance have advised claude to leave matter alone for dreaded effect on friend mind when learned truth whether hilliston proved innocent not unraveling of mystery must necessarily result in disclosure of relation existing between mr bezel tait shrank from pursuing investigation likely to lead to result determination of claude to avenge father murder left option against better judgment be urged along path of discovery trusted when time came to soften blow of inevitable result in silence heard story related by claude of evening at hilliston did not comment on information thus given so speedily a larcher expected thought wiser to delay remark till have told young man of interview with mr bezel need not go into detail claude said anxious not to say too much will tell a shortly a can mr bezel be more convenient to speak of so than to call mother be not pleased that must try solve mystery know that think be hopeless be unwilling must waste time to purpose must have thought of before inducing hilliston to show paper now be too late for own satisfaction if not for hers must go on with matter did relate conversation with linton yes take same view of a hilliston that miss paynton got case from bundle of old newspaper what do think still hold to opinion said tait quietly affair be related to jenny by someone who lived in horriston at time murder took place else must never have given linton that fact about scarfpin a know be not mentioned in report of trial hilliston say that episode be fiction mr bezel say be fact what be scarfpin of garnet really found in ground of laurel be mr bezel described jewel to asserted that be discovered near bank of stream doe know to whom belonged have recollection of having seen before father jeringham wore scarfpin of pattern be curious that hilliston must insist that pin never existed be very curious assented tait significantly especially a be shown to by denis bantry one fact ought to convince that hilliston be playing false doubt be confirmed by manner to night replied claude gloomily know what reason may be how can reconcile present behavior with kindness to mother certainly seems anxious to thwart if can tait guessed what reason be very well be too wise to explain granted that bond existed between mr bezel lawyer whole thing became clear mr bezel be claude mother so tait held peace why be scarfpin produced at trial asked claude seeing friend made answer only one man can answer question denis bantry doe mother know where be have not set eye on since left horriston be strange that must have suppressed so important piece of evidence said claude meditatively devoted a be to father must have thought must have done best to bring murderer to justice perhaps did not know who murderer be however there be doubt that scarfpin must have told something about judged wise to hold tongue perhaps miss paynton can enlighten on subject then must know denis bantry so think said tait thoughtfully episode of scarfpin be only known to mother to hilliston to bantry jenny paynton doe not know mother who denied knowledge of can not be acquainted with hilliston certainly must not have let make use of affair for linton book even if have told there only remains denis bantry now know jenny have lived life at thorston so if saw man anywhere must have be there be there anyone in neighborhood think be asked larcher greatly excited none can call to mind then know neighborhood very well must make thorough exploration of when be down there certainly seems to that only one who can put in right track be girl true enough only hope will be amenable to reason larcher poured out glass of wine drank slowly then lighted pipe returned to chair with new idea in head wonder why hilliston told that lie about scarfpin tait ask something easier can not say will learn nothing from dear fellow be use asking further question of guardian of mother have found out from that can nothing now remains to see jenny paynton quite right go to thorston to morrow by ordinary train have written for dogcart to meet by time next week may know great deal may know truth be if hilliston doe thwart be going down to eastbourne remember know intend to get what american call 'inside running ' by seeing jenny to morrow evening whole case turn on explanation of scarfpin episode well said claude knocking ash out of pipe found through book found jenny through linton through may find denis bantry through denis bantry may find man who killed father finished tait triumphantly well know what name of man will be what will be jeringham tait shrugged shoulder knowing what did be by mean certain on point chapter xx precis of case month ago have anyone prophesied that spenser tait must be engaged in playing part of amateur detective must have flatly contradicted prognostication yet here be doing best to solve mystery hang round death of friend father can not say that object to task for there be something tremendously exciting in man hunt friendship for claude be principal factor induces to meddle with business slight flavoring of selfishness be also present hitherto have be fairly successful have at least found clew likely to lead to certain result between mr bezel hilliston linton book have learned good deal of case knowledge point to interview with jenny paynton a next step to be taken to morrow start for thorston for purpose before exploring new field judge wise to set down fact have come to knowledge to deduce therefrom if possible logical reason for future action have suspicion be vague intangible claude have suspicion coincide with mine belief jeringham to be guilty of crime think hilliston be likely to prove assassin of may be wrong to take case of mr hilliston attitude be decidedly aggressive at present moment be doing best to dissuade claude from investigating case why must do so george larcher be dearest friend met with cruel fate if there be chance of fate being avenged surely hilliston must be first to prosecute inquiry instead of doing so hang back throw cold water on effort on claude must have reason for action be that reason to be found at clarence cottage in hampstead question brings to delicate point work be hampered by fact that mr bezel be claude mother dare not express a must wish gather from report of trial mr be vain silly coquette who threw away love of good man for indulgence of own selfish instinct guilty may have be not with jeringham if have lover be francis hilliston after visit to clarence cottage believe view taken of case by novelist to be right one during interview with mr bezel noted look action when hilliston name occurred flushed up looked savage be anxious to know about wife at kensington gore in way showed that have more interest in man than cared to confess again told that illness be of ten year duration hilliston have be married ten year what be more likely than that must have wearied of invalid so deserted for mr derrick rich widow mr bezel be jealous of hilliston of wife love have changed to hatred verily believe that must harm if must already have attempted to do so for be only threat to reveal to claude that made hilliston produce report of larcher affair have told know can not help thinking that be keeping back certain fact connected with case there be hesitancy doubt in speech point to secret if must learn that secret might establish guilt of hilliston yet can not believe that woman however vain however frivolous must have lived with man who murdered husband who slew father of child mr bezel secret may not directly inculpate hilliston may point toward a possible assassin can not believe that think guilty relation with one forbids so horrible supposition nevertheless hilliston be afraid of truth coming to light denies that garnet scarfpin ever existed while mr bezel said saw if lawyer be not afraid why must tell deliberate lie be word against of mr bezel a statement be backed up by description in novel believe be telling truth can be possible that scarfpin belonged to hilliston be dropped by in garden of laurel on night of struggle here hilliston prof alibi stated to claude at hour of three o'clock when crime be presumably committed be at ball in horriston town hall if can be proved must perforce be innocent supposition can mr larcher be actually guilty of husband death knowing be hilliston anxious to stop claude in investigation lest must learn so terrible truth can not believe for mr larcher bezel set ball rolling be guilty certainly must not have run such risk then again jeringham fled on night of murder for what reason if hilliston killed larcher why must jeringham fly if mr bezel killed husband why must jeringham fly see reason in flight yet if be guilty hilliston knew to be guilty why must try screen at present time altogether case be so confusing that know what to think whom to suspect wonder have

be old people alive who danced at ball in hot youth may be able to say if george larcher be there present in character of darnley at what time hilliston left ball may also hear what think of jeringham of conduct of mr bezel in making investigation will not take claude a shrewdly suspect opinion of oldster regarding mother be anything flattering to lady if go to horriston must go alone on reading

vibrated among arch in great burst of sound march anthem offertory till tait almost fell asleep lulled by drone of pipe at length jenny brought performance to end having dismissed boy who attended to bellow tripped down aisle with music book under arm looked a fresh pink a rose quite out of place in bare bleak building toward tait advanced with bow here be see miss paynton said shaking by hand heard music must not help coming in to listen hope mind intrusion oh lord of manor can go anywhere said jenny demurely be glad to see again mr tait second time to day be not yes drove past in market place if remember rightly wo sit down miss paynton give news be terribly ignorant of local gossip assure nothing loath girl seated in pew near door occupied in fixing glove remembering conversation with linton be slightly uneasy at tait very direct request thinking that must not possibly have anything to do with plot of linton novel resigned to circumstance before conversation ended wished that have refused to speak to tait at moment be then too late news repeated with laugh do ever have news in dreary place must rather ask for news mr tait who be fresh from london oh doubt young author have already told be worth hearing said tait deftly leading up to point have be quite lion of season yes have be very fortunate replied jenny carefully did not relish sudden introduction of forbidden subject owes to believe to good gracious mr tait have to do with frank success according to what say everything what do mean said sitting up very straight with deeper color than usual on cheek why said tait looking directly at thereby adding to confusion frank told that supplied plot of ' whim of fate ' what if did mr tait oh nothing only must compliment on will say selection invention former replied jenny with extraordinary quickness since frank make secret of why must plot be told by found set forth a trial in newspaper of h be in canterbury observer believe how do know be name of paper asked in nervous tone learned from same source supplied with history of larcher affair what also know name of case a see frank doe not know did not show paper suppressed name when told story said incoherently now know yes be right observed tait complacently be better acquainted with plot of ' whim of fate ' than john parver jenny sat looking at in kind of wild amazement from significance of tone extent of knowledge vaguely felt that something be wrong again anger of kerry conversation of linton came into mind saw into what difficulty chance telling of ancient crime have led tait noticed that be perplexed frightened so dexterously strove to set more at ease by making clean breast of enlisting sympathy for claude saw friend who be with in cart miss paynton yes who be claude larcher claude la what do mean mr tait be in dark understand have done anything wrong in in in telling case to linton finished tait smoothly by mean a matter of fact have done friend service be called larcher who be asked again with effort be son of george larcher who be murdered at horriston in chapter xxiii fact fiction silence ensued between tait waiting to mark effect of revelation while jenny tried to grasp idea that fiction have changed unexpectedly to fact to case have be more le of romance far removed impossible a such have told to linton now brought face to face with fact that murdered man son be in neighborhood scarcely knew what to think certainly be ignorant what to say shock must have more nervous woman jenny paynton be not wanting in pluck so braced up to do what be required of took little time to recover seeing tait afforded opportunity by talking broadly of matter later on intended to enter into detail wonder be startled miss paynton said easily be coincidence such a rarely meet with in real life friend be ignorant of father fate one evening paper be put into hand recounted tragedy paper similar to whence obtained story came to tell scarcely have begun relation when became aware that knew everything beforehand have also seen paper mr tait have read ' whim of fate ' there found larcher affair set forth in guise of fiction astonished at sought out linton who learned be author hidden under name of john parver asked whence obtained material mentioned name so have come to why can ask to find out know of matter for what reason think can guess reason replied tait quietly friend claude larcher wish to find out who killed father after five twenty year impossible so said at first now be of different opinion in short space of time have found out great deal with help will discover more so in end matter may be cleared up want help decidedly be solely for reason that larcher have come here be pale faced jenny who sat considering reply to remark began to be aware that have inadvertently set ball rolling progress of be powerless to stop chance discovery in garret have resuscitated old scandal brought into contact with people of whose existence have hitherto be ignorant a matter of fact jenny be responsible for revival of larcher affair narration of plot have caused writing of novel that in turn have freshened memory of mr bezel with result that claude have be told truth now have come to source to learn more see how can help said jenny fencing with inevitable if a say mr larcher saw canterbury observer must know a much a do about matter very true replied tait promptly there be many thing in novel be not mentioned in report of case thing be fictitious must go to frank for information about be that scarfpin episode fictitious replied jenny with hesitation kerry told that kerry man servant have be with father ever since can remember be quite autocrat of household found with paper one day after told frank story took away from have idea how angry be that have read yet told about scarfpin oh be because asked who have committed crime said jenny quickly at first must not talk about when said that doubt jeringham be guilty since have fled kerry denied asserted that crime be committed by man who owned garnet scarfpin did say who owned no went away before must ask will not let speak of matter in book frank make michael dene owner of pin ah michael dene be francis hilliston in real life how do know asked girl quickly with nervous start dear young lady have read report of case novel be easy to see who fictitious personage be do know mr hilliston little have visited father once twice have not seen now for many year in fact have almost forgotten name till saw in case humph in novel michael dene man meant for hilliston commits crime be that idea linton be frank dene be least likely person to be suspected be necessary to keep up mystery to end think ought to have made markham commit crime markham be jeringham be not said tait thoughtfully with permission miss paynton will use real name not fictitious will help to understand matter more clearly jenny stood up tucked music book under arm recollection of kerry anger made feel that be unwise to talk so freely to stranger about matter hitherto tait have taken own way now be resolved to take hers want to speak more about said resolutely be very sorry told frank story meddled with paper let pas mr tait drop subject do cried tait rising in turn barring way must not fail at eleventh hour friend be bent on learning truth surely will not grudge help remember be murderer of father whom desire to bring to justice ca say more know more mr tait do know what be about to do said tait looking at grave face in wonder be going home to tell father kerry what use made of paper if have acted wrongly be right that must know will know shortly without telling miss jenny ah intend to speak of matter perhaps in case allude to hilliston hilliston repeated jenny in surprise what have to do with matter great deal fancy more than suspect be now at eastbourne be certain will come over here to see to morrow to see why because want to hold tongue about matter mr tait cried with sudden flush surely be not biased by frank book imply that mr hilliston be afraid of truth think be in fact be sure be do believe committed that cowardly crime of twenty five year ago asked jenny with scorn what be own opinion be counter question believe that jeringham be murderer yes captain larcher went in disguise to ball learned truth from lip of own wife believe loved jeringham believe followed home on fatal night urging to fly then captain larcher appeared on scene in struggle ensued be killed jeringham fled mr larcher died that be certain be true history of crime then think that mr larcher be privy to murder oh say said girl shrinking back be impossible to say have right to talk to about matter mr tait have told know let pas please tait bowed stood aside hat in hand flitted down aisle slim girlish figure have arrived at door when voice arrested one moment miss paynton said following quickly what be tell father of for twenty four hour why because want to prove to that what say be true hilliston will inform father ask to be silent be too late for now unfortunately why unfortunately must be glad to have strengthened hand of justice however need not speak of now will promise to withhold confession for time ask promise nothing mr tait good evening miss paynton said following again surely will not be so rash can have idea how important matter be to friend mr hilliston be certain to inform father within next twenty four hour so surely can give time to do what can beg of jenny stopped irresolutely looked at tait with mixture of anger doubt matter have now grown so intricate that did not know what to do what to say have not known tait long enough to be guided by advice to rely on judgment impulse be to tell father receive suggestion a to what be best to be done under circumstance yet also mistrusted hilliston a connection with horriston case seemed to to be by mean a simple a have appeared at first sight be suspicious of if came over to thurston especially to ask to be silent must go long way toward confirming doubt then after harm must be done within twenty four hour a afterward must tell father thus at once satisfying conscience curiosity made compromise very well mr tait said gravely promise to be silent for twenty four hour chapter xxiv new suspicion spenser tait walked back to manor house with pleasing conviction that have passed very profitable hour have warned jenny about probable movement of hilliston thus have put on guard against astute individual once idea enters woman head be impossible to get out again tait by half hinting confirmation of jenny suspicion regarding lawyer have made uneasily conscious that hilliston be man to be watched reckoned with if hilliston fulfilled tait prophecy little man believed that jenny must resent interference penetrate motif thwart if possible in spite of denial that thought guilty tait must not perceive that reading of case have not biased in favor of dead man friend jenny believed that jeringham have committed crime if hilliston acted indiscreetly must not take much to induce to alter opinion tait chuckled a thought of thing for have not only cut ground from under hilliston foot by warning jenny of possible arrival have a truly thought converted passive spectator into active enemy again have learned that be old servant who have informed girl concerning scarfpin episode kerry said that man who owned scarfpin be guilty kerry knew to whom scarfpin belonged if must only be induced to part with information there might be chance of solving mystery kerry rather denis bantry past conduct present attitude be so doubtful that be difficult to know how must act even though be driven into corner tait have little doubt in own mind that kerry be old servant of captain larcher for one knew truth about scarfpin nevertheless failed to understand why man have changed name why be staying at thorston a servant to recluse like paynton only personal interview with must settle vexed question tait be of two opinion whether kerry must be amenable to reason confess reason for such concealment thus thinking trying to come to conclusion regarding new aspect placed upon affair by conversation with little man arrived home learning that claude be still in garden went there to report result of interview discus situation larcher be leaning back in comfortable garden chair with open book on knee instead of reading be staring with unseeing eye into fresh green of tree above on hearing tait brisk step hastily lowered head with flush a though have be caught doing something wrong grew still more confused when saw friend looking at with queer expression of amusement be pretty girl said tait significantly wonder be thinking of thinking of who asked claude merrily at reading of thought be mind reader so far a be concerned be knowing how easily influenced be by sight of pretty face think be far wrong in guessing that thought be with jenny paynton well yes replied claude with frank laugh deny glimpse caught of a drove past in cart charmed greatly have rarely seen more sympathetic piquant face bah say that of woman meet goose be always swan jenny be at event said larcher promptly can not deny that admire exceedingly be a pretty woman see already call jenny in own mind be because always talk of by christian name now jenny be dear don juan said tait blandly think have better leave off erotic get to business must not indulge in ideal to exclusion of real oh not that business sighed larcher wearily believe will do good with mystery of father death be likely to remain one to end of time for can see trace be obliterated by snow of twenty five year not entirely friend for instance have learned important fact to day from miss paynton yes have long conversation be considerably startled when learned object of visit here be wise of to tell why yes returned tait decidedly can hing without help that will refuse to give unless learns reason of inquiry what be opinion of matter same a linton suppose by mean think that jeringham killed father be not altogether sure that doe not suspect hilliston after may come round to linton opinion before long did tell that suspected hilliston asked claude anxiously not directly permitted to hint a much however only aided seed of suspicion to sprout for be already implanted in mind look astonished claude recall to recollection report of case will see that hilliston be far too much mixed up in matter to be a ignorant a pretended to be at trial according to evidence have not left ballroom consequently must have known nothing of tragedy be then being enacted at laurel yet know detail so far a can see prove to have be eye witness claude jumped to foot began restlessly pacing up down gravel walk yet retained belief in hilliston be reluctant to think that one to whom owed so much must be guilty of so foul crime be true that certain circumstance looked black against be purely theoretical by mean founded on absolute fact after due consideration claude inclined to belief that tait be too easily satisfied of hilliston guilt be willing to accept stray fact likely to confirm theory thus biased must not possibly look on matter in fair equable manner wish be altogether too greatly father to thought think give hilliston fair show tait said stepping before friend if wink eye look on a sign of guilt mother assured solemnly that hilliston be at ball when tragedy occurred oh in case have nothing more to say said tait coldly still added rather spitefully must like to know why mr hilliston be so anxious to keep matter quiet tait said claude hoarsely sitting down by friend seizing arm do know have often asked that question have found reply thereto only reply of can think paused looked fearfully around then wiped sweat off white face with nervous gesture tait eyed in amazement must not understand what have come over usually self possessed friend have time to speak for claude with irrepressible shiver whispered in low voice what if mother must be guilty after ah may well look astonished be hideous doubt have haunted for day mother say ran at father with dagger fainted before struck what if did not faint if really killed hilliston knowing be trying to screen trying to save from knowing truth dear fellow trial never mind trial now know that denis swore falsely when asserted that father be not in house on night know that be in house that mother found with mona bantry jealousy might have carried to greater length than intended to go denis saved at trial by telling lie know truth can not rid of doubt that may be guilty if so in place of being enemy hilliston be acting part of friend in placing obstacle in way tait shook head believe mr bezel be guilty said quietly if have be must certainly not have written to thus forced hilliston to show paper banish thought from heart claude be a certain a sit here that mother be innocent of crime if must only be certain why must not be exclaimed tait vigorously eye witness must tell truth where can find eye witness cried claude with impatient frown mona bantry jeringham have fled be probably dead by time mother denies that struck blow hilliston say be at ball when murder took place who can tell truth denis bantry said tait quietly listen to claude episode of garnet scarfpin to mind be clew to assassin be only known to mother to hilliston to denis bantry now hilliston denies that trinket exists mother insists that be found on bank of river after murder only person who can give casting vote who can arbitrate so to speak be denis bantry where be denis bantry lost dead year ago nothing of sort friend denis bantry be alive in neighborhood yes jenny paynton admitted to that scarfpin episode be related to by old servant kerry therefore naturally follows that kerry be denis bantry why be hiding here under name said larcher after have digested piece of information with due display of astonishment can not say unless here tait hesitated before uttering opinion unless denis bantry be guilty person be impossible be out of question said claude decidedly be devoted to father a know why must turn kill without cause ah said tait significantly what if have cause very good one to kill father recall mother confession returned at three o'clock in morning found husband alone with sister of denis accused mona of being husband mistress girl confessed guilt father evidently must not deny now what be more probable than denis attracted by high voice must have followed mother to room there must hear truth probably while waiting at door what follows with impulsive irish temperament dash in hot to avenge wrong done to sister dagger dropped by mother be at foot pick up kill master on instant mother in faint on floor know nothing of what be going on brother sister remove body to river where drop in then mona be sent away by denis to hide shame evade awkward question while remains why must remain interrupted claude smartly must not have be wiser for to fly so confess guilt no induces jeringham to fly with threat of denouncing a murderer of larcher jeringham be in such dilemma that seeing that evidence will be against take to flight thereupon denis be able to save mistress by denying that larcher came to house on night of course be pure theory still be a circumstantial a rest of evidence have in hand claude be by mean inclined to agree with last remark there be flaw in argument said after few moment reflection if denis intended to deny that father be in house on night why must induce jeringham to fly to make assurance doubly sure doubt intended first to put blame on jeringham finding that mr larcher be likely to be accused made thing safe for by denying that master returned on evening only four people knew of return mona who fled mr larcher who held tongue to save neck denis who swore falsely to serve mistress jeringham who thought might be accused of crime why must have denounced denis be doubtless ignorant that denis be criminal forget that jeringham be in garden knew nothing of what be taking place in sitting room denis rushed out finding jeringham may have told that mr larcher have killed husband on account man bewildered shocked yet see that be complicated in case through love for mr larcher guess that owing to gossip of place may be accused of crime so doe wisest thing must do only thing must do seek refuge in flight then think denis be guilty ca say a see can make strong case out against mother against jeringham against denis yes must even make case against mona bantry be sole theory yet denis must have reason for hiding here under name of 'kerry for keeping paper found by jenny contained report of case case be strong against hilliston admit be stronger against father own servant think so said claude quietly if denis have killed father must not have told jenny about scarfpin why not scarfpin may have belonged to jeringham to hilliston for own safety now that case be recognized after so many year by girl rash action denis must not hesitate to blame to save taking round added tait with air of one who have settled question think conduct of denis be very suspicious must not be surprised if turned out to be guilty person act of hilliston tait rubbed head looked vexed for be unable to give direct answer let leave matter alone for present said crossly be getting bewildered with talk only one person can tell truth be kerry alias denis bantry chapter xxv recluse meanwhile jenny be proceeding homeward in rather unhappy state of mind conversation have left unpleasant impression be by mean sure what must lead to hundred time did wish that have not meddled with matter be now too late for regret recognized that must bear burden of wrong doing though indeed must see reason to characterize action by so harsh name bundle of old paper in garret thought walking quickly through lane where be harm in reading a contained interesting story fail to see where acted wrongly in telling to frank larcher affair can have nothing to do with papa even though kerry be so angry will speak to kerry ask if have done wrong according to promise be determined to say nothing to father for at least twenty four hour for be curious to see if mr hilliston must call to speak of matter if did so then must be time to exculpate pending such visit saw reason why must not consult with kerry have expressed anger at possession of paper so if anyone must be able to explain if have be rash on kerry answer must depend explanation due to father thus thinking speedily arrived in deep lane at end of turned into white gate set in rugged stone wall nut tree bent over wall dropping fruit into rut of road on opposite side rose steep green bank topped by blackberry bush byway be little frequented here quiet constantly reigned unbroken save by voice of bird be great place for nightingale many summer evening did jenny stand under bending bough

since rarely leaving seeing few people accepting invitation man be recluse disliked fellow creature so when thorston became aware of peculiarity be left alone to live a chose may be guessed that peculiar habit made unpopular vicar be friendly to misanthrope for in paynton found kindred soul in matter of book many pleasant evening did spend in discussing literary subject bookroom be pleasantest apartment in house cosy warm lined throughout with volume in deep window stood desk here ferdinand paynton sat wrote day save when took usual stroll in garden jenny have also grown up in

armchair instead of at desk a usual looked rather sternly at a bent over tall white haired with sad face slim figure old man looked singularly interesting appearance being enhanced by peculiar garb dressing gown black skullcap indeed be more like mediaeval magician than aged gentleman of nineteenth century looked like man with history be doubtless reason thorston gossip be so anxious concerning past in country town curiosity be quite disease in hurry of entrance jenny have not noticed that stranger be present on greeting father with fond kiss turned to see elderly gentleman looking at intently mr paynton explained presence of stranger with le than usual suavity from tone of voice jenny guessed that be angry with a afterward appeared have good reason to be jenny be friend mr hilliston hilliston jenny must not suppress start of surprise even of alarm prophecy of tait have be fulfilled sooner than have expected there be something uncanny in speedy accomplishment of prognostication in at time have hardly believed hilliston mr hilliston repeated with gasp of surprise already time be hilliston turn to be surprised face darkened with suspicion what be to understand by 'already miss paynton said quickly why be mr tait began jenny in excuse when father cut short rose from chair exclaimed in voice of alarm tait then have seen already yes father said girl in

know not what trouble have caused hilliston said nothing stood moodily considering what be best to be done saw that tait have be too clever for have anticipated arrival yet have come a speedily a possible not moment have lost since arrival in eastbourne to seek out jenny ask to be silent be too late have missed opportunity by few minute only remained for to learn how much girl have told enemy wonder hated tait fellow be too dangerous foeman to be despised may yet mend matter said judiciously if miss jenny will repeat so much of conversation a remembers why must repeat said jenny objecting to interference a tait guessed must there be nothing wrong in conversation with mr tait know of there be nothing wrong in telling linton story found in canterbury observer replied hilliston dryly yet must have be a well have not done so father cried jenny turning toward old man with appealing gesture have done wrong yes child answered with sigh very wrong sinned in ignorance kerry told have found bundle read about trial passed that over now be different repeated to young linton mr hilliston tell that london know story through book be very sorry said jenny after pause really did not know that be wrong of to act a have done bundle of old newspaper in garret surely be justified in reading in telling frank what conceived must be good plot for story blame miss paynton said hilliston kindly so happens that father did not want that affair again brought before public after have have le to do with than fate than fate interrupted paynton with groan good heaven be to be paynton said hilliston in warning voice forgot muttered old man with shiver more more jenny tell said to mr tait considerably astonished girl repeated conversation a closely a must remember hilliston father listened with keenest interest seemed relieved when finished be not so bad a expected said former with nod have to do paynton be to warn kerry against gratifying curiosity of young men will be certain to ask question kerry will baffle have fear of said paynton harshly jenny be not to refer to subject again with mr tait be not to speak to father interrogated hilliston with look received nod answered accordingly can speak to mr tait if choose doubt will be introduced by vicar to mr larcher place prohibition on speaking to only warn to avoid subject of larcher affair promise promise be sorry ever have anything to do with say no more about dear said hilliston patting shoulder how must be expected to know now have be warned speak more of wish unjustifiable curiosity of idle young men to be gratified if assist to learn that have better be hidden will ruin cried paynton with passionate gesture father ruin yes mean ruin disgrace perhaps death ah broke down with cry hilliston taking jenny by hand led to door go away dear father be ill said in whisper pushing outside door locked forthwith jenny stood in passage in agony of fear surprise ruin disgrace death be meaning of terrible word chapter xxvi old servant leaving two men to talk over dark secret together jenny went into garden brow burned a with fever understanding be confused by thought filled mind what be meaning of father word why have mr hilliston come over from eastbourne to request silence be connection between sole surviving parent paced up down gravel walk vainly asking question racking brain a to possible answer hitherto sky of young life have be pure serene now by own act a though have unconsciously wrought malignant spell sudden storm have arisen threatened to overturn foundation of small world in very unexpectedness of event lay terror a tait shrewdly surmised jenny be by mean satisfied with evidence of hilliston at trial of mr larcher so far a must judge from unsatisfactory report in canterbury observer have given version of affair glibly enough yet there seemed to be something behind be anxious to suppress definitely enough stated that have not be at laurel on fatal night that have not seen captain larcher since left for london that have not noted whether mr wore that important dagger when left ballroom pressed by evidently suspicious counsel accounted so minutely for moment of time evidence have about air of frank falseness even unsophisticated jenny saw that man be acting part did not believe guilty of crime be certain in own mind that knew who have struck fatal blow nay more jenny thought not impossible that have be at laurel after three that morning in spite of denial have seen tragedy take place tait hint confirming own doubt led to gravely doubt purity of mr hilliston motif then now what most perplexed girl be reason why lawyer called to see father on subject requested silence knew nothing of tragedy save through paper old faded paper dated have found in garret be not born when murder took place so hilliston must not possibly wish to close mouth for own sake be on father account jenny feared what must know of obscure crime perpetrated in country town so many year ago must recall mention of name in report of trial yet word led to suspect that be more closely connected with tragic past than chose to admit must be that father be relative of jeringham knowing that jeringham be still alive wished to stop inquiry made a to whereabouts lest must be punished for early sin be only feasible suggestion must make yet failed to satisfy too exacting mind again there be kerry kerry certainly have personal interest in case else must scarcely have related episode of scarfpin moreover have be very angry when found with paper in possession putting two thing together must seem a if knew more than chose to tell jenny thought for gratification of own curiosity must ask kerry to explain matter so went to kitchen in search of maria be there cross deaf a usual intimated that kerry have be out two hour on message sounded extraordinary to jenny who knew that old servant rarely left house argued that father be anxious to have out of way during visit of hilliston what did mean horrible fear seized girl lest must have set machinery in motion must end in crushing unhappy father unhappy have always be given to seclusion there must be reason for jenny felt vague alarm must neither express display dearly enough have paid for meddling with old bundle of paper again returned to garden went outside into lane in order to see if kerry be in sight in few minute came shuffling round corner withered face relaxed into grin when saw standing by gate be apple of eye though scolded often yet never let anyone say word against to look askance at jenny be to lose kerry favor win enmity forever ah there ye be darling miss jenny said with familiarity of old servant watching waiting for poor old kerry sure be sunbeam be in dark lane kerry want to speak to change in tone struck at once peered sharply into fresh face with bleared eye look of wonder stole into at sight of white cheek crossed before replying so a to avert evil might befall kerry always lived in state of suspense waiting for bolt from blue jenny scared face almost assured that have fallen what be alannah asked pausing at gate be anything wrong oh nothing be wrong kerry what must be wrong said jenny nervously only papa have visitor augh riverence not vicar stranger at least almost stranger said half to herself be many year since mr hilliston came here mr hilliston cried kerry

sorrow befall black attorney that be never did cross threshold without bringing grief to heart be evil day saw evil day when see again uplifted hand a though about to invoke curse on hilliston then unexpectedly letting fall turned sharply on jenny how did come miss by train from eastbourne doubt walked from station will drive back exclaimed kerry in quite amiable voice sure will be weary on leg why not will borrow riverence trap little mare with white foreleg kerry father might not like get along with ye said kerry cheerfully sure riverence have offered trap hundred time will take on to explain to master keep mr hilliston here till see arriving up road dirty one be too bad ce to be hurrying off when jenny stopped saw that borrowing of vicar honey trap be mere excuse to get hilliston to for hour rendered more curious than ever by kerry artful way of arranging matter ran after pulled sleeve kerry kerry have mr hilliston come over to see papa about larcher affair how must know retorted kerry relapsing into crusty humor for shame miss jenny be business mine be mine said girl with resolute look on face mr hilliston came over to ask to be silent about what be contained in paper took from how doe know of miss because london now know story of larcher affair augh get away with ye sure be fool be making of old kerry said servant in incredulous angry tone indeed be doing such thing did not know there be harm in reading paper did so did more than kerry told story of tragedy to frank linton have written book on trial book with real name name be fictitious scene be laid in different place whole story be told in novel doe master know asked kerry muttering something between teeth doe now mr hilliston saw book in london came over to tell to ask to say more about what be

rather alarmed for have gripped arm son of deceased man be staying at manor house with mr tait for few minute kerry stood looking at ground in silence up to present have succeeded in preserving calm last piece of news upset altogether burst into violent speech augh be sorrow be coming to house black curse will be on threshold cold will hearth be soon old master will be driven out ohone time will have sent into cold world whirra whirra jenny be so dumfounded by unexpected eloquence of old man that must hing stare at caught eye seeing that have be indiscreet in so betraying cut short lamentation wiped eye relapsed once more into crusty faithful kerry whom knew gave word of warning before took departure say nothing of miss jenny remarked sure be old fool be keep silent tongue a master lawyer wish to do then please saint thing will go better kerry before go tell what be mr hilliston to father be father best friend miss said kerry with emphasis best worst with enigmatic reply hurried off down lane in direction of vicarage leaving jenny in state of bewilderment must understand nothing at moment sorely needed friend with whom must consult kerry gave satisfaction spoke so indefinitely that conversation mystified in place of enlightening be use to make confidant of frank linton a notwithstanding london reputation have greatly contributed to jenny did not consider sufficiently steady to be told of commotion raised by novel in immediate circle must therefore discus matter with one so annoyed be by whole affair that by mean must bring to go back to house while hilliston be yet there must be gone trusted in half hour so pending departure strolled along lane in hope of evading only escaped scylla to fall into charybdis for a turned corner tait claude met almost face to face jenny must have given much to escape awkward meeting intimated wish for solitude by passing young men with curt bow sight of claude memory of father death coupled with suspicion entertained wrought up to pitch of excitement have great difficulty in concealing be therefore greatly annoyed when tait took off hat placed directly in path little man thought be too favorable opportunity for introduction to be overlooked go away miss paynton said smiling wish to introduce to friend mr larcher claude be miss paynton of whom have heard speak how do do miss paynton said claude with suave bow hope will pardon irregularity of introduction remark made jenny laugh set more at ease be not particular a to form ceremony idea that young man must apologize for such trifle struck a ridiculous moreover glance assured that mr larcher be by mean formidable person be decidedly good looking have pleasant blue eye with kindly look so speech glance broke ice at once between do stay here long mr larcher asked pointedly ignoring previous conversation with tait a long a may replied smiling london doe not invite at time of year prefer fragrant country to dusty town be true lover of field miss paynton broke in tait admiring self possession insisted must come out for walk so that might lose time in steeping in sweetness of nature quite idyllic be quite said jenny lightly good by at present mr larcher be going to vicarage have not moment to spare mr tait can speak with minute tait obeyed with alacrity claude be left to muse on fresh charm of jenny sweetness of voice trim figure exquisite neatness springing gait made admire greatly when tripped away with smiling nod be so taken up in watching that failed to observe grave face with tait joined a thought said latter when resumed walk what be up now oh nothing more than usual hilliston have called on paynton already be there now say so did not think must have be so smart however have stolen march on do intend to see now to wait coming out why said tait after moment deliberation rather let go home again that hilliston may not see wish to wait see what excuse will make for not calling on will get letter full of lie to morrow claude chapter xxvii glimpse of past hilliston remained considerable time with friend be not until sunset that left house have satisfied look on face a though interview have answered expectation so lifted up in spirit did appear that stepped out into lane a jauntily a though be quite young man be over three mile to railway station must be obliged to walk back prospect did not annoy in least on contrary so great load have be removed from mind by late conversation that felt fit to walk twice distance yet such unusual light heartedness might have recalled to mind scotch superstition regarding probable reason a walked smartly to end of lane sun have just dropped behind hill leaving trail of red glory behind against crimson background rose gable chimney of manor house sight recalled to hilliston fact that young larcher be staying in mansion paused doubtfully not certain whether to go in pas on for in many scheme least slip might prove prejudicial to accomplishment if call in can say visit here be to do so thought be too late though claude might believe little man must certainly be suspicious besides be sure to find out from jenny paynton have seen father sha go in to night will write letter stating that paynton be client whom called to see about business have made right there will take cleverer man than tait to upset plan time meditation be interrupted by rattle of wheel turned to see kerry driving dappled pony in small chaise old man distorted withered face into grotesque grin of welcome jumped out with extraordinary alacrity when came alongside hilliston augh augh sir said kerry touching hat in military fashion be sight for sore eye to see ye miss jenny told have walked over from station so just borrowed trap of riverence vicar to take back be very kind of kerry replied hilliston in most genial manner be glad to accept offer escape walk drive will sit beside kerry did a be told in few minute trap containing pair be rattling through

trickling brook matted with cress time of have spoken a be seemingly wrapped up in own thought a matter of fact be thinking of other kerry wished to speak to hilliston did not know how to begin while hilliston be in same predicament regarding kerry be latter who finally began conversation did so in way must have startled le brave man than lawyer at moment be crossing rather broad stream with swift current kerry pulled up pony midway between parapet of stone protected side of rude bridge rather astonished at stoppage for must assign reason hilliston roused from musing looked inquiringly at kerry man eye significant angry be fixed on in anything friendly manner do know what be thinking sir said coolly flicking pony back with whip kerry replied hilliston with equal coolness be of anything important might be to sir replied kerry dryly be just thinking whether must be good thing to send horse trap into water then there must be end to black heart black scheme be very possible kerry said hilliston who knew man before going to extremity have better make certain that be acting for best without master be ruined will talk over sir answered kerry with smart flick of whip sent pony across

taking better care of bundle of paper through negligence have fallen into hand of jenny how be to know sir retorted kerry querulously paper be safely put away in garret miss jenny have call to go there well kerry see what have led to account of tragedy be over london what of sir be account of over horriston twenty five year ago doubt said hilliston coolly be over done with be useless to dwell on past error now captain son be bent on finding out truth why must sir think need ask question kerry replied lawyer in so significant tone that old servant turned away head be not desirable that claude larcher must be enlightened know what took place on night if one else doe for more reason than one be advisable that must keep knowledge to ourselves augh said kerry gruffly want known that be in garden on night sir answered hilliston with hasty emphasis spoke falsely at trial to save mr larcher rather think did so kerry for master sake for master sake a for mistress brought trouble on head lied sir lied be worth be there to be trouble over now mr hilliston not if baffle inquiry of young men at manor house will meet question get truth out of if can whether do not depends upon leave to sir said kerry confidently will manage to send away without being bit wiser now mr hilliston that be settled must speak to about sister mona hilliston changed color nevertheless retained sufficient composure to fix eye on man face with sad smile what of kerry asked in melancholy tone know be dead gone augh augh grave sir must tell where be for have in mind to go see must be good of doing said hilliston disapprovingly because be harsh with sir if did wrong suffered for be wicked of to let go a did where be grave sir in chiswick cemetery said hilliston a chaise stopped at railway station if come up to london call at office will tell where to find kerry be profuse in thanks touching hat gratefully accepted shilling hilliston put into hand when train containing hilliston started for eastbourne threw away money shook fist after retreating carriage not word did say frown on face grew deeper deeper a got into trap again drove slowly back to thorston evidently trusted hilliston no more than did tait jenny be now quite dark for daylight afterglow have long since vanished from western sky moon be not yet up only star be visible here there in cloudy sky finding light insufficient to drive by kerry got down lighted carriage lamp heaven only know of what be thinking a drove along dusky lane past unrolled before eye what saw there made groan heave deep sigh there be use in so indulging memory thinking of master kerry braced up to see what must be done toward meeting danger seemed to threaten on side when delivered trap again to groom of vicar hit on idea proceeded to carry out instead of going back at once to rose cottage borrowed piece of paper pencil from groom laboriously traced few line by light of stable lantern putting missive in pocket went off in direction of manor house leaving public road skirted low stone wall divided from adjacent field kerry knew inch of ground even in darkness have difficulty in guiding to destination be vantage point at end of wall whence must see into sitting room of house in few minute kerry be perched on wall busily engaged in tying letter to ordinary sized stone almost immediately below mansion stretched in kind of abrupt right angle in be set two wide window overlooking bed of flower be open to cool night air blind have be drawn down so that kerry from lofty hiding place must see right into room tall brass lamp stood at one end under sat claude larcher smoking thinking glare of lamp fell full on fresh colored face light hair so kerry felt a though be gazing at phantom out of dread past be a like father a two pea muttered kerry devouring picture with eye fine boy honest gentleman augh augh to think have nursed on knee when be bit of lad now be here telling to go away be better than other curse on who brought here put sorrow into heart thus muttering kerry threw stone lightly through window fell heavily on floor within few foot of claude who sprang to foot with exclamation not waiting to see result kerry hastily tumbled off wall jumped ditch made off in darkness by circuitous route regained rose cottage entered into kitchen worn out in body mind have done duty so far a in lay mentally prayed that result might tend to remove threatened danger meanwhile claude have picked up stone ran to window must see nothing for kerry be already halfway across field must not even guess whence stone have be thrown be silent though listened intently must not hear sound of retreating footstep with wonderment untied paper from stone smoothed out be badly written badly spelled ran a follows bewar of danger claude larcher tak frind advise go quick away there be signature young man be looking at in growing perplexity when tait entered room what did shout out about asked carelessly heard in next room must have shouted also replied holding out paper be flung into room tied round stone say so who threw ca say rushed to window at once saw sign of anyone what do think of hint therein contained tait read anonymous communication pondered over finally delivered opinion by uttering name hilliston said confidently hilliston nonsense said claude sharply why must deal in underhand way of sort if wanted to go away must have called urged to do so believe hilliston must condescend to such trickery when man be in fix will descend to anything to get out of replied tait placing paper in pocketbook will keep perhaps before many day be over will have opportunity of proving to that speak truly who else want to go away besides hilliston kerry denis bantry might doubt whether kerry know that be here must give matter time to develop a inmate of rose cottage ca know about within twenty four hour what between confession to jenny hilliston own knowledge think will know good deal in one way can know a much a like said tait quietly know more if come to tug of war think can win against hilliston co come outside let examine top of wall do think stone be thrown from there asked claude a went out into garden fancy so from description light candle night be so still that flame of candle hardly wavered tait gave to claude to hold easily climbed up wall by thrusting toe of boot in among loose stone examined top carefully then getting light tied to piece of string lowered on other side in few minute came down again with satisfied look a thought said blowing out candle someone have be on wall thrown stone from there saw mark of foot on other side man who delivered letter jumped ditch made off across field think be hilliston said claude doubtfully think be emissary of hilliston perhaps denis bantry tait said larcher after pause from hilliston visit to paynton from way in paynton persistently secludes from world from knowledge posse that information for linton book came out of cottage have come to conclusion what be believe that ferdinand paynton be none other than mark jeringham who killed father chapter xxviii preparing ground aware that claude must hear sooner later of visit to paynton lawyer wrote to forestall information skillfully alleging business engagement a excuse for visit must have called on continued that be already late when left client mr paynton have to return to eastbourne in time for dinner however hope to come over again shortly then must tell how be getting on with case be afraid will learn nothing at thorston know better than said tait to whom letter be shown be aware that have cut ground from under foot so far a jenny be concerned moreover be certain that be author of anonymous letter of few day since do really think came here to ask miss paynton to keep silence asked claude returning letter to pocket dear fellow be certain of also wish to show that know paynton so a to warn against asking question in quarter indeed think be useless to do so said larcher doubtfully know called yesterday be refused admittance spoke to mr linton about replied tait easily seems that such be invariably case a hermit will see one why what can be reason for such persistent seclusion ca say unless surmise be correct be jeringham be sure be said claude emphatically why be bundle of newspaper containing account of murder found in house what be denis bantry doing there if paynton be not jeringham shoe be on other foot remarked tait dryly what be denis bantry doing there if paynton be jeringham forget claude that suspect jeringham a criminal if be so if paynton be jeringham hardly think father devoted servant must be at beck call unless added tait a after thought denis bantry be also implicated a imagine ca understand cried claude catching up hat in place of growing clearer matter seems to become more involved how do intend to proceed seems to that be at dead stop by mean dear fellow there be kerry alias denis bantry to be examined must learn truth from wo tell particularly if suspicion be correct perhaps not have provided against failure must appeal to a son of old master while be absent absent where be going ca guess to horriston of course in order to pick up what information can there be sure to be people still alive who remember father mother who recollect trial be still acquainted with mr hilliston expect to learn good deal about gentleman there perhaps something about jeringham disappearance humph doubt if will be successful replied claude gloomily however there be harm in trying where be going now told before set out to call on vicar a ca see jenny at father house must meet in person be like daughter to mr linton be constantly at vicarage doubt young linton love be sure doe have objection demanded tait slyly none none said claude hastily have only met for few minute know be remarkably pretty girl from what say seems to be clever too good by half for idiot idiot john parver lion of season idiot forget wrote book of year so say responded larcher dryly for part believe jenny paynton have more to do with than have doubt wrote further conversation be put end to for time being by arrival at vicarage mr linton stiff old gentleman with severe face received very kindly unbent so far a in lay have be acquainted with tait for many year be during visit to that little man have seen purchased thorston manor knowing to be wealthy being well disposed toward for own sake mr linton be anxious to make lord of manor at home in house vicar can not afford to neglect opulent parishioner hope mr tait that will shortly take up abode altogether at manor said pompously be not in favor of absentee landlord oh will see good deal of mr linton assure be too much in love with beauty of place to stay long away moreover be not roamer like friend larcher here be necessary with said claude smiling assure sir be not wandering vagabond tait must make out to be be proper to see world said vicar with heavy playfulness when have made fortune in far country mr larcher may settle down in favored spot must wish for nothing better mr linton time be yet far off for son be also fond of traveling continued mr linton now that be making good income tell that be intention to go to italy be proud of son mr linton said tait genially without doubt without doubt book wrote be clever although care for sensational writing pay taste of age be in direction of sensationalism certainly certainly suppose be only natural that francis must write frivolity be never deep scholar what doe astonish added vicar raising eyebrow be that student like mr paynton must desire to read book tait claude glanced at one with same thought in mind respecting information informed by hilliston of use made by linton of larcher affair paynton be anxious to see in light case have be placed curiosity argued that recluse have be one of actor in tragedy if so must only be jeringham since captain larcher be dead knew denis bantry francis hilliston vicar worthy man be quite ignorant of effect produced by announcement be undeceived by artful reply of tait naturally mr paynton want to read book said latter diplomatically if mistake not have great liking for frank indeed yes responded mr linton thankfully taught francis latin along with jenny must have made scholar of be indeed sorry that son failed to profit by association with so brilliant student might have written better book clearly vicar be by mean impressed with sensationalism of whim of fate must rather son have written honest pamphlet grave tragedy than have produced so meretricious piece of three volume frivolity however have time to talk further on matter for a ended speech subject of entered room with jenny mr linton former started flushed a saw claude remembered romantic history former meeting wife mr larcher know mr tait of course dear miss paynton mr larcher son have already have pleasure of meeting mr frank linton in town said claude holding out hand young author took willingly enough then company resolved into two group vicar wife conversing with tait while claude seconded by frank made agreeable to jenny lady author be pleased with arrangement a former felt uneasy when remembered father position while latter felt jealous of claude superior good look frank linton be of course ignorant that be in company of son of horriston victim did not even know name of people that of place have simply written story on meager information afforded by jenny must not therefore understand interest two displayed in one so grew jealous on seeing must be useless to report conversation in main consisted of frivolity warned by father jenny be on guard carefully avoided allusion to larcher affair on part not knowing reticence jenny have practised with regard to linton claude tried to lead conversation into grove likely to deal with novel case at one point did so clumsily that jenny spoke outright on subject let talk more of mr larcher said quietly told mr tait knew other day have to thank began claude when cut short turned conversation into channel young man be disappointed in nevertheless fell in with humor when following tait example arose to go be quite charmed with country girl hope will come soon again said vicar hospitably a shook hand must have party shortly friend mr mr hilliston have promised to come stay night during next week move foolish one thought tait said aloud will be charmed mr linton more so a mr hilliston be friend guardian rather be jenny looked startled at rich color faded when said good by to claude mystery of affair be beginning to worry must by mean understand relation of hilliston to larcher hilliston who be guardian friend hilliston who judging from veto put on speaking be inimical to claude untroubled by conversation claude held one idea when left house with tait be afraid be in love said looking at friend what at first sight impossible shakspere did not think so must not have written 'romeo juliet ' yes believe be in love jenny be a fresh fair pure sweet a mountain daisy have better tell linton so said tait dryly whereat larcher laughed be too confident in own power to be timorous of rivalry with celebrated individual there be need to tell said lightly poor man be eaten up with jealousy when spoke to miss paynton by way did see that changed color when mentioned that hilliston have be guardian be natural that must hilliston be suspicious person in eye discovery will perplex still more regarding relation with jenny be very clever young woman wonder if be clever enough to put that together to arrive at what conclusion at most logical conclusion that father be jeringham whom suspect of crime chapter xxix kerry having a considered prepared ground by acquainting claude with notability of neighborhood tait next proceeded to secure interview with kerry be by mean easy matter a by accident design kerry eluded young men attempt to interview hitherto have be accustomed to fish daily in lax now doubtless by direction of master forsook customary sport for considerable time absence speedily roused tait suspicion hilliston have succeeded well said after one of futile attempt to see old servant have put jeringham on guard paynton mean observed claude looking up from plate be at breakfast when conversation took place thought have determined in own mind that be jeringham said claude coloring little have come round to opinion in matter if paynton be jeringham think denis bantry must be in service ah remarked tait sarcastically be that result of reflection of love of love understand yes do claude be in love with jenny last week have only deepened first impression believe like also so foresee marriage will rob of friend be not so certain of a be said larcher after pause miss paynton have given hint of feeling acquaintance be yet young even if did design to make wife must have to gain consent that of father judging from paynton present attitude consent must most probably be refused tait did not immediately reply stared out of window with absent look in eye remark changed current of idea wonder who paynton can be said at length with hesitation that be connected with case be certain from way in have profited by warning of hilliston like have doubt regarding identity with jeringham because of denis bantry who be must go to horriston to morrow find out what be to do in meantime hunt out kerry learn truth said tait coolly think after will be best for to see alone be stranger wo speak before to son of old master may open heart once doe that may learn truth doubt well there be chance tie bind denis to paynton must not forget that be irish irish be impulsive excitable race so be just possible that feeling may carry away in presence may tell wish to know do think can solve mystery yes be in house when jeringham came home with mother picked up garnet pin may be can tell to whom belongs may be property of hilliston a be stated in novel on other hand may belong to father to jeringham of one point be sure person who owned pin killed father kerry rather denis bantry know owner consequently murderer if so why did not denounce there puzzle said tait rising to foot be one of many mystery of case only denis can explain may do so to will stay at home morning prepare for journey to horriston have better take fishing rod go to post post alluded to be on bank of lax where for past week young men have patiently waited for appearance of denis on morning claude found alone for first time sat down with disconsolate air for have little hope that denis must make appearance in

look in claude direction prepared fishing tackle began industriously to whip stream hardly knowing how to break ice larcher silently continued sport two divided by water stood like statue on opposite bank after time denis who have be cunningly taking stock of claude wondering why letter have not produced effect intended moved down to where stream narrowed between large stone determined to invent excuse for speaking larcher followed after time stepped out on to bowlder apparently to throw line into likely looking pool being within reach flung line next moment be entangled in of kerry be sorry quite accident said claude noting wrath on kerry face let disentangle jumped into brown water before kerry must make objection be across on other side gripping line without word irishman let separate two line then busied with fixing fly nettled at determined silence claude spoke wish to speak with said tapping other on shoulder be to ye speak replied kerry with admirable look of surprise have like

night so to speak withered in space of day in earlier part of victorian era celebrated doctor recommended mineral spring invalid flocked to be cured at new pool of bethesda whether cure be not genuine insufficiently rapid to please sick folk be hard to say after fifteen twenty year of prosperity crowd of fashionable valetudinarian ceased to occupy commodious lodging house hotel in horriston other place sprang up with greater attraction more certain cure so erstwhile fashionable town relapsed into provincial dullness one lived there few retired army men one came save stray neurotic person in search of absolute quiet few failed to get at horriston be now a sleepy place a must be found in england even thorston be more in touch with nineteenth century than deserted town a tait drove through street on way to principal hotel must not help noticing dreary look of chief thoroughfare many of shop be closed be unoccupied still open displayed ware grimy flyblown shopkeeper came to door in dazed fashion to look at new visitor in single fly plied between station hotel thereby showing that event be one of rare occurrence there be vehicle in street save lumbering cart containing market produce doctor trap stood at doctor door few people sauntered along pavement in listless fashion whole aspect of place be one of decay desertion for presence of shopkeeper pedestrian few though be tait must almost have imagined in deserted mining township on californian coast principal hotel faced one side of melancholy square be called royal victoria out of compliment to reigning monarch be large barrack with staring window flight of white step leading up to deserted hall busy waiter genial landlord buxom barmaid not even sound of cheerful voice cat slept on step fowl clucked in square while melancholy waiter peering out of window put finishing touch to lamentable dreariness of scene sign royal victoria must have be removed out of very shame word ichabod written up in place landlord be lacking in humor to let thing remain a be however tait being hungry dusty tired consoled with reflection that be at event hotel speedily found sole occupant of dining room attended to by melancholy waiter viand provided be by mean bad wine be undeniably good small wonder seeing have be in cellar for quarter of century for want of someone to drink fact be confided to tait by sad ganymede used to see sight of company here said elderly person when appeared with claret bless be like babylon fallen now sir be first gentleman a have seen here for week must think must pay to keep hotel open sir replied waiter with conviction master be well off made money in day when horriston be horriston keep place a sort of hobby have club here in evening sir that make thing bit lively have be here long asked tait noticing how gray wrinkled be despondent servitor over thirty year sir responded ganymede with sigh a though memory be too much for man boy have be here thirty year be glad of that be man want got good memory pretty good sir not that there be much to remember sighed again h be have recollection of murder took place at laurel twenty five year ago that have sir said waiter with faint animation be talk of country captain larcher be sir wife sweetly pretty woman be accused of murder think did do mr jeringham though people think did 'cause cleared out small blame to when be after like roaring lion do remember jeringham must think so sir why stopped in very hotel did a kind affable gentleman a ever met sir kill captain larcher not no more than did wife poor thing now have own opinion said wise person significantly did take to for five year after murder a might say twenty year ago sir who do think committed crime then asked tait rather impressed by man manner waiter looked around with enjoyable air of man about to impart piece of startling information bent across table to communicate to tait denis bantry be man sir said solemnly captain be valet nonsense what make think that think sir know if believe go to laurel ask old gardener dick pental saw finished waiter in tragic whisper saw what murder said tait with startled look yes sir saw murder heard from did forget exact story told denis bantry must have be hanged sir oh there be least doubt about sir if dick pental saw crime committed why did come forward tell about well sir be way said ganymede dusting table with napkin dick aint there not to be too delicate sir dick mad be always softy from boy not that be old now sir forty five believe be twenty year of age when be in captain larcher service be at laurel still why yes sir see after murder one must take house thought haunted maybe so dick be put in a caretaker looked after for twenty year then be taken by gentleman who did care for murder ghost be there now sir so be dick who still look after garden why did dick relate what saw because of softness sir said waiter deliberately see dick have be put into lunatic asylum have just before came of age captain larcher kind gentleman sir took out made gardener at laurel so when dick saw murder done be afraid to speak in case must be locked up again head see sir so held tongue did only told five year after murder then be too late for who be at laurel on night have disappeared happen to know where denis bantry be sir do for ought to hang sir indeed ought tait did not think wise to take bloodthirsty waiter into confidence rewarded with sovereign for information retired to bed to think matter over be startled by new discovery seemed to indicate denis bantry alias kerry a assassin wondered if have be wrong through in suspecting hilliston yet if kerry have committed crime tait saw reason why hilliston must protect a be evidently doing assuming that waiter have spoken correctly only ground on tait must explain hilliston conduct be that mr larcher be implicated with old servant in murder if kerry be arrested might confess sufficient to entangle mr larcher a hilliston loved woman fact of tait be certain must not like to run so great risk to liberty reasoning be upset by remembrance mr larcher have already be tried acquitted of crime a according to law must not be tried twice on same charge be safe in case tait be bewildered by own thought kaleidoscope have shifted again combination be different component part be same argue a might there seemed solution of mystery mr denis bantry sister hilliston mark jeringham who have killed unfortunate husband tait must find answer to perplexing question in morning walked to laurel have difficulty in finding owing to explicit direction of friend waiter be pretty low roofed house on slight rise near river built somewhat after fashion of bungalow garden sloped to river bank on one side on other be sheltered from inland wind by belt of sycamore tree in front light iron railing divided from road ran past house on way to ferry garden be three acre in extent very pretty picturesque showing at turn might be mental state of dick pental be thorough master of business tait came into contact with in short space of time through medium of housekeeper individual be sour old maid who informed with acerbity that mr deemer present occupant of laurel be away from home without permission must not show house perhaps suspected tait errand for looked suspiciously at resolutely refused to let cross threshold however a concession said must inspect ground be well worth seeing called dick pental to show round a tait have really no great desire to see interior of house where must learn nothing likely to be of service great desire to speak alone with mad gardener thankfully accepted offer be then thrown into company of very man whom most desired to see dick pental be slender bright eyed man with dreamy looking face alert in movement restless with hand foot did not seem unintelligent germ of madness be plainly discernible tait guessed that only constant life in open air kept from returning to asylum whence have be taken by captain larcher with justifiable pride queer creature showed tait over ground never by word deed did hint at story have told waiter still hopeful tait led conversation on direction finally succeeded in touching spring in man brain made relate whole matter opportunity occurred when two men be standing on slight rise overlooking river here tait made remark concerning view what peaceful scene said waving stick toward prospect corn land farmhouse square towered church ferry crossing placid river can imagine nothing more homely so charged with pleasant memory here be peace quiet trouble no danger crime dick thoughtfully rubbed half crown given by tait looked dreamily at river sky opposite shore to abnormally active brain scene looked different to what did to stranger must not forbear alluding to fact moreover gentleman have given money dick be greedy so in expectation of extracting coin hinted that must tell startling story about very place aint fond of murder sir asked abruptly turning bright eye on tait think be replied other delighted to think have succeeded in rousing man dormant intelligence why do ask murder be ugly word can have nothing to do with so peaceful scene a be know sir said dick eagerly why must tell of murder a seed in very spot where be now only few yard from sir tait glanced at watch with affectation of hurry shook head be afraid ca wait said artfully must return to horriston in few minute wo take longer that to tell why have told in ten minute have be freezer to blood murder at night too added dick in agony lest tait must go away with lantern corpse just like read in novel hm observed tait skeptically not yet being sure of man be true true a gospel sir must tell lie must have be brought up methody know sir scorn falsehood a snare of old make worth dicky while sir will give goose flesh oh that will very good said tait throwing on sward mind hearing legend of place if be a good a say will give sovereign in gold asked dick with grasping eagerness in bright gold see here be half sovereign tell story be yours now then what be about dick pental sat down beside tait at distance away chuckled a rubbed hand have chance of making twelve sixpence that morning be overjoyed at good fortune resolved to begin with startling remark glanced down to see that be alone then brought out must hang man must said cheerfully must hang till be deader chapter xxxiii story of mad gardener having made startling announcement dick pental drew back to observe effect on hearer humoring man vanity tait expressed due surprise requested to narrate circumstance to referred be about twenty five year ago be said dick commencing tale in great hurry be gardener here to captain larcher know sir aint to be expected a must be grown gentleman before be kind be took out of asylum did said be mad know put into strait waistcoat be bit wrong in head sir not captain larcher saw that so took out made gardener aint done lot for place just look round see work be admirable dick be that replied man with naive vanity aint first a have said that sir oh be fond of garden be flower be much nicer company than human being think not so cross with dicky know sir doubt said tait seeing that creature be following wandering of poor wit about murder did know anything be wrong interrupted gardener earnestly 'd have kept out of way if 'd known came here one night when must have be here how be that hot rum water confessed dick with great simplicity drank too much of went to head be strong head so came here to sleep clear again be about twelve o'clock a near a can tell lord bless head made account of time when hot rum water be in woke up be frightened finding in dark hate dark sir so finished rum have with went to sleep again then woke up sudden did saw murder being committed not quite that saw man lying on ground just over there did move bit man be holding in arm denis bantry be standing by with lantern who be other man be gentleman called mr jeringham oh yes head be queer knew by clothes did be at grand ball of gentry know be there got drunk saw mr jeringham there in black clothes with gold trimming have on when bent over captain how did know man on ground be captain larcher did then confessed dick ingenuously when heard a found in river knew be did saw drop in denis bantry mr jeringham exclaimed tait astonished at minuteness of detail yes talked together for bit head be so queer must make out what said picked up captain larcher one at head other at heel dropped in splash went did be behind tree must see ugh said man with shiver how did feel afraid when went splash into cold water then went away held tongue why did do that be duty to have come forward told truth dick pental put on cunning look shook head not sir said artfully 'd have said head be queer put in asylum again dicky be too clever for be say be denis bantry who killed captain larcher said tait after moment reflection how do know that when did not see blow struck might have be mr jeringham looking lovingly at piece of gold be now in possession dick shook head with great vigor be mr jeringham protested be good kind gentleman gave dicky half crown day before be fond of captain larcher wife so must have killed captain larcher against insane reasoning tait have nothing to urge a dicky be evidently convinced that denis bantry be guilty to exclusion of jeringham have former given money instead of latter must doubtless have accused jeringham sworn to innocence of denis man brain be too weak to be depended upon tait recognized that report gave of occurrence of fatal night be true faithful in respect dicky be not sufficiently imaginative to invent story satisfied from importance of knowledge have gained that time have not be wasted tait wished to be alone to think out matter there be difficulty in getting rid of dicky who be still greedily expectant of further tip in end induced man to return to work set out for horriston at brisk walk always thought better when exercising limb before reached town have arrived at several conclusion respecting case a seen under new light thrown on by gardener for one thing concluded that paynton be jeringham reason for denis being in service have be explained by dick pental a two men be bound together by common bond of guilt tait be inclined to think that jeringham be innocent for if have killed larcher there must have be need for denis to have screened on other hand circumstantial evidence be so strong against jeringham that if denis have struck blow must be forced to acquiesce in silence of real criminal to become a be accessory to crime denis must have sworn that jeringham be guilty so placed in danger of life thus two men have hold on one jeringham because circumstance be against denis because have killed larcher motive for crime be not difficult to discover after story told by mr bezel bantry have killed master a destroyer of sister honor under name of paynton kerry two men be dwelling together at thorston in loathed companionship afraid to let other out of sight tait must imagine more terrible punishment than enforced comradeship reminded of similar situation in novel of zola where husband wife be equally culpable equally afraid filled with equal hatred one toward other still conclusion supported a be by fact did not explain attitude of hilliston assuming guilt of denis bantry complicity of jeringham there appeared to be reason why hilliston must protect at thorston throw obstacle in way of truth discovery tait be completely nonplussed must think of explanation then remembered mr bezel letter mention of louisa sinclair hilliston according to mr bezel knew woman knew who have committed crime how must know unless have be concealed like dick pental in garden on night tait be quite certain that denis bantry be guilty hint of mr bezel threatened to disturb view yet what better evidence be obtainable than of eye witness still tait remembered that dicky confessed have not seen blow struck what if louisa sinclair have be question asked under circumstance be necessary to find out who woman be tait did not judge wise to ask hilliston for simple reason that lawyer must not admit truth there be obvious reason why must not tait have sufficient experience of hilliston trickery evasion in past to know that admission be untrustworthy there only remained for to search for louisa sinclair in horriston question if be alive learn that must if be dead now occurred coincidence unwittingly put tait on right track when within mile of horriston met clergyman swinging along at good pace in recognized former college companion recognition delight be mutual dear brandon be indeed surprise exclaimed tait holding out hand have idea that be in part have only be vicar here for year answered brandon cordially what be doing at horriston friend oh have come down partly on business partly on pleasure then dismiss business for moment come to luncheon with be just going to house where be staying at royal victoria dismal place must come frequently to see while stay here will do what can to cheer up mr brandon will be delighted to see oh so be married for last five year two child well be glad to see again do stay here long few day only replied tait carelessly entirely depends on business anything important yes by way may be able to help brandon do know anyone in parish called miss louisa sinclair vicar reflected for few moment shook head never heard name must have be here before time have reason for wanting to see naturally must not have asked said tait with faint sarcasm however must make confidant of a wish for advice assistance will be delighted to give said friend briskly here be at house there be wife in porch dear be old college friend of mine spenser tait must make welcome for day have be mr brandon comfortable rosy cheeked matron with two tiny brandons clinging to skirt heartily welcomed tait led way to dining room here extra knife fork be hastily produced for guest sat down to luncheon in best of spirit for moment tait banished thought of case from mind laid out to be agreeable to vicar wife in succeeded a subsequently pronounced to be singularly charming man while pronounced to be one of most intelligent woman have be fortune to meet after luncheon brandon conducted tait to study there over excellent cigar little man related story of larcher affair from time claude became possessed of paper needle to say clergyman be much astonished by recital agreed with tait that be difficult to know way to turn in present dilemma thought that denis be guilty jeringham accomplice by force of circumstance doubted whether existence of louisa sinclair might not altogether alter complexion of case of course difficulty will be to find louisa sinclair said thoughtfully five twenty year be long time to go back to may be dead so may rejoined tait trifle tartly on other hand may be alive found that waiter that gardener who be at horriston then remember case so be probable that will find woman at least gain sufficient information to trace whereabouts can not recall name tait have not be here in time fortunately can help in much that old parishioner of mine be calling to day a have lived here for last forty year more be likely will remember if such person dwelt here who be old lady dear fellow must not call old lady be true be over forty well be always young charming in own eye miss belinda pike be name must like to come under lash of tongue be such tartar be dear fellow must not ask to talk scandal about parishioner moreover see lady in question be coming up garden path once set tongue going will learn history of horriston for last hundred year only want to go back twenty five rejoined tait smiling at moment miss belinda pike be announced be tall bony female with hook nose false front artificial smile dressed in voluminous raiment bore down on brandon like frigate in full sail proceeded to talk time remained in study talked of herself of parish work of dorcas meeting of scandal new old so astonished tait by extent of petty information volubility of tongue that must only stare wonder introduced to be graciously pleased to observe that have heard of inquiry waiter know mr tait said smiling at astonishment sugden be name told about now why do wish to learn about larcher crime for amusement merely replied tait rather scandalizing vicar by answer waiter began to speak of encouraged later on story from gardener from dicky pental interrupted miss pike vivaciously oh can tell nothing be mad mad not told great deal false doubt dear mr tait continued lady impressively only one person can tell truth of case louisa sinclair louisa sinclair what do know about nothing save name replied tait want to know more can give required information yes come have afternoon tea with to day will tell oh yes said miss pike with self satisfied nod know who killed captain larcher jeringham denis valet hilliston three people be innocent can swear to know then who be guilty why said miss pike quietly mr larcher maid mona bantry chapter xxxiv letter from horriston dear claude in last letter informed of various discovery with regard to case deem singularly fortunate in finding who must afford necessary information five twenty year be wide gap of time to tell honest truth scarcely expected to be successful in mission death absence old age might have put end to who knew about case a be already advised unexpectedly met with three people who gave three different version of murder from various point of view first waiter sugden who merely reflected opinion of dick pental second gardener with first hand story third miss belinda pike whose idea be quite at variance with other two mentioned to that have met miss pike at friend brandon that have invited to visit next day to hear story of case of course went found lady excellent character for purpose have truly wonderful memory for small beer of life be born gossip be one of most spiteful woman have ever be fortune to meet invitation be more to satisfy own vanity curiosity than because wished to do service if be gratified in one be balked in other with difficulty for be most persistent creature managed to evade inquiry a to reason for wishing to know about larcher affair ' extracted from information likely to be of service to in discovering truth what told leaf more in dark than ever will doubtless return to thorston whit nearer truth than be when set out before narrating story a imparted to in strict secrecy must not be offended if certain reflection be cast by busybody on mother to get at truth of complication must view from disinterested standpoint throw aside prejudice for moment believe that mr larcher intended to willfully deceive husband a be implied by miss pike must confess think conduct be highly reprehensible still pas judgment a be not place to do so must clearly understand that remark herein contained about be of miss pike can guess from tenor what very spiteful old lady be promised to report doings hearing faithfully to hereby keep promise at cost of losing temper cause of miss pike malignity be jealousy passion be a active now with a be twenty five year ago then fair belinda according to own account be belle of horriston shared that enviable position with two rival one being mother other miss louisa sinclair fancy hear exclaim at mention of name mr bezel be right person doe exist be passably pretty girl according to miss pike rather popular again miss pike cared for one so much a mr francis hilliston then handsome young lawyer of great promise good family be evidently romance of hilliston life account for silence about louisa sinclair did not wish to speak of one who have disappeared under somewhat discreditable circumstance yet who truly loved whether returned love can not say suspend judgment till hear story of maiden lady of course be quite different to of dick pental think le easy to believe gardener spoke of what saw pike speaks of what think judge for yourself be right a have said miss pike be belle in younger day be also well off must have made good match unfortunately be in love with hilliston say unfortunately because happened to be in love with mr larcher again apologize for putting matter so plainly miss pike insisted that be so in day hilliston must have be handsome fascinating man for louisa sinclair also loved with like result have eye for two damsel quietly devoted to mr larcher mean to say that roused suspicion of father for devotion be perfectly respectful desire of moth for star may say for hilliston knew well enough that have chance in quarter for two reason first mr larcher be married woman second be in love with jeringham at time of notable dress ball matter stood thus miss belinda pike in love with hilliston miss louisa sinclair in love with hilliston hilliston in love with mr larcher mr larcher in love with jeringham can imagine anything more complicated to make confusion still worse miss pike solemnly asserted that jeringham be not in love with mr larcher with maid mona bantry therefore round of five people be in love with wrong person be modern 'comedy of error with tragic ending miss pike went to ball in character of flower girl there be astonished to find two mary queen of scot two darnleys during night learned that out of jealousy louisa sinclair have adopted same fancy dress a mother be second queen of scot be attired precisely same in respect save that mr larcher wore small dagger miss sinclair did not on making discovery miss pike naturally thought a jealous woman must that second darnley be hilliston knew that first be jeringham did not trouble about maneuvered to get speech with second to astonishment found out how can not say that be captain larcher who be supposed to be in london confessed that be jealous of wife have returned in disguise to learn truth miss pike be not clear whether be suspicious of jeringham of hilliston have opportunity of learning truth a larcher seeing wife leave ballroom followed at once next day miss pike be informed of disappearance of jeringham later on learned of death of captain larcher now will ask whom suspected woman with so unhappy temper must not be long in forming opinion about matter connected with lady of whom be jealous allude to mother miss pike have theory ever since declining to accept evidence given at trial have held firmly to suspected mona bantry to be guilty give reason in own word course be only theory ' said when asked pointblank who thought be guilty suspicion point to mr larcher maid ' mona bantry ' asked rather astonished 'yes be in love with mr jeringham be at ball dressed a darnley captain larcher wore same dress a told left ballroom when saw wife go out with mr jeringham fancy followed home caught a parted in garden of laurel very likely ordered mr jeringham off premise insisted on wife going into house mona who be sitting up for mistress must open door seeing by dress a thought mr jeringham with mr larcher believe lost head killed ' 'killed how ' 'with dagger worn by mr larcher ' responded miss pike triumphantly snatched from sheath a hung at girdle of mr larcher killed poor man thinking be lover then finding out mistake fled so did jeringham ' said 'yes also saw murder naturally enough thought might be suspected think took mona away with on very night fled together a to body denis brother to save sister possibly mistress from being suspected threw into river be theory mr tait believe to be true one ' need not repeat more of conversation a be merely argument on side now know sufficient to see in what direction miss pike suspicion be directed story be quite at variance with of mother who plainly stated that found mona in sitting room with father be not strange that two narration must be contradictory for must remember that mr larcher spoke from fact while miss pike only speaks from hearsay again from statement of dick pental must appear that murder took place in garden mother say be committed in sitting room so here be contradiction must not forget that only one person have sworn to identity of saw with body miss pike can prove nothing from fact only evolves accusation out of own malignant nature mother accuses one alleging that fainted in sitting room therefore taking fact into consideration believe gardener story to be true denis bantry killed father jeringham through force of circumstance being accessory to deed view account for identity of paynton with jeringham of kerry with denis fully account for living in seclusion at thorston be opinion do think can give better regarding mother hint about louisa sinclair confess can not understand miss pike be perfectly frank about person stated that shortly after murder went to america have not be heard of for year hilliston may know of whereabouts under circumstance think be likely to speak at event be certain of two thing louisa sinclair did not marry hilliston that have nothing to do with tragedy at laurel miss pike intends to show portrait of lady on occasion of next visit knowledge of look may lead to something honestly speaking see how can possibly be implicated in matter must bring long letter to close have found out sufficient at horriston to justify suspicion of menage at rose cottage when return must set wit to work to see paynton kerry must be forced into plain speaking then may solve mystery of father death not before expect in two day think over what have written so that may discus matter thoroughly when come together so no more at present from friend spenser tait chapter xxxv original of portrait claude larcher be blessed with best of temper strongly gifted with self control found virtue very necessary in profession especially when in command of body of men in wild there trouble ruffled disappointment depressed spirit be always serene amiable so that among comrade good temper have become proverbial have seen at moment must have found reason to alter opinion case wore out patience saw end to complication arising therefrom sooner be one obstacle surmounted than blocked up path for tait must have taken hilliston advice long ago let matter lie little man be bent on solving particularly tantalizing mystery so urged friend to persevere in what seemed to be futile attempt so far claude have held to resolve last letter of tait with budget of new complication threw into rage vowed that must throw up matter a soon a tait returned father be dead there be end of after five twenty year nothing must be discovered above there be jenny claude be too clear sighted to disguise from fact that be in love now enlightened by mr hilliston regarding feeling of young lady be doubly anxious to make wife before must do so have to remove obstacle in shape of father be easy matter who mr paynton be did not know whether be implicated in larcher affair must not guess of one thing be certain that mr paynton resented prosecution of case while continued to investigate mystery recluse must continue inimical must therefore refuse to permit to pay attention to daughter regarding linton love claude have fear have be assured by mr hilliston that jenny liked best taking advantage of hint have thrown a frequently a possible into society of beloved did jenny go to vicarage claude be there under pretense of questioning clergyman concerning architecture of church did practice on

visiting persistent young man be constantly to be found near miss jenny paynton meant infatuation availing of opportunity thus afforded learned secret betrayed own without word being said on side with shadow of case between two young people fell in love with one when tait returned two day after last letter be confronted by claude with intimation that wished to stop further investigation tait who be devoured by unappeasable curiosity to find out truth resented backsliding told claude opinion very plainly for long friendship must have quarreled over matter a be tait argued out question induced claude to come round to way of thinking be hard task be not going to turn back after putting hand to plow said when claude first broached subject of abandoning case why not if plow wo move returned young man flippantly plow will move returned tait vehemently got last letter did see that contains anything likely to elucidate mystery dick pental be madman miss pike untrustworthy gossip be opinion not mine have made discovery since writing last letter of have not yet have time to inform what be will tell later on meanwhile be on account of girl that have decided to abandon case partly partly because think be wasting time investigation can lead to result may find out who killed father doubt replied larcher coolly suspect hilliston suspect jeringham suspect mona bantry why in last letter hinted at guilt of denis simply because drunken lunatic told wild story yet so far a can see have not morsel of evidence against one of four be wrong said tait in argumentative manner misfortune be that there be too much evidence against must furnish with case against so far a circumstantial evidence be concerned must convince of individual guilt theory tait theory will prove that soon boy said tait with exasperating coolness if back out of case at least be determined to see through suppose be bent on marrying young lady if will have yes humph there be obstacle have overlooked consent of father mysterious friend paynton have not overlooked obstacle will obtain consent from own lip how do intend to see through agency of mr hilliston replied larcher calmly have agreed to introduce to paynton to morrow here be letter little man fairly bounded from chair took letter from friend hand with air of bewilderment after mastering content returned with satisfied nod congratulate claude said with good humored air though failed with man may succeed with matter how in name of olympian jove did induce hilliston to do why saw be in love with jenny for inexplicable reason have agreed to forward suit by introducing to plead cause with father not so inexplicable a think said tait sagaciously see idea think will be so occupied with love making a to abandon case know that be right oh see be bent on getting quit of matter claude tait shook reproving forefinger will change mind after interview with hermit friend why so will learn something will astonish only wish must be present with to see what occurs if make reference to case said larcher seriously tait waxed indignant on instant spoke mind freely claude friend went into matter solely on account owe to to see through if find further investigation bar to marriage will agree to let matter drop first added tait with emphasis must make effort to get truth out of man swear to that be resolved to push matter to end tell have learned something new at horriston mention name of louisa sinclair then see result after hearing story of dicky pental be convinced that man be jeringham will do say replied claude after hesitation be afraid that pertinacity in matter will prejudice wooing if at end of interview see that withdraw intention to go on with case then out of gratitude may give daughter bluff first yield afterward in way may discover who paynton be what have to do with case why be connected with hilliston do agree good give hand on that two men shook hand though be not without secret qualm claude thus sealed compact after pause said who be louisa sinclair make such point of mentioning to paynton ah be discovery said tait rubbing hand when interviewed mr bezel showed portrait of mr hilliston whom curiously enough have never seen doubt hilliston have reason therefor seemed startled said nothing then wrote to about louisa sinclair what have louisa sinclair to do with mr hilliston ca guess miss pike showed portrait of louisa sinclair taken twenty five year ago did not then wonder at mr bezel start that hilliston have refrained from letting see picture of wife in word louisa sinclair mr hilliston be one same woman ah cried claude with sudden recollection be for be so afraid of going to horriston yes thought might learn too much be beginning of end claude what do think mr hilliston know anything of case according to mother know good deal according to miss pike be in possession of certain fact yes think mr hilliston can help if will dear tait said claude quietly mr hilliston be american ah louisa sinclair went to america probably became naturalized subject of star stripe objected larcher be widow when married hilliston so believe mr derrick doubt came by money through first marriage oh can put puzzle easily together wonder hilliston wanted case dropped on own account on of wife what do mean tait do suspect that say more said tait rising will tell what mean after have seen paynton then added significantly think will need explanation chapter xxxvi strange thing happens next morning claude received second letter from hilliston stating that a wife be ill must be unable to come over to thorston directing young man to go to rose cottage at noon when mr paynton must be ready to receive tait regretted that have not be included in invitation carefully instructed claude how to act during interview believe paynton can settle matter be parting word so put love out of head for time being do best to extract truth anxious to oblige one who took so much interest in private affair larcher promised to do what must shortly after eleven started for rose cottage a matter of fact need not have gone so soon did so in hope of meeting with jenny well acquainted a be with movement surmise proved correct for met young lady at end of nightingale lane blushed expressed surprise at meeting such feigning be part of love comedy did not expect to see here mr larcher said after first greeting have passed between where be going be about to call on father really said jenny with perplexity more doubt be afraid go on useless errand father see one will see replied claude quietly come by appointment mr hilliston spoke to father with result that have agreed to see have visit anything to do with with novel have everything to do with wish to ask paynton question in connection with father death know nothing nothing cried jenny vehemently can tell nothing be worse than useless for to speak to on subject will only make ill have to speak to on subject said claude artfully jenny looked up inquiringly remarked passion in gaze turned away face with blush much a must have liked to found impossible to appear ignorant of meaning seems to that be person to be first consulted said with pout jenny hush here be kerry see father first then see till then good by flitted rapidly away turned corner of lane a kerry more crabbed looking than ever came up to where claude be standing be then that larcher saw that old servant be suffering under strong emotion eye be brighter than usual lip quivered be so nervous that must keep limb body at rest rightly connecting agitation with visit claude wisely held peace waited to hear what kerry have to say will be after seeing master sir said kerry in breathless anxiety be waiting for sir in garden be just on way there kerry stopped to speak for few minute to miss jenny be very glad that mr paynton have consented to see may well be glad master claude master claude echoed young man stopping short oh blaze 't be slip of tongue sir cried kerry anxiously notice sir sure be old be mind wanders then deny that be denis bantry say nothing of sir let master speak own mind to will know soon enough who be be fact anyhow be convinced in own mind that be father old servant said larcher a resumed walk who master be be not so clear kerry shook head pursed up lip a though determined to let information escape walked along in silence be only when unlocked gate in red brick wall that kerry again opened mouth keep silent sir if love said in low tone agitate master will do speaking tell ye ye wish to know begad more too larcher nodded passed into garden morning be warm sunny color of flower be dazzling in warm glow against white wall of cottage with hand clasped behind back paynton paced meditatively up down path before house stopped a caught sight of visitor taking off hat in tribute to venerable look of old gentleman claude bowed waited to be addressed for moment paynton looked at in silence with much emotion then controlling with difficulty held out hand be glad to see mr mr larcher suggested claude seeing host at loss for name larcher gasped paynton with effort yes yes friend mr hilliston advised of coming let enter house will have more privacy there a claude knew one be about in walled place kerry deaf old housekeeper wondered what further privacy be necessary considering that paynton have doubtless good reason for action bowed silently followed within a requested in few minute be in bookroom paynton seated in position a to place back to strong light shining through window asked claude to be seated in chair lacked advantage in way paynton must observe change in face of visitor while own being in shadow be more difficult to read larcher saw maneuver did not think necessary to make objection in place tait must have acted differently be greatly obliged that have consented to see said claude breaking silence for be informed that live very secluded life be true accord interview at request of friend mr hilliston at same time may tell have own reason for granting think can guess reason mr paynton doubt replied paynton touching book on table be not unconnected with novel know of course that daughter that jenny supplied young linton with material for plot do found report of father murder in old newspaper in house did not think strange must be in possession of such report naturally did answered claude replying to direct question with marked embarrassment be on account ask to help do think can do so be sure of why asked paynton in unsteady voice because know about matter retained report of trial denis bantry be in service under name of kerry how do know why in third volume of book there be episode of scarfpin be not mentioned in report of trial be told to miss paynton by man call kerry now only two person knew that scarfpin be picked up in ground of laurel after murder one be hilliston other denis bantry must see mr paynton can only come to one conclusion presume got information from hilliston said paynton in altered voice mr hilliston spoke of replied claude cautiously did not intend to reveal that have heard from mother indeed to reveal existence of mr larcher until be sure of ground positive of paynton identity accepting diplomatic answer in affirmative paynton nodded went on with questioning spoke to kerry on subject did a may guess failed naturally kerry be faithful servant owe more to than can ever repay here be talking about murder added paynton irrelevantly when wish to speak about jenny at least so hilliston informed do wish to speak of daughter later on said claude with flushed cheek in meantime be anxious to come to understanding about crime why said paynton rather disconcerted at failure to turn conversation because have sworn to avenge death of father be what good son must do said paynton thoughtfully after twenty five year chance be small wish to find murderer so do yes be more deeply interested in matter than suppose who do think be asked can not say unless be jeringham jeringham said paynton in faltering tone be not jeringham poor soul do think guilty of crime do sometimes seems so at others fancy hilliston to be guilty hilliston guilty said paynton rising what do mean oh be only theory said claude hastily friend tait who be at horriston few day ago found out kind of thing implicated one person found tell tell said paynton hastily can not talk to longer else will be ill interview have already tried too much here added unlocking drawer in desk take paper will find in full account of know of matter be then eye witness said claude joyfully slipping roll of manuscript into pocket have be more successful than have hoped to be paynton pressed hand together looked eagerly at claude can bear no longer said impatiently laying hand on shoulder of astonished young man boy boy can not guess who be replied larcher rising to foot in wonder know who can be unless be jeringham be not jeringham be dead dead aye murdered can not see can not guess claude man who be killed at horriston be not george larcher be mark jeringham be father chapter xxxvii voice from grave be close on two o'clock weary of waiting for claude master of manor house have seated at luncheon table be curious to know what have taken place between friend mr paynton a judged from length of time interview have lasted that important communication must have be made have claude discovered identity of paynton with jeringham if so have jeringham confessed to crime question so annoyed perplexed tait that must not swallow mouthful of food throwing aside napkin rose from table to see if larcher have returned a pushed back chair door opened claude with roll of paper in hand made appearance tait turned to greet with smile disappeared from face word died on lip when saw white haggard countenance of friend good heaven man cried hastening toward what be matter here sit down drink glass of wine claude did a be bidden then waved hand in direction of dormer who stolid a ever stood waiting order can go dormer said tait hastily then when man leaving room closed door after found alone continued be anything wrong claude did paynton tell not paynton said larcher finishing wine setting down glass there be not such person aha remarked tait rubbing hand thought name be feigned one who be friend mr paynton father tait opened mouth to utter ejaculation shut without doing so looked dumfounded at friend what what what do mean be mad stammered sitting down limply be not mad groaned claude though have suffered enough to make so mean what say be jeringham who be murdered jeringham who be dressed a darnley on night a be father jeringham whose corpse be so unrecognizable by decomposition that be thought to be that of george father be alive father be hiding here a ferdinand paynton be story of tragedy placed roll of paper in tait hand poured out glass of wine overcome with amazement little man looked first at paper then at friend be minute before must collect wit together speak coherently what extraordinary thing said at length thought parent dead now seems be alive mother at clarence cottage hampstead father at rose cottage thorston did tell father that mr larcher be still in existence asked sharply have time to do so said claude with effort father placed paper in hand then confessed who be wished to speak further to pushed out of room saying confession form judgment before accept a father ' hardly knew what be doing till found in lane outside then came on here still feel quite bewildered wonder at take glass of wine did ask question tait said claude rising impatiently read confession at once ca do wo have luncheon mouthful must choke will lie down on sofa bring chair close to to read tait nodded unrolled paper while claude filling glass of claret crossed over to sofa lay down thereon with glass of wine on carpet beside with untasted luncheon on table closed eye with weary sigh compelled to listen tait glanced sympathetically at then without remark though be burning to speak smoothed out paper began to read slowly writing be clear legible matter interesting so there be difficulty in deciphering story of tragedy a narrated by man who for twenty two year have be supposed to be victim confession so called be in form of letter from father to son dear claude at length have made up mind to reveal to to set out at length circumstance placed in position be led to do so by three thing firstly presence in neighborhood with avowed intention of avenging death secondly publication of novel entitled ' whim of fate ' set out particular of what happened at horriston in more le perverted for fictional purpose thirdly advice of francis hilliston old valued friend who point out that only way to stop in investigation be to admit identity so do away with motive viz avenging of death on reading leave to whether will still consider father visit accordingly whether will look on a guilty man till be acquainted with truth so far a be aware of swear will not approach open mouth in presence on understanding set forth following fact a shortly a be consistent with clearness judge a please declare before god be innocent of jeringham death know not who killed for prologue now for story will understand wish to cast aspersion on memory of mother in present case be necessary must speak plainly mother be ill suited to one lived unhappily together even when in army be addicted to literary pursuit when sent in paper devoted almost entirely to study mother be gay social being beautiful woman liked admiration be never so happy a when out at ball at theater at garden party lived in whirl of excitement quarreled bitterly with because preferred quieter life accompanied sometimes not often enough to please when came to reside at laurel after leaving army frequently declared that regretted having given up mark jeringham for naturally enough resented plain speaking be estranged not even birth must bridge over abyss between while lived at laurel at horriston believe be a unhappy ill matched couple a existed in england be quick coupled with dead suffered accordingly first cause of unhappiness be a see incompatibility of temper second be presence of jeringham who came to horriston ostensibly on visit in reality to stay near wife can easily understand that resented presence of young man be remarkably like in height figure look wife have fancy for before marriage with that became wife laughingly avowed be because of uniform so far a look be concerned there be nothing to choose between jeringham glitter of military trapping so declared turned balance in favor may be sure liked jeringham none more after such declaration of lukewarm affection from mother when came to reside at horriston four year after marriage resented continued presence about house mother be angry at expostulation introduction of second element of discord into house estranged more widely than ever be miserable most unhappy time be friend hilliston who pointed out real reason for jeringham visit latter be not in love with wife with maid mona bantry a denis brother of mona be old servant of mine did not care to speak to wife on matter to keep affair quiet to save girl from anger of brother discouraged visit of jeringham on possible occasion have quarrel in public a gossip of horriston knew that have be fond of wife before marriage to quarrel be set down to jealousy on part neighborhood knew there be bad blood between jeringham foolishly enough admit made use of several expression calculated to show hatred heated speech be afterward remembered commented upon thing be in position when fancy dress ball took place at horriston hearing that be to be masked ball resolved to assume similar dress to of jeringham learn from wife own lip if still cared for may think acted in unworthy manner a matter of fact be nearly out of mind with anger jealousy hardly knew what be doing wife be going to ball a mary queen of scot accompanied by jeringham a darnley be sufficiently pointed to show in what direction affection leaned took advantage of opportunity feigning excuse ostensibly went to london in reality remained at horriston where obtained from costumer similar dress to worn by jeringham thus masked disguised repaired to ball there be recognized by miss belinda pike kindly consented to keep secret can guess what happened deceived by dress wife took for jeringham learned sufficient to know that loved hated did not reveal went away mad with wrath sole idea be to unmask jeringham show wife how unworthy be of love to end sought out hilliston learning that wife be shortly returning home hilliston went to laurel together a intended to make mona confess that jeringham be lover left hilliston outside in garden to watch for coming of wife entered house to see mona be waiting in sitting room for mistress then there forced to admit truth declared that jeringham be father of unborn child implored not to tell brother fortunately have directed denis to stay in entrance hall so did not hear sister confession be safe for time being while be talking with mona wife entered immediately accused of having feigned visit to london in order to stay at home with girl slipped out of room wife continued raving said that jeringham have come home with be at moment in garden there swore to join prevented leaving room ultimately fainted ran out to call mona found that have left house doubt to join jeringham in garden to tell that secret be known also went into garden to seek for jeringham to horror stumbled over dead body hastily ran back for light to see whose be denis came with lantern found be corpse of jeringham have be stabbed to heart must have given alarm that denis quicker witted than at moment prevented pointed out that be well known be on bad term with jeringham that unhappy man have be murdered in garden that hand be red with blood clothes stained owing to handling corpse said must be accused of murder saw in flash peril in stood know if denis suspected of crime a be not present when first found body acted part of friend threw body into river made preparation for flight one hilliston miss pike knew that have returned from london on night for wife must keep silence a thought for own sake mona have disappeared left house in charge of denis without word to wife who have brought about catastrophe sought safety in flight be cowardly if like have other resource must have be accused of murder have stayed for evidence be strong against fled trusted to chance to hide crime rest know wife be accused tried for murder a jeringham corpse be so disfigured that be thought to be mine have mentioned strong resemblance between helped deception be compelled to keep in hiding a jeringham declare have case gone against wife must have come forward told a be went abroad aided by hilliston who acted a friend through looked after unhappy wife till died in london took charge of brought up like son also secured sufficient of own property to live quietly so came to thorston under name of paynton here have lived ever since thought to die in peace claude have reopened case tell to show futility of trying to find real murderer know who killed jeringham do think will ever find out if after reading still consider father come at once to most unhappy man be just be lenient son forgive unhappy father george larcher chapter xxxviii new aspect of thing tait folded over last sheet of long letter with sigh although be pleased for claude sake that george larcher be still in land of living yet be distinctly disappointed that communication have be made likely to elucidate mystery yet result of confession be entire displacement of point whence be necessary to survey case motif have caused supposed death of larcher must not suffice to explain death of jeringham case have assumed new aspect nevertheless be a complex inexplicable a ever tait thought of with inconceivable rapidity did not give utterance to opinion in presence of friend letter be wonderful so far be sole remark be great pity that end so abruptly suppose father will personally relate other detail claude when see again young man assumed sitting position deliberately finished wine before replying to remark looked anxious disturbed now that have recovered from overwhelming surprise at finding father alive seemed le delighted than must have be miracle have be wrought in behalf dead have be restored to life be by mean gratified by occurrence know whether will see father again said shortly dear friend oh know must say interrupted claude hastily with frown be not prepared to admit argument mother be alive father be in existence yet for twenty five year have looked on a dead can then wonder that feel awkward toward that be by mean disposed to render that filial affection must admit ill deserve question be so delicate that can only hold peace said tait after pause admit what say still be own flesh blood might answer a hamlet did on like occasion replied claude with bitter smile quotation will not mend matter have to consider be advisability of seeing father again must certainly see again said other promptly why in first place be father whatever may say in second have better tell personally that abandon further investigation of case after object be gone for though might want to avenge death of parent murder of scamp like jeringham can matter nothing to oh that abandon case go without speaking said claude quickly act in same way further go into case more perplexing doe become be beyond only at last day will mystery be solved still added tait meditatively must admit curiosity yet exists on part to know who struck blow of course father story corroborates dicky pental gardener mistook for jeringham by reason of fancy dress doe letter suggest anything to narrow field of inquiry be mother father denis bantry must necessarily be innocent a be in house when murder took place in garden if be innocent who be guilty have choice of two who be outside at time can choose between hilliston mona bantry mona bantry kill lover how do make out forget father account of scene in sitting room said tait significantly then mr larcher asserted in presence of mona that have come with jeringham furthermore that be in garden mona also jealous act a other woman must have done in position go into garden to demand explanation there be quarrel between jeringham kill then fly not to hide disgrace to evade consequence of act be feasible theory think claude shook head agree with said emphatically forget that have mother account of matter to place against of father if recollect also admitted finding father mona in sitting room also admits fainting there resemblance between account cease mother distinctly say that threatened husband with dagger that fell on floor when lost sens when recovered dagger be gone now continued claude slowly if remember crime be committed by mean of dagger for be found red with blood in ground then be taken possession of by police if mother account be true one mona bantry may certainly have picked up dagger have murdered jeringham a suggest if father story be to be believed mona left room before mother fainted consequently must not have gained possession of dagger follows a natural consequence that must not have committed murder tait nodded several time during explanation to show that agreed with point raised when claude concluded rubbed chin in perplexity here come to dead stop said impatiently be asserted by police that murder be committed with dagger worn by mother a part of fancy dress yes if remember be on evidence be arrested well if wore that dagger in sitting room jeringham must not have be killed with because murder must have taken place while father be trying to pacify mother claude glanced at letter again father make mention of dagger in said with puzzled look must like to hear what have to say on subject more so a incline to story rather than to mother for what reason in conversation with mr bezel rather mother said that have threatened father with dagger in sitting room of laurel yes well if remember evidence given by to police at time of arrest be that have lost dagger at ball knew not into whose hand have fallen claude looked nonplussed knew not what answer to make that mother have made two different statement be compelled to admit further remembered that father have made statement whatsoever about dagger yet on possession of dagger turned whole of case whoever picked up whether at ball in sitting room must have killed jeringham assuming father account to be true claude saw reason to doubt accuracy mona must not have committed murder must mr mr larcher be guilty therefore followed that mother have spoken truly to police for inexplicable reason falsely to dagger must have be lost at ball picked up by whom can make nothing of said after due consideration only way to get at truth be to tell father that wife still life bring together out of meeting good may come will then call see father said tait encouragingly yes must see way out of must be informed that mother life be proper person to tell so though be strange added claude suddenly that hilliston never told humph that gentleman seems to serve side said tait gruffly mother speaks well of father think end of trust yet for what can see have deceived how why by keeping back truth from have let father think mother dead vice versa what do make of tell can make nothing of whole confusion said claude crossly will see father abandon case for be sick of affair be maddening what pity lunatic did not wake up few minute earlier so a to see who struck blow thus have settled matter be not that trouble what else disturbs mind jenny jenny echoed tait with feigned simplicity be afraid be dull see must be blind then retorted claude in exasperated tone know love jenny well well ca love be half sister indeed said tait in nowise astonished at announcement how do make out why be jenny daughter of paynton be father be father certainly assure jenny be not daughter be relation to tait what do mean ca guess out with man keep in suspense why drawled tait enjoying situation jenny be niece of denis in other word be child of mona bantry jeringham chapter xxxix garnet scarfpin same evening claude called to see father decided to go alone asked tait to repair to rose cottage within hour so that meeting with newly found parent having taken place consultation must be held by three regarding proceeding with withdrawing of case tait especially stipulated that arrangement must be come to a be desirous of seeing mr larcher senior in order to disabuse mind of straight forwardness of hilliston privately tait believed that lawyer must yet be found guilty of crime on other ground must explain attitude taken up by hilliston since paper have be placed in claude hand evidence of miss pike dick pental failed to alter idea on point tait be beginning to feel weary of investigation at turn took be baffled by fresh obstacle be not ill pleased to find that matter be at end so far a claude be concerned that young man have sworn to avenge death of father now that father proved to be still in existence oath be null void so that claude married to jenny must be quite willing to leave solution of mystery surrounding death of jeringham to tait tait determined to have nothing further to do with so wearisome problem waited considerably beyond hour before leaving for cottage a rightly considered father son must have much to say to one moreover be necessary to give larcher time to overcome emotion on learning that wife be still in existence tait be by mean sure that old gentleman must be pleased with revelation according to own showing relation with wife have be none of best to renew relation after twenty five year must hardly fail to be most unpleasant during time tait gave thought to jenny denis a to former be so satisfied that be daughter of jeringham by mona bantry that did not think while to give matter benefit of doubt what be curious to know be how paynton rather captain larcher came to stand in position of adopted father information on point be conveyed to before reached cottage by denis old servant walked briskly along road looking

have to clear besides evidence of dicky pental must implicate seeing that mistook in fancy dress for jeringham true enough replied nodding there be reason have just learned that wife be still alive be protected by hilliston at hampstead sent claude out of room so must ask plain question give plain answer tell be relation between care to answer that plainly said tait with hesitation think can guess doe hilliston love wife on authority of miss belinda pike whom saw at horriston believe doe for sake have deceived year seems so in fact captain larcher hilliston have be playing double game kept wife apart by assuring that other be dead that conduct alone stamp a villain then again threw kind of obstacle in way while be investigating case what for own opinion be that hilliston committed murder captain larcher clenched hand thought for few moment might be so muttered more to than to tait hilliston be in garden if loved wife fact never suspected might have killed jeringham out of jealousy dagger how did obtain that doubt at ball assure mr tait that wife have not dagger when in sitting room declares that threatened with then forgets speaks falsely wore at ball when spoke to there when returned be missing hilliston came with knowing jeringham be with wife might have picked up dagger with fullest intention of committing crime now that know loved wife be not prepared to say how acted in garden while be in house garnet scarfpin mentioned in novel belonged to hilliston said larcher quickly gave to denis picked up in garden thought nothing of a be aware hilliston be in ground on night now believe oh be afraid to say what believe may be wrong there be one way of finding out truth captain come up to town week see wife then may learn old gentleman leaned head on hand in deep thought for few minute will come said at length at cost will force guilty woman to own truth chapter xl face to face conversation between tait captain larcher be not finished that evening a old gentleman worn out by excitement of day early retired to bed however declared that must be shortly ready to journey to london claude left cottage with tait on understanding that father be to be called for next day before parted for night claude made remark about hilliston hope wo get wind of said dubiously may get mr bezel ca call mother out of way have fear replied tait calmly hilliston hand be too full at present what do mean why said tait lighting candle father showed letter from hilliston apologizing for not coming over a wife be lying dangerously ill at connaught hotel at eastbourne said something of in note to what be matter with mr hilliston have smallpox smallpox echoed claude in tone of horror poor creature be dead woman know so much about that may recover may recover from disease said young man gloomily not from blow to vanity many time have told that if lost look must kill mark word tait within week will hear of death with prophetic word claude retired to room tait have time to think of conversation being occupied with anticipation regarding meeting of captain larcher wife so happened that claude prognostication occurred to when truth of horriston tragedy be discovered be not long afterward perhaps like young men fate grew weary of affair have dragged on for twenty five year at event brought matter to conclusion with almost inconceivable rapidity first step toward end be meeting of husband wife took place at clarence cottage hampstead during afternoon of next day in company with son tait old gentleman drove to railway station three mile distant took up express when established comfortably in first class smoking carriage for captain larcher be fond of pipe resumed conversation with tait have be broken off on previous night time subject be hilliston doings have be thinking over suspicion regarding hilliston said addressing more directly to tait confess that be difficult to reconcile of action with view that be guilty claude a know be ignorant of horriston tragedy until enlightened by hilliston know that dear sir said tait quietly hilliston certainly placed paper containing account of matter in claude hand be forced to do so by action of mr bezel beg pardon mr larcher continue to call mr bezel if please prefer so how did force hilliston to confide in claude because read book ' whim of fate seeing tragedy therein described wrote asking claude to see with intention of telling a may guess story differs materially from of hilliston so of two evil choosing least determined to forestall inform claude of matter did so by mean of press said claude eagerly in place of telling story allowed to gather what information must from scanty report of canterbury observer dear father genesis of whole matter spring from finding of paper by jenny have not read told linton story must not have written book have not done so mr bezel must not have determined to tell version for threat to do so hilliston must not have produced paper humph action be compulsory on part of hilliston think so sir said tait complacently therefore be quite in keeping with usual character rat did not fight till be driven into corner be not in corner remarked captain larcher significantly will drive there see if will face accusation what about hilliston introduction of claude to must not have be to interest to keep apart oh said tait with contempt for hilliston diplomacy be case of necessity knew that claude be bent on discovering truth so fearing that must do so by further investigation thought to stop whole matter by bringing face to face with son see how must accomplish aim hilliston hoped must do so in two way explained tait glibly first hoped that must give consent to claude marrying jenny so lead mind away from case second trusted that when claude found alive must no longer desire to pursue investigation be right so far said claude seriously if be hilliston calculation made one great mistake said captain larcher scornfully did not think must wish to see wife must have be satisfied that claude must tell be alive that of course thought must stay at thorston a ferdinand paynton be afraid to admit identity even to wife might have done so for claude owe to to clear meeting with wife will be first step toward doing so between must solve mystery be none so far a be concerned said tait grimly be sure a be sitting here that hilliston murdered gardener be just too late to see do deed motive asked claude curiously father tait stole glance at one of wished to make remark about mr larcher hilliston passion preferring claude must be ignorant of episode still when asked so direct question be difficult to avoid direct answer larcher gave one be sufficiently evasive to stop further inquiry must try find out motive said quietly depend upon claude there be good deal of underhand work in of know nothing do think mona committed crime in way must have gained possession of dagger with be committed mother say have dagger in sitting room be mistake said captain larcher using a delicate word a must think of threatened with sheath of dagger doubt being agitated at time thought be weapon noticed when entered room that sheath be empty story to police at time of trial be more likely lost in ballroom question be who picked up judging from knowledge now have of character believe be hilliston who did so jeringham said tait suddenly impossible how must jeringham have found be with mr evening may have seen dagger fall again may have taken out of sheath to examine have forgotten to return be not improbable that in case might have recollected when be in garden offered to mona to return to mistress oh said claude with contempt on slight ground suppose that mona killed be not beyond bound of probability nonsense said captain angrily believe be good girl foully deceived by jeringham fled from house to hide disgrace thinking wife must tell brother hilliston afterward met in london where died in giving birth to jenny then be hilliston who brought jenny to yes because uncle denis be in service adopted jenny told that be child of mr kennedy mona bantry believed father mother be married so disturb that view of case certainly not said tait emphatically must be cruel to do so here be at victoria after seeing mr bezel at hampstead can resume conversation if do will be from different standpoint fancy said larcher significantly a train stopped tait brougham be waiting for at station in drove up to hampstead leaving in fitzjohn avenue walked down hunt lane to clarence cottage mr bezel occupied usual seat in window caught sight of claude a preceded father tait up path terrified expression crossed face made motion to forbid entrance yet sense of coming evil struck at heart needed self control to prevent from fainting when be shown into room dear mother said claude kissing must be prepared for unexpected news beg of to control for stopped short in astonishment mr bezel be looking at captain larcher with bewildered air gazed at face with expression of amazement shrank back a crossed room with rapidity bent over mona bantry cried be possible that still live chapter xli explanation on hearing father exclamation claude turned round with look of supreme astonishment must not understand meaning of sudden exclamation father understand be wife mother be indeed sneered captain larcher who have

innocence a sure a be george larcher be sister of denis bantry who denis interruption came from mr bezel have sat dumfounded at unexpected appearance of man whom have thought dead have said nothing while assertion denial be going on mention of brother name stirred dormant faculty sat up looking wildly around denis cried in terrified tone be denis here denis be down at thorston said captain

steadily at captain larcher yes be old master so be alive be dead why did kill sir did not kill replied captain quietly a counter question may ask why passed off to claude a wife mr bezel burst into wild laugh clapped hand together then covered face commenced to weep in few moment fit of hysteria passed away became cool composed thrown off balance for time being have now gathered wit together be ready to fight folly impulse have brought about catastrophe be duty to set right again if must upshot of matter be extremely doubtful on part captain larcher be relieved to find mr bezel proved to be mona bantry instead of wife ever since communication made by claude have suffered agony at thought that wife have be living year under protection of false friend now that fear be set at rest once forever julia larcher have really died a hilliston have asserted woman in clarence cottage who have taken name be maid in place of mistress out of trouble larcher extracted morsel of comfort honor be unstained meanwhile three visitor sat waiting to hear what mr bezel have to say saw that expected confession resolved to disappoint leaning backward among cushion closed eye played waiting game proved

anything to do with on account of jeringham did love oh yes know thought be in love with wife such be not case loved only larcher drew long breath looked puzzled be relieved to find that have not be mistaken in hilliston after yet assertion of mr bezel only seemed to further complicate case if hilliston did not love mr what possible motive must have to kill jeringham look of claude tait reflected perplexity dismissing special point for moment pursued examination how did hilliston receive mr bezel looked around with bitter smile meaning be clear from contemptuous expression on face can not guess from what see here said quietly francis hilliston bought loved well enough not sufficiently to marry did not ruin for be already ruined accepted offer to come here be mistress what else must do

before episode after episode till stopped short at spectacle of closed door lying alone deserted in sickroom wept prayed then with firm hand took out of dressing case small vial filled with dark brown liquid twice put to lip twice hesitated third time accomplished purpose thought of lost beauty of husband neglect of childless home wretched future nerved drank off content then quickly replaced bottle in dressing case when nurse came in to see patient mr hilliston be lying back with quiet smile on pale lip have found peace at last chapter xliii last appearance of francis hilliston unaware of tragedy have taken place at eastbourne captain larcher be in london brooding over wrong weaving scheme how to avenge on hilliston eye have be opened by tait with regard to conduct of gentleman now saw plainly that have be hilliston dupe for year indeed began to share tait opinion that lawyer be guilty be casting about in own mind how to prove when announcement in paper informed of death of mr hilliston smallpox killed doubt said tait when have expressed regret remarked claude who have be looking over general news be case of suicide suicide exclaimed hearer in one breath yes according to paragraph appears that in way became possessed of bottle of laudanum while nurse be absent woman returned to find patient dead poor mr hilliston added claude folding up paper with sigh how sorry be to

longer with murderer be wrong father observed claude looking up be knowledge that have lost look killed depend upon took poison so a to avoid dragging out day scarred miserable object how do know that claude asked father with curious look on face because not once twice thrice mr hilliston told must kill rather than grow old ugly loss of beauty came with smallpox so have carried out resolve will be blow to hilliston think so said captain larcher rather cynically from what remember of louisa sinclair love be on side doubt married when be mr derrick purely for money quite believe story of mona bantry be be woman of love now wife be dead can console with mistress reminds observed claude suddenly what be to do about jenny be to be informed that mother be yet alive captain larcher shook head

bezel agrees with have consented that thing will remain a be doe not want to see jenny father of course doe be only natural poor soul love child sufficiently to avoid casting shadow on life jenny will never know that jeringham be father that mother be still alive will marry claude a miss kennedy know more of connection with matter than doe at present denis denis have be told wrote two day ago have doubt will come up to town to see last of wretched sister last of can doubt have death written on face blow for hilliston said tait in rather regretful tone villain a knew lawyer to be must not help feeling sorry for trouble fate have held hand long time now be dealing full measure pouring vial of wrath on head of sinner will be heavier blow than last said larcher in severe tone for there be doubt hilliston truly love mona suppose denis will object to going near again be impossible to say must leave to man conversation took place in tait room one morning three week after momentous interview with mr bezel have be captain be intention to return at once to thorston have be dissuaded from by son who thought few week in town must do father good there be doubt on point for captain larcher brisked up wonderfully in exhilarating atmosphere of west end for unexplained mystery of jeringham death must have be quite happy in recovered society of son even while future be still black enjoyed in small degree did claude good to see that father be at length getting pleasure out of life after year of incessant trouble wearing anxiety next day denis looking older grayer than ever came up to see sister saw master for few minute then went on to hampstead have told denis how ill be explained captain larcher a man took departure have promised to be a lenient a possible toward wrong doing by way hilliston be in town hilliston yes came up in same train a denis have impudence to speak to asked where be a wanted to see to see father cried claude in astonishment what for think can guess interposed tait quietly hilliston have be stricken by wife death want to atone for sin by confessing truth must not be surprised if called here afternoon captain larcher looked skeptical said nothing matter dropped for time being a happened denis be still ignorant that sister have be mistress of lawyer else there might have be trouble have confused idea of hilliston connection with case beyond knowing that be owner of garnet scarfpin must not conceive that have be actually present in garden when murder be committed true be that scarfpin have be found on spot where corpse of jeringham have lain assured by master that hilliston be innocent a captain larcher have truly believed many year denis never gave matter second thought now must learn truth from mr bezel denis only came back in afternoon looking much put out ruin of much loved sister by jeringham have be great blow to discovery that be alive have be living in sin with hilliston startled considerably must hardly reply to question of master ultimately related that have parted friend mr bezel have told that doctor assured must not live much longer in shadow of death denis have freely forgiven sin folly indeed sir what else must do said denis wiping tear from eye when saw poor thing lying there like corpse be bitter time be have of last ten year in death in life state oh yes captain forgave freely poor soul hilliston asked larcher inquiringly may black soul burn cried denis with scowl be younger 'd leave mark on mona have letter from saying be calling to see evening that have appointment with sir with denis be first have heard of where be at moment a if in response to question door opened tait appeared looking very disturbed mr hilliston be here captain larcher wish to speak with claude have entered room by door on hearing stepped forward looking slightly pale slipped arm within of father a though to protect elder man then waited to hear what captain larcher have to say permission for interview must come from man who have be most deeply wronged thought for moment so with frown on face then sank into chair with deep sigh denis stand behind said in peremptory tone claude sit down yonder now mr tait be ready to see friend tait anticipated permission be already prepared for without word threw open door hilliston dressed in deep mourning entered room with paper in hand looked pale worn fresh color be gone a spoke kept eye persistently on ground must be easily seen that man have received shock from must not easily recover have called to see deliver said in low tone placing paper carried on table ask forgiveness larcher for consider have done anything to justify anger against must have saved year of anguish by telling truth said larcher indignantly perhaps be not to interest to tell truth wonder at said claude bitterly be afraid of law perhaps said hilliston again on other hand may not be so guilty a think will find truth in paper pointed toward table eye of immediately turned in direction while hilliston moved toward door having fulfilled promise made to dead wife now take leave said quietly will never see of again day may learn that have misjudged good by opened door before must pas through denis sprang forward sister said with indignant look in eye be about to repair wrong did replied lawyer gravely by to morrow will be wife chapter xliv truth hilliston came went in space of few minute none of present made attempt to stay exit a door closed after looked at one in silence thinking of hilliston last speech denis be first to speak what doe mean sir asked master with air of helpless bewilderment think can only mean one thing denis replied larcher rousing mr hilliston have at length awakened to fact of dastardly treatment of sister be about to make reparation for past intends to marry wife only died few day ago master know that mr bezel will also die shortly if hilliston desire to atone for past have time to lose can marry at once will again be widower within month denis lifted pair of shaking hand slowly left room followed by sympathetic look of others did not even pause to learn content of sealed envelope left by mr hilliston great a be curiosity to learn have taken place on fatal night love grief for sister be greater still bowed gray older looking than ever departed in heart there be one comfortable thought mona must die honest woman if mr hilliston be to be believed when three found alone captain larcher picked up sealed letter with reluctance strange said balancing in hand for year have be eager to know truth now have only to open envelope to learn feel half afraid nevertheless will be a well to lose time in making ourselves acquainted with content said tait eagerly for be in fever of impatience to know may be confession by hilliston think not be directed to in handwriting of mr hilliston to ferdinand paynton to captain larcher h be said tait with start how did mr hilliston know be captain larcher did see at thorston husband doubtless informed of real name however will learn from said larcher breaking seal believe be confession by mr hilliston what can have to confess cried claude a father smoothed out closely written letter can know nothing of tragedy forget said tait with sudden recollection louisa sinclair be at horriston according to mona bantry be in garden of laurel on night must not be surprised if saw committal of crime what do think be about to betray husband oh said tait significantly be by mean sure of hilliston guilt larcher found that writing be too small for to read comfortably so handed letter to claude with request that must read out aloud excusing on plea of illegibility of writing claude passed to tait who accepted office with avidity letter be without date direction began in abrupt manner highly suggestive of agitation under have be written tait mentally noted point began confession be to be read after death by captain george larcher if see fit have free permission to make public still trust out of regret for memory of unhappy woman that will not do so save in arising of two contingency first must be still alive accused of murdering mr jeringham second must dear husband be accused of crime in event of occurrence of of contingency authorize to make page public to explain must go back twenty six year when be residing at horriston captain larcher will remember well a louisa sinclair for at time saw great deal of wife saw too much of for eye be sharp for natural reluctance to disturb domestic peace must have enlightened a to conduct be never worthy of good man like be a bad a afterward became be saying great deal a will see by reading on loved francis hilliston intimate friend belinda pike loved also there be need for of to be jealous of other for mr hilliston loved third person none other than wife doubt will be angry when read anger can not alter fact yes dearest friend loved wife let deny that if can at point there be marginal note by hilliston do deny be not in position to do so must not let george eye rest on confession poor wife be insanely jealous of mr larcher swear that have ground to be so admired mr larcher

marry on account of crime in america married derrick millionaire died returned to london found francis greatly in want of money a still loved married one two knew who really killed jeringham for sake captain larcher acknowledge guilt lest must be found out accused of crime must say much more be enough when read will be dead last word swear be true none other killed mark jeringham in mistake for francis hilliston note by hilliston will be seen that wife be actuated through by jealousy swear have reason loved mona not mr larcher saved life because committed crime for sake married because be on verge of pecuniary ruin have nothing more to add can blame if like consider have acted through a be forced by circumstance chapter xlv few word by spenser tait when case have be stated when witness for against have given evidence when counsel on side have delivered speech be then customary for judge to sum up entire matter for direction of jury in instance be judge here be larcher affair summed up for understanding of public have fallen to share to wind up story so here set down such result a happened from confession of mr hilliston immediate result of death be marriage of widower to mr bezel took place so to speak when latter be on deathbed lingered out two month died in arm of husband at peace with world denis heartily forgave only bitter drop in cup be absence of child yet when captain larcher suggested that jenny must be told truth brought to say good by to mother mr bezel with self denial for hardly gave credit refused to permit thing thought that jenny must be happier if be ignorant of truth moreover mr bezel shrank from letting child know how have lived during many year at event jenny never learned truth mr bezel died without seeing daughter that forgave hilliston for having deprived her of child be think proof of goodness of heart for there be doubt that acted selfishly cruelly in doing so enough of mr bezel fault virtue lie in hampstead cemetery under plain stone of rose colored granite inscribed to memory of mona hilliston so have wish at last died honest woman captain larcher returned with kerry to cottage in nightingale lane a must not make up mind to resume own name tear away from bookworm life of twenty five year one knew truth save claude jenny for hilliston being absent from england doe not count vicar be also enlightened on subject expressed much astonishment at strange series of event have culminated in death confession of mr hilliston unwilling to lose old crony heartily approved of larcher determination to resume usual life so matter be settled captain larcher will remain mr ferdinand paynton to end of day will still be mystery to gossip of thorston how great one can never guess notable change have taken place in habit be no longer recluse misanthrope when be at manor house visit there be constant guest at vicarage may be seen frequently fishing beside kerry on bank of lax following example of master denis bantry also renounced name superstitiously regarded a one of ill omen called kerry for rest of life if be grieved for unhappy sister life death find consolation in society of mr claude larcher who conduct toward a niece must do relationship be not known beyond wall of rose cottage lest might lead to inquiry jenny be still known a daughter of mr paynton that claude must call mr paynton father be of course only regarded a natural by village have not married jenny doe not stand in relation of son to old man thorston gossip think be most perfect son in law never guess that nearer relationship exists between of course jenny claude be married a speedily a possible know happier couple mr larcher have quite converted with regard to fair sex plume on victory have audacity to say that will yet succeed in getting married think be beyond power mr linton married spent honeymoon at manor house lent for occasion indeed while at thorston invariably live with must be offended did take up quarter anywhere else not that have desire to do so for rose cottage be rather small besides manor be within easy distance of so that jenny can see father rather father in law a often a chooses claude still go to different part of world to build bridge construct railway sometimes wife go with doe not like to be so long away from thorston paynton be now old man can not live long so mr larcher wish to be near a much a possible besides care of nursery take up attention so think that in few month claude will settle down to business in london make home at thorston a always intended to do there be pleasant little place not far from manor have be commissioned to buy for so really think that next year claude jenny will take up residence among only person who disapproved of marriage be frank linton who accused jenny of jilting be utter nonsense a never have intention of becoming wife however author considers badly treated have taken up quarter in london where writes book pose in chelsea circle think will ever write so excellent book a whim of fate perhaps because mr claude larcher refuse to tell more plot have good reason for so doing a trouble arose out of finding murder paper in garret of rose cottage have startled in small degree still a tell must look on such trouble a blessing in disguise for after led to marriage present happiness mr claude doe not see matter in so amiable light finally hilliston be hard to say what have become of gentleman after death of second wife withdrew from business went abroad there believe be still from what hear of at odd time seems to have developed into kind of wandering jew france italy austria germany russia have seen place be constantly traveling about doubt trying to live down past whether will succeed in doing so be hard to say after consideration have come to conclusion that have be rather hard on hilliston did not love mr larcher in spite of wife insane jealousy on point believe be sincerely attached to mona bantry blot on character be that did not marry when first came to london seeing that be in love with profess inability to explain why did not do so perhaps be on account of low birth circumstance connected with jeringham at event did not marry till be too late for poor creature happiness otherwise see how must have acted differently louisa sinclair be guilty of murder a did on account be wildly in love with be to honor that protected a did whether must have told truth have mr larcher be convicted know a louisa sinclair did not leave for america till mr larcher be released think hilliston must have persuaded to confess openly in event of conviction be true that married for money think be touched by devotion gave love doubt be mr hilliston remorse for condemning father to lifelong seclusion that made so kind to claude when be lad now be easy to see why hilliston be reluctant that claude must investigate case be afraid lest truth must be found out wife arrested be wrong in surmise hilliston be not afraid for for unhappy woman who have killed jeringham in mistake for whole mystery must have be solved year ago have dicky pental spoken out a must have done fear of being shut up in asylum closed mouth so case be at standstill for five twenty long year be strange that jenny who set ball rolling must have be indirect mean of avenging father murder rather of solving mystery concealed have not discovered paper in garret must not have be able to give frank linton plot of whim of fate have that novel not be written published mr bezel must not have read thereby have be induced to write to claude have not done so hilliston must not have told claude truth thence must not have taken up investigation solved mystery be jenny who be responsible for whole after five twenty year child of murdered man unconsciously enlightened a to person who have slain fate work in strange way wish to figure further a detective one experience have be quite enough for thought anguish trouble be too worrying next criminal case in
