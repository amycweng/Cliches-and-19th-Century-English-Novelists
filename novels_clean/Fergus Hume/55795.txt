sake when meet woman said gerald wisely will ask to be wife otherwise shrug must complete unfinished sentence tod be quite ready to leave conclusion of fishing adventure to friend being in love with particular girl thought of only have wish to search for girl even though be illiterate princess who fluted like nightingale what with earning living fighting lady euphemia wooing charity bird tricking mr pelham odin who be strongly opposed to wooing macandrew hand be quite full within two day betook to london keen upon seeing moon fay ballet in charity be dancing before departure unwittingly did gerald service by learning something about pixy house same something be le romantic than unpleasant according to tod thing came about by accident haskins who believed that everything be designed even

hab de knife in if go dere homicidal mania said tod learnedly cheerfully haskins shuddered seemed terrible to think that owner of silvery voice who have sent so delightfully quaint message must be dangerous lunatic not responsible for action when landlord took departure made observation rather to than to friend message be sane enough said thereby contradicting first impression when geary spoke of lunacy well know answered macandrew doubtfully fairy business talk of not being able to read write seems queer suppose will chuck adventure now that know probably said haskins evasively so that tod must not worry in heart have longing to probe matter deeper later in day gerald escorted tod to selbury saw off to london macandrew left with impression that gerald must carry out prearranged programme travel to st ives on ensuing day when haskins walked back to denleigh be far from having made up mind to course seemed incredible that sender of message must have homicidal tendency same if have not law must certainly have prevented incarceration in old leegarth mansion known a pixy house that must not read write be quite possible since have used phonograph yet in age of education appeared improbable that anyone must be so ignorant wording of message be that of imaginative not of weak brain spirit of poetry breathed appealed to young man poet of mean order on whole decided gerald will go to exeter to morrow get canoe on same evening when geary went for usual walk haskins again slipped record into machine again drank in music of perfect voice then for sake of hiding secret since landlord unexpectedly returned set phonograph to grind out godly hymn be geary delight be dismal enough in word tune through sounded in gerald charmed ear silvery lilt of fairy princess ' tone owner of such voice must not possibly be crazy haskins rather regretted that have not asked major rebb about pixy house occupant rebb doubtless knew village of leegarth excellently well since came down occasionally to see elderly relative for moment haskins be tempted to write ask question on second thought made up mind to explore for be even glad that tod have departed for now secret be entirely own wished to share with one therefore abstained from talking to geary on subject for have learned be possible from source what have learned be so decidedly unpleasant that did not wish to hear more a afterward turned out reticence be wise next day haskins informed geary of intention to remain in denleigh for week negro expressed delight at decision adonis be cheerful soul who have traveled widely in humble capacity of steward on board various liner therefore approached more intellectual society than must obtain in lethargic denleigh haskins with eye to copy after fashion of literary man found geary experience entertaining useful a for landlady be nonentity who worked like horse be a dumb a one seemed to be somewhat afraid of ever smiling husband gerald thought that there might be cause for such dread with suave manner geary one eye hinted at sinister doings a yet haskins knowing only on surface have fault to find with personality there be difficulty in finding precisely suitable canoe in exeter having made up mind singularly obstinate one gerald never rested until have attained object in couple of day returned to devon maid with light birchwood affair have purchased from returned canadian emigrant young man temporarily bestowed in outside shed informed landlord casually that intended to explore water of ruddle a stream be called name evidently came from streaky red bank between flowed geary advised guest to travel downstream toward silbury a canoe must there be impeded by fewer stone needle to say a leegarth be in precisely opposite direction haskins have intention of taking well meant advice indeed because of very difficulty in navigating upper reach of ruddle have purchased canoe for must carry so light craft along bank when stone weed blocked up waterway when gerald took indian coracle down to river next afternoon saw how wise have be in not buying heavier boat a little stream wound devious way through dense wood grew yet more narrow on whole somewhat willow here there deep pool be to be found inshore a rule current flowed lightly over shingly bed foaming round gigantic stone bubbling over trunk of fallen tree distance to leegarth a crow fly must not have be more than three mile stream twisted so oddly difficulty of navigation be so great that gerald sometimes doubted if must reach journey end several time be forced to climb steep bank drag canoe through thickly growing sapling on whole tiny willop behaved with dexterity of eel in slipping through dangerous place nevertheless traveling be more like exploration of unknown land than like civilized river trip in mapped out england late in day about six o'clock when western sky be beginning to glow with hue of soapbubble adventurer found in le toilsome position after choked stream where tree met overhead be relief to float into immense pool fenced in by precipitous red cliff draped with vividly green vegetation gerald emerged into haven with feeling of thankfulness laid down paddle to rest weary muscle to examine romantic surroundings pool be nearly circular a narrow ruddle flowed in at one end out at other whole resembled bead on string on placid water brimming like of mill dam canoe floated idly until touched left bank haskins therefore saw on right hand tall cliff of ruddy earth overgrown with bush surmounted by fringe of tree between espied ruinous gray stone wall clothed thickly with ivy a there be two three small window in wall gerald guessed that formed side of dwelling place guessed moreover that from one of same window sealed message have be thrown into pool be of course merely surmise that pixy house be built on top of inland cliff bearing in mind cylinder with attached bladder haskins felt certain that be correct imprisoned mavis durham must only have launched message from cliff top gerald have now practically arrived at journey end a have discovered palace of sleeping beauty shut in by enchanted wood

in way be cold never kiss if like person kiss if be very nice person do said haskins bubbling over with laughter now eye completed sentence love yes mavis answered unhesitatingly gerald scorned lie

calling to supper must go may find come again will kiss oh what be name gerald replied softly prince gerald said smiling slipped down tree rapidly a bellaria called again haskins parting leaf saw cross lawn enter house in company of tall lean woman be too dark to see bellaria look at distance adventurer slipped from wall descended to mother carey peace pool a named place paddling to opposite side found sloping bank dragged canoe into undergrowth then in rosy twilight scrambled through bush to find path road leading to denleigh chapter v golden hour how haskins reached devon maid that evening must not tell for memory be occupied in recalling word of delightful conversation in way managed to strike narrow path led on to high moor thence gained highway descending into denleigh valley be rather late when entered sitting room rosy hue of sunset have given place to shadowy stillness of summer night supper be waiting for almost immediately negro appeared with hot dish thought be lost sah said geary looking closely at gerald flannel be somewhat torn by bramble smeared with mud oh answered young man ready with explanation since wished to satisfy negro curiosity without enlightening have be down river up river in canoe got mixed up with stone cross current blundered in darkness therefore hid canoe in bush came back like river sah asked geary lingering haskins supped soup nodded most charming river said in careless voice very quiet very lonely will explore again to morrow afternoon negro withdrew quietly haskins reflected on persistent way in man questioned more than ever did mistrust adonis now with stronger reason for felt certain that negro be connected in way with major rebb who in turn be assuredly connected with pixy house inmate if geary discovered that gerald have met with enchanted princess might officiously inform rebb when there must be trouble without doubt major be behaving illegally in shutting up perfectly sane girl therefore must not create public scandal nevertheless if knew that haskins have penetrated secret might remove mavis to hiding place gerald must not risk that until knew more again have met girl looked upon a knight errant of distressed beauty behooved to be wary in dealing with very difficult somewhat dangerous matter after supper haskins lighted pipe seated by open window to think over matter mr geary entered removed remnant of meal in dumb way after placing cup of coffee on small table at guest elbow withdrew be left to reflection began with consideration of mavis beauty of person charm of conversation can thus be guessed that haskins be in love genuinely in love for first time in life a bulwer lytton say there be many counterfeit only one eros be haskins experience have loved in earthly way many time in time several time have mistaken false for true fastidious mind have saved from commercial passion of ordinary man have usually approached woman in belief that be goddess be hard on sex a attitude exacts too much perfection in world of temptation consequently gerald have be deceived several time therefore have guarded carefully against tender passion then met with charity bird in common with many man fell in love with physical charm in spite of beauty grew to admire a must that of picture haskins failed to find in wife helpmate exacting nature demanded outwardly charity be that must desire inwardly be le attractive being matter of fact when be not silly might suit tod did not match with gerald so withdrew with little regret for month have be heart whole fancy free now in unexpected extraordinary way young man have met with charity bird more perfect than original mavis be a beautiful in look yet be higher in mind from strange upbringing to have subjected looked at life what little knew of in poetical way yet judging by remark on cooking embroidering gardening have fund of common knowledge directed by common sense be too early a yet to pronounce authoritatively on capability trend of thought spiritual power manifested in personality appealed strongly to lover who have loved counterfeit here indeed be true eros deity who must be worshiped without disappointment gerald with le reflection than usually gave to decision determined to be faithful attendant at shrine of divinity having thus settled attitude towards girl with impetuosity of young man true lover haskins began to think over miss durham position in spite of hideous rumor reported by geary believed from personal observation that girl be quite sane rebb who be acknowledged guardian have apparently set such gossip afloat so that one might comment upon seclusion of girl guarded in way by public fear have be erected by lying tale mavis might continue to dwell for rest of life amidst ruin of pixy house closely watched by florentine spied upon in le degree a gerald shrewdly suspected by geary who be probably creature of major rebb now question be why did rebb shut up so pretty unsophisticated creature in conventual solitude have committed crime from what little haskins have seen of have instinct must make commit one there must be other reason strong one for odd behavior of rebb reason haskins determined to learn howsoever much geary employer might desire to conceal also there be other question to young man desired answer why be mavis so similar to charity in look why have not be taught to read write why be geary a haskins verily believed posted at devon maid to keep one sinister eye on gerald must not have sworn in court of law that negro be connected in way with pixy house secret have intuitive feeling from man behavior towards major rebb by eager statement of false rumor that in manner landlord have to do with matter haskins therefore placed on guard by careless demeanor apparent frankness succeeded in lulling geary suspicion a to true reason for postponing journey to st ives be geary who must answer at least of question vexed gerald soul lingered to hear unfortunately did not know how to inquire without betraying secret visit to pixy house two three day went by haskins regularly took way to river to seek fairy palace after first attempt to navigate so stubborn stream a ruddle used canoe very little be easier more expeditious to take highway to moor then strike into secret path led to mother carey peace pool haskins did then must paddle across to landing place whence must gain summit of cliff here must climb wall to hide behind beech tree hither mavis must come to chatter to fairy prince a still continued to call owing to presence of bellaria young man did not dare to descend into ground moment might have brought about discovery have risked so much for according to mavis florentine be keen restless dragon be afraid of something said mavis one day when gerald questioned about woman know what be be afraid why do think that because be always looking over shoulder with scared expression never sleep in same bedroom have more than one then mavis oh yes there be many many bedroom in house bellaria go to different one nightly be afraid of darkness too remains always in house after sundown when go shopping in leegarth return quite pale nervous be quite sure that be afraid of something always get angry with when ask what be matter curious murmured haskins here be mystery then asked aloud how often doe guardian come to not very often sometimes be away for month then will come twice in week really be very kind for always brings present call santa claus when doe that oh there be bellaria stay here gerald will see what want a be early in afternoon haskins have excellent view of florentine who stalked across lawn almost to foot of beech drawn thither by nursling answering cry be always sitting on high branch of tree said italian crossly in most excellent english why do do can see river pool said mavis quickly oh bellaria be nymph must plunge into cool water can do without being nymph cara mia not in pool below not

that accepted limitation of liberty in good faith will be so glad when be twenty one complained with sigh si si si bellaria placed hand on hip nodded three time emphatically will not like world ah dio mio world be dangerous evil place looked in scared manner over shoulder shivering in warm air florentine have be handsome woman tall dark of commanding appearance be still remarkably straight at age of fifty six carried with defiant air when forgetful of danger threatened whatsoever might be then must cringe wince a gerald have just seen do eye be large black pupil be dilated looked like terrified rabbit apparently woman have cause to fear enemy punishment for not only be eye scared looking plentiful hair be absolutely snow white might have be age fifty six be not very great age hair might easily have be iron grey there be certainly shadow on life threatened disaster only when forgot danger in conversation with mavis did bellaria appear defiant stately tolerably young very slightest reminder of past past apparently contained danger referred to form dwindled body bent eye grew timid aged to seventy a though by enchantment might have be fancy on haskins part for be extremely imaginative believed that have read woman rightly might be reason bellaria dondi have be frightened into lonely house there to hide from appalling danger appeared that fit of terror tormented now that have sought mavis company from sheer dread of solitude quite ignorant of man up tree rather lover who be seated on wall bellaria sat near trunk talking to mavis lover be afraid lest secret must be discovered bellaria kept up so loud conversation seemed a though spoke loudly to reassure that occasional movement of haskins passed unheeded mavis proved to be capable actress despite simplicity for nothing must have be more artless than demeanor geary be coming to see to night said bellaria after pause observation startled listener sent message by matthew be aged cross gardener of whom mavis have spoken why be coming questioned mavis major rebb told to come see that young man who be stopping at devon maid have not be lurking about here what young man asked mavis coolly have told friend of major who be stopping at geary inn have taken to rowing on river might find place wish must said girl truthfully must like to see really young man will day bellaria assured then will be sorry cara mia young men be liar villain geary wrote to major rebb in london telling about mr haskins be name believe so major say that geary have to come over to night to look round place ask

to marry until have seen world dear have to wait for ten month pouted mavis what be yes who speak bellaria dondi will never never see world again here be shut up for ever ever why nanny have often asked never will tell tell one reason why stop here said woman sombrely be dead to world to people for twenty year have be dead be a well that must be thought to be dead if knew if guessed ugh looked round shivered if who knew matter matter bellaria leaped to foot be done with over be famous once cara mia yes behold in great singer know know often have talked to of greatness be blotted out in night by hush hush cast scared glance over shoulder darted into middle of lawn bellaria bellaria called out mavis will climb beech again woman did not reply burst out into shadow song from dinorah haskins realized at once what magnificent voice must have have even now many of note be true though occasionally high one be cracked wheezy spreading black skirt bowed becked swept danced to shadow in strong sunlight while voice fluted high birdlike through air thus singing dancing re entered house dark hour over for time being haskins wondered what must be secret here indeed be woman with past by time mavis have climbed tree again be hurriedly persuading to go bellaria suspect nothing said eagerly after geary come to night wo come again must be careful how can be more careful than be asked gerald taking hand come at night urged come to morrow night when moon be high fairy come out to dance be often in garden on summer night for bellaria will not come out hate to be mewed up in stuffy

knife oh so dangerous brought from jamaica told bellaria so must kill if found quite believe that said gerald grimly resolved to arm with revolver when next came to pixy house be resolved not to die without fight worry darling will be right goodbye to morrow night then dropped from wall departed while mavis wailed that have not kissed chapter vi past of adonis geary gerald have not kissed wished to very badly something in heart strong sense of honor maybe prevented doing so until have made position clear to be so simple so innocent so virginal that knew nothing of passion of life of world wherein woman marry be given in marriage with almost absurd particularity young man desired that before being kissed must learn that be true lover that wished to marry that greatly desired to enter into lifelong companionship with to act otherwise be to bind unknowingly to when understood what love meant be ready to accept a husband then must seal acceptance with kiss for knew full well that kiss must awaken woman in must reveal life to soul caress meant so much that be little wonder restrained from following too hurriedly desire of heart perhaps be that found innocence friendly acceptance of presence too delightful to transmute with unconsidered haste friendship into love why spoil idyll of lily by presenting with red ripe rose of love romance be so charming so dreamlike that poetic instinct of poet forbade to rouse mavis be indeed sleeping beauty slumbering within enchanted palace fated prince a must seem be from finding of cylinder must in time awaken with kiss hour have not yet struck when did many thing must come to pas in first place mavis must no longer be contented to live in pixy house ignorant of life must wish to come out into world even before age of twenty one must not wait longer for guardian permission desire must mean meeting explanation with rebb gerald a yet did not see how to bring about guessed that when spoke to major must be told of homicidal mania with mavis be said to be tainted must be vain for to decline to believe in such taint if rebb insisted that be so must refuse to allow haskins to marry ward particularly a be under age then again if rebb guessed that young man wished to marry girl might very easily remove secretly to new hiding place gerald must lose for ever hasty action be not to be thought of must be best to wait until must learn why rebb secluded girl in ruinous house haskins duly returned to devon maid found geary a cheerful obsequious a usual now that gerald be enlightened a to connection of negro with pixy house found difficult to tolerate false smile piercing mask of geary good humor saw in dangerous man gripping yellow handled knife be ready to use must be necessary haskins no longer wondered at negro presence amongst lonely hill knew that have not drifted there have be made landlord of inn to act a dragon very dangerous dragon might prove to be must gain wind of gerald philanderings with mavis geary however showed sign that suspected anything waited a usual on guest while at dinner gerald seized opportunity to tell landlord that contemplated stopping at silbury on ensuing night have to run up to london on day after to morrow said haskins with feigned carelessness if sleep at silbury can catch eight o'clock train must dribe dere sah for dat train said geary beaming evidently pleased at

while gerald at window sipped coffee saw big negro walking up hill led on to moor for moment flashed across young man that geary might go to mother carey peace pool by taking down path there might discover canoe on second thought dismissed reflection geary being quite ignorant of haskins knowledge have reason to seek pool so canoe must be left undisturbed in undergrowth haskins have really intended to retire early unable to rest quietly strolled out of inn on to bridge one lingered there now a early bird of denleigh have gone to roost have rialto of village to a thought until became aware that mr geary with blue shawl over head be leaning against parapet wondering if must learn anything about adonis from usually silent wife gerald moved alongside penny for thought mr geary said cheerfully mr geary turned in moonlight saw that be cry thought have to do with funeral sir said in heavy voice with much le use of devonshire dialect than must have expected from barnstaple woman with funeral be thinking said mr geary looking at water flowing under bridge if must be best for to throw into yon stream why on earth must do asked haskins blankly be then that became conscious that have be drinking for swayed against stonework perhaps be drink made talk more than usual added to absence of husband certainly spoke very freely told much that wished to know why must wish to do sir repeated scornfully because be most miserable woman on god green earth oh surely not mr geary have good home healthy child capital husband again laughed scornfully capital husband when suit oh know what geary be mr haskins soul be a black a face be saying lot wondered why married negro commented haskins leaning over bridge leading to confide in married because be greedy fool sir be housemaid at least general servant under bellaria at pixy house gerald caught breath be where mad girl life according to husband mad be le mad than be sir poor pretty sweet young lady who be kept fast prisoner by major rebb why be kept prisoner ca tell that sir know be that sixteen long year ago be servant there miss mavis liked got on well with bellaria too although have fit of terror at time why ca say often seemed to be scared by very shadow major rebb be away then with regiment in jamaica oh miss mavis lived at pixy house be be kept prisoner there said mr geary whose tongue seemed to be very loose with drink else must scarcely have talked so boldly major rebb came home with geary who have be servant in jamaica geary stopped at pixy house while master went to london fell in love with quarreled with bellaria be like cat dog so when major rebb came down said that if must marry geary must keep old mother out of poorhouse did dislike geary then wanted mother to be comfortable for rest of life agreed

geary with sudden terror for drink be dying out of if do will kill be afraid of death added looking into silver water if be not must end everything in yonder stream wo say word mr geary said haskins soothingly husband will never hear anything from why doe live here to watch pixy house said mr geary to see that miss mavis get away if did learned what must learn major must be able to dash about in

have told more than ought to drink drink geary must kill if knew curse geary curse drink returned slowly to inn striking forehead repeating drink drink drink haskins remained on bridge for few minute then retired to bed not to sleep to think deeply have enough to occupy thought throughout long summer night mr geary a saying go have given show away from remark about motor car gerald felt certain that mr geary have meant loss of money apparently if mavis escaped from pixy house rebb must lose income rightfully belonged to girl of young man must not be sure until have more information must hing still suspicion have certainly proved to be correct negro be rebb creature have be posted in denleigh village to guard pixy house occupant haskins felt that be on track of mystery must not follow up until talked over with person two head be better than one in instance tod macandrew be very shrewd therefore haskins fell asleep with resolution to explain matter to lawyer when went to london meanwhile have to meet mavis in moonlight on ensuing night that thought alone be sufficient to fill mind to exclusion of le romantic matter next morning geary be a suave obedient a usual evidently have found have heard anything to awaken suspicion while visiting pixy house haskins watched closely weighed look inflection of voice in case be satisfied that negro have not slightest idea that guest have stormed enchanted castle when time came for haskins to drive to silbury negro appeared on box of trap hullo said gerald climbing in seeing that portmanteau be right be honor geary oh sah said negro showing splendid teeth ver ' good pusson sah to hab at de devon maid wish to come here again ' tell odder jemplem ob dis place will tell everyone said gerald when trap started will be back soon

about life with major rebb negro appeared to be quite devoted to old master alleging that rebb have saved life when be in danger from what asked gerald idly voodoo said geary scowling lose one eye in voodoo after remark became silent haskins have heard of voodoo of terrible african witchcraft having initiate in company must have liked from literary curiosity to learn more by time trap be entering silbury descending steep high street so geary refused to say anything more loss of eye be evidently sore subject with small wonder that loved rebb if sight of other eye have be saved by military gentleman when geary drove away leaving haskins at prince head that individual thought deeply chapter vii love haskins being genuinely anglo saxon have not plotting instinct of conspirator be therefore somewhat rough ready in arranging for secret meeting with mavis however love sharped wit excused to landlady of prince head for being absent after midnight on plea that have to ride out see old friend in ordinary course of thing there be reason why must explain at to make matter entirely safe must mr geary play spy be just what creature must do haskins thus arranged for explanation after dinner called in mr jennings ordered horse obtaining at same time key of side door so that must admit when returned somewhere about one o'clock in morning then gave order that be to be called in time for early morning train afterwards snatched forty wink in order to prepare thoroughly for fatigue of night owing to excessive heat of weather haskins usually wore loose white flannel from morning until evening on occasion to escape possible watchfulness of bellaria donned dark hued riding dress with brown gaiter tweed cap in guise when shielded by semi gloom of summer night must certainly avoid observation of course chance be that woman tormented by fear must not venture out of house after dark still be best to be on safe side dress a inconspicuously a possible animal supplied by stable of prince head be not exactly derby winner proved to be wary quadruped remarkably old extraordinarily slow having great merit of knowing inch of surrounding country mean qualification considering rider comparative ignorance however gerald have fair idea of five mile route to leegarth in due time horse got over ground although must be admitted that did not hurry haskins reached village shortly after ten o'clock skirted round house so that must not be observed unknown stranger arriving in so secluded hamlet must assuredly awaken suspicion of wary geary news travel fast in country district so gerald kept well out of way after somewhat circuitous route came to bank of mother carey peace pool here fastened horse to trunk of ancient oak with permission to crop lush grass launched faithful canoe shortly be perched for fourth fifth time on top of wall night be perfect romeo juliet night warm still with cloudless sky radiant with ivory moonlight gerald looked down on quaint peaceful quadrangle sleeping in chill whiteness at range of building with fantastic architecture at darkly solemn tree girdled enchanted palace then became aware of slight white clothed figure flitting across shaven lawn like ghost of dead gone beauty musical whisper stole through warm stillness adventurer with fast throbbing heart flung on to bough of copper beech to use a stair for descent in few minute found standing in shadow of tree clasping cool slender hand looking into two wonderful eye flashed like star overhead oh be not in white prince said mavis disappointed gerald explained thought best to wear dark clothes since bellaria might be on watch there be chance of be fast asleep must not leave bed unless house went on fire then again went on gerald pressing hand have

schoolchildren out on frolic then come cried loosening grip must catch catch prince like arrow from bow shot across turf towards archway followed rapidly by lover haskins be swift of foot mavis ran

disraeli dictum have be cultivated to excess then nature have be allowed to decivilize result be charming wonderfully artistic there be bed of brilliant flower wherein slim sapling grew at will statue of god goddess wreathed in greenery pond of placid water rimmed with stone wherein white lily slept on broad leaf floating amidst slender reed faade of house with tudor battlement long range of latticed window rose picturesquely in still calm light of moon rendered thing ethereal fairylike before mansion stretched willow terrace of gray stone diapered with lichen emerald moss wide flight of step descended from to meet broad path melted imperceptibly into jungle of tall bush wiry grass around tree sprang like sentinel to guard magic domain from prose of outside world everything be bathed in luminous white radiance in colorless world mavis flitted here there like moth of snow be too lovely for mere word murmured gerald gazing at beauty with poetical feeling uppermost be speaking of

meaning of hour low low note from tree top must send floating across grass pause must bring to statue stillness dying sigh a wind lost heart stirred limb to gentle movement like trembling of flower on stalk poised gracefully in radiant light in white garb with mystical gesture timed to nature sound looked like spirit of wood gerald faintly grasped for one fleeting moment idea of sacred dance of old when gesture pose be sign of power to draw down hierarchy of heaven to physical plane then wind died away golden note of nightingale fluted through tree one bird trilled wild music replied with scattering of liquid note like falling rain marvelous enchantment of night be in speechless song young man heart beat in measure with pulse of nature rose abruptly to foot when mavis floated within circle of arm went round passionately like tamed bird rested on heaving breast looked up smilingly into brown eye mavis read therein that wind nightingale have be trying to tell when man lip be

of trouble in order to arrive at conclusion be necessary to make inquiry a to why rebb kept girl in pixy house when be known step might be taken to release when be released must be presented to world a mr gerald haskins to make inquiry be necessary that must go to london consult tod who be sharp enough in professional matter visit to london meant seven day separation from mavis think that major

evasively when return will know what be necessary in meantime own brave girl must hold fast secret not allow bellaria to guess that have even met much le that be engaged mavis stood up slim strong

repaired to grimy office in chancery lane to consult solicitor mr james ian robert roy macandrew be lawyer gorgeous name usually shortened to tod by friend because of ruddy hair possessed two room sparsely furnished outer room contained two lean clerk office boy who labored to increase gradually growing business while inner room be sacred to master brain be building up same business there be green painted important looking escritoire with sliding lid three four chair battered bookcase containing tod somewhat limited library pile of japaned deed box in iron frame everything looked very legal very dry very dusty with exception of tod spick span far too fashionably dressed for chancery lane tod must have be strolling in row if dead gone macandrews have not squandered money probably must have be beside charity bird if possible a be tod looking fresh well fed well groomed alert dwelt for many hour daily in dull room ancestor must have scorned tod have be compelled to lay down ancestral claymore take up pen be hard on tod who much preferred kilt to lawyer wig however be useless to be dignified with jerry haskins a tod decided so after glance at door to see that be closed unbent lighted cigarette produced bottle of whisky two glass syphon not wishing that clerk must see unbend to bacchanalian extent mr macandrew cast second look at door advised gerald in scarcely legal language to fire away have be playing high kick oh houp la since left said tod with jolly grin have be doing nothing of sort cried haskins indignantly be very serious be now bantered lawyer well when man decides to marry girl whom have only seen for five minute rather think be infernally serious how did manage to hook what beastly low mind have tod h be shut up hold tight be going to startle startle away tod gripped arm of sedate chair well then mavis durham be living image of charity bird macandrew stared glared be rotting boy there can only be one angel in world there be two of especial make insisted gerald leaning back say toddy do be serious be serious be confound look macandrew stared glared again there be change in admitted love suppose be same with tod know what love be oh hang beastly conceit well then just do love heavenly charity end so there be pulling leg when say that charity be image of mavis girl call mavis girl miss durham to tod very well then miss bird to haskins sighed resignedly will never get on at rate be really truly in trouble macandrew do listen tod nodded face grew serious haskins seized fortunate moment detailed everything from finding of sealed message be scarcely necessary since tod have hooked cylinder to parting with mavis on enchanted night what do think of toddy questioned haskins anxiously be very rum murmured tod making pencil mark on blotting paper why doe rebb keep girl shut up be what wish to learn must help be only too glad how remember how mr geary said that if mavis left pixy house major must not be able to dash about in motor car yes what of hint at money belonging to mavis major be using oh say tod fell back in chair go too far hold brief for rebb must be such blackguard a besides have six thousand year know that for fact who told mr berch what mr crosby mother yes grim old lady ai rather like grandmother be not very fond of rebb a be not very polite to still want mr crosbie to marry because of money how found out ca say certainly stated that rebb have income mentioned thought that mr berch daughter be well off assume to be answered tod with shrug wink be have slap up flat go everywhere mr crosbie wear expensive frock although old woman look like rag shop at time may not be lack of money indifference to dress humph a if woman old young must be indifferent to frock anyhow mr crosbie be supposed to be wealthy widow in market if want to marry major rebb who be not nice man if mr berch want to be rebb mother in law strike that two may not be so rich a pretend well well well cried gerald impatiently be wandering from subject rebb say have six thousand year on authority of mr crosbie mother yes well then tod want to know how rebb come to be possessed of six thousand year can find out well might ask income tax people ca help thinking said haskins staring at dusty carpet that money belongs to mavis if think that on few word let slip by mr geary said tod scornfully have got leg to stand on go by intuition also toddy rarely deceive witness distrust of geary be right in thinking that have to do with rebb pixy house macandrew nodded yes be right so far assume too much in accusing major rebb of taking miss durham money be only guess said gerald impatiently may be wrong of course tod still must see that there be something queer in rebb keeping mavis shut up in putting about rumor of being affected with homicidal mania be sure be true ventured macandrew cautiously haskins grew wrathful good heaven toddy do take for as silly blighter tell girl be a sane a be deal more sane than be then why doe rebb shut up want to find out tell snapped other savagely tod reflected perhaps girl be rebb daughter guessed haskins started a well might ca believe that declared violently have drop of rebb blood in body even if be daughter went on in contradictory fashion be reason that must shut in gaol set beastly nigger to keep eye on n o drawled macandrew eye on blotting paper say that girl be like charity very image of be partly why fell in love so rapidly tod before came along did love charity in way admired beauty somehow never made heart beat now mavis be just a lovely a charity more so no growled tod striking desk yes yes yes insisted haskins besides there be something in personality charity lack feel heart beat pulse thrill whole being raised to heaven when mavis look at so do when look at charity retorted lawyer for heaven sake jerry let pit girl against one mavis suit charity suit there be more to be said save that girl might be twin never heard that charity have twin did then know charity history do in part said tod quickly when mr pelham odin be traveling with own comedy company in india fifteen sixteen year ago found charity at calcutta child be then five year of age belonged to native woman of juggler caste native do mean to say charity have nigger blood snapped tod sharply have only to look at to see that be purely european native woman confessed to mr pelham odin that have picked up child from ayah at simla for few rupee ayah have perhaps stolen child from english people perhaps mother be dead at rate native woman bought child taught to dance in show husband went round with mr pelham odin took fancy to child beauty bought from native woman adopted a daughter in way called charity because of way in be found bird because of silvery voice have gerald started point of resemblance mavis have voice like nightingale tod must learn mavis past life two girl must be connected in way resemblance be too wonderful there be chance likeness hinted tod slowly daresay nature doe turn out two girl line for line same unless sends into world a twin mavis be brought to pixy house when be five year of age doe remember where lived before be twenty one in ten month by jupiter tod hoisted up with curious look be odd for charity told that must be twenty one next year then must run away with perhaps there be something in what say jerry after what be to be done haskins pinched chin let leave question of resemblance alone for moment tod what want to do be to go to somerset house look up will will whose will what will look up will made by anyone called durham go back fifteen twenty year of course said gerald apologetically be only fancy based upon few word let drop by mr geary feel somehow in bone a old woman say that mavis be being kept prisoner on account of money tod fidgeted be such wild idea protested wild not be six eightpence in greedy legal pocket rebb might not like prying into private affair see that rebb need know anything about said gerald impatiently in fact want to keep doings dark in rebb direction for if there be anything in belief major will do best to queer pitch if look up will of man of woman called durham rebb can not say anything a be supposed to know anything about pixy house business well tod nodded made note will search assented will by someone called durham man woman dated fifteen twenty year ago suppose find nothing suppose do retorted friend rising be searching for needle in haystack remember toddy must poke about in direction will look into money business first then can question mr pelham odin bellaria a to possibility of there being relationship between two girl see here remarked macandrew slowly talk be first rate if be writing story knew end seems to that a have to deal with real life be making circumstance to fit in with theory perhaps be replied haskins with shrug be so much in love with mavis that will move heaven earth to get why not be bold ask rebb straight out then must tell story of girl birth perhaps may explain why be so like charity if rebb dislike mavis so much that shuts up wo mind taking off hand oh will if money go with said gerald grimly want to make rebb think that be in love whole business be shady do mean love making asked tod slyly rotter love making be a straight a rebb way be crooked do what say when learn if there be will well will know how to move next meanwhile intend to tell story have told to mr crosbie say will go straight tell rebb said haskins decisively have known mr crosbie for year be a honest good little woman a ever lived mr berch be also ripping sort if somewhat funereal if major rebb be villain really believe that be want mr crosbie life to be made miserable by marrying mr berch know how adores daughter same mr crosbie may tell rebb insisted tod macandrew think so will enlist sympathy on behalf woman love love affair then story will put on guard against major rebb will probably contrive to find out truth of business without knowing good day toddy boy haskins shot out of office rapidly macandrew sat soberly at desk shaking red poll appeared to that gerald be about to climb hill difficulty might not reach top chapter ix mr crosbie same afternoon when mr haskins be arraying in bond street kit to call on fascinating widow be seized with sudden qualm a to wisdom of intention after a tod very truly observed mr crosbie be supposed to be engaged to major rebb although official announcement have appeared in morning post if then related secret be connected with pixy house with pretty girl mr crosbie inspired by jealousy might forthwith demand explanation from rebb in case vulgarly speaking fat must be on fire there must be fine blaze on other hand gerald wished to enlist mr crosbie on side for two reason firstly have be close friend of mother to whom have be tenderly attached a boy have flirted with in calf love stage now be what tod must call pal gerald usually took trouble to for be wise little woman of course there be nasty people who called mr crosbie adventuress who said that have nagged late husband to death be in minority so far a haskins must read character prided thereon mr crosbie be good woman who certainly ought not to marry rascal like rebb that major be rascal gerald believed perhaps on insufficient premise for after there might be honest explanation of pixy house mystery in second place haskins wished to remove mavis from prison a time must necessarily have to elapse before must marry desired to place under wing of mr crosbie since widow be connected with rebb seemed rather like putting mavis into lion cage mr crosbie be sole woman of haskins acquaintance of whom must ask favor of chaperoning young girl also once mavis be at flat practically beyond rebb reach since then must not hide again there must be necessity for further concealment major must have to account to mr crosbie for detention of ward in devonshire explanation must have to precede marriage of mr crosbie to rebb must then be detailed to haskins thing must be made straight of course there be always chance that might be too crooked to be straightened if so be more necessary that mavis must be placed in mr crosbie guardianship that little woman eye must be opened bearing thing in mind haskins descended into street to call hansom proceeded to visit mr crosbie dwelt along with mother in palatial block of mansion known a ladysmith court have be erected by financier of south african fame mansion be situated near marylebone road although address be not ultra fashionable rent be high when gerald paid cab at foot of marble step surveyed huge pile of redbrick building reflected that tod must be wrong about widow financial position only rich woman must afford to live here there must be money grubbing idea in connection with rebb marriage even though major have six thousand year nevertheless be strange that mr crosbie must marry rebb when be so much disliked by mr berch of whom daughter be extraordinarily fond mr crosbie flat be on second floor gerald be shown into small smart drawing room by neat maid servant be true woman room luxuriously furnished prettily decorated filled with manner of useless knick knack fancy china silver framed photograph japanese drapery finally with mass of flower in many hued vas scent of blossom perfume of burning pastille made atmosphere fragrant somewhat heavy in spite of rose curtained french window opened on to tiny balcony near one of window mr crosbie be seated looking somewhat pale disturbed facing be overdressed man with white hair moustache who looked like foreigner how be gerald asked mr crosbie when haskins be announced addressing by christian name according to custom have not seen for age shook hand looked at how brown be dear boy allow to introduce two men signor venosta mr haskins mr haskins signor venosta who have be amusing do sit down tea will be in presently ala madam must depart said signor venosta who be stout oily looking italian of tenor type dressed in too gaudy style to satisfy gerald fastidious taste have be with one hour must add that have seemed like one minute said mr crosbie with pretty little laugh waving fan for heat be stifling well if must go must rose walked with visitor to door glancing over shoulder meanwhile excuse gerald will return soon left room with italian marked courtesy be not usual with mr crosbie a be spoilt beauty who preferred that others must wait on rather than that must trouble about others haskins wondered at self denial especially in face of such heat wondered also that must look so pale worried apparently something be wrong with mr crosbie began to conjecture whether tod be correct a to money matter gerald be not over rich determined to question mother friend learn if possible what bothered so that must proffer help hostess returned after minute looked quite renewed color might have be due to reflection of rose hued curtain tripped across olive green carpet like fairy resembled one being delicate tiny beautifully formed people said that mr crosbie blonde hair pink white complexion be due to art since woman of forty must not possibly look so young without artificial aid be a may certainly appeared wonderfully pretty in white silk tea gown be draped with expensive lace haskins complimented on look when sank again into chair took up cigarette case lying on table at elbow yet know added gerald thoughtfully fancied that looked worried pale when came mr crosbie lighted cigarette shot keen glance at have worry dear boy said blowing wreath of smoke must not have mr crosbie if there be anything can put right know that yes yes know interrupted hurriedly ca really be nothing oh nothing at be heat make look pale washed out mother be lying down quite exhausted will be in to tea hope one else will come gerald then can have nice long talk be what have come to have said soberly produced own cigarette case laid on table give match please thank lighted up be in trouble have come to a usual yes hope that carry coal to newcastle mr crosbie shrugged trouble be only minor one such a come to woman when get past youth be in flower of have known for year gerald certainly must have irish blood in to pay such extravagant compliment think too well of dear boy have fault why not look at upbringing have have ended bitterly why mother be that mother can must be interrupted little woman know that gerald husband father be brute husband whom made marry in teen be brute mother have suffered poverty nearly open shame poverty gerald glanced round luxurious room crowded with such splendid thing mr crosbie shrugged again be only necessity said contemptuously fancy woman of taste having to live in flat being bothered by tradespeople want town house country house yacht chance of traveling over europe like other rich people in fact want thousand year have not got gerald looked down meditatively so tod be right after mr crosbie be hard up even to extent of being dunned by tradespeople wondered if must help have known long enough to accept check stammered whiffed away offer contemptuously although thank very much for offering money said graciously always be dear boy amount of money want must ruin since be aware that have five hundred year left by dear mother there there tapped with closed fan wo talk further of disagreeable thing will be well when marry major rebb asked haskins pointedly why not major be not bad looking have good position at least five thousand year six believe corrected gerald who told that tod macandrew heard from mother mr crosbie nodded yes believe that mother asked mr macandrew question regarding settlement on chance must marry major rebb mr macandrew must not have spoken about did not said gerald hastily can still trust macandrew a legal adviser have not betrayed confidence regarding settlement merely mentioned major rebb income how did come to be talking of major rebb gerald flung fag end of cigarette into silver ashtray rose to pace room must always talk better when in motion want to help madge remarked must call madge said mr crosbie with look at door major rebb must not like then be engaged well yes want money be quite sure that rebb have money mr crosbie started to foot crossing room gripped young man by arm face be perfectly pale voice sounded uncommonly hoarse what do mean mean anything said gerald astonished by emotion rebb be doubt a wealthy a king solomon only meant that must make sure of settlement a friend must say nothing else mr crosbie be not satisfied have heard rumor to effect that major rebb be poor be likely to lose money said haskins in perfect good faith do sit down compose if anything be wrong in way must speak out must say nothing else a of course idea regarding possible will money having be taken from mavis be mere theory mr crosbie looked at piercingly after scrutiny returned to seat apparently counted upon marriage releasing from terrible trouble dreaded lest must fall through wish must not frighten said querulously nerve be not strong mother be going away to bognor next week for change need one very badly well selected cigarette became more bright self knew so well so wish to help yes wish to keep what say to promise looked at hard be very mysterious be very much in earnest rejoined dryly mr crosbie shuffled ca promise until know what be going to say observed irritably nerve a have said be certainly very bad there be something in replied haskins felt inclined to withdraw without telling story after reflection compromised at event must hold tongue about secret for at least month by naming time hoped to deliver mavis from imprisonment within three week promise said mr crosbie curiously know secret be in love gerald be startled how must tell that demanded astonished laughed be woman observant a well a intuitive look at eye in yonder mirror at expression of face at whole bearing h be said haskins half satisfied one be not so clever a be madge call madge tell yes will when be alone hang have known for year besides wish to do service have promise to hold tongue for month yes yes yes go on go on be ear story concern major rebb what then did mean something when mentioned last meant nothing will stop marriage said gerald crossly although know why nice woman like madge must marry mr crosbie stared major rebb be supposed to be delightful man may be to who know believe that be jealous said with nervous laugh well how doe secret affect major see here madge may think mean speaking about rebb to behind back be doing so at risk because wish to help one in whom be interested otherwise be quite ready to see rebb personally have out with later on say in three week more le will for then hope that mavis will be with here quite safe mavis ah girl be in love with what be to major rebb may ask mr crosbie voice rose when put question eye grew a hard a jade while face colored deep red ah said haskins surprised then love rebb be rich see what right have to ask such question go on what have to say if love rebb ca speak love rebb go on will keep promise gerald hesitated longer rising to foot again began to pace room related same story a have told tod only in especial instance suppressed theory regarding will money mr crosbie listened quietly with expression of dismay made remark until have finished be telling fairy tale said quietly yes be cried gerald delighted with quietness mean that be untrue swear be mavis be kept in pixy house found by mean of sealed message a have described now want to get up here look after until can marry who will bring here will within three four week ah said mr crosbie quietly now see why asked to hold tongue for month gerald be wrong to act in way a have made promise will keep will be better for to release from promise then must ask major rebb about ward persuade to let have up here in case when marry major rebb will have to do with girl love what suggest madge must certainly be better may say more straightforward hate acting in way behind rebb back intend later to speak plainly to face forget how rebb have put about mavis be homicidal maniac be untrue ca be sure of gerald have not seen sufficient of to judge to take girl reputed mad from seclusion must be very wicked crime might commit must be laid at door surely madge action of major rebb be not that may have probably have good ground for shutting up girl gerald bit lip beginning to see that with caution have made dire mistake then wo help said mr crosbie firmly how can expect to help against major rebb when be engaged to be married how can ask to take charge of girl who be mad be not mad tell tell that be mad otherwise major rebb certainly must not shut up what reason must have to shut up sane girl be on point of haskins tongue to explain theory having made one mistake a plainly saw from mr crosbie attitude did not wish to make will keep promise of silence urged earnestly yes on condition that make attempt to run away with girl from madhouse speak in own interest will get into trouble if take insane woman from lawful guardian seem to be quite certain that mavis be mad said gerald bitterly however a know secret be at mercy promise think that be very ungrateful cried mr crosbie many woman must have declined to keep what call secret at have made mistake confessed gerald must have kicked that man of world must be such fool well said mr crosbie a door opened to admit servant with afternoon tea let say more about promise to hold tongue for month promise to leave girl alone meanwhile gerald waited until tea tray be arranged girl have departed no said decisively have be wrong have shown duty will call on major rebb to morrow explain can not replied mr crosbie major be in devonshire announcement complicated matter then follow rebb to devonshire said gerald doggedly mistake must be put right chapter x amulet be admitted man a whole be not infallible individual man have secret belief that be haskins be more complacent than other mortal in fact so yet have idea that caution common sense invariably prevented making mistake assuredly a rule be rarely in error to rule there be exception haskins ill judged frankness to mr crosbie be exception in case said much for gerald sane view of life that recognized mistake at once at cost of unpleasantness hastened to correct entailed interview with major rebb be likely to be stormy one at outset gerald believed that have read mr crosbie character wrong that even after year of close companionship since have be so intimate with mother knew very little about have really be that believed to be must thought immediately on leaving ladysmith court have readily helped in somewhat eccentric wooing on calmer reflection arrived at conclusion that be in error first mistake lay in overlooking relationship existing between rebb widow being engaged to a have admitted certainly must not be expected to act against what believed to be interest second mistake consisted in hoping that mr crosbie who in many way be particularly conventional must take charge of girl believed to be insane be only natural that mr crosbie must believe mavis to be mad a being willing to accept major a second husband must scarcely credit with conspiracy if mavis be not insane detention in pixy house be certainly conspiracy against right a human being gerald took view from personal observation because mistrusted rebb mr crosbie a engaged to marry major must not be expected to endorse theory must render rebb unworthy of hand indeed of acquaintance may be here mentioned that haskins have not mentioned wonderful likeness existed between charity mavis since thought have flashed across while speaking that statement might implicate tod in mysterious business be not to be thought of mr crosbie practically knew be that gerald loved reputedly insane ward of promised husband desired to side against promised husband so that might marry girl be impossible to expect that woman must act in way gerald acknowledged to that mr crosbie have behaved in perfectly reasonable manner in refusing to help in fact have behaved extremely well in holding to promise of one month secrecy for many woman must have told rebb there then what have be said about therefore mr crosbie be not only right gerald felt that be entirely in wrong felt indeed that have acted somewhat shabbily sole way in must right matter recover self respect be to see rebb a soon a possible explain then a man to man must thresh matter out with idea haskins drove back to room in frederick street mayfair intending to change pack catch midnight train from paddington to exeter while dressing reflected that must be better to first assure that mr crosbie be correct in stating major whereabouts rebb room be also in frederick street only few door away so must be just a well to run in to make inquiry rebb might return on morrow in case must hardly be worth while to journey to denleigh so hurriedly also mr crosbie having promised to hold tongue for one month there be necessity to act at once since two three even more day must make very little difference finally gerald be unwilling to return to pixy house to mavis until knew if theory regarding possible will be correct otherwise must have nothing to tell while meditating on desirability of calling at rebb room gerald desired to smoke to aid thought after manner of men mechanically took cigarette case found difficulty in opening a case be usually easy to open looked down with awakened attention to see what be matter found that have brought away mr crosbie cigarette case by mistake probably have laid own case on small table alongside hers in fact

upon mr crosbie widow have broken promise if be case rebb have be placed on guard so not only avoided haskins have gone back to pixy house to make arrangement for thwarting young man curiosity gerald therefore paid visit to ladysmith court only to learn that widow mother have departed for bognor on month holiday be thus apparent that in two quarter gerald must hing for moment indeed more haskins

from old actress sufficient of adopted daughter past to give clue to intrigue of major rebb will be seen that gerald have not proceeded to inquire into mystery of coral hand bellaria fear of same must have learned somewhat about matter of trinket by seeing signor venosta who according to mr berch have given amulet to widow gerald did not know where venosta lived must not make inquiry from mr crosbie without wanting to know reason moreover desired to solve mystery of mavis of detention before searching into bellaria past certainly have shrewd idea that mavis detention bellaria dread major rebb behavior mr crosbie possession of coral hand be of piece be like separate part of puzzle must not fit together there be nothing for to see if must find clue into labyrinth when visiting mr pelham

began to walk up down a be accustomed to do when much excited then be to understand that if marry mavis major rebb loses six thousand year exactly reverts to original five six hundred apparently possessed before getting brother officer to make preposterous will in favor a practically be haskins stopped brother officer yes durham be in goorkha regiment so be rebb later daresay rebb exchanged to west indie always heard that came from place yes jamaica said haskins mechanically thinking of geary so be why rebb have shut up girl put about rumor that be crazy plotting beast be nodded

quartered can punish more by depriving of income oh will do so far a be personally concerned care two straw for income oh come now human nature go by human nature interrupted haskins sharply go by own feeling must marry mavis without one penny since five hundred year what make by writing be enough to keep thing going rebb must be punished will do can to deprive of six thousand year there be necessity to bother said tod soothingly thing act automatically a might say when mavis becomes wife money be paid over rather income be transferred to on wedding day sole chance that rebb have of keeping money be to prevent marriage oh will do best to do said gerald with frown will tell tod man wo stop short of murder oh must yes must mavis be under impression that girl be brought up in conventual seclusion be not allowed to see young men rebb for obvious reason told so understands that be to be taken into world when be one twenty twenty first birthday be only ten month distant nine month in fact when time arrives will want to come out if rebb let out will probably be asked in marriage then must murder finished macandrew not at rebb be too clever man to place precious neck in

dryly rebb have six thousand year at command besides even if must find doctor to swear to insanity mere rumor of such thing must prevent man from marrying be not so certain of said gerald grimly a said just now much can be done with money however rebb wo have chance of working out rascally plot whether mean murder not will go to devonshire interview how do know that be there questioned tod quickly question recalled haskins to sense of folly in trusting widow with secret have made fool of macandrew remarked soberly resumed seat be belief that mr crosbie have put rebb on guard rebb have

departed for devonshire by eleven fifty morning train from paddington with great sense of exultation necessity of immediate action appealed to active brain to craving for romance that there be more than spice of danger in adventure to be committed added to enjoyment notwithstanding repudiation of tod suggestion that murder might be end of thing took precaution of carrying revolver after major rebb be being driven into highly unpleasant corner from what gerald knew of be not kind of man to submit tamely to being beaten must readily surrender six thousand year have enjoyed luxury of life too long to be content with mere necessity be only human nature however haskins determined to beard lion in den for moment be geary village inn gerald decided to remain at prince head silbury since negro by rebb order might make highly disagreeable must young man live under sinister roof of devon maid haskins be not easily intimidated even though major underling joined force to thwart felt quite equal to dealing with collectively separately right be on side gerald have implicit belief that good be stronger than evil who fought in cause for geary rebb be fighting must not possibly triumph be after

received shock have idea that rumor of mavis insanity have spread so far a silbury mr jennings seemed to know about oh yes sir know remarked earnestly miss bellaria be set to watch that poor girl mavis durham who be quite mad who say that be mad asked gerald heatedly everyone replied landlady vaguely why major told that be always wanting to kill people be why be shut up watched by miss bellaria must never do sir for lunatic like to come out why might all be murdered in bed be on tip of haskins tongue to deny insanity of mavis for mr jennings vouched so staunchly to do so must have led to admission of secret visit to pixy house until settled with rebb did not wish to be known therefore contented with question have ever seen miss durham lord sir have anyone else miss bellaria keep safely within ground of tumbledown house good thing too say doe house belong to major rebb sir to poor girl see sir durham be great family hereabouts for year died out save one who went soldiering to india be shot in lung month after marriage at simla to english lady came home to die lingered year died at brighton wife oh died in bombay when starting for england long before captain durham be shot that poor girl at pixy house be born when mother died so major rebb who be brother officer of captain durham took charge of have miss durham money ca tell that sir what say be only what have heard from time to time believe that have old house of durham enough money to keep major rebb be good kind gentleman to take such trouble over poor thing many gentleman must have shut up in lunatic asylum haskins smiled once more very significantly quite believed that if rebb must have shut up mavis a lunatic must have done so long ago in first place must be difficult to get two doctor to certify to insanity in second if case became known use of girl money by rebb might be questioned major have just made sufficient of story public to save from awkward question gerald foresaw to extricate mavis from false position be more difficult task than have reckoned upon however notwithstanding that thing looked thus black held to determination of having explanation with major rebb a evening be pleasant walked to denleigh at leisure there be more chance of catching major at hour since be probable that must always return to devon maid for dinner a be starting mr jennings came up to at door if see major rebb sir said in low voice might tell that mr arnold have come back who be asked gerald forgetting what mavis have said small clever gentleman with long beard who looked after poor girl for time went away to foreign port month ago returned to neighborhood during last two three day have seen mr arnold ended mr jennings others have seen want major to know why asked haskins looking at keenly mr arnold behaved very badly to major rebb explained landlady went away without giving notice major rebb want to see ask why left in lurch a might say will tell said haskins nodding where be mr arnold now ca say sir save that be in neighborhood haskins walked away pondering over what have be said then remembered how mavis have called dwarf arnold by name of schaibar said that have gone to australia apparently have acted a kind of companion to mavis possibly a tutor although have not be allowed by rebb to teach pupil reading writing occurred to gerald that scholar be friendly to mavis in case certainly must be hostile to guardian a must not fail to know from personal observation that girl be perfectly sane be illegally detained young man felt very certain that rebb wished to see mr arnold not to ask question a to reason for sudden departure month back to bribe into silence regarding truth will hunt up arnold thought gerald a mounted rising road to denleigh may be able to help mavis heaven know that will need help friendship that can obtain evening be warm luminous intensely still haskins did not hurry sauntered through lovely country enjoying beauty in spite of anxious state of mind in depth of heart felt that everything must come right in end that must day be able to make mavis dear wife must then live happily ever afterwards just like fairy tale still in fairy tale lover always have to undergo much woe sorrow danger before end be reached fantasy of real life a gerald believed be to proceed much on same line dragon have to be overcome magician thwarted enchanted castle have to be stormed when task laid upon fated prince be accomplished must awaken princess to everyday life with kiss fairy must come to nuptials young man thought allegorically there be bitter truth enshrined in symbol fairy tale be only fanciful picture of life mystery pain must be undergone before pleasure can be gained geary be absent when traveler arrived at devon maid haskins be not sorry to hear from mr geary who received negro having learned from rebb bellaria that castle have guarded be discovered must not be in best of humor must probably make disagreeable not that gerald have fear of man wished for explanation with rebb before open quarrel took place major a civilized being must certainly be more reasonable than negro be major rebb in questioned gerald when mr geary have told of husband absence did not say where be a apparently did not know geary be not man to permit question yes sir be having dinner in old room be sorry ca have room mr haskins major yes yes understand said haskins impatiently take card to major rebb say have come down from london to see mr geary did in stolid way shortly returned to usher haskins into well remembered sitting room here be received somewhat stiffly by man have come to see landlady retired closing door carefully after rebb looked thinner more erect more reserved than ever with silent bow pointed to seat waited to hear what gerald have to say considering two men have already met frequently reception be frigid rebb apparently wished to make haskins a uncomfortable a possible so that might get better of if such be object failed to attain for gerald anticipating demeanor be quite cheerful very observant major having finished meal lighted cigar did not offer one to haskins be sign of war gerald accepted a such be surprised to see remarked keeping eye on rebb dark high bred face not exactly answered other coolly man told that wished to see in london of course found card when returned regret must not see then have to come back here on business to see elderly relative doubt bellaria dondi precisely well why fence in way rebb asked young man have heard from bellaria yes interrupted major leaning forward gripping arm of chair with angry expression on face bellaria have told of secret visit to pixy house must say that have behaved very badly haskins be not kind of thing expected from really gerald raised eyebrow have not be intimate that must expect to consider feeling since future wife be mother friend be yours said rebb with dignity be quite willing to admit to certain degree of intimacy now case be altered because love ward because went by stealth to see if have come to must have explained unhappy condition be quite certain that must retorted gerald looking straight at enemy a be convinced major be be there need of explanation everyone hereabouts declares that miss durham be insane not responsible for action flash of pleasure came went in rebb dark eye for moment then looked hypocritically sad poor girl be only too true agree with there said haskins quietly indeed on what ground have have several interview with mavis be quite certain that be a sane a if so why must shut up ask own conscience rebb struck hand fiercely on table go too far haskins in saying that be not forced to account for action to may not think so said gerald feeling that be coming to close quarter do love mavis wish to marry be out of question why be a declare insane if married must probably murder in sleep be willing to take risk said haskins with contemptuous smile saw that rebb be trying to make best of position be not willing that must retorted major ah decision lie with mr crosbie rebb looked furious what have mr crosbie to do with matter have not told told what have heard nothing from mr crosbie gerald privately apologized to for having doubted little woman determined to have further misunderstanding spoke out saw mr crosbie when be in london asked to help to marry not even for mr crosbie sake can consent to marriage of kind must be sin how dare tell private affair to future wife rebb again struck table gently major gently be not to be intimidated asked mr crosbie to help a be mother old friend have known much longer than have refused to help ah cried rebb gratified knew that loved agreed to keep what have told secret from for at least month on condition that took step meanwhile to run away with mavis from what say understand that have kept promise have done injustice fancied from sudden departure to place that have told mr crosbie have told nothing said rebb coldly came down here because heard that bellaria have be up to see also have line from geary saying that something be wrong came down at once be informed that have be spying out private affair call hard name major said gerald coolly admit be wrong to speak to mr crosbie seeing that be engaged to be putting that right by coming here for explanation absolve mr crosbie from promise be not wrong in obeying invitation of sealed message young man in position must have done same ah cylinder cried rebb angrily bellaria told of a mavis confessed to what have done who must have thought that girl must have communicated with world in way why must not communicate with world asked gerald sharply rebb saw that in hurry have made mistake tried to get out of why because be crazy for reason have not be taught to read write exactly doctor said that if be educated if brain be subjected to strain homicidal mania must be intensified out of sheer pity for unfortunate girl have have kept in ignorance see said haskins thinking that excuse be extremely skilful then mr arnold taught nothing rebb started cigar fell from finger turned pale mention of name evidently worried not little do know of mr arnold demanded only that be be mavis ' tutor in sort of odd way that reminds mr jennings of prince head gave message for major mr arnold say have returned from australia be in neighborhood stale news haskins said rebb recovering wit geary found out at least week ago arnold be traveling round country in kind of gipsy caravan selling book be about arnold that geary wrote to came down to see into matter a arnold be rascal also learned on arrival from bellaria that have be taking interest in affair sneered in affair of woman hope to make wife said gerald imperturbably rebb rose stiffly mr haskins said in most ceremonious manner have come to in first place without acting in underhand manner must have told that marriage be impossible tell so now beg to end interview gerald rose also a please major rebb after paused at door six thousand year be worth fighting for rebb gasped again turned pale fell back into chair chapter xiv unexpected happens do still wish to go inquired gerald politely half opening sitting room door cried rebb sharply shut that door again explain haskins returned to seat doe what say need explanation certainly insinuate that income have to do with mavis place matter in nutshell major have rebb rose again with look of man at bay dare to dare anything in cause of mavis interrupted gerald imperiously make mistake about attitude major rebb if act honestly be here a friend if declare war be willing to accept challenge if look must have slain bold speaker haskins must have dropped dead where stood bore rebb fierce gaze without flinching waited for to speak major made gigantic effort gained control of sufficiently to open mouth for quiet question where did learn demanded from will of captain julian durham at somerset house indeed more spying sneered other lip quivered haskins shrugged shoulder took scarcely notice of insult be weak speech to make remarked rebb passed handkerchief across pale lip who told about will asked quietly be more intuition than anything else said haskins anxious to shield mr geary whose chance word have put on track saw that mavis be sane that be shutting up for reason money be reason suggested searched in somerset house not personally macandrew did that a lawyer great heaven stormed rebb growing darkly red be macandrew in affair also will tell mr haskins how many people have succeeded in interesting in private business only tod know about matter so far refer to will of course others may come to know of unless ah said rebb quickly now be coming to gist of matter mr haskins unless what unless give mavis proper position in world consent to marriage with suppose haskins bowed save trouble of explanation there be explanation to be made said rebb trying to appear calm one in justice to must make will pardon interrupted gerald coolly mr jennings know about ward alleged insanity true insanity cried rebb warmly everyone in denleigh silbury leegarth know about poor girl that be watched by bellaria dondi useful elderly relative just so doe neighborhood know about julian durham will anyone who go to somerset house can learn what wish a have done retorted major be not bound to make private affair public down here apparently be trying to do best to provide gossip for neighborhood well yes mean to get mavis out of pixy house rebb jumped up banged on table furiously defy yes defy almost shouted will not get out of house be well treated one moment never said that be not well treated said gerald swiftly badly a be behaving presume conscience doe not allow to ill treat mavis seeing that be enjoying fortune take care take care may strike by mean will give chance to take into court for assault make matter of pixy house public ah rebb looked scathingly at bold speaker be afraid oh if strike will probably give good thrashing to mind richly deserve in ordinary case must thrash let go desire be to force into taking up public position of defence be quite willing to do so said rebb violently can employ macandrew lawyer like will be in favor have carried out provision pardon be just what have not done mavis by will be to be educated can neither read write doctor said produce doctor who said that brain must not understand must not bear teaching be use major may say about mavis to suit own end be well aware that be perfectly sane that be keeping shut up in pixy house to enjoy money dare dare dare now will dare in open court retorted young man wonder kill muttered rebb in impotent fury in first place ca in second if did must only be tried for murder instead of conspiracy conspiracy conspiracy damn yes against liberty of subject rebb have proved to be brave man in several south african engagement so be not fear that prevented from falling upon man who thus defied meddled with most private affair with fury must scarcely articulate for rage be sufficiently master of to know to strike haskins must only force into open court rebb have wish that will of durham guardianship of mavis must be topic of conversation with friend appear in print for delectation of public therefore kept hand down by side subdued wrath a best must effort nearly choked have said that can say mr haskins growled in guttural voice filled with menace so can go certainly rejoined gerald again attitude stand by will of brother officer said rebb with suppressed fury enjoy durham property until mavis marries be not fit to marry being insane therefore will enjoy durham property until end of life yes said rebb determinedly do hold to mavis have want be happy where be because have filled mind with lying tale of english girl being brought up in seclusion a be being brought up on mavis ' twenty first birthday rebb when hope to come out into world what then how will restrain will be happy then be not bound to tell of plan regarding ward said major stiffly on twenty first birthday will know how to act good night said gerald abruptly made for door stop cried rebb imperatively what about attitude haskins wheeled at door love mavis intend to make wife be attitude see sneered major be after money insult be too contemptible to be noticed think what like major only remember one thing if harm mavis in way transfer to hiding place will hold accountable in what way questioned other contemptuously will find relative of mavis get to contest will will bring everything out very probably have relative julian durham be last of race so since wife be dead left child for to look after have relative must not have be appointed guardian stand by will good night gerald hesitated wondered whether must say anything more on second thought decided to hold peace abruptly left room after there be more to be arranged knew attitude rebb have taken up rebb knew attitude only remained to fight for possession of girl a haskins walked back to silbury in rapidly gathering darkness admitted that rebb position be strong one mavis be perfectly happy have wanted loss of liberty did not trouble since have spacious ground of pixy house for playground moreover thought that english girl be brought up in same way have known that be lie might have fretted after liberty then there must have be ground to go upon be taken into court must not deny that guardian have be kind have given required reasoning be in favor of rebb then again since rebb swore that mavis be insane be quite justified in shutting up so long a be treated kindly certainly must be proved to be sane position must then be very awkward one a must force to explain why have used girl money year while keeping in durance vile a tod have said gerald have echoed much must be done with money if thing came to be made public rebb might be able to bribe couple of doctor to certify to mavis ' insanity in case must be shut up in public asylum rebb after setting aside certain sum for maintenance must enjoy durham income for rest of wicked life plot be very cunningly arranged in standing by will rebb took up almost unassailable position many man must have be daunted by difficulty thus presented by survey of position gerald be in love to lover nothing be impossible that stand in way of gaining mistress haskins did not know for moment exactly how to act in one way determined to force rebb strong hand by warning rebb have certainly put on guard against possible elopement also have forced to behave in more le straightforward manner knowing that be watched major must not smuggle mavis into hiding place during conversation gerald have intended to mention bellaria dread of coral hand so that might learn if be really tna society that feared chance be that rebb must not have told moreover introduction of new subject might have complicated matter haskins therefore congratulated that have kept silence also for moment be unnecessary to draw rebb attention to wonderful likeness between charity mavis doubtless rebb be well aware of be more than likely that rebb must explain still bearing in mind mr pelham odin offer to pas off mavis a charity must be necessary gerald resolved to hold peace at one moment be inclined to storm pixy house secretly elope with mavis hiding a above under name of charity who must then be out of way a mr macandrew rebb must know who have taken mavis away standing by will gave guardianship of mavis until be twenty one must make dire trouble gerald did not wish to be arrested a must do little good for mavis if imprisoned only remained then to return to london to see tod in one way start must be made towards extricating mavis from clutch of guardian when start be made desired end must be reached sooner later gerald therefore determined to leave silbury next morning to begin campaign forthwith assisted by tod felt very reluctant to leave neighborhood without seeing mavis be forced to bellaria must now be on guard if attempted to climb wall gerald be very certain that geary have be sent to watch pixy house by precious master haskins have revolver a opposed to yellow handled knife about mavis have talked so did not fear encounter open struggle must only damage position of mavis impede plan made for rescue knowing rebb have will swore to reported insanity of mavis to strengthen attitude gerald be extremely anxious to move cautiously in sheer desperation major rebb might call in assistance of law much a haskins wished to force man hand did not want to do so by placing in wrong to take mavis from guardianship of man appointed by father will must be disobedience to law of rebb must take full advantage a night be warm gerald having plenty of time did not hurry there be moon star be covered with dun hued cloud very little light therefore came from above nevertheless night be not entirely dark a faint luminous radiance be everywhere spread must pick way along highroad very easily although following tod advice have revolver in hip pocket never thought that must be necessary to use major rebb a civilized being have refrained from actual violence much a apparently desired to use then must only have taken to fist be far otherwise with geary that semi civilized savage must undoubtedly have taken to yellow handled knife in usual way in intuition came to haskins thought of knife unexpectedly flashed into mind when topped last rise of hill already must see glimmer of silbury light paused moment to watch shining like star under muggy canopy of heavy sky knife thought remained turned head uneasily from side to side scenting danger by sixth sense feeling passed then came again stronger than ever when began to walk on once more glanced back then swerved to one side just in time to avoid rush of big black form hurled out of shadow be geary who dashed towards missed wheeled flung again on young man haskins have walked to denleigh in flannel a evening be so close so be sufficiently easy mark in semi darkness showing whitely like negative against gloom geary clutched in powerful arm before must swerve again draw revolver then gerald realized with shock of surprise save for pair of dungaree trouser man be naked not only that upper part of body have be rubbed with oil slipped about like eel geary made remark did gerald speak two men one big burly other lithe wiry wrestled together for mastery haskins believed that geary wished to get down stab must not see if held knife certainly did not in huge hand might have have strapped sailor fashion in small of back without word two men swung swayed geary wriggling pressing gerald downward with great weight haskins have lately taken lesson in jiu jutsu of negro be apparently ignorant so suddenly gave way with unexpected relaxing of muscle geary uttered guttural ejaculation of anger surprise a felt looseness of young man body found moment afterwards that big arm be empty by making small so to speak gerald have slipped out of negro grip darted back with lightning speed when geary swung round again to assault found facing revolver nothing daunted hand slipped round to back of dungaree trouser moment later gerald saw steel glitter in dim light a geary rushed forward with uplifted hand haskins did not wish to kill man a be necessary witness to save mavis so winged bullet struck negro right arm knife dropped a howled viciously apparently dreading shot sprang aside then backward vanished for minute gerald pad pad pad of bare foot on highway became aware then for first time that have escaped great danger picking up knife replaced revolver in hip pocket walked swiftly towards silbury wondering if rebb have sent man to kill if so geary have failed a there be chance of attempt being made on night gerald did not trouble on way to town swiftly resolved to say nothing of adventure especially a publicity might lead to revelation being made at moment while mavis ' fate swung in balance later gerald determined to bring geary to justice have evidence of knife at first street lamp stopped looked at weapon be dangerous piece of steel bowie knife handle be of black wood what then have become of yellow handled knife mavis feared so greatly gerald be too weary ached too much with late struggle to think over problem therefore postponed consideration until next morning on reaching prince head sat down to excellent meal held peace about adventure after dinner drank coffee smoked couple of pipe then went to bed about ten o'clock trifle later shortly in spite of late excitement fell asleep when awoke be nine o'clock in morning feeling somewhat bruised stiff for geary grasp be like of octopus decided to remain in bed instead of taking morning train to london afternoon train must do decided so rang for breakfast to be served intending to rise at midday chambermaid took order for breakfast seemed to be flustered before must make inquiry ran out of room later mr jennings arrived with breakfast tray looked excited a placed on bed oh mr haskins cried with shining eye such terrible news that mad girl at pixy house have murdered miss bellaria have bolted be impossible gasped haskins starting up in bed milkman from leegarth have just brought news sir chapter xv tragedy mr jennings news be so startling that gerald must only fall back on pillow stare at excited face pleased with effect produced like gossip continued rapidly to explain breathlessly milkman master evans be name went at seven morning with milk to pixy house miss bellaria always came to gate opened to take milk in found gate wide open miss bellaria lying on path within ground stabbed to heart a dead a stone gave alarm in village many people went into ground up to examine house found one there that poor lunatic be gone evans sent on man to tell police here came in for drink have whole story out of be dreadful sir to think that must have be talking of crazy meg only yesterday that must commit so dreadful crime stop said gerald sharply somewhat recovering can not say if miss durham be guilty mr jennings gaped not say be guilty why sir if be who can be be well known that miss durham a call sir always wanted to kill people be why be shut up not being able to get at person have murdered poor miss bellaria who watched then ran away to murder again suppose oh how very dreadful be when said yesterday that might be murdered in bed little thought that must be nonsense nonsense begging pardon sir be gospel truth that be speaking said landlady bristling with lunatic at large one never know what may happen police inspector very nice man be have already sent to denleigh asking major rebb to go to leegarth everyone be talking about thing with blood slaughter in ask pardon sir for having come into bedroom thought must like to know oh dear dear mr jennings wrung plump hand retreated towards door in flurried condition will bolt bar window door at sunset murder for having babbled out of room banged door haskins sitting up in bed placed hand on side of head to think matter over found difficult to believe news yet might have expected to hear something of sort of course be absolutely certain that mavis be innocent must not understand why have run away must guess who have slain unfortunate italian quite unable to eat breakfast because of intelligence jumped out of bed into hip bath be in centre of room sooner went downstairs learned must be learned better able must be to see way if mavis have be in danger from major rebb before be now in greater danger than ever a assuredly must use assumed guilt to prevent inheriting money nothing will make anyone believe that mavis be other than guilty be young man soliloquy crazy reputation be enough if be caught will shut up in asylum notwithstanding denial be sure to make then rebb will be able to keep money according to strict letter of will yet yet clenched fist believe that rebb be guilty of crime have really reason to make such accusation happening of crime be so opportune for major that did not seem entirely impossible for to have have hand in assuredly might not have struck blow unscrupulous geary must easily have be employed to remove bellaria not that rebb on face of must wish to lose so useful servant if be necessary that mavis must be accused of murder to ensure being placed in asylum bellaria be nearest most natural victim argument be futile a gerald reflected while dressing for did not know exactly what have taken place be necessary to learn when crime have be committed where body have be found precise spot be if possible to discover weapon have be used if yellow handled knife be picked up anywhere near corpse presumption must be that geary have killed woman although mr jennings have made report of thought recalled to haskins mind attack made upon by negro on previous night knife have be used then have in pocket of suit have worn on looking at again saw what have struck before that handle of particular weapon be black not yellow what then have become of famous sacrificial knife of mavis have spoken why must geary not have used when striving to murder gerald that question must only be answered when yellow handled knife be found haskins must not wear flannel in have be attacked a be smeared over with oil from geary body therefore flung suit into portmanteau a day promised to be extremely hot dressed in white drill thus clothed although far from being in right mind by reason of inward perturbation descended to find hotel seething with excitement everyone be talking of leegarth tragedy a such event have never before startled somnolent town bar be crowded with idler mr evans messenger be being supplied with a much drink a must swallow however be yet sober enough to answer few question haskins put to weapon have be found police have gone to leegarth guilt of miss durham be certain have vanished search be being made wire have be sent far wide ordering arrest policeman be scouring countryside on bicycle sooner later murderess must be captured everyone must be relieved so man babbled on having learned be possible gerald went to hire bicycle in order to proceed to leegarth did not feel least hungry for obvious reason a have long exhausting day before be wise enough to force to eat drink thus fortified rode up steep silbury high street into surrounding country so rapid be pace so eager be to learn best worst at once that in marvelously short time found before high wall girdled pixy house park in wall double gate of rough iron be set ground must not be seen from lane a board have be placed across bar to prevent anyone looking in have be done a gerald learned from chatty villager many year before when crazy girl dead watcher have come to live there policeman guarded gate preserved order amongst rapidly increasing crowd augmented minute terrible news have traveled with lightning speed from far wide came who be possessed of morbid curiosity police be expected from exeter in meanwhile inspector morgan of silbury be within ground searching round major rebb have not yet arrived on learning latter fact haskins at once demanded admission so that might interview morgan when rebb came knew well that must not be possible to meddle with case a major must insist that have nothing to do with in order to discover evidence might be suppressed by rebb must geary be guilty haskins made up mind to examine a much into matter on spot a must be permitted to after sending in request received reply in few minute led to being conducted by young constable through jealously guarded gate into presence of inspector morgan be standing on lawn drawing plan of ground several policeman be beating about long grass searching for something have found knife asked gerald coming up swiftly morgan looked at keenly be tall burly man with red face white hair apparently easygoing tolerant who must not be difficult to manage if treated diplomatically nevertheless resented haskins abrupt question with stiff official dignity may ask who be sir demanded gerald pointed to card inspector held name be there mr inspector came here because be interested in case on what ground for what reason questioned morgan still stiffly haskins did not hesitate on way hither have resolved to be absolutely frank if frankness be necessary to deliver mavis from dangerous position must have to give reason for championing having regard to searching examination of law deemed best to tell absolute truth if did not rebb might possibly make use of knowledge of secret visit to get into trouble therefore cast bombshell boldly be engaged to marry miss durham stated slowly morgan in spite of official phlegm dropped pocketbook in sheer amazement two constable who overheard looked round with expression of blank astonishment what do mean sir stuttered inspector growing redder than ever be making fool of miss durham be mad must not be engaged to anyone miss durham be perfectly sane a be prepared to swear to prove belief in sanity be willing to make wife murderess be not murderess killed that unfortunate bellaria dondi poor girl who be shut up here be at least innocent dear dear dear morgan scratched head looked bewildered never came across anything so extraordinary in life if miss durham be shut up here everyone know that be strictly guarded on account of mania how came to see in rather peculiar way mr inspector what tell can be substantiated by friend legal adviser mr ian roy macandrew after thus guarding from tale being received with disbelief gerald detailed finding of cylinder subsequent dealing with matter morgan gaped stared not knowing what to make of so extraordinary story then young lady be not crazy said gerald positively be certain be in complete possession of sens then why be shut up have better ask major rebb said haskins dryly will be here soon in proof of truth of story can look for canoe be hidden in undergrowth on other side of pool below river wall morgan nodded with pale blue eye fixed on speaker do know anything of murder asked pointedly gerald laughed shortly be going to accuse demanded certainly not mr haskins certainly not seeing that canoe be near house confess to having paid secret visit understand gerald cut short people will talk let can prove alibi with help of mr jennings three four of servant slept last night at prince head silbury be in bed few minute after ten by way can tell when crime be committed doctor who examined poor woman body state that be stabbed so far a can ascertain from condition of corpse somewhere about twelve o'clock say at midnight where morgan indicated spot stained with blood have soaked into graveled path little distance away yonder mr haskins judge from miss bellaria a be called hereabouts came to open gate to someone assassin doubt then be stabbed to heart before must make outcry doctor declares that death must have taken place almost instantaneously humph said gerald swiftly see then that exonerate miss durham seeing that say bellaria be summoned to gate by assassin yes mr haskins said inspector stolidly according to what say young lady be sane have yet to be proved be quite likely that for once may have gone out have wish to go out seem to know great deal about young lady intention said inspector morgan trifle dryly well then may have followed miss bellaria into garden after stabbing may have opened gate got away miss bellaria never came into garden at night said gerald quickly told that be afraid of something what be afraid of asked morgan sharply ca exactly tell replied young man who did not wish to say too much about tna society lest mr crosbie who owned coral pin might be implicated bellaria hinted that be afraid miss durham told that nurse must never venture out after dark why then must have come to gate morgan reflected pulled white moustache probably miss durham be seized with mania for killing chased nurse through house miss bellaria must then run into garden to escape so be struck down on very threshold of yonder gate daresay be trying to get out summon assistance from village make out very pretty case against miss durham mr inspector morgan must have replied at moment one of constable who have be hunting in long grass on left hand of gate cried out triumphantly held up knife here be sir said in moment morgan be holding in hand yellow handled knife of very deadly description have bloodstain on blade see said officer gravely be undoubtedly weapon used seems to that woman be stabbed then assassin miss durham for thousand flung knife aside into long grass before running away very natural very natural must not care to carry with such evidence of guilt guilt have yet to be proved said gerald hotly argument ensued in haskins decidedly got worst inspector indeed everyone else scouted idea of mavis ' innocence have pursued bellaria to gate having killed have got rid of knife by flinging into long grass then have fled not daring to face consequence of crime in case cried gerald furiously must be sane madwoman must not be afraid to remain being ignorant of heinousness of offence morgan shook head still unconvinced indeed gerald saw that thing looked very black indeed against girl loved be on tip of tongue to denounce geary a owner of knife must not prove without evidence of mavis moreover thought wiser to keep silent a to suspicion until consulted macandrew must get legal advice situation be too dangerous to be dealt with hurriedly later in day major rebb arrived heard from inspector morgan about crime viewed body of poor woman examined knife either failed to recognize if did decided to keep silence a to ownership stated that have seen ward about four o'clock on previous day that be then in excited condition not thinking must venture to commit crime have gone back to devon maid at denleigh there have retired to rest at nine o'clock geary landlord of inn have also be with major nearly evening have likewise retired to bed early a while handling pistol have managed to shoot in right arm simple minded inspector heard with air of belief did not inquire a must have done why major rebb must take such trouble to explain movement of landlord why landlord have managed to shoot so dexterously in right arm while speaking rebb frequently glanced at gerald who be present expecting contradiction doubt when morgan have taken note of major evidence that military gentleman beckoned to haskins together went into room missing girl have used be comfortably even luxuriously furnished gerald casting swift glance around never doubted that major out of diplomacy because be conscience stricken have treated prisoner with consideration when door be closed rebb looked searchingly at unwelcome visitor well haskins inquired what do mean to do now will let know that later retorted gerald quickly must be certain now at event pursued major calmly that mavis be insane one madwoman must have stabbed bellaria how dare say that when know perfectly well that mavis be innocent indeed haskins then who be guilty must like to tell said gerald significantly rebb gave short laugh be going to accuse remarked much in same manner a haskins have spoken earlier to morgan know best be fool haskins said rebb flushing very roughly considering circumstance of case what on false premise be ready to do must be such idiot a to kill bellaria yes said gerald dryly knew must move heaven earth to prove mavis ' sanity so must marry therefore in order that homicidal mania must be proved beyond doubt have bellaria killed mavis taken away if can not prove innocence can guess how difficult will be for to do so will then have put into asylum enjoy money for rest of life be very pretty plot major rebb agree with there haskins doe credit to imagination a writer of fiction be glad to see that accuse of murdering bellaria be too cunning to risk own neck said gerald decidedly remained in inn to prove alibi believe that sent geary here to kill bellaria for reason have given deny rebb yellow handled knife belongs to geary be in morgan possession doe know that be geary asked rebb anxiously will tell so can spare trouble will tell knife doe belong to geary a wife dozen other people can prove gave to bellaria because asked for weapon to defend probably mavis wrenched knife from at gate then very ingenious explanation believe geary to be guilty must stick at nothing a know from way in tried to

once to place mavis at belver theatre for dance mr pelham odin looked distinctly nervous carried away by theatrical instinct by admiration for gerald chivalry to say nothing of interest felt in love affair a woman much le sentimental must have done have proposed plot without thinking that must be taken seriously yet here be young man whom admired actually asking to lend to fantastical mode of concealment such a have never to knowledge be seen off stage dramatic instinct impelled to yield common sense warned against mixing up in murder committed by lunatic dear boy said genuinely distressed really be impossible proposed mr pelham odin muttered gerald sorely disappointed for if actress did not help how be to conceal mavis from persecution of rebb did not think that must take at word faltered after mr haskins major rebb might find out think so see how must if come to theatre will see girl belief to be charity dancing be mavis durham really so like girl might be sister might be

mr pelham odin hopped off sofa very much excited now talk common sense show in way duty lie be willing to see girl to help against enemy hum mr pelham odin pressed fan to lip even three thousand year for charity might be earned too dearly can say no more than will see be shrewd in reading character can easily tell if mavis be insane deceitful bloodthirsty gerald laughed when thought of beautiful

odin a have hinted before that be anxious to re engage miss charity bird for new ballet said mr pelham odin privately lamenting necessity of declining exceptionally good term in couple of week so when run of moon fay be over daughter be going to southend for rest miss bird be not going to marry macandrew fellow hope remarked manager who have heard rumor will be loss to stage nothing have be arranged a yet replied actress evasively matter dropped when night came for mavis ' appearance charity did rash thing in induced tod to support although mr pelham odin gerald must have be seriously annoyed have known be nothing le than to make tod take closely veiled to gallery of belver theatre to see double dance tod remonstrated being very much in love yielded in long run just before curtain rose on moon fay charity lawyer found very comfortably seated among god theatre be crowded a usual a ballet be successful one charity pointed out gerald mr pelham odin in small box near stage do hope mavis be not afraid whispered charity who be trifle nervous answered tod in same low tone be quite certain that will pull through right girl have heart of lion indeed macandrew prophecy proved to be correct one when curtain drew up on forest scene in charity have figured for so many night a moon fay everything went excellently wandering lover who be searching for peasant love chased moonbeam a usual be electric light when gathered into one radiance of white fell on knee invoking fairy of moon to assist in search mavis arrayed in filmy vaporous robe of snow stepped calmly on to stage have altered dress little a thought charity robe be trifle scanty wardrobe mistress manager have remonstrated on change must not understand why miss charity bird have altered mind about dress when ballet be nearing end never suspected truth a mavis born actress have mimicked charity speech gesture in private life so appeared in kind of greek dress worn long sparkling with silver hair be crowned with diadem of crystal with pure face uplifted in glory of light looked indeed like spirit audience a did stage hand manager thought still that saw charity bird same felt in puzzled way that there be something different in girl what must have said have known that moon fay be being sought for far wide a lunatic murderess one dreamed of such thing gerald must not have winced even have rebb be present major be not there a have more important matter to attend to moreover there be need that must come seeing that be ignorant of dancer identity in dark scenic forest amidst soft radiance of electric light mavis danced a have be instructed by charity so a to swing in time to music also introduced something of mystic element have displayed when gerald have beheld swaying in ground of pixy house floated across wide stage like veritable moonbeam beckoned to lover bent over like fair white angel finally melted into mist be contrived by gauze screen clever device have be much commented upon by press when moon fay vanished there be burst of applause charity always have be applauded for dance never have audience be so hearty in showing appreciation a on night charity be not at jealous for attention bestowed upon double must have looked splendid if be like whispered to tod of course be like replied macandrew be double dear only added loyally what be more really believed what said be ever so much better mr pelham odin hurried behind scene a soon a mavis ' dance be at end hurried girl away moment completed change of dress a be old actress usual way of behaving with charity action caused comment beyond fact that several people behind scene remarked that miss bird have be in unusually good form on particular night one troubled about matter indeed why must seeing how have beheld ballet for more than hundred night also dance of charity bird gerald be delighted there be very merry little supper at mr pelham odin flat that night mavis again again asked lover if have done well if be pleased with gerald must only reply with kiss until mr pelham odin merrily declared that must not remain in room if be so affectionate then child added must turn young man out for to morrow have to be at mr macandrew wedding can not come asked mavis eagerly bless child presence must bring about very complication be desirous of avoiding thing be going right so far so put so next day mavis remained in flat quite accepted by servant of house a miss charity bird while real lady who bore that name went with macandrew gerald mr pelham odin to quiet country church in essex where tod have elected to get married gerald be best man mr pelham odin gave bride away in best theatrical style none of tod relative be present for obvious reason a led bride down aisle after ceremony grinned to think of lady euphemia wrath did know what have taken place hope have done right sighed mr pelham odin when looking after train that bore tod bride away think have chapter xix signor venosta gerald did nothing until conclusion of presumed charity bird engagement at belver theatre there be need to do so for moment a scheme to hide have proved entirely successful one guessed where to look for much wanted mavis mr pelham odin took to theatre waited for there escorted back again so that mavis spoke very little to people behind scene gerald often came to supper spent much of time at bloomsbury flat be supposed to be writing new book in reality indulged with holiday to make love to girl have so strangely rescued when belver theatre closed for time mr pelham odin feeling want of change took mavis to southend there occupied pleasant apartment looking out on to sea mavis did not like to be parted from lover a must not see so frequently mr pelham odin pointed out that haskins must have to begin search for true murderer of bellaria so thing must be put right also a mavis be being taught to read write by old actress be just a well that gerald must not come too often to distract scholar attention from lesson so mr pelham odin stopped with mavis at lively seaside town happy in company of girl happy also to receive glowing letter from mr tod macandrew in expatiated on heavenly honeymoon haskins found time hang rather heavily on hand when mavis new guardian left london wished to wait for tod before beginning operation must be quite fortnight until macandrew returned until then there be nothing to do gerald tried to write few chapter of new book in vain thought of mavis of perilous position filled head so be obliged to throw aside literary work until matter be made straight for girl having come to conclusion resolved not to wait for tod arrival to work at case difficulty be how to begin arnold have stated plainly that believed rebb to be guilty person of gerald must not be sure be convinced that if bellaria life have stood between rebb six thousand year must have be murdered long ago moreover story of how geary knife came to be used sounded very plausible if rebb be guilty haskins believed that must not have told police about weapon a have done when inquest be held then again arnold did not know true reason of bellaria fear why have buried in secluded devonshire village struck gerald that tna society have traced bellaria dondi to leegarth there have be slain a expected mr berch knew of bellaria dread of coral hand a gerald have told about when called to claim again might have informed venosta who have bestowed amulet on mr crosbie be undoubtedly emissary of tna society probably be real criminal arguing in way haskins resolved to call on mr crosbie question mother a to whether have betrayed bellaria to burly italian also be anxious to learn why signor venosta have given coral hand to widow a be incredible to think that belonged to cut throat organization there must be reason why mr crosbie must hold trinket have so sinister significance gerald made up mind to see into finally a third reason for visit desired to know when rebb mr crosbie must marry if tod be right about widow impecuniosity gerald believed that be must not become major wife unless be certain of income while mavis remained undiscovered rebb must by mean be certain gerald must have asked arnold to come to london thought best that must not be seen in company of schaibar a major might suspect that something be wrong be of course impossible that rebb must ever trace mavis be just a well to be on safe side so arnold remained in exeter touring surrounding country a far a silbury denleigh leegarth keeping keen eye on geary communicating to gerald by registered letter gossip dealing with case must gather seemed from little man epistle that excitement have died down after bellaria be buried belief existed that mavis while flying from justice have fallen into river have be drowned whether negro rebb shared comfortable belief haskins must not discover thought not else major might have be still more afraid of losing illegal income in spite of denial that mavis have relative on father mother side be possible that gallant officer lied if relative existed must certainly claim money if mavis be supposed to be dead few day therefore after mavis have departed with mr pelham odin to southend gerald paid visit to ladysmith mansion mr crosbie be within looking much same a usual received in quite friendly manner fancied that disagreeable topic of last conversation have vanished from memory first word after greeting proved that be not case be glad to see dear gerald said languidly pointing to seat hope be not going to tell more horror be not aware that have ever told answered rather annoyed by tone oh yes story of lunatic whom wanted to look after be just a well that did not seeing how mad be be not mad insisted young man told that before tell again madge how often have said that be not to call by christian name silly boy said mr crosbie irritably there be one here gerald looked at curtain dividing one room from other suppose mr berch be not again lying down with headache be out shopping will be in soon need look so cross mother told major rebb about weird love affair mother overheard a said held tongue madge tell major rebb may come in at moment be also expecting signor venosta to afternoon tea what must of say if heard address so familiarly gerald shrugged shoulder did not argue point a please mr crosbie be merely taking privilege of age long acquaintanceship why not friendship inquired closing eye friendship then when be to be married ca say michael be major rebb know have not settled anything yet be very much upset poor man over crazy girl believe that girl be crazy said gerald decisively so said before major rebb told of interview with at denleigh inn how absurd be now suppose will admit that have have lucky escape admit nothing of sort said haskins bluntly then added in diplomatic manner did know where poor girl be must look up marry to morrow think that lunatic marriage be legal yawned mr crosbie in spite of what say girl must be guilty jury brought in verdict of wilful murder must be hanged a be owing to insanity presume will be shut up in asylum then major will be pleased expect said gerald grimly will not be very sorry about affair have brought name before public in most unpleasant manner luckily everyone know how well behaved in looking after girl got nothing for doing haskins started wondered if must be wise to reveal real term existed between mavis guardian if mr crosbie did not know how rebb earned income if must be called earning be certainly marrying under false pretense for moment gerald be inclined to blurt out truth remembering how mr crosbie have taken last confidence resolved to hold tongue about money question to let widow admirer adjust own private affair meanwhile widow have gone to tea table have just be set be talking while poured out tea hope that have got over infatuation for girl gerald will never see again expect be dead fell into pit river something when ran away after committing murder poor thing be lucky business for that be dead mr crosbie said gerald ceremoniously taking cup of tea will insist that miss durham killed nurse believe from bottom of heart that be innocent oh of course must being in love said mr crosbie with shrug if be innocent who be guilty major rebb accuse how good of dear gerald added young man with emphasis may have idea a to who killed bellaria dondi piece of bread butter fell from mr crosbie hand turned round with amazed look in heaven name how must know did mother tell said about bellaria that coral hand found in cigarette case yes woman be afraid when saw do know why be afraid certainly must signor venosta tell mr crosbie rose came forward with glittering light in eye not pleasant to look at what do mean signor venosta gave amulet mr berch told a much if did what then signor venosta be old friend of mine so long a major rebb doe not object fail to see why oh have objection to offer interrupted gerald hurriedly bellaria be afraid of coral hand symbolized now then mr crosbie what did symbolize know faltered eye dropped after pause looked up will tell know added passing lace handkerchief across lip keep what say to go on will say nothing to world without permission mr crosbie reflected be in difficulty over money when last met said rapidly there be italian moneylender jew in city who held bill of mine treated badly did not know what to do when told signor venosta in despair since be always good friend of mine asked name of jew particular what be name of jew asked gerald quickly have nothing to do with story there be need for to know moneylender be italian jew came from naples when signor venosta heard tale detached that coral hand from watch chain on very day found together gave to saying that if showed to jew everything must go well put for safety in cigarette case carried off so small object must easily be lost a may guess when found that case be missing sent mother at once to thinking rightly that have taken brought back well go on did show to jew yes be desperately afraid agreed to whatever term chose to make so may guess insisted on having favorable one be gerald why be jew afraid know more than know why bellaria be afraid did italian jew from naples say anything no turned dirty yellow nearly went on knee told that if did not give way that must get into trouble have brought sign to show yielded after making term seemed glad to get rid of know know nothing interrupted tartly returned to tea table haskins wondering if be playing part since knew so much seemed to that must know more tried effect of surprise ah jew be probably afraid of tna time mr crosbie dropped teapot clattered on tray with great noise tna society stammered very pale tna society said new foreign sounding voice at same time signor venosta be shown into room a teapot fell bers crosbie recovered with effort oh signor how be to day last time mr haskins know mr haskins found with now find with how strange be talking for sake of talking a gerald noted for face be livid bosom rose fell stormily burly italian who looked perfectly self controlled composed eyed haskins who bore gaze without flinching man took notice of mr crosbie chatter sank again into seat before tea table wo sit down also two tittered nervously mentioned tna society said venosta turning on little woman to young man pardon mentioned first to mr crosbie said haskins coolly what do know of tna society very little beyond fact that consists of body of men who emerge on occasion from den to dispense that justice can not be obtained by law headquarters of society be in naples symbol be coral hand grasping dagger signor venosta might have be hewn out of marble for surprise showed at speech be staggered since gerald caught expression of eye may ask how know sir gerald shrugged see reason to conceal fact that by chance carried away mr crosbie cigarette case during last visit amulet fell out when opened case in room for cigarette quite so ' assented venosta blandly thought doubt that be merely trinket yes such a old friend for instance signor venosta might give to mr crosbie ah italian turned swiftly on widow have told said vehemently only that gave trinket that made that jew moneylender do what wanted by showing to did not tell anything else because know nothing else save that coral hand have to do with society called tna how do know that much even mother told mr haskins told how do know demanded venosta turning toward gerald because bellaria dondi italian started came to room just before mr berch appeared to reclaim cigarette case bellaria be afraid when saw amulet staggered out of room cry out 'tna tna ' asked friend what word meant told meant den told also that have heard of society by name in naples guessed then from what bellaria said from terror that tna society wished to kill venosta nodded smiled amiably be clever young gentleman to piece thing together so cleverly well have heard name of bellaria dondi in connection with murder asked gerald long ago when be singer in love with enrico salviati signor venosta brow grew dark frowned fiercely bellaria told much said striving to appear calm much assented gerald easily not at daunted by black look did not tell who have struck blow who have given information led to striking of blow must not be dead poor soul venosta eyed coldly then in spite of verdict accuses english young lady of murder believe tna society murdered bellaria dondi did justice on let say remarked gerald quietly be euphonious way in italian put such thing believe that obtained news of bellaria whereabouts from eye wandered to mr crosbie sprang to foot indignantly be not true told nothing of what mother said nothing of what heard from gerald say that did not tell how must when knew nothing have known of society connection with must not have made use of coral hand to terrify jew say that be connected with tna society madam gave trinket be given to by member of society for use in emergency madam gave to to aid out of friendship be waved large white hand there be more to be said pardon said gerald quickly there be much to be said how did come to know of bellaria hiding place if mr crosbie madam here told nothing interrupted italian silencing little widow with gesture bellaria dondi be traitress who deserved to be killed nevertheless hid so successfully that tna society never knew where be until paper said that have be found dead in devonshire did not emissary of tna society kill asked gerald confounded said venosta gravely heaven punished bellaria not tna be dead stabbed know who struck blow looked at mr crosbie at gerald coldly bowed slightly left room chapter xx dark mystery almost a soon a italian went out mr berch entered since gerald have seen last have greatly aged looked more worn thin than ever in dark gown glancing from young man to daughter went to latter took hand what be matter madge asked in stern cold voice why have signor venosta left why be shivering gerald turned to haskins what have be saying to daughter nothing answered calmly signor venosta have be saying great deal to of be about coral hand mother cried mr crosbie feverishly clinging to mr berch signor venosta say that be symbol of society murder for reason moneylender be afraid wish have refused venosta assistance ended why did talk of horror asked mr berch reproachfully know gerald that madge can not bear such thing be trying to learn who killed bellaria mr berch struck since be afraid of coral hand that told madge what told that being repeated to venosta might have stabbed woman by order of tna society know anything about tna society do do muttered mr crosbie there be reason why signor venosta who be friend must kill major rebb servant went on mr berch steadily everyone know that be stabbed by crazy girl agree with replied gerald coldly prepared to leave however be useless arguing can only apologize to mr crosbie for having brought up so disagreeable subject good day said widow rising recovering color nerve go yet gerald know that did not mean harm after a signor venosta have nothing to do with death matter very little have known when saw moneylender what know now must never have taken that coral hand have given back to signor venosta will not mention subject again sit down have cup of tea do urged mr berch light coming into cold eye think owe to madge to remove impression of horror whole thing be too fantastical with symbol secret society murder in lonely house live in twentieth century thing belong to fiction last doe not replied haskins dryly bellaria be certainly murdered at pixy house by crazy girl insisted mr berch hope will be caught shut up in asylum be not safe to let creature go at large haskins defended mavis no longer a be afraid that two woman keen eyed clever might guess secret knowledge of girl whereabouts let change subject said taking fresh cup of tea from mr crosbie hand hope enjoyed yourselves at bognor oh very much indeed said widow brightly be quite sorry to return to london be going abroad soon to switzerland gerald winced switzerland be wide place yet if mr berch daughter went there be not impossible what might come across honeymooning path of mr mr macandrew in event major rebb must certainly learn charity be married therefore guess that mavis be with mr pelham odin however showed sign of fear privately resolved to write to tod when be going mr crosbie ca say exactly answered carelessly depends on major rebb be coming with mother have business to arrange before can leave london what have be doing with lately gerald a know have be at bognor writing a usual haskins plunged into account of new book for sake of talking on safe subject yet even a spoke brain be wondering why widow lied about bognor according to tod clerk two lady have not be near that watering place mr crosbie spoke a having just returned from very town probably since be hard up mr crosbie in talking of moneylender have confessed a much have be ruralizing in quiet cheap part of country for next twenty minute conversation be of light somewhat frivolous order in so congenial atmosphere widow expanded like flower even mr berch grew more human le like stone image be quite like old day when gerald mother have sat knitting listening with smile on well remembered face mr crosbie evidently recalled past for when gerald finally took departure accompanied to door what pleasant quarter of hour have have said pressing hand always get on well together gerald mother be so fond of wish have not quarreled with michael with major rebb be for when be married want still to be friend be only too willing to continue so rebb doe like how can expect to said mr crosbie petulantly when accuse of shutting up girl unjustly do hope have got over infatuation for must never do for to marry madwoman said gerald shirking useless argument must never do good day madge will see again soon went down stair with backward glance to see mr crosbie shaking playful finger at for calling a usual by christian name when in street gerald suddenly remembered that must have be a well to get signor venosta address from widow a wanted to gain further information concerning tna society on second thought saw little use in again questioning venosta italian have plainly denied murder must tell nothing more about society be secret one haskins quite believed what venosta said with regard to crime if bellaria judged traitress by tna have be deliberately stabbed be improbable that venosta a mouthpiece of cut throat organization must deny that such justice have be executed such society be rather proud than otherwise of vengeance did not mind truth being known since publicity on score terrified other member who might wish to break oath tna society therefore be guiltless of bellaria death assassin must have to be sought for in quarter where can look gerald asked be not until reached frederick street that decided what to do decision came to be to journey at once to denleigh interview negro probably geary knew truth might be bribed terrified into telling what knew to depend upon semi civilized creature be grasping at straw to whom else must go for information rebb fighting with back to wall must not tell geary knowing master secret might be persuaded kicked bought over into speech when gerald arrived in room be met with surprise in shape of tod macandrew looking sunburnt healthy marvelously happy good heaven what be doing here asked haskins amazed looking for retorted tod shook hand charity be so anxious to see mavis cleared married to that made come back where be mr macandrew at amsterdam what be doing there waiting for must not stop in switzerland a be too far away so came to amsterdam can run over see there whenever like until infernal business of murder be cleared up can bring back to england be glad be in holland remarked gerald told tod how mr crosbie mother intended to go to switzerland of dread lest might meet charity tod nodded be just a well answered however charity be right snug so be at disposal mavis mr pelham odin be at southend yes where rebb be not likely to look for a for be going to devonshire to morrow to see geary arnold arnold yes must like to interview see if have picked up further information a to geary do suspect yes according to rebb geary gave knife to bellaria certainly shot geary in right arm so on night of murder be in condition to kill woman geary believe be guiltless know rebb secret wish to force into telling hum said tod nursing chin do believe that rebb know what to believe of rebb interrupted gerald quickly a told mr arnold think rebb stabbed bellaria may have done so may not at event be going down to find out then haskins related what have learned about coral hand how venosta have disclaimed murder must not have done tod have society executed vengeance on bellaria by confessing must run neck into noose no must simply deny having told guilt must be difficult to prove since mr crosbie mr berch say that did not tell about bellaria terror of amulet moreover must clear out of england back to own country must laugh at english law tod feel certain that venosta accursed society be innocent believe that geary be innocent also leave only rebb to be accused however will come down with scour country after conversation with arnold can then learn what stranger be in neighborhood of leegarth on night of murder what then stranger have reason to murder bellaria well know crime may be work of tramp daresay there be rumor of jewel money rest of tramp might said gerald very decidedly mavis declares bellaria received letter excited must not be surprised to learn that letter asked to come to gate at midnight so that might meet with death ah then think letter be written by assassin if so rebb be guiltless must not commit to making appointment in writing when must have met bellaria easily without doing so where be letter know mavis say that bellaria have on person must not have be found else must have be produced at inquest know from reading paper that be not hum said tod again well let go down to devonshire then can look into thing be very good of to cut short honeymoon to help said gerald patting macandrew on back be very good of indeed assented tod readily must have done for living soul come now take out to dinner at troc amuse with best play in london haskins laughed did be desired a be just a well to keep tod from fretting after wife have left at amsterdam macandrew did not do thing by half having come over to help friend did not keep reminding of sacrifice have made tod ate excellent dinner laughed at musical comedy went to sleep in gerald extra bedroom after smoke glass of whisky slightly diluted with water macandrew a became native of scotland liked drink strong next morning two friend went down to west of england in very good spirit at exeter tod alighted to see arnold having obtained monmouth hotel address from gerald other amateur detective proceeded to silbury where a usual put up at prince head mr jennings be pleased to see must tell very little about murder likely to throw light on darkness seemed to gerald that took very little interest in matter crazy girl ca be found told guest so expect poor soul have be drowned be general opinion sir a be case miss bellaria be buried in leegarth graveyard there be more to be said what of pixy house major rebb have shut up in way be for mad girl room be beautifully furnished saw added mr jennings breathlessly when went over after inquest to leegarth major rebb have be living in room with man geary sir geary be still landlord of devon maid be fiddling with pistol hurt be right now major rebb brought own man from town who cook look after place expect major like better to live in pixy house than in hotel at denleigh must not live in wicked house ended mr jennings with shudder must be afraid of miss bellaria ghost be major rebb there now asked gerald quickly come again to morrow next day believe answered landlady who knew gossip of neighborhood say that intends to repair house against marriage with london lady haskins nodded took way over hill to denleigh be apparent that rebb really believed mavis to be drowned according to common report since one be likely to question right to income house intended to reap a married man fruit of villainy seemed strange to gerald that mavis must not have relative who must dispute will knew how often old family dwindle down to single person in case believed that there be two twig still sprouting from durham family tree in person of twin girl on crossing bridge in denleigh valley haskins saw geary lounging at door looking big black sullen dangerous however white man be not to be intimidated by barbarous animal like so gerald walked up to coolly wished good day geary grew green under black skin glared like wild beast hand working

care for over clever servant probably have learned lesson when pensioning off geary who knew far too much old place looked very beautiful in warm golden light gerald caught glimpse of lawn whereon

although fair face flushed trifle there be question of that mere fact that come here alone be enough to prove that fear lighted pipe carefully looked along stem at host fire away rebb sat down in comfortable chair with back to window probably so that haskins must not read face too easily be neatly dressed in maroon colored smoking suit looked a spic span a though have just stepped out of band box then rebb being something of lady killer have always be attentive to personal appearance suited room very well a looked high bred bland dangerously amiable what do wish to say asked quietly be for to judge answered haskins lazily very attentive to rebb slightest movement say that expected well presume mean have something to say have called to see without invitation retorted rebb so show have

there be nothing in life what will bear inspection even by law even by law will have hock claret hock please seltzer congratulate on courageous conscience major few people even best of can stand having secret life looked into rebb passed along glass foaming with drink shrugged shoulder a took up claret jug did come here to preach platitude asked cynically gerald took long drink set down glass with laugh came to ask where mavis durham be hiding how must know may be dead for can tell indeed added rebb to believe be dead else must have be discovered long ago have idea of whereabouts if have must ask fenced gerald coolly stopped on night of poor girl flight at prince head a will find if ask mr jennings have asked already know ah then did suspect of having hand in murder fancied that might since loved mavis wanted to get away from here hope be satisfied with work with work what do mean haskins sat up simply that nothing have gone right since found that infernal cylinder pryed into private affair rebb glared if be old day of dueling haskins must call out quite believe a dueling day be past will have to silence in way why must silence because rebb know too much after left on night at devon maid came here did not interrupted rebb fiercely came here mr geary say so believe from soul that killed bellaria put blame on mavis to secure money rebb started to foot infernal liar flung glass at young man chapter xxii confession glass skimmed past haskins head smashed against wainscoting by time men be on foot rebb glaring furious gerald perfectly calm few drop of claret have sprinkled face wiped off quietly there be nothing to be gained by losing temper rebb remarked tell what to do what not to do raged major striding towards door locked be in power here haskins sat down again with contemptuous laugh so much so that if opened that door to let out must refuse to go be fool rebb one must think be melodramatic actor do think that be afraid of of dozen like sit down let talk quietly over matter rebb walked forward flung into chair gnawing moustache somewhat taken aback by haskins aplomb usually when asserted undeniably strong will opponent sat down obeyed major recognized readily enough that have determined man to deal with moreover knew that must not get better of by treachery since silbury police be aware of haskins whereabouts pixy house already have unpleasant reputation rebb did not wish inexplicable disappearance to take place there must willingly have got rid of man who so persistently crossed path risk be too great a man to man gerald be more than able to hold own rebb be fool for moment mentally confessed beaten ask pardon for losing temper said wiping forehead man can sit quietly hear accused of woman murder defend then said gerald relighting pipe have gone out during episode there be need for to make defence snarled other think there be geary may hold tongue since appears to be devoted to wife having left husband will certainly speak out what can say asked rebb taking glass of claret that went to place on night about time of murder went away time after left did not return until two in morning major rebb sat moodily looking at tip of slipper saw well that gerald be right if young man a probably must supported mr geary in making trouble very unpleasant question might be asked why devil do interfere in business asked between teeth because love mavis durham be dead ca be sure of then know cried major starting to foot now how must know anything when have exonerated from complicity in flight argued gerald dexterously skirting subject if have run away with mavis must be wife by time must have passed honeymoon in prison growled rebb quite convinced by gerald quiet tone think not must have fought for wife intend to search for fight for still will never find if be alive must have be captured long ago ah must please doubt to see hanged on soul cried major beginning to walk to fro only want to see happy be happy here added a gerald laughed unpleasantly be happy until came disturbed poor brain very clever brain contradicted young man acidly pshaw major be fool that must talk to in way whatever may state to outside world for sake of illegal income know perfectly well that mavis be perfectly sane be not must have killed bellaria if sane oh be trying to keep up fiction also be not fiction insisted rebb obviously in earnest will admit that girl brain be stronger than chose to tell anyone outside room same believe that weary of being shut up tried to escape on night bellaria came to stop mavis then must have stabbed remember bellaria have geary knife do really believe asked gerald quite puzzled swear that do come haskins let talk plainly since there be one to hear believe no if anyone killed bellaria why must because knew must take girl away marry to put presumed insanity beyond doubt murdered bellaria placed crime on poor girl shoulder in way must be found secure income for life since can not marry must have be clever thing for to do said rebb in quiet way have not brain to conceive plot much le cleverness to carry out might in fit of rage kill man capable of defending certainly must never raise hand to stab defenceless woman provocation might have be here about time of murder said haskins wrinkled brow in perplexity rebb spoke very earnestly be since mr geary have let cat out bag may a well confess will see how groundless suspicion be be long after ten o'clock when left devon maid took lantern with why did go at to search for confounded canoe geary told about so did bellaria who learned where be hidden from mavis yes told mavis well well wanted to find break up so that must no longer get across pool climb wall walked over hill lost way for time be close upon twelve o'clock when got to pool searched for canoe must not find heard shriek inside ground of house went to see what be not at moment knew that bellaria being always terrified for reason need not know pardon know about tna society rebb looked astonished made comment being too occupied in exonerating then know that suffered greatly from nerve be afraid of being discovered killed often shrieked at night a mavis told at time when here late heard therefore merely thought that bellaria be in one of mad fit went on searching about one o'clock climbed bank crossing stream by bridge to leegarth went to gate of pixy house wondering if have dared to come there after seeing found gate opened bellaria dead a be stooping over body geary came running from house said that have followed to tell about shooting in arm on finding bellaria body have gone to look for mavis have vanished searched house also must not find therefore came back to denleigh with geary making promise to say nothing of midnight visit why asked gerald straightly why echoed major looking surprised when be meddling with affair have known of visit at time must have denounced to police must have have great difficulty in clearing held peace tell really believed a believe now that mavis have stabbed bellaria so a to get liberty why did not believe that emissary of tna society have found out bellaria hiding place have killed mean venosta said rebb hurriedly well own after first shock of surprise did suspect venosta a mr crosbie have shown coral hand have told use put to did know about society asked gerald declared that be ignorant of existence so be knew about society at naples fifteen sixteen year ago when rescued bellaria from clutch believe venosta killed bellaria although must have done so be sure have known where be hiding did not who must have told not mr crosbie although mentioned bellaria name whereabouts confound a mr crosbie knew nothing of tna society well haskins must see now that be innocent look like admit everything fitted in so well with plan that naturally thought guilty then see that be not snapped rebb much ruffled if be must confess midnight journey to seeing that mr geary be about to make public think must have have to in long run retorted gerald sharply must do muttered rebb still walking becoming much agitated for be beginning to realize danger will now that husband can no longer terrorize be in very awkward position advice to if be really a innocent a pretend to be be to search out mavis hand over income after by will need not account for what have spent up to date have have long run for money say that because want income must do with when marry mavis will certainly insist upon justice being done to must take without penny a well know be not such fool a to refuse six thousand year along with pretty clever wife well then find mavis will see cried rebb quite out of temper throwing into chair for to accuse when be found no thank first want to prove innocence will find difficult not with help major rebb grew violent damn say that believe girl may be innocent surely have exonerated may think so public public need never know anything about see here haskins love girl seem to think that be still alive good make bargain with give three thousand of six thousand year belonging to durham estate can marry mavis quietly take to america colony one will think to find notorious mavis durham in mr gerald haskins thus everything will be settled can marry mr crosbie a greatly want to with quiet heart what say refuse offer said gerald calmly mavis will have character cleared will have nothing of income rebb rose snapped finger do worst said trying to suppress anger find mavis marry be prepared for to have condemned for bellaria murder shut up in asylum hope to prove innocence said haskins quietly even if do snarled rebb becoming reckless when found so beset may lose money be impossible belongs to mavis to real mavis gerald rose guessing that rebb referred to other twin what do mean by rebb mavis have sister yes may look charity bird be real mavis at least can prove to be so there be likeness between girl admit said gerald pretending ignorance be ridiculous to say that be sister be twin sister sit down will tell about that can make so much mischief must not say word when know truth for own sake may hold tongue give income without word haskins resumed seat marveling at thus having be able to force rebb hand without revealing suspicion major hastily swallowed glass of claret began to speak in hurry be in goorkha regiment in twenty five year ago gerald interrupted thought be in west indian regiment later later said rebb testily interrupt exchanged to jamaica few year later in india have brother officer who be greatest friend name be julian durham have six thousand year against six hundred be not very strong always said that a have relative must make heir then married silly flirting girl with whom quarreled hope be thus dashed to ground did aid quarrel asked gerald delicately yes replied rebb shamelessly wife stood in way of getting fortune from julian tried to part husband wife succeeded for more than year after marriage mr durham went to bombay with intention of living apart from husband what scoundrel be rebb said haskins astonished at cold blooded way in man recounted villainy major laughed harshly only tell to matter retorted outside if say anything will deny who will believe haskins however to continue be stationed in far north of india escorted mr durham to bombay where intended to embark for england at bombay be taken ill died giving birth to twin did want couple of girl on hand a knew that julian must not live long so paid nurse to take one of child eldest mind to simla to get rid of somehow sold believe to juggler wife afterwards mr pelham odin then on tour bought child in calcutta to bring up child be charity bird can prove yes be quite certain of that ayah juggler wife be still alive well then that disposed of one brought other back to north of india to father be christened mavis julian be very ill so made will in favor in favor of child be to be guardian to enjoy money until married then be to hand over without accounting for what have spent in way julian hoped to satisfy for old promise to make heir of course agreed said nothing of other twin why must one brat on hand be enough afterwards julian came home to brighton died be at brighton that made will a know came back from india with mavis to cut off association with who knew durham exchanged into west india regiment took to jamaica sold out fifteen sixteen year ago brought child here after tour in italy be in naples found bellaria be singer have betrayed man belonging to tna society know exact story be in danger of death so took by stealth to devonshire made nurse to mavis geary be servant in jamaica in devonshire at barnstaple met with wife a wanted someone to watch pixy house established at devon maid making present of freehold gerald rose paid for out of mavis money of course did only mistake money doe belong to mavis until be married will be married to moment can find said gerald grimly stalking to door wait bit called out rebb if marry without promising three thousand year will prove identity of charity will get lot when marries tod macandrew be in love with know will get left can not take money from mavis name be mentioned in will said gerald coolly tried door be locked say open confound major rebb flung key across room haskins fitted into lock before must open door rebb continued be fool in own interest haskins will swear charity be mavis beloved will lose can scarcely do in face of story will have to tell mr pelham odin juggler wife ayah can prove charity be missing twin daresay mavis ' baptismal certificate can be found name in will make heiress then will tell about charity prove identity cried rebb starting furiously to foot will at least get care if doe retorted gerald flinging open door have better give money to then will be silent a to charity being durham daughter major care for crooked way will find mavis marry probably will be quite willing to halve income with twin three thousand year will be enough for for good day major find other man who be willing to become such blackguard a be rebb caught decanter slung across room only crashed against closed door when rebb ran forward to pursue man who flouted found door locked on outside chapter xxiii tod discovery on returning to silbury hotel gerald sat down to think over important conversation with rebb to appearance master be a innocent a man nevertheless according to major geary have be to pixy house on fatal night in spite of denial on face of negro have reason to kill bellaria rebb have sworn that murder be neither committed prompted by if be so appeared strange that rebb must have found geary not only in ground of pixy house in mansion when arrived seeing that geary be thus first in field be not improbable that have caught glimpse of assassin whether have have told master be of course impossible to say haskins determined to have interview with landlord of devon maid force to disclose whole truth assuredly have not told in wife presence one important thing gerald have learned from rebb be truth of surmise regarding charity be a have always supposed twin sister of mavis haskins congratulated on guessing before rebb have spoken out still be just a well that rage have made major thus candid matter be put beyond doubt haskins be pleased also by discovery a guided by mavis must be quite willing to divide income then lady euphemia must not be angry at tod runaway marriage so far everything be right mystery of crime have still to be solved until be mavis must continue not only to be outcast fugitive from justice must remain unable to claim right a julian durham heiress apparently geary rebb signor venosta a emissary of tna society be innocent if so who be guilty person gerald wondered if letter to mavis have referred must be found a firmly believed that must afford clue to identity of criminal in own mind constructed manner in crime have be committed bellaria have received mysterious letter for reason overcame fear sufficiently to make venture out at night to meet writer of letter have opened gate then have be stabbed by own knife geary weapon have be wrested from in hand to hand struggle wonder be that struggle have not attracted attention a be rebb swore that have heard only one scream that might have be uttered by mavis when found dead body of nurse bellaria therefore be in probability slain unawares however be useless to build up theory be moonshine so gerald resolved to wait until tod arnold arrived according to macandrew letter must come to silbury early next day so gerald have good many hour to have mind to see inspector morgan learn detail concerning inquest a possible evidence might have be obtained likely to throw light on darkness haskins refrained from doing so a did not wish to arouse morgan suspicion reopen case for mavis ' sake quieter moved in matter better must be gerald wondered after hearing rebb acknowledgment of charity birth if have idea of scheme by girl have be made to change place after reflection decided that be impossible a mr pelham odin have managed very cleverly also rebb be unaware that twin have got rid of be now mr macandrew since young lady be at amsterdam there must be chance of being met by mr berch daughter when in switzerland bearing in mind what mr crosbie have told of projected tour abroad gerald be greatly surprised when met widow mother driving up silbury high street from railway station saw at once a stood thunderstruck on pavement beckoned for to come to side of landau be surprised to see here said with gay smile be not switzerland be said nothing about coming down here yesterday answered because mother have intention of coming be way gerald michael major rebb know came in almost a soon a have left told have taken place why did do asked haskins imperatively bully gerald said mr crosbie tartly told michael because have secret from michael be very angry that must have spoken to a did be perfectly polite permit to remind madge call by christian name said a usual well then michael went away to have explanation with later telegraphed to that have gone to devonshire that intended to follow at once also asked to come down might see pixy house a intend to repair when marry do indeed muttered haskins ironically of course said mr crosbie with airy flutter of lace may tell gerald that came down more willingly since want michael to quarrel be why be here to see house to prevent quarrel said gerald coolly be greatly obliged to for trouble have taken mr crosbie have already seen major mr berch who have hitherto kept silence looked up sharply have have quarrel demanded eagerly yes rebb be slightly difficult to deal with now understand one mr crosbie asked what about about various thing answered haskins carelessly be determined not to answer question a have vague idea that be not so honestly friend a pretended to be parted amiably hope said mr berch haskins laughed a remembered parting how have locked rebb in room think that major must gladly see tarred feathered said lightly there cried mr crosbie with childish pout knew have quarreled did so wish to be friend want to come to pixy house when marry michael see improvement have already arranged what to do have be down here before then asked gerald astonished yes over two year ago michael asked down when be first engaged saw poor bellaria not mavis why did not see mavis because michael said mental state be so sad that might be dangerous be shut up on day went over house a be only there for hour knew nothing of visit mother be stopping in neighborhood be when be learning to drive motor gerald must have taken poor girl out for drive a got to know country so thoroughly be too dangerous where did stop asked gerald still lingering although mr berch seemed inclined to cut short daughter chatter at village mile away called belldown why do start mosquito stung answered haskins readily real reason for starting be that belldown happened to be place where mr arnold tod be now stationed there be heap of mosquito here mr crosbie will be stung ah well be only here for couple of day at pixy house be merely want to look round now that poor mad girl have gone can explore at leisure good day wish must ask to come over michael might object so stupid of to quarrel with future husband when be such friend gave signal to driver of landau to move on mother bestowed friendly smile on young man a took off hat gerald watched carriage climb up long street vanish over crest of hill then walked back again to hotel wondering why mr crosbie be so anxious to retain friendship when became mr rebb knew that madge be flighty woman although much cleverer than pretended to be be sure that have reason for friendliness chatter however have more important thing to think about than mr crosbie air grace spent wakeful night building up theory knocking down again by dawn have arrived at conclusion that geary be criminal expect thought haskins while taking bath that geary found hold over rebb be getting lax so deliberately killed bellaria knowing that major have gone to pixy house in hope of getting blackmail by threatening to throw blame of murder on master by murder secured to rebb income out of large sum must be paid yes really believe that geary will prove to be guilty person how be to fix crime on be hard question to answer gerald waited for arrival of tod to put to since two head be better than one solicitor arrived at midday along with arnold having come from belldown so explained by railway tod looked anxious not so healthy a have done in london haskins put down to man unavoidable fretting after bride arnold have not changed in least appeared to be a tiny gnome like a ever first foremost two men being hungry have dinner then gerald conducted to hotel drawing room gorgeous apartment have be placed at disposal by mr jennings for extra pound on bill having apartment to three men saw that door be closed then sat down to talk gerald immediately asked question have be trembling on tongue from moment set eye on friend in first place tod said impatiently what took arnold to belldown be long story said tod leisurely then tell a shortly a can one moment let do thing in order first let know doings here jerry began haskins with irritation tod cut short see here jerry said firmly be supposed to be solicitor be place to conduct business want thing done in order first story then mine will be extremely interesting have doubt gerald stared why must think have anything to tell well observed macandrew jocularly little bird mr jennings by name whispered to that two london lady have come down on visit to major rebb who be camping so to speak at pixy house yes mr crosbie mother what of will tell when have heard what have to say about arnold uttered grunt raked long beard with lean finger haskins looked from one to other quite mystified have what have to say anything to do with lady great deal to do with jerry light broke in on haskins clouded brain mr crosbie said that have stopped at belldown be where have be hum said tod glancing at arnold did think must have admitted so much tod gerald caught friend arm worry with hint look have mr crosbie anything to do with crime ca say rejoined solicitor stolidly sha speak until tell how got along with rebb haskins threw back in chair made best of scotsman obstinacy have something very important indeed to tell said seriously know likeness between girl macandrew nodded told mr arnold here about about idea of two being twin idea have proved to be correct be twin tod jumped up scattering paper with red hair almost standing on end do mean to say that rebb yes sit down toddy listen said gerald vigorously when legal adviser became quiet related whole of conversation with rebb well be blessed muttered tod rubbing head when narrative be ended what wonderful thing there be something in intuition after jerry think needed much intuition to guess at possible relationship seeing how marvelously alike mavis be to charity wonderful part consists in getting rebb to give away ah said arnold significantly military gentleman be beginning to see that wheel of fortune be turning wrong way with quite right too said tod meditatively what scoundrel man be to be sure well jerry important a what have told be be more interested in movement of mr crosbie mother when tell about can explain what mr arnold have discovered at belldown there be little to tell about rebb came down after came down after rebb asked future bride here to have second look at future home oh so have be here before yes so say time ago be second visit third more like muttered arnold in beard ca be sure of said tod rapidly for heaven sake tell what mean cried haskins jumping up in turn nerve be wearing thin with suspense well then began macandrew shuffling with paper be way mr arnold here be going about country in caravan selling book reached belldown on same day that mavis fled mavis fled at night well well cried macandrew testily know what mean arnold be at belldown on day of night when mavis fled murder be committed be that plain enough yes go on toddy be silly as be solicitor just now not pal said tod with great dignity well then while wandering about belldown arnold saw two lady in motor car one be driving one be being driven be mr berch daughter whom jerry supposed to be at bognor never knew that mr crosbie must drive motor oh yes taught trifle be quite expert at business mentioned to day when stood by carriage how have motored over inch of country what be doing down hereabouts when when be supposed to be at bognor be what want to ask be glad that be on spot gerald thought for few moment how did recognize lady mr arnold major rebb once showed colored photograph of lady to whom be engaged recognized mr crosbie when passed in motor severe looking old lady in black be with mr macandrew tell that be mr berch mother may tell that two lady wore motor goggles veil then how did recognize asked gerald again mr crosbie veil be up a passed pulled down when saw be looking earnestly at motor be going very slowly at moment because hay wain be in front blocking road see well what happened motor went to inn at belldown be about six o'clock two lady have dinner be at inn when left belldown in caravan on way to leegarth where hoped to rescue mavis yes yes yes cried tod impatient at slow way in arnold be speaking late night about ten o'clock passed motor on road between belldown leegarth have broken down mr crosbie be tinkering with machine must think must mend broken motor tod oh expect anything very serious be matter probably driving drive furiously a woman always doe have put gear out of order however arnold passed camped distance outside leegarth so that villager who knew face must not recognize then time after eleven saw motor coming along also skirting village two woman be in thought that have lost way then again fancied that mr crosbie be going to devon maid to see rebb at event motor passed out of sight in darkness may tell that lamp be not lighted so mr crosbie ran risk of police interference rather foolish think seeing did not want to be seen well well said gerald after pause what doe mean arnold went on tod cautiously did not attach much importance to motor car business when told fancied that mr crosbie have to do with murder see how do did want to be recognized have lamp so that must slip along easily a learned at belldown did not return through village if did not come down to murder bellaria why be in neighborhood why did lie to about bognor be mare nest have found tod mr crosbie have motive to murder bellaria certainly have nerve will ask myself said tod rising come on over to leegarth chapter xxiv second marriage in anxiety to prove theory tod must then there have taken friend arnold over to pixy house gerald more cool headed than impetuous scotsman pointed out that have not sufficient ground upon to accuse widow if ask to explain movement on night will only refuse to gratify curiosity said haskins positively police must make speak police must not arrest without warrant there be not to mind sufficient evidence to obtain warrant certainly police can not ask question about anyone private affair until reason can be given to show why such question must be asked lady said that be at bognor when really intended to come to devonshire observed arnold who seemed to side entirely with macandrew be woman privilege to change mind mr arnold ask what possible motive must mr crosbie have have to journey way to devonshire to commit unnecessary murder unnecessary snorted tod displeased seeing that murder be ascribed to mavis who may thus be shut up to provide rebb with income can not see that be unnecessary ah mr crosbie did not know that major income depended upon seclusion of mavis said haskins rapidly did not tell a there be reason why must be quite certain that rebb must not explain if mr crosbie have known that income be so uncertain must have refused to marry perhaps will do so now said arnold hopefully have come down to see about repair to pixy house answered gerald rebb love too well to let go believe tod that geary be man who committed murder sound plausible enough grumbled macandrew case must easily be built up against presence of mr crosbie on spot have to be explained gerald rose walked up down room thinking tell what tod said abruptly be getting tired of poking about in dark believe a do arnold doe that mavis be entirely innocent hitherto have kept in hiding so a to prove innocence since may be arrested if be discovered well then think must be best to let be arrested arnold macandrew jumped up wrathfully what exclaimed tod continued what be use of charity sacrifice if intend to hand over mavis to law tod said gerald seriously a thing stand now be not able to force geary mr crosbie rebb to speak if mavis be put on trial can be called a witness then truth may come out also mavis can be examined by two doctor will insist upon when sanity will certainly proved beyond doubt if be proved to be sane then rebb will find in queer street will be hard put to to prove innocence must have done in first case said arnold irritably replied haskins sharply for then did not have evidence to hand that have now rebb geary mr crosbie be implicated may also be able to place venosta in witness box proof that mavis be responsible for act have be shut up in pixy house while rebb enjoyed income will gain sympathy of everyone will go far to show innocence will support throughout case be rebb ward be under twenty one said tod crossly so major may not allow to support propose to take out of major keeping by making wife forthwith said gerald coolly if do sir cried arnold much upset mavis will be arrested indeed doubt if will find clergyman who will marry to seeing that be said to be lunatic be right rejoined haskins easily have arranged that in own mind there be old college chum of late father who can see side of question can trust utterly to day be going to london to repeat experience get special license toddy marriage be expensive matter old boy be tod grunted kicked carpet when be married what do intend to do will bring wife down here within three day will go over to pixy house mr crosbie will not have left by time a from quantity of luggage brought fancy intends to remain for week so then can confront rebb if possible tod wish to bring geary on scene thus actor in tragedy of real life a mr pelham odin must call will be together can bring about fall of curtain with mr gerald haskins in gaol said arnold gloomily mavis will be arrested on rebb information at once be highly probable whether mavis appears early late will have to stand trial seeing that be accused also will have to be examined a to sanity in ordeal intend to be beside a husband there be pause well be forlorn hope said macandrew hesitating risky still looked questioningly at arnold little man nodded sadly thing be so bad that can scarcely be worse remarked certainly a mr haskins think public trial must force witness want into court once in box closely examined truth might come to light think mr haskins must do a say be risk life be risk said gerald cheerfully well be going to pack up clear off to london toddy will keep eye on geary if possible will see mr crosbie mother gerald nodded matter thus being arranged went up to london same afternoon en route for southend there to make mavis wife tod arnold left behind remained at prince hotel wandered about country even a far a leegarth heard that london lady be still with major did not catch glimpse of even tod audacious a be shrank from going to pixy house openly accusing lively widow tod took occasion to pay special visit to devon maid found hotel in charge of rough man slatternly wife appeared that since mr geary disappearance husband have taken heavily to drink refused to attend to business uncivilized instinct have got better of be running wild in neighborhood mr geary now with mother in barnstaple refused to return to to surrender child adonis talked loudly of forcing stubborn will by law a yet have not done anything perhaps because be in danger of law tod learned a much from inspector morgan whom met in silbury high street on third day after gerald departure in search of wife in course of idle conversation about other thing for macandrew during holiday at devon maid have learned to know morgan intimately name of negro be mentioned inspector uttered grunt be black scoundrel that remarked why asked tod pricking up ear always understood that geary be meritorious
