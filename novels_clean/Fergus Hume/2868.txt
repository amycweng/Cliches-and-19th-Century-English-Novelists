tartly oh nothing at nothing at said braddock airily only thought be never mind never mind cockatoo come down with good night good night disappeared well said mr jasher drawing along breath for rudeness selfishness commend to scientist might be mud for what notice take of never mind said miss kendal rising come to drawing room have music archie will stop here care to sit over wine alone said that young gentleman rising will accompany mr jasher lucy stopped at door through widow have already passed what did father mean by hint concerning random think regret giving consent to marriage with whispered back did not hear talk about tomb desire to get money for expedition from random what rubbish sooner than if marriage be stopped by beastly business will sell out will hing of sort interrupted girl imperiously must live if marry have given father enough if random lends money for expedition doe so at own risk be not going to marry sir frank because of step father requirement have right over whether consent not marry darling archie kissed before followed mr jasher into drawing room same foresaw trouble chapter iv unexpected for next two three day archie felt decidedly worried over projected marriage with lucy certainly have to put bluntly purchased braddock consent gentleman must scarcely draw back from plighted word have cost lover so much nevertheless hope did not entirely trust professor a from few word have let drop at dinner party be plain that hankered after money with to fit out expedition in search of mysterious tomb to have alluded archie knew a did professor that must not supply necessary five thousand pound without practically ruining already have crippled resource in paying over price of green mummy have fondly believed that braddock must have be satisfied with relic of peruvian humanity seemed that professor having got what wanted now clamored for what be at present beyond reach mummy be property desired content of queen tahoser tomb also particular moon cried for be very expensive article hope did not see how must gain unless here came in cause of archie worry unless five thousand pound be borrowed from sir frank random professor must have to content with maltese mummy from what young man have seen of braddock longing for especial sepulchre desired to loot believed that scientist must not readily surrender whim random must easily lend give money since be extremely rich extremely generous be improbable that must aid braddock without quid pro quo a sole desire of baronet heart be to make lucy wife must easily be guessed that must only assist professor to realize ambition on condition that savant used influence with step daughter meant breaking of engagement with hope marriage of girl to soldier of course such state of thing must make lucy unhappy braddock cared very little for to gratify craze for egyptian research must be willing to sacrifice dozen girl like lucy undoubtedly lucy must refuse to be passed along from one man to like bale of good archie knew so far a in lay must keep to engagement especially a denied braddock right to dispose of hand same professor in spite of cherubical look must make extremely disagreeable undoubtedly must do so if thwarted sole course remained must braddock begin operation to break present engagement must be to marry lucy at once archie must willingly have done so pecuniary difficulty stood in way have never told one of not even girl loved existed same for many year have be assisting needy relative thus have hampered in spite of income by sheer force of will so a to force braddock into giving lucy have contrived to secure necessary thousand pound without confusing arrangement have made to pay off certain debt connected with domestic philanthropy brought to end of resource in six month hoped to be free to have income entirely to then small a be must support wife until half year elapsed must see chance of marrying lucy with degree of comfort meanwhile must be exposed to persecution of professor perhaps persecution be too harsh word a braddock be kind enough to girl nevertheless be pertinacious in gaining aim where pet hobby be concerned undoubtedly must see chance of obtaining money from random by selling step daughter must do so assuredly be dishonorable to act in way professor be scientific jesuit deemed that end justified mean when glory to gain to british museum be in question may be doing injustice said archie when be explaining fear to miss kendal on third day after dinner party after professor be gentleman will probably hold to bargain have made care whether doe not cried lucy who have fine color certain amount of fire in eye be not going to be bought sold to forward nasty scientific scheme father can say what like do what

brought book to read under glowing wall there ripened like peach in warm sunshine on occasion brought archie into old world garden a have hinted at confidence time have come to speak plainly a hope began to think that have not treated lucy quite fairly in hiding from momentarily embarrassed position why ca marry at once asked lucy seeing that lover held peace looked confused hope did not reply

chisel a though be bolton head be left to be stolen by scientific thief come along while professor assisted by cockatoo loosened lid of packing case mild voice be heard at door lucy turned a did archie to see widow anne curtseying on threshold of door braddock took notice of entrance being occupied with task even while doing swore scientifically under breath be furious against bolton for neglect of duty hope rather sympathized with be serious matter to have left valuable object like green mummy to rough care of laborer beg pardon lady whimpered widow anne who looked more lean rusty

terrible content of packing case startled terrified present faint white lucy clung to arm of lover to keep from sinking to ground a mr bolton have done archie stared at grotesque rigidity of body a though have be changed into stone while professor braddock stared likewise scarcely able to credit evidence of eye only kanaka be unmoved squatted on ham indifferently surveying living dead a savage must not be expected to have nerve of civilized man braddock who have dropped chisel hammer in first movement of surprise be quickest to recover power of speech sole question asked revealed marvelous egotism of scientist nominated by one idea where be mummy of inca caxas murmured with bewildered air widow anne groveling on floor pulled gray lock into wild confusion uttered cry of mingled rage

braddock stamped again take away take away cried testily keep out of sight be not enough to have lost invaluable assistant costly mummy of infinite historical archaeological value without being accused of of oh professor choked with rage shook hand in air seeing that be unable to speak lucy seized opportunity of lull in storm hurried old woman sobbing moaning up stair by time shriek of mr bolton wordy wrath of braddock have drawn cook husband along with housemaid from basement to ground floor sight of surprised face only added to master anger advanced furiously go downstairs again go down tell if there be anything wrong sir ventured gardener timidly everything be wrong mummy have be lost mr bolton have be murdered police be coming choked again servant waited to hear more mere mention of word murder police sent pale faced startled down to basement where huddled like flock of sheep braddock looked around for hope found that have opened front door have vanished be too distracted to think why archie have gone there be much to do in putting thing straight beckoning to cockatoo stalked into side room scribbled pencil note to inspector of police at pierside telling of what have happened asking to come at once to pyramid with underling communication dispatched by cockatoo who flew to get bicycle in short time be riding at top speed to brefort be on side of river facing pierside there must ferry across to town deliver terrible message having done that must until police came braddock walked out of front door into roadway to see if be in sight must not see young man a luck must have by one of coincidence be much more common than be suspected saw gartley doctor walking briskly past hi shouted professor who be purple in face perspiring profusely hi there dr robinson want come come hurry man hurry ended in testy rage doctor knowing braddock eccentricity advanced with smile be slim dark young medical practitioner with amiable countenance argued of mighty intelligence well professor remarked quietly do want to attend for apoplexy take time dear sir take time patted scientist on shoulder to soothe clamorous rage be already purple in face let blood rush to head robinson be fool shouted braddock glaring at suave look of doctor be in perfect health damn sir then miss kendal be quite well also bolton oh robinson looked interested have returned with mummy mummy bellowed braddock stamping like insane cupid mummy have arrived really professor surprise said doctor mildly will surprise more growled braddock dragging robinson into garden up step gently gently dear sir said doctor who really began to think that much learning have made professor mad did bolton bolton be dead fool dead doctor nearly tumbled backward down step murdered at least think be murdered at event arrived here to day in packing case must have contained green mummy come in examine body at once braddock pushed back doctor just a fiercely a have dragged forward wait until constable come want to see body first to observe nothing have be touched have sent for pierside inspector to come there will be sort of trouble cried braddock despairingly work most important work will be delayed just because silly young as sidney bolton chose to be murdered professor stormed up down hall shaking impotent arm in air good heaven stammered robinson who be young in year somewhat new to profession must be mistaken mistaken mistaken shouted braddock with glare come see that poor fellow body then be dead murdered by whom hang sir how must know in what way have be murdered stabbed shot know know nuisance to lose man like bolton invaluable assistant what will do without really know mother have be here making end of fuss can blame said doctor recovering breath be mother after poor bolton be only son be not denying relationship confound snapped professor ruffling hair until stood up like crest of parrot need ah glanced through open door then rushed to threshold here be hope painter come in come in have doctor here hope have key observe constable that mr hope have key open door open door let see meaning of dreadful crime crime sir queried constable who have heard be known from hope now wished to hear what braddock have to say yes crime crime idiot have lost mummy thought sir that murder oh of course of course gabbled professor a if death be quite minor consideration bolton dead murdered suppose a must scarcely have nailed down in packing case be precious mummy be thinking of painter mummy if know what mummy be that cost nine hundred pound go in man go in stand there gaping see that mr hope have opened door have sent cockatoo to pierside to notify police will soon be here meanwhile doctor can examine body painter here can give opinion a to who stole mummy assassin stole mummy said archie a four men entered museum substituted body of murdered man be b c snapped braddock issuing into vast room want to know name of assassin if be to revenge bolton get back mummy oh what loss what loss have lost nine hundred pound say one thousand considering cost of bringing inca caxas to england archie forebore to remind professor a to who have really lost money a scientist be not in fit state to be talked to reasonably seemed much more concerned because peruvian relic of humanity have be lost than for terrible death of sidney bolton by time painter fair haired young constable of small intelligence be examining packing case surveying dead dr robinson also looked with professional eye braddock wiping purple face gasping with exhaustion sat down on stone sarcophagus archie folding arm leaned against wall waited quietly to hear what expert in crime medicine must say packing case be deep wide long made of tough teak banded at interval with iron band within be case of tin when held mummy have be soldered up impervious to air water unknown person who have extracted mummy to replace by murdered man body have cut open tin casing with sharp instrument there be straw round tin casing straw within amongst body of unfortunate young man be placed rigor mortis have set in corpse with straight leg hand placed stiffly by side lay against back of tin casing surrounded more le by straw packing at least by so much a professor have not torn away face looked dark eye be wide open staring robinson stepped forward ran hand round neck uttering ejaculation removed woollen scarf dead man have probably worn to keep from catching cold who looked on saw that red colored window cord be tightly bound about throat of dead poor devil have be strangled said doctor quietly see assassin have left bow string on have courage to place over scarf belonged to bolton how do know that sir asked painter heavily because widow anne knitted that scarf for bolton before went to malta showed to laughingly remarking that mother evidently thought that be going to lapland when did show to sir before went to malta of course said robinson in mild surprise suppose showed to when returned when did return to england asked professor with afterthought yesterday afternoon about four o'clock replied braddock then from condition of body doctor felt dead flesh must have be murdered last night h be with permission painter will examine corpse constable shook head better wait sir until inspector come said in unintelligent way poor sid why knew be at school with now be dead who killed none of listener must answer question chapter vi inquest like geographical lord byron isolated village of gartley awoke one morning to find famous previously unknown save to inhabitant of brefort jessum surrounding country to soldier stationed in fort became nine day centre of interest inspector date of pierside arrived with constable to inquire into reported crime local journalist scenting sensation came flying to gartley on bicycle in trap next morning london be duly advised that valuable mummy be missing that assistant of professor braddock who have be sent to fetch from malta be murdered by strangulation in couple of day three kingdom be ringing with news of mystery mystery proved to be for in spite of inspector date effort enterprise of scotland yard detective summoned by professor clue must be found to identity of assassin briefly story told by newspaper ran a follows tramp steamer diver captain george hervey in command have berthed alongside pierside jetty at four o'clock on wednesday afternoon in mid september two hour later sidney bolton removed case containing green mummy ashore a be impossible to carry case to pyramid on night bolton have placed in bedroom at sailor rest mean little public house of very savory reputation near water edge be last seen alive by landlord barmaid when after drink of harmless ginger beer retired to bed at eight leaving instruction to landlord overheard by barmaid that case be to be sent on next day to professor braddock of gartley bolton hinted that might leave hotel early must probably precede case to destination so a to advise professor braddock necessarily anxious of safe arrival before retiring paid bill deposited in landlord hand small sum of money so that case might be sent across stream to brefort thence to be taken in lorry to pyramid there be sign said barmaid landlord that bolton contemplated suicide that feared sudden death whole demeanor be cheerful expressed exceedingly glad to be in england once more at eleven on ensuing morning persistent knocking subsequent opening of door of bolton bedroom proved that be not in room although tumbled condition of bed clothes proved that have taken rest one in hotel thought anything of bolton absence since have hinted at early departure although chamber maid considered strange that one have seen leave hotel landlord obeyed bolton instruction sent case in charge of trustworthy man to brefort across river there lorry be procured case be taken to gartley where arrived at three in afternoon be then that professor braddock in opening case discovered body of ill fated assistant rigid in death with red window cord tightly bound round throat of corpse at once said newspaper professor sent for police later insisted that smartest scotland yard detective must come down to elucidate mystery at present police detective be engaged in searching for needle in haystack so far have met with success such be tale set forth in local london provincial journal widely a be discussed many a be theory offered one must fathom mystery agreed that failure of police to find clue be inexplicable be difficult enough to understand how assassin must have murdered bolton opened packing case removed mummy to replace by body of victim in house filled with at least dozen people be yet more difficult to guess how criminal have escaped with so noticeable object a mummy bandaged with emerald hued woollen stuff woven from hair of peruvian llama if culprit be one who thieved murdered for gain must scarcely sell mummy without being arrested since england be ringing with news of disappearance if scientist impelled to robbery by archaeological mania must not possibly keep possession of mummy without someone learning that possessed meanwhile thief plunder have vanished a completely a if earth have swallowed great be wonder at cleverness of criminal many be solution offered to account for disappearance one enterprising weekly paper improving on limerick craze offered furnished house three pound week for life to fortunate person who must solve mystery a yet one have won prize be early day yet at least five thousand amateur detective tried to work out problem naturally hope be sorry for untimely death of bolton whom have known a amiable clever young man be also annoyed that loan of money to braddock must have be so to speak nullified by loss of mummy professor be perfectly furious at double loss of assistant embalmed corpse be only prevented from offering reward for discovery of thief assassin by painful fact that have money hinted to archie that reward must be offered that young man backed by lucy declined to throw away good money after bad braddock took refusal so ill that hope felt perfectly convinced must try wriggle out of promise to permit marriage persuade lucy to engage to sir frank random must baronet be willing to offer reward hope be also certain that braddock singularly obstinate man must never rest until once more have mummy in possession that murderer of sidney bolton must be hanged be quite minor consideration with professor meanwhile widow anne have insisted on dead body being taken to cottage braddock with consent of inspector date willingly agreed a did not wish newly dead corpse to remain under roof therefore remains of unfortunate young man be taken to humble home here body be inspected by jury when inquest took place in coffee room of warrior inn immediately opposite mr bolton abode there be large crowd round inn a people have come from far wide to hear verdict of jury gartley for first only time in existence presented aspect of august bank holiday coroner elderly doctor with short temper caused by unrealized ambition of country practitioner opened proceeding by snappy speech in set forth detail of crime in same bold fashion in have be published by newspaper plan of sailor rest be then placed before jury coroner drew attention of twelve good lawful men to fact that bedroom occupied by deceased be on ground floor with window looking out on to river merely stone throw away so will see gentleman said coroner that difficulty of assassin in leaving hotel with plunder be not so great a have be imagined have merely to open window in quiet hour of night when one be about pas mummy through to accomplice who probably waited without be also probable that boat be waiting by bank of river mummy having be placed in assassin friend must row away into unknown without slightest chance of discovery inspector date tall thin upright man with iron jaw severe expression drew coroner attention to fact that there be evidence to show that assassin have accomplice what have stated sir may have occurred rasped date in military voice can not prove truth of assumption since evidence at disposal be merely circumstantial never suggested that be anything else snapped coroner waste time in traversing statement say what have to say mr inspector produce witness if have there be witness who can swear to identity of murderer said inspector date coldly determined not to be ruffled by apparent antagonism of coroner criminal have vanished one can guess name occupation even reason led to slay deceased coroner reason be plain wanted mummy inspector why must want mummy coroner be what wish to find out inspector exactly sir wish to learn reason why murderer strangled deceased coroner know reason what wish to know be why murderer stole mummy must point out to mr inspector that a yet even know sex of assassin might be woman who murdered deceased professor braddock who be seated near door of coffee room being even more irascible than usual rose to contradict there be scrap of evidence to show that murderer be woman coroner be out of order sir must point out that a yet inspector date have produced witness date glared coroner be old enemy always sparred when met seemed likely that peppery little professor must join in quarrel that there must be duel of three date not wishing for adverse report in newspaper a to conduct of case contented with glare aforesaid after short speech called braddock professor looking more like cross cherub than ever gave evidence tartly seemed ridiculous to prejudiced mind that fuss must be made over bolton body when mummy be still missing however a discovery of criminal must assuredly lead to regaining of precious peruvian relic curbed wrath answered coroner question in fairly amiable fashion after braddock have very little to tell have so stated seen advertisement in newspaper that mummy swathed in green bandage be to be sold in malta have sent assistant to buy bring home be done what happened after mummy left tramp steamer be known to everyone through medium of press with grumbled professor agree what do mean by asked coroner sharply mean sir snapped braddock equally sharply that publicity given by newspaper to detail will probably place assassin on guard why not on guard persisted coroner wilfully rubbish rubbish rubbish mummy be stolen by woman what devil must woman want with mummy be more respectful professor then talk sense doctor two glared at one after moment two situation be adjusted in silence coroner asked few question pertinent to matter in hand have deceased enemy sir have not being famous enough rich enough clever enough to excite hatred of mankind be simply intelligent young man who worked excellently when supervised by mother be washerwoman in village lad brought washing to house noting that be intelligent be anxious to rise above station engaged a assistant trained to do work archaeological work yes wash whatever bolton mother may do ask silly question be more respectful said coroner again grew red have idea a to name of anyone who desired to obtain possession of mummy daresay dozen of scientist in line of business must have liked to get corpse of inca caxas such a reeled out list of celebrated men nonsense growled coroner famous men like mention must not murder even for sake of obtaining mummy never said that must retorted braddock wanted to hear who must like to have mummy have told coroner waived question be there jewelry on mummy likely to attract thief asked how devil must know fumed professor never unpacked mummy never even saw jewelry buried with inca caxas must be bound up in bandage so far a know bandage be never unwound can throw light on subject ca bolton went to get mummy brought home understood that must personally bring precious charge to house did why know when professor stepped down still fuming at what considered be unnecessary question of coroner young doctor who have examined corpse be called robinson deposed that deceased have be strangled by mean of red window cord that from condition of body must judge death have taken place twelve hour more le before opening of packing case by braddock be at three o'clock on thursday afternoon so in witness opinion crime be committed between two three on previous morning ca be absolutely certain a to precise hour added witness at rate poor bolton be strangled after midnight before three o'clock be wide margin grumbled coroner jealous of brother practitioner be there other wound on body can see for if have inspected corpse coroner thus reproved glared widow anne appeared after robinson retired stated with many sob that son have enemy be good kind young man also related dream be flouted by coroner who did not believe in occult however narration of premonition be listened to with deep interest by in court widow anne concluded evidence by asking how be to live now that boy sid be dead coroner professed unable to answer question dismissed samuel quass landlord of sailor rest be next called proved to be big burly red haired red whiskered man who looked like sailor indeed few question elicited information that be retired sea captain gave evidence gruffly honestly although kept so shady public house seemed straightforward enough told much same tale a have appeared in newspaper in hotel on night there be only wife two child staff of servant bolton retired to bed saying that might start early for gartley paid one pound to get case taken across to river placed on lorry a bolton have vanished next morning quass obeyed instruction with result everyone knew also stated that did not know case contained mummy what did think contained asked coroner quickly clothes curio from foreign part said witness coolly did mr bolton tell so told nothing about case growled witness chatted lot about malta know well having put into port frequent when sailor did hint at row taking place at malta no did did say that have enemy no did did strike a man who be in fear of death no did said witness for third time seemed happy enough never thought for one moment that be dead until heard how body have be found in packing case coroner asked manner of question so did inspector date attempt to incriminate quass be vain be bluff straightforward told so far a must be judged everything knew there be nothing for to dismiss eliza flight be called a last witness also proved to be most important a knew several thing have not told to master to reporter even to police on being asked why have kept silence said that desire be to obtain reward might be offered a have heard that there must be reward be willing to tell what knew be important piece of evidence girl stated that bolton have retired to bed at eight on ground floor bedroom have window a marked in plan looked on to river stone throw distant at nine trifle later witness went out to have few word with lover in darkness saw that window be open that bolton be talking to old woman muffled in shawl must not see woman face judge of stature a be stooping down to listen to bolton witness did not take much notice a be in hurry to see lover when returned past window at ten o'clock be closed light be extinguished so thought that mr bolton be asleep to tell truth said eliza flight never thought anything of matter at be only after murder saw how important be must remember everything have yes sir said girl honestly enough have told everything happened on night next morning hesitated well what about next morning mr bolton have locked door know that because few minute after eight on night before not knowing have retired tried to enter room make ready bed for night sang out through door be locked for tried that be in bed be lie also a after nine saw talking to woman at window previously said old woman said coroner referring to note how do know be old ca say if be old young said witness candidly be only manner of speaking have dark shawl over head dark dress must say if be old young fair dark stout lean tall short night be dark coroner referred to plan there be gas lamp near window of bedroom did not see in light oh yes sir just for moment took very little notice have known that gentleman be to be murdered must have taken great deal of notice well about locked door be locked over night sir when went next morning be not locked knocked knocked must get answer a be eleven thought gentleman be sleeping very long so tried to open door be not locked a say added witness with emphasis window be snibbed blind be down be natural enough said coroner mr bolton after interview with woman must of course snib window pull down blind when went away next morning must unlock door begging pardon sir a know did go away next morning being in packing case nailed down coroner must have kicked for very natural mistake have made for saw derisive grin on face around particularly on of inspector date then assassin must have gone out by door said weakly then know how got out cried eliza flight for be up at six front back door of hotel be locked after six be about in passage room doing work master missus others be over place how must murderer walk out sir without of seeing perhaps did took notice oh sir if stranger be around must have taken notice concluded evidence be meagre enough widow anne be indeed recalled to see if miss flight must identify a woman who have be talking to bolton witness failed to recognize widow proved by mean of three friend that have be

who posse quality likely to be envied by around be certain to belong to rank file of humanity unconsidered unit of mankind can always console with undoubted fact that mediocrity be invariably happy such man a random must never set thames on fire certainly have ambition to perform that astounding feat be fond of profession intended to remain in army a long a must desired to marry beget family

be one black white be simply gray being ordinary mixture of good bad a theology have provided hereafter for gray people be hard to imagine where bulk of humanity will go doubt on point never troubled random went to church kept mouth shut pore open vaguely believed that must be right somehow very comfortable if superficial philosophy indeed can easily be guessed that random somewhat colorless personality must never attract lucy kendal since hue of own character be deeper for reason be drawn to hope who possessed that aggressive artistic temperament where good bad be in violent contrast random took opinion from book from other people mind like looking glass reflected came along hope possessed opinion of own right wrong held to in face of verbal opposition must argue did argue when random simply agreed lucy have similar idiosyncrasy inherited from clever father so be just a well that preferred archie to frank have latter young gentleman married must have dwindled to lady random husband must have found too late that have domesticated kind of imitation george eliot when congratulated archie on engagement somewhat ruefully little thought what escape have have professor braddock who did not belong to gray tribe knew nothing of a egyptological study did not permit time to argue on such commonplace matter therefore failed in advance when set out to persuade random into renewing suit a fiery little man afterwards expressed might a well have talked to mollusc for random politely declined to be used a instrument to forward professor ambition at cost of miss kendal unhappiness interview took place in sir frank quarter at fort on day after hervey have called to propose search for corpse be during interview that braddock learned something startled annoyed random at three

tail now sir said glaring at young man like school master what deuce be talking about out with evasion oh hang professor jump down throat spur said random rather annoyed by dictatorial tone never wear spur go on sir argue sir frank must not help laughing although knew that be useless to induce braddock to be civil not that professor meant to be rude especially a desired to conciliate random long year of fighting with other scientist of having own scientific way have turned into kind of school master one know that be most domineering of human race be long story said baronet with shrug smile story story what story 'that be about to tell then random began hurriedly so a to prevent further argument of unprofitable kind be at genoa with yacht there stopped on shore at casa bianca what place be that hotel there met with certain don pedro de gayangos daughter donna inez be gentleman from lima have come to europe in search of green mummy braddock stared what did confounded spaniard want with green mummy demanded indignantly how did know of existence what reason have to try obtain answer sir will let don pedro answer said random dryly arrives in couple of day intends to take room at

to get in way learned that be in malta be for sale quite so quite so rasped professor saw advertisement in newspaper a did wanted to buy over head oh wanted to buy right enough wired to malta said random in reply received letter stating that have be sold to be being taken to england on diver followed diver in yacht arrived at pierside hour after did ah braddock glared begin to see light

don pedro be gentleman man of honor must not stoop to there there braddock waved hand sit down sit down must say such thing professor say what desire to say retorted old gentleman tartly can dismiss subject for time being be only too glad to do so said random who be ruffled out of usual calm by veiled accusation braddock have brought against foreign friend to get to more agreeable subject tell how miss kendal be keeping be ill very ill said professor solemnly ill why hope whom met other day said that be feeling very well very happy so hope think because have forced into engagement random started to foot forced nonsense be nonsense dare to speak like to sir repeat that lucy poor child be breaking heart for young man stared then broke into hearty laugh pardon sir be impossible be confound said braddock who did not like being laughed at know woman know daughter step daughter mean ah perhaps more distant relationship account for ignorance of character said random dryly be quite wrong be in love with miss kendal asked to be wife before went on leave refused saying that loved hope because of refusal took broken heart to monte carlo where lost much more money than have right to lose broken heart seems to have mended quickly said braddock who be trying to suppress wrath at instance of lucy duplicity for so considered oh pooh be only way of speaking laughed young man if heart have be really broken must not have mentioned fact then did not love lucy dared to play fast loose with affection raged braddock stamping be quite wrong said sir frank sharply did love miss kendal must certainly not have asked to be wife when told that loved man stood aside a fellow must must have insisted on on nothing sir be not man to force woman to give heart belongs to person be very glad that miss kendal be engaged to hope a be capital fellow will make better husband than ever must have made besides random shrugged shoulder one nail drive out humph that mean love be not bound to tell private affair professor quite so quite so inez be pretty romantic name know what be talking about sir said random stiffly braddock chuckled having read truth in flush have crept over random tanned face ask pardon said elaborately be old man be father friend must not mind if have be trifle inquisitive say more sir be right agree with random thing be not all right never will be until mummy be discovered now can help in what way asked other uneasily with money understand boy added professor in genial way knew well how to assume must have preferred lucy becoming wife however since prefers hope there be more to be said on score therefore will not make offer came here to make offer sir yes fancied that loved lucy be broken hearted by news of engagement to hope therefore intended to ask to give rather lend five hundred pound on condition that helped to stop professor said random coloring must never have bought miss kendal a wife on term of course of course a say there be more to be

never said anything about donna inez professor braddock of course not modern reticence however can see through brick wall a well a most people understand so let drop subject boy five hundred pound can not lend to professor fact be lost heap of coin at monte carlo be not in position to very good let shelve that also said braddock with apparent heartiness although be really very angry at failure be sorry though a wish to get back mummy to revenge poor sidney bolton death how can five hundred do asked random with interest well drawled professor with eye on young man attentive face captain hervey of diver came to yesterday proposed to search for assassin plunder on condition paid five hundred pound be a know very poor for scientist so wished to borrow five hundred from on condition that lucy wo talk of again said random hurriedly do mean to say that captain hervey know of anything likely to solve mystery say that doe not merely proposes to search from what have seen of man must think that have capacity of good bloodhound must certainly succeed will not move step without money five hundred pound murmured random thoughtfully while professor watched closely can tell how to obtain how in what way don pedro seems to be rich want mummy said baronet so when come here ask to certainly not certainly not raged braddock clapping on hat in fury how dare make such proposition to random if don pedro offer reward hervey find mummy will simply hand over to friend can scarcely do since have bought mummy don pedro be willing to purchase from humph braddock moved to door thinking will reserve decision until man arrives good day departed random did not attempt to detain a be somewhat weary of professor vagary knew very well that braddock must call on don pedro when came to warrior inn join force with in searching for lost good train of thought initiated by professor visit led random to certain drawer whence took photograph of splendid looking beauty to pressed lip wonder if father will

work from nine until four after hour took short walk in garden through village on finishing dinner must glance over scientific publication perhaps by way of recreation play game two of patience at seven invariably retired into own room to renew work retirement to bed took place at midnight so can be guessed that professor got through enormous quantity of work during year more methodical man more industrious man did not exist on occasion even enthusiast wearied of hobby of year routine longing to see brother scientist of own way of thinking must seize must abruptly depart for london to occupy quiet lodging indulge in intercourse with fellow men braddock rarely gave early intimation of urban nostalgia at breakfast must suddenly announce that fit took to go to london must drive to

profaned by servant of house a matter of fact braddock need not have be afraid for lucy knowing step father whim violent temper took care that sanctity of place must remain inviolate sometimes professor came back in couple of day at time absence must extend to week on two three occasion remained absent for fortnight whenever returned said very little about doings to lucy perhaps deeming that dry scientific detail must not appeal to lively young lady a soon a be established in museum again life at pyramid must resume usual routine until braddock again felt want of change wonder be considering nature of work closeness of application that did not more often indulge in bohemian wandering lucy therefore be not astonished when on morning after visit to mr professor announced in

pedro looked thorough castilian gentleman bowed gravely when presented to lady by random mr jasher miss kendal permit to present don pedro de gayangos be charmed said peruvian bowing hat in hand in turn allow lady to introduce daughter donna inez de gayangos archie be also presented to don to young lady after lucy mr jasher while not appearing to look made thorough examination of lady with whom random be in love doubt donna inez be making examination on own account with cleverness of sex three woman while chatting affably learned that there be to be learned from outward appearance of other in three minute miss kendal must not deny what donna inez be very beautiful frankly admitted inwardly of course own inferiority be merely pretty whereas peruvian lady be truly handsome quite majestic in appearance yet about donna inez there be same indefinite barbaric look a characterized father face be lovely dark proud in expression there be aloofness about puzzled english girl donna inez might have belonged to race populating planet of solar system have large black melting eye straight greek nose perfect mouth well rounded chin magnificent hair dark glossy a wing of raven be arranged in latest parisian style of coiffure also gown a two woman guessed in instant be from paris be perfectly gloved booted even if betrayed somehow barbaric taste for color in dull ruddy hue of dress be subdued with black braid yet looked quite well bred woman same whole appearance gave observant onlooker idea that must be more at home in scanty robe glittering with rudely wrought ornament of gold perhaps peru where came from suggested comparison lucy thought flew back to account of virgin of sun professor have once described occurred to perhaps wrongly that in donna inez beheld one who in former day must have be bride of gorgeous inca fear will find england dull after sunshine of lima said lucy having ended swift examination donna inez shivered trifle glanced around at gray misty air through pale sunshine struggled with difficulty certainly prefer tropic to said in musical english father have come down here on business until be concluded will remain in place then must make thing a bright a possible for said mr jasher cheerfully desperately anxious to learn more of new comer must come to see donna inez yonder be cottage thank madame be very good meanwhile don pedro be talking to two young men yes did arrive here earlier than expected be remarking have to return to lima shortly wish to get business with professor braddock finished a speedily a possible be sorry said lucy

subject of missing mummy came uppermost since have disappeared since man who have brought to england be dead might have be thought that nothing more must be said about matter professor braddock harped incessantly on loss be perhaps natural widow anne also talked great deal a to possibility of mummy being found a hoped to learn by mean name of assassin who have strangled poor boy now don pedro de gayangos appeared with strange information that weird relic of peruvian civilization have be stolen from father apparently fate be not inclined to let matter of lost mummy drop be working round to denouement must possibly include solution of mystery of sidney bolton death yet on face of there appeared to be chance of truth becoming known of course when don pedro announced that mummy have formerly belonged to father one be anxious to hear how have be stolen gayangos family be established in lima embalmed body of inca caxas have be purchased from gentleman residing in malta how then have crossed water how have don pedro learned whereabouts only to arrive too late to secure missing property mr jasher be especially anxious to learn thing explained reason to lucy see dear said to girl on day after don pedro arrival in gartley if learn past of horrid mummy may gain clue to person who desired possession of nasty thing so may hunt down terrible criminal once be found mummy may be secured again must be able to return to father out of gratitude must certainly marry seem to think that assassin be man said lucy dryly yet forget that person who talked to sidney through window of sailor rest be woman old woman emphasized mr jasher briskly quite so lucy contradicted eliza flight did not say if woman be old young merely stated that wore dark dress dark shawl over head still mysterious woman be connected in way with murder else must not have be speaking to sidney follow dear talk a though poor mr bolton expected to be murdered for part hold by verdict of wilful murder against person person unknown truth be to be found if anywhere in past of mummy can discover nothing about forget what don pedro said dear remarked mr jasher hastily that mummy have be stolen from father let hear what have to say may find clue be anxious that professor must regain green mummy for reason know of now hear can come to dinner to night well know miss kendal hesitated archie said that must look in evening will ask mr hope also love don pedro be coming daughter likewise needle to say sir frank will follow young lady will be party of six after dinner must induce don pedro to

restored to father mr jasher shrugged plump shoulder father don pedro can arrange desire be that mummy must be found undoubtedly belongs by purchase to professor a have be stolen peruvian gentleman may claim well will come archie also assented lucy who be beginning to be interested in matter affair be somewhat romantic criminal dear criminal said mr jasher rising to take leave be not matter care to mix up with still laughed know why be doing so if have to take trouble to gain husband observed lucy somewhat acidly must remain single life if be a lonely a be retorted plump widow must do best to secure man toy look after must prefer young handsomer husband such a sir frank random for instance a beggar can not be chooser must content with old age famous scientist chance of possible title now mind dear to night at seven not minute later bustled away to prepare for reception of guest seemed to lucy mr jasher be taking great deal of trouble to become mr braddock especially a professor brother might live for many long day yet in case widow must not gain title coveted for year however girl rather sympathized with mr jasher who be companionable soul fond of society circumstance condemned to somewhat lonely life in isolated cottage in rather dull neighborhood so be little to be wondered at must strive to move heaven earth a be doing in hope of escaping from solitude besides although miss kendal did not wish to make close companion of widow yet did not dislike moreover thought that must make professor braddock very presentable wife thinking thus lucy be quite willing to forward mr jasher plan by inducing don pedro to tell knew about missing mummy thus came about six people assembled in tiny pink parlor of mr jasher at hour of seven o'clock required dexterous management to seat whole company in dining room be only trifle larger than parlor however mr jasher contrived to place round hospitable board in fairly comfortable fashion once seated dinner be so good that one felt drawback of scanty elbow room widow a hostess be placed at head of table don pedro a eldest of men at foot sir frank with donna inez faced archie lucy kendal jane who be well instructed in waiting by mistress attended to duty admirably acting a footman butler lucy indeed have offered mr jasher service of cockatoo to hand round wine widow with pretty shudder have declined that dreadful creature with yellow mop of hair give shiver declared considering isolation of district narrow limit of mr jasher income meal be truly admirable being well cooked well served while table be arrayed like altar for reception of various dish mr jasher might be a adventuress certainly proved to be capital housekeeper lucy foresaw that if did become mr braddock professor must fare sumptuously for rest of scientific life when meal be ended widow produced box of superfine cigar of cigarette after left gentleman to sip wine took two young friend to chatter chiffon in tiny parlor said much for mr jasher methodical way considering limited space everything went a saying go like clockwork likewise widow have proved wonderful hostess a kept ball of conversation rolling briskly induced spirit of fraternity uncommon in ordinary dinner party during meal mr jasher have kept off subject of mummy be excuse for entertainment when gentleman strolled into parlor feeling well fed happy hinted at don pedro quest a night be cold peruvian gentleman came from tropic be established in well padded arm chair close to sea coal fire with own fair hand mr jasher gave cup of fragrant coffee be rendered still more agreeable to palate by introduction of vanilla bean with with good cigar for lady gave gentleman permission to smoke don pedro felt very happy easy complimented mr jasher warmly on capability of making fellow creature comfortable be altogether comfortable madame said don pedro rising to make courtly bow in fact so agreeable be foreigner that mr jasher dreamed for one swift moment of throwing over dry a dust scientist to become spanish lady of lima flatter don pedro said waving wholly unnecessary fan out of compliment to guest spanish extraction indeed be very glad that be pleased with poor little house pardon madame house can be poor when be casket to contain such jewel there said lucy somewhat satirically to young men while mr jasher blushed bridled what englishman must turn such compliment reminds one of georgian time be more sober now than father be then said hope smiling be sure if random thought for few minute must produce something pretty go on random brain be not equal to strain after dinner said sir frank a for donna inez did not speak sat smiling quietly in corner of room looking remarkably handsome a young girl lucy be pretty mr jasher be comely widow one have majestic look of spanish lady smiled veritable queen amidst gim crack ornament of mr jasher parlor sir frank who be fathom deep in love must not keep eye off face for few minute conversation be frivolous quite shakespeare musical glass kind of speech then mr jasher who have idea that good dinner must be wasted in charming nothing introduced subject of mummy by reference to professor braddock be characteristic of cleverness that did not address don pedro pointed speech at lucy kendal do hope father will return with mummy observed after dexterous allusion to late tragedy think have gone to look for replied miss kendal indifferently surely desired to get back after paying nearly one thousand pound for said mr jasher with well feigned astonishment oh of course must scarcely look for in london have professor braddock gone to search for mummy asked don pedro answered lucy be visiting british museum to make research in egyptian department when do expect back please lucy shrugged shoulder ca say don pedro father come go a whim take spanish gentleman looked thoughtfully into fire will be glad to see professor when return said in excellent slow sounding english concern about mummy be deep dear remarked mr jasher shielding fair cheek with unnecessary fan venturing on joke be mummy relative yes madame replied don pedro gravely unexpectedly at one very naturally looked astonished that be save donna inez who still preserved fixed smile mr jasher took mental note of same decided that young lady be not very intelligent meanwhile don pedro continued speech after glance round circle have blood of royal inca race in vein said with pride have murmured widow to herself then that account for love of color be so un english then raised voice tell about don pedro entreated be usually so dull here that romantic story excites dreadfully know that be very romantic said don pedro with polite smile if will not find dull oh said archie who be a anxious a mr jasher to hear what be to be said about mummy come sir be attention don pedro bowed again again swept circle with deep set eye inca caxas remarked be one of decadent ruler of ancient peru at conquest by spaniard inca atahuallpa be murdered by pizarro a probably know inca toparca succeeded a puppet king died also be suspected that be slain by native chief called challcuchima then manco succeeded be looked upon by historian a last inca of peru be not be news indeed said random lazily who be last inca man who be now green mummy inca caxas ventured lucy timidly don pedro looked at sharply how do come to know name mentioned just now before heard father mention said lucy who be surprised at sharpness of tone where did professor learn name asked don pedro anxiously lucy shook head can not say go on with story continued with naive curiosity of child yes do pleaded mr jasher who be listening with ear peruvian meditated for few minute then slipped hand into pocket of coat brought out discolored parchment scrawled scribbled with odd looking letter in purple ink somewhat faded did ever see before asked lucy manuscript like answered bending forward to examine parchment carefully don pedro again swept inquiring eye round circle everyone denied having seen manuscript what be asked sir frank curiously don pedro restored manuscript to pocket be account of embalming of inca caxas written by son who be ancestor then be descended from inca said mr jasher eagerly be have right must rule peru a be be poor gentleman with very little money added don pedro with emphasis be why wish to recover mummy of great ancestor be then so valuable asked archie suddenly be thinking of reason why mummy must have be stolen well in be of great value save to archaeologist be don pedro reply have better tell story of how be stolen from father go on go on cried mr jasher be most interesting don pedro plunged into story without further preamble inca caxas held state amidst solitude of andes away from cruel men who have conquered country died be buried manuscript touched pocket be written by son detail ceremony place of sepulchre also give list of jewel with mummy be buried jewel murmured hope under breath thought a much son of inca caxas married spanish lady made peace with spaniard came to live at cuzco brought with for purpose manuscript doe not disclose mummy of father manuscript be lost for year although family de gayangoses became poor member of knew that concealed in corpse of inca caxas be two large emerald of immense value mummy of royal ancestor be treated a sacred thing venerated accordingly afterwards family came to live at lima still dwell in old house how be mummy stolen from asked random curiously be coming to said don pedro frowning at interruption be not in lima at time have met man who stole precious mummy be spaniard answered don pedro slowly be english sailor called vas vas be swedish name observed hope critically man said that be english certainly spoke like englishman so far a foreigner can tell at time when be young man civil war raged in peru father house be sacked vas who have be received hospitably by father when be shipwrecked at callao stole mummy of inca caxas father died of grief charged to get mummy back when peace be restored to unhappy country tried to recover venerated body of ancestor search proved vain a vas have disappeared be supposed that for reason have taken embalmed body out of country be when mummy be lost that unexpectedly came across manuscript detailed funeral ceremony of inca caxas on learning about two emerald be naturally more anxious than ever to discover mummy retrieve fallen fortune by mean of jewel a said search proved vain afterward married thinking to settle down on what fortune remained to did live quietly in lima for year until wife died then with daughter came to europe on visit to search for mummy questioned archie eagerly sir have given up hope of finding chance placed clue in hand at genoa came across newspaper stated that mummy in green case peruvian mummy at be for sale at malta immediately made inquiry thinking that be long lost body of inca caxas so happened be too late a already mummy have be sold to professor braddock have be taken to england on board diver by mr bolton chance have pointed out whereabouts of mummy also brought at genoa into relation with sir frank random don pedro bowed head to baronet a appeared that knew professor braddock thankfully accepted offer to introduce hence be here only to hear that mummy be again lost be peruvian gentleman dramatically waved arm strange story said archie who be first to speak certainly solves at least one part of mystery what be demanded mr jasher quickly show that mummy be stolen on account of emerald pardon be impossible sir said don pedro drawing up lean figure one knew that mummy held two emerald in dead hand learned that only few year ago from manuscript have honor of showing there be that objection assuredly replied hope with composure yet can hardly believe that man must risk neck to steal so remarkable mummy must have difficulty in disposing of did assassin know of emerald must venture much to gain since jewel can be disposed of with comparative ease can not easily be traced same said random looking up see how assassin must have learned that jewel be wrapped in bandage humph said hope glancing at de gayangos perhaps there be more than one copy of manuscript speak of not to knowledge sailor vas might have copied don pedro shook head be written in latin since spanish priest taught son of inca caxas who wrote that language think that vas knew latin also if vas have copied manuscript must have stripped mummy to procure jewel now in newspaper advertisement stated that bandage of mummy be intact a also be verdant case said don pedro decisively be quite of opinion that vas indeed everyone else be ignorant of manuscript seems to suggested mr jasher that must be best to find sailor remarked de gayangos be impossible be twenty year since disappeared with mummy let drop subject until professor braddock return to discus with be accordingly done chapter xii discovery three

refusal cockatoo be supported by miss kendal who have wholesome dread of step father rage must return find that stranger have be making free of sacred apartment peruvian gentleman expressed extremely disappointed so much so indeed that lucy fancied believed braddock have green mummy hidden in museum in spite of reported loss from sailor rest failing to get permission to range through room of pyramid don pedro paid occasional visit to pierside questioned police regarding bolton murder from inspector date learned nothing of importance indeed that officer expressed belief that not until day of judgment must truth become known then occurred to de gayangos to explore neighborhood of sailor rest to examine that public house saw famous window through mysterious woman have talked to deceased noted that looked across stony narrow path to water edge wherefrom rugged jetty ran out into stream for little distance nothing must have be easier reflected don pedro than for assassin to enter by window having accomplished deed to leave in same way bearing case containing mummy few step must carry man burden to waiting boat once craft slipped into mist on river trace must be lost a have truly happened in way peruvian gentleman believed murder theft have be accomplished even supposing thing have happened a surmised still be a far a ever from unraveling mystery while don pedro searched for

down to museum will go to congratulate mr jasher said lucy so be arranged shortly professor braddock retired into sanctum along with devoted cockatoo who displayed lively joy on beholding master once more lucy after being carefully wrapped up by archie set out with young man to congratulate bride elect be just half past nine when started out night be frosty star twinkled like jewel in cloudless sky of dark blue moon shone with hard brilliance on ground be powdered with light fall of snow a young people walked briskly through village footstep rang on frosty earth scrunched snow in quick tread warrior inn be still open a be not late light shone from window of various cottage when two following road through marsh emerged from village saw great mass of fort bulking blackly against clear sky glittering stream of thames marsh outlined in delicate white fairy world of snow moonlight appealed to archie artistic sense lucy approving of same did not hurry to arrive at destination shortly saw squarely fenced acre of ground near embankment wherein mr jasher humble abode be placed light shone through pink curtain of drawing room showing that widow have not yet retired in few minute lover be at gate promptly entered be then that one of odd thing happened must argue that people be possessed of sixth sense archie closed gate after glancing right left walked up snowy path with lucy to right be leafless arbor also powdered with snow against white bulked dark form something like coffin hope out of curiosity went up to what deuce be asked then raised voice in loud surprise lucy lucy come here what be asked running up look pointed to oddly shaped case green mummy chapter xiii more mystery neither lucy archie hope have ever seen mummy knew appearance must present a professor braddock with enthusiasm of archaeologist have often described same to appeared according to braddock on purchasing precious corpse in malta dead assistant have written home full description of treasure trove consequently being advised beforehand hope have difficulty in recognizing oddly shaped case be made somewhat in egyptian form on impulse of moment have proclaimed to be long lost mummy when closer examination by light of lucifer match revealed green hue of coffin wood knew that be right what be mummy in ancient case doing in mr jasher arbor be mute question two young people asked other a stood in chilly moonlight staring at grotesque thing mummy have disappeared from sailor rest at pierside week ago now unexpectedly appeared in lonely garden surrounded by marsh how have be brought there why must have be brought there who have brought to unlikely place be question hard to answer however most obvious thing to do be to question mr jasher since uncanny object be lying within stone throw of home lucy after rapid word two went to ring bell summon lady while archie stood by arbor wondering how mummy came to be there in same way george iii have wondered how apple got into dumpling far wide spread marsh flatly towards shore of river on one side on other sloping up to gartley village twinkled with many light on rising ground distance away fort rose black menacing in moonlight mighty stream of thames glittered like polished steel a flowed seaward a there be only few leafless tree dotted about marshy ground a same ground lightly sprinkled with powdery snow revealed moving object for quite mile so hope must not conceive how mummy case seemed heavy must have be brought into silent garden without bearer being seen be not late soldier be still returning through gartley to fort then again noise must have be caused by so bulky object being through narrow wicket mr jasher inhabiting wooden house be very sea shell for sound might have heard footstep voice if who have brought mummy here there be more than one from size of case must be discovered then mystery of sidney bolton death must be solved very speedily be at moment of reflection that lucy returned to arbor leading mr jasher who be attired in tea gown who looked bewildered what be talking about dear said a lucy led towards arbor declare be ever so much astonished when jane told that wished to speak to be just writing letter to lawyer who have poor brother property in hand announcing engagement to professor mr hope here also well be sure lucy grew impatient at babble did not hear what said mr jasher cried irritably ca use eye look green mummy be in arbor green mummy in arbor repeated mr jasher like child learning word of one syllable staring at black object before three be standing a see said archie abruptly how did come here spoke harshly of course be absurd to accuse mr jasher of knowing anything about matter since have be writing letter still fact remained that mummy have be thieved from murdered man be in arbor naturally be called upon to explain suspicion in tone struck little woman turned on with indignation how did come here repeated now how can tell silly boy have be writing to lawyer about engagement to mr braddock daresay have told yes chimed in miss kendal came here to congratulate only to find mummy be that horrid thing mr jasher stared with eye timidly touched hard green stained wood be case mummy be inside thought that professor opened case to find body of poor sidney bolton argued mr jasher be packing case in archie struck old world coffin be stored be corpse of inca caxas about don pedro told other night how doe come to be hidden in garden hidden mr jasher repeated word with laugh there be not much hiding about why one can see from path from door of house remarked hope significantly did not see when took leave of braddock snapped widow if have must certainly have come to look also professor braddock who be so anxious to recover must not have allowed to remain here then case be not here when professor left to night no left at eight o'clock to go home to dinner when did arrive here questioned hope quickly at seven be sure of time for be just sitting down to supper be here hour said nothing when entered of mummy being in arbor when left at door came to say good bye to did of see object to be sure added mr jasher meditatively did not look particularly in direction of arbor scarcely see how one entering leaving garden must fail to see especially a snow reflects moonlight so brightly mr jasher shivered taking skirt of tea gown flung over carefully attired head be very cold remarked irritably think have better return to house talk there what said archie grimly leave mummy to be carried away a mysteriously a have be brought mr jasher mummy represents one thousand pound of money understood that professor bought so did supplied purchase money therefore intend that must be lost sight of again lucy dear run home again tell father what have found have better bring men to take to museum when be there mr jasher can then explain how came to be in garden without word lucy set off walking quickly anxious to fulfill mission gladden heart of step father with amazing news archie mr jasher be left alone former lighted cigarette while tapped mummy case examined a closely a pale gleam of moonlight permitted mr jasher made move to enter house much a have complained of cold perhaps found flimsy skirt of tea gown sufficient protection seems to mr hope said very tartly that suspect having hand in tapped mummy coffin also pardon observed hope very politely suspect nothing because have ground upon to base suspicion certainly be odd that missing mummy must be found in garden will admit that much admit nothing of sort rejoined coolly only jane live in cottage expect that two delicate woman must move huge thing tapped case again moreover have found mummy must have taken to pyramid at once so a to give professor braddock pleasure will certainly be acceptable wedding present said archie sarcastically pardon said mr jasher in turn have nothing to do with a present otherwise how thing came into arbor really can not say a told professor braddock made remark about when came when left although be at door did not notice anything in arbor indeed can not say if ever looked in direction archie mused glanced at watch professor told lucy that came by six train say that be here at seven yes left at eight what be time now ten o'clock few minute after therefore since braddock saw mummy take that case be brought here by unknown people between eight o'clock quarter to ten about time arrived here with lucy mr jasher nodded put matter very clearly observed dryly have mistaken vocation mr hope must have be criminal lawyer must turn detective be why asked archie with start might ascertain movement on night when crime be committed snapped little widow woman muffled in shawl in much same way a head be now muffled in skirt talked to bolton through bedroom window of sailor rest know hope expostulated dear lady how run on assure must a soon suspect lucy a thank said widow very dryly very tartly merely wish to point out went on archie in conciliatory tone a mummy in case a appears probable be brought into garden between hour of eight ten le fifteen minute that may have heard voice footstep of who carried here heard nothing said mr jasher turning towards path have supper played game two of patience then wrote letter a told before be not going to stand in cold answering silly question mr hope if wish to talk must come inside hope shook head lighted fresh cigarette stand guard over mummy until rightful owner come said determinedly ho rejoined mr jasher scornfully be now at door understood that bought mummy therefore be owner well only hope will find emerald don pedro talked about with light laugh entered cottage archie looked after in puzzled way there be reason to suspect mr jasher so far a saw even though woman have be seen talking to bolton on night of crime yet why must widow refer to emerald be of such immense value according to don pedro hope glanced at case shook primitive coffin anxious for moment to open ascertain if jewel be still clutched grimly in mummy dead hand coffin be fastened tightly down with wooden peg must only be opened with extreme care difficulty also a hope reflected even did manage to open receptacle of dead still must not ascertain if emerald be safe since must be hidden under innumerable swathing of green dyed llama wool therefore let matter rest there staring at river wondered how mummy have be brought to garden in marsh hope recollected that expert have decided mode in mummy have be removed from pierside public house have be passed through window according to inspector date others when taken across narrow path bordered river have be placed in waiting boat after that have vanished until have re appeared in arbor if taken by water once must have be taken by water again there be rude jetty behind embankment hope must easily see from where stood in probability mummy have be landed there carried to garden while mr jasher be busy with supper game of card letter also path from shore to house be very lonely if care have be exercised be probable one from fort road from village street must have seen stealthy conspirator bringing weird burden so far hope felt that must argue excellently who have brought mummy to garden why have be brought there question must not answer so easily indeed not at while thus meditating heard far away in frosty air puffing blowing panting like impatient motor car before must guess what be braddock appeared simply racing along marshy causeway followed closely by cockatoo at distance away by lucy little scientist rushed through gate flung open with noise fit to wake dead lunged forward to fall with outstretched arm upon green case there remained still puffing blowing looked a though be hugging huge green beetle cockatoo who being lean hard kept breath more easily stood respectfully by waiting for master to give order lucy came in quietly by gate smiling at father enthusiasm at same moment mr jasher well wrapped up in coat of sable emerged from cottage heard coming professor called out hurrying down path must think whole fort heard professor coming said hope glancing at dark mass soldier must think be invasion braddock paid heed to jocularity even to mr jasher to whom have be so lately engaged soul be in mummy case a soon a recovered breath loudly proclaimed joy at miraculous recovery of precious article mine mine roared word ran violently through frosty air be calm sir advised hope be calm calm calm bellowed braddock struggling to standing position confound sir how can be calm when find what have lost have mean groveling soul hope not soaring spirit of collector there be need to be rude to archie father corrected lucy sharply rude rude be never rude mummy braddock peered closely at rapped wood to assure be phantom yes be mummy mummy of inca caxas now will learn how peruvian embalmed royal dead mine mine mine crooned like mother over child caressing coffin then suddenly drew upright fixed mr jasher with indignant eye so be madam who stole mummy declared venomously thought of making wife oh what escape have have shame woman shame mr jasher stared then face grew redder than rouge on cheek stamped furiously in neat louis quinze slipper in have in judiciously come out how dare say what have said cried voice shrill hard with anger mr hope have be saying same thing be mad never set eye on horrid thing in life only to night told that loved yes yes said many foolish thing doubt madam be not question mummy mummy rapped wood furiously how doe mummy come to be here know said mr jasher still furious care care care when look forward to helping in lifework a wife will never be wife cried widow stamping again must be wife for thousand million pound marry mummy horrid red faced crabbed little hush hush whispered lucy taking angry woman round waist must make allowance for father be so excited over good fortune that will not make allowance interrupted mr jasher angrily practically accuses of stealing mummy if did that must have murdered poor sidney bolton cried professor wiping red face never hinted at thing mummy be in garden what of know how came there mr hope surely support professor braddock in preposterous accusation bring accusation stuttered professor do mr jasher be excited now go in sleep to morrow will talk reasonably brilliant speech be from hope wrought mr jasher into royal rage well gasped asks to be calm a be very calmest person here declare oh will be ill lucy seized girl hand dragged towards cottage come in give red lavender will be in bed for day day day oh what brute men can be listen two horror indicated braddock hope a pushed open door if dare to say word against will have action for libel against oh dear how very ill feel lucy darling help oh help oh oh oh flopped down on threshold of home with cry archie archie be fainted hope rushed forward raised stout little woman in arm jane attracted by clamor appeared on scene between three of managed to get mr jasher placed on sofa of pink drawing room certainly be in dead faint so hope left to administration of lucy servant walked out again into garden closing cottage door after found heartless professor quite oblivious to mr jasher suffering so taken up be with newly found mummy cockatoo have be sent for hand cart while be absent braddock expatiated on perfection of relic of peruvian civilization will sell to don pedro asked hope after have done with not before snapped braddock hovering round treasure will want percentage on bargain also archie thought privately that if braddock unswathed mummy must find emerald must probably stick to so that expedition to egypt might be financed that case don pedro must no longer wish to buy corpse of ancestor while debated a to advisability of telling professor of existence of emerald cockatoo returned with hand cart have lost mr jasher said hope while assisted professor to hoist mummy on to cart never mind never mind braddock patted coffin have found something much more to mind something ever so much better have have chapter xiv unexpected happens in spite of newspaper letter tape machine telegram such like aid to speedy diffusion of news same travel quicker in village than in city word of mouth can spread gossip with marvelous rapidity in sparsely inhabited community since be obvious that in such place person know other a saying go inside out in english village wall have ear window have eye so that cottage be hot bed of scandal what be known to one be within hour known to others even sphinx must not have preserved secret long in such locality gartley must keep up reputation in respect along with best therefore be little to be wondered at early next morning one knew professor braddock have found long lost mummy in mr jasher garden have removed same to pyramid without unnecessary delay be not particularly late when hand cart with uncanny burden have passed along sole street of place several men have emerged from warrior inn ostensibly to offer help really to know what eccentric master of great house be doing braddock brusquely rejected offer oddly shaped mummy case stained green having be seen needed little wit for who have caught sight of to put two two together especially a weird object have be described at inquest have be talked over ever since in cottage a cart have be seen coming out of widow garden naturally occurred to villager mr jasher have be concealing mummy shortly rumor spread that have also murdered bolton for unless have done so certainly according to village logic must not have be possessed of spoil finally a mr jasher door window be small mummy be rather bulky be natural to presume that have hidden in garden report said have buried have dug up just in time to be pounced upon by rightful owner from can be seen gossip be not invariably accurate however may be news of professor braddock good fortune shortly came to don pedro ear through medium of landlady a revealed what have heard in morning peruvian gentleman be spared sleepless night a soon a learned truth be surprising enough in unexpectedness hastily finished breakfast hurried to pyramid a yet have not intended to see braddock so promptly at least not until have made further inquiry at pierside news that braddock possessed royal ancestor of de gayangoses brought immediately into museum greeted professor in usual grave dignified manner one must have guessed from inherent calmness that unexpected news of braddock arrival still more unexpected information about green mummy have surprised beyond measure being somewhat superstitious also occurred to don pedro that coincidence meant good fortune to in recovery of long lost ancestor braddock already knowing great deal about don pedro from lucy archie hope be only too pleased to see peruvian hoping to find in kindred spirit a yet professor be not aware of content of ancient latin manuscript revealed fact of hidden emerald since hope have decided to leave to peruvian to impart information archie knew very well that don pedro a have plainly stated wished to purchase mummy be only right that braddock must know what be selling hope forgot one important fact perhaps from careless way in don pedro have told story namely that professor in second degree be receiver of stolen good therefore be more than probable that peruvian must claim mummy a own property still in event must have to prove claim must not be easy plump little professor have not yet unsealed case when don pedro entered be standing before rubbing fat hand with gloating expression in face however a cockatoo have brought in peruvian card braddock expected visitor wheeled to face how be sir said extending hand be glad to see a hear that know about mummy of inca caxas well do answered de gayangos sitting down in chair host pushed forward may ask who told that mummy be that of last inca braddock pinched plump chin replied readily enough certainly don pedro wished to learn difference in embalming between egyptian ancient peruvian looked about for south american corpse unexpectedly saw in several european newspaper in two english journal that green peruvian mummy be for sale at malta for one thousand pound sent assistant sidney bolton to buy managed to get coffin for nine hundred while in malta before started back in diver with mummy wrote account of transaction seller who be son of maltese collector told bolton that father have picked up mummy in twenty more year ago came from lima thirty year back believe according to collector in paris be corpse of inca caxas be whole story don pedro nodded gravely be there latin manuscript delivered along with mummy asked braddock eye opened widely sir mummy came thirty year ago from lima to paris passed twenty year back into possession of maltese collector son sold to few month ago never heard of manuscript then mr hope did not repeat to what told other night professor sat down mouth grew obstinate mr hope related story told others about mummy having be stolen from from father corrected unsmiling peruvian keeping careful eye on host be really case inca caxas be be ancestor manuscript don pedro produced same from inner pocket detail funeral ceremony very interesting most interesting fussed braddock stretching out hand may see read latin observed don pedro surrendering manuscript braddock raised eyebrow of course said simply well educated man read latin must do so wait sir until glance through document one moment said don pedro a professor began to literally devour discolored page know from hope have doubt how chance upon own property in europe braddock still with eye on manuscript mumbled own property quite so quite so admit that then will doubt restore mummy to by time drift of don pedro observation entirely reached understanding of scientist dropped document be reading to leap to foot restore mummy to gasped why be mine pardon said peruvian still gravely very decisively admitted that belonged to braddock face deepened to fine purple did know what be saying protested how must say be property when have bought for nine hundred pound be stolen from have got to be proved said braddock caustically don pedro rose looking more like don quixote than ever have honor to give word yes yes be right cast imputation on honor must think not said other coldly strongly same can scarcely expect to part with so valuable object braddock waved hand towards case without strict inquiry into circumstance again sir even if succeed in proving ownership be not inclined to restore mummy to for nothing be stolen property be keeping from know nothing about have only bare word that be so don pedro know be that paid nine hundred pound for mummy that cost best part of hundred to bring to england what have keep like country said peruvian sarcastically precisely replied professor suavely englishman have bull dog tenacity of purpose brag be good dog don pedro holdfast be better one then understand said peruvian stretching out hand to pick up fallen manuscript that will keep mummy certainly said braddock coolly since have paid for also will keep jewel manuscript tell from glance obtained of be buried with sole jewel buried be two large emerald mummy hold in hand explained don pedro restoring manuscript to pocket wish for so that may get money to restore fortune of family said braddock forcibly have bought mummy jewel with will sell to supply with money to fit out expedition to tomb of queen tahoser will dispute claim cried de gayangos losing calmness braddock waved hand with supreme content can give address of lawyer retorted step choose to take will only result in loss from what hint must not think that have much money to spend on litigation don pedro bit lip saw that be indeed more difficult task than have anticipated to make braddock yield up prize if be in lima muttered speaking spanish in excitement must then learn that speak truly doubt truth answered professor in same language de gayangos wheeled faced host much surprised speak tongue senor demanded braddock nodded have be in spain have be in peru answered dryly therefore know classical spanish colonial dialect a to being in lima be there wish to go there again a have quite enough of uncivilized part thirty year ago when country be much disturbed after civil war be in lima thirty year ago echoed don pedro then be there when vas stole mummy know who stole even if be stolen said professor obstinately know name of vas ah now remember young hope did say something about swedish sailor who said stole mummy vas did brought to europe to sell probably to man in paris who afterwards sold to maltese collector doubt rejoined braddock calmly what have to do with don pedro want mummy raged other looked dangerous then wo get retorted braddock adopting pugnacious attitude quite composed mummy have caused one death don pedro from look must think must like to cause will not be honest will knock head off if bring honesty into question cried professor standing on tip toe like bantam best thing to do will be to take matter into court then law can decide have little doubt what will decide in favor englishman peruvian glared at one cockatoo who be crouching on floor glanced from one angry face to guessed that white men be quarreling perhaps must come to blow be at moment that knock came to door minute later archie entered braddock glanced at took sudden resolution a stepped forward hope be just in time declared don pedro state that mummy belongs to assert have bought will make umpire want want be to be done mummy be own flesh blood mr hope said don pedro precious little of about said braddock contemptuously archie twisted chair round straddled long leg across with arm resting on back quick brain have rapidly comprehended situation being acquainted with side of question be not difficult to come to decision if be hard that don pedro must lose ancestor mummy be equally hard that braddock rather must lose purchase money seeing that have be paid in good faith to seller in malta for presumably righteously acquired object on premise young solon proceeded to deliver judgment understand said judiciously that don pedro have mummy stolen from thirty year ago that professor bought under impression that maltese owner have right to posse yes snapped braddock daresay maltese owner thought so too since bought from collector in paris hope nodded if vas sold to man in paris said calmly certainly must not tell purchaser that have looted mummy in lima poor man must not know that be receiving stolen good be that right don pedro yes sir said peruvian who have recovered temper gravity declare solemnly that mummy be stolen from father must belong to one dispute that said archie cheerfully ought to belong to professor also since have bought now a ca possibly belong to two people must split difference professor must sell back mummy to don pedro for price paid for then don pedro must recompense professor braddock for loss have not much money said don pedro gravely still be willing to do a say know that be protested braddock noisily there be two emerald be of immense value a don pedro say belong to since mummy be property professor said archie solemnly must do right even if lose by believe story of senor de gayangos mummy with jewel belongs to besides only wish to see way in inca race embalmed dead well then unpack mummy here in presence of don pedro when have satisfied curiosity when senor de gayangos sign check for one thousand pound can take away corpse have have so much trouble over that wonder be not anxious to see last of emerald must sell for much money must defray expense of expedition into egypt to search for queen tomb understood from lucy that mr jasher intended to finance expedition when became wife humph muttered braddock stroking fat chin said few foolish thing to last night when be heated up may not forgive hope woman will forgive anything to man love said archie braddock be fool must not help casting glance at tubby figure be reflected in near mirror seemed incredible that mr jasher must love for look fact that might day be baronet did not strike at moment a consideration however foresaw trouble expense must don pedro go to law a seemed determined to do taking thing into consideration braddock thought that archie judgment be good one yielded well said after reflection let agree will open case examine mummy after be reason why bought when have satisfied a to difference between mode of embalming don pedro can give check take away mummy only hope that will have le trouble with than have have so speaking braddock signing to cockatoo to bring necessary tool laid hand on case be content said don pedro briefly seated in chair beside young daniel who have delivered judgment hope offered to assist professor to open case be dismissed with abrupt refusal though be glad be present to see mummy unpacked said braddock laboring at lid of case for if emerald be missing don pedro might accuse of stealing why must emerald be missing asked hope quickly braddock shrugged shoulder sidney bolton be killed said in low voice be not likely that one must commit murder for sake of mummy then leave stranded in mr jasher garden have doubt about safety of emerald else must not have consented to sell thing back again with honest speech professor vigorously attacked lid of case inserted steel instrument into crack to prize up covering lid be closed with wooden peg in antique perfectly safe manner apparently have not be opened since dead inca have be laid to rest therein hundred of year ago among andean mountain don pedro winced at desecration of dead a have given consent there be nothing left to do to grin bear in wonderfully short space of time considering neatness of workmanship holding power of wooden peg lid be removed then four on looker saw that mummy have be tampered with swathed in green stained llama wool lay rigid in case swathing have be cut hand protruded emerald be gone torn rudely from hard grip of dead chapter xv accusation don pedro professor braddock be amazed angry at disappearance of jewel hope did not express much surprise considering fact of murder be just what expected although must be confessed that be wise after event refer to own word immediately before case be opened professor remarked after first surprise have subsided word word snapped braddock who be anything pleased what word of mine do mean hope said that be not likely that one must commit murder for sake of mummy only then leave stranded in mr jasher garden also declared that have doubt about safety of emerald else must not have consented to sell mummy again to rightful owner professor nodded quite so quite so what say hold to retorted especially a have proved true prophet can both see for yourselves waved hand towards rifled case poor sidney must have be killed for sake of emerald question be who killed person who knew about jewel said don pedro promptly of course who did know be ignorant until told about manuscript hope searched archie face do intend to accuse questioned young man with slight laugh assure professor be ignorant of what have be buried with corpse until don pedro related story other night to myself random lady braddock turned impatiently to de gayangos a did not approve of archie apparent flippancy doe one else know of content of manuscript demanded irritably don pedro nursed chin looked musingly on ground be just possible that vas may vas vas oh sailor who stole mummy thirty year ago from father in lima pooh pooh pooh tell that manuscript be written in latin evidently in monkish latin at be of worst sailor must not read must not know value of manuscript if have must have carried off senor said peruvian politely have idea father made translation of manuscript at event copy understood put in hope still astride of chair that did not find original manuscript until father died be quite true sir assented other readily did not tell everything other night father be who found manuscript at cuzco although can not state authoritatively yet believe be correct in saying that have copy made whether copy be merely transcript actually translation can not tell think be former a if vas reading translation have learned of jewel undoubtedly must have stolen before selling mummy to parisian collector perhaps did said braddock pointing to rifled corpse see that emerald be missing assistant assassin stole insisted don pedro coldly can not be sure of retorted professor although admit that man must jeopardize neck for sake of corpse archie looked surprised enthusiast such a be professor might risk so much for once in life braddock made good humored reply sir not even for mummy must place in power of law think that other scientist must savant may not be worldly be not fool however fact remains that jewel be gone whether be stolen by vas thirty year ago by poor sidney assassin other day know what be more care will examine mummy further in couple of day don pedro can bring check for one thousand remove ancestor cried peruvian hurriedly since emerald be missing be not in position to pay one thousand english pound sir want to take back body of inca caxas to lima a one must show respect to one ancestor fact be can not pay money said that must shouted exasperated professor in bullying way admit senor have hoped to do so when sold emerald a can see be not available therefore body of royal ancestor must remain here until can procure money may be that sir frank random will help in matter must help snapped braddock so why must help don pedro looking more dignified than ever drew up to tall height sir frank said in stately way have done honor of seeking to be son in law a daughter love be willing to permit marriage now have learned emerald be lost will not consent until sir frank buy mummy from professor be only right that daughter hand must redeem regal forefather from purely scientific surroundings that must take mummy back to be buried in lima at same time sir must say that be rightful owner of dead that must surrender mummy to free of charge what lose thousand pound cried braddock furiously sir will hing of sort only wanted mummy for sake of jewel now that be lost care what becomes of confounded ancestor professor must have gone on still more furiously that hope seeing don pedro be growing angry at insult chimed in let throw oil on troubled water said smoothly don pedro be not able to redeem mummy until emerald be found a such be case must find emerald enable to do what be necessary how be to find jewel asked braddock crossly by finding assassin how be to be done asked de gayangos gloomily have be doing best at pierside can not find single clue vas be not to be found vas exclaimed archie professor profoundly astonished don pedro raised eyebrow certainly vas if anyone must have killed assistant since alone must have known that jewel be buried with inca caxas dear sir argued hope good naturedly if vas stole manuscript whether translated not certainly must have learned truth long long ago since thirty year have elapsed in event must have stolen jewel a professor braddock remarked lately before sold mummy to parisian collector may be so said don pedro obstinately while professor muttered approval can not be certain on point one agree with professor in must have risked neck to steal mere mummy therefore motive for committal of crime must have be emerald only vas knew of existence outside dead father therefore must be assassin will hunt for when find will have arrested ca possibly recognize man after thirty year argued braddock disbelievingly have royal memory for face said don pedro imperturbably in past saw much of vas be then young sailor of twenty humph muttered braddock be now fifty must have changed in thirty year will never recognize oh think so said peruvian smoothly eye be peculiarly blue full of light also have scar on right temple from blow received in street riot in also be concerned finally gentleman vas loved peon girl on father estate induced to have sun encircled by serpent peruvian symbol tattooed on left wrist with mark with memory for face never yet have failed have doubt what will recognize man then then will have arrested hope shrugged square shoulder have not much belief in don pedro boasted royal memory did not think that must recognize young sailor of twenty in what must certainly be grizzled old salt of fifty year however be possible that man might be right in surmise since vas alone must have known about emerald only doubt be whether must have waited for thirty year before looting mummy archie said nothing of thought a must only serve to prolong unprofitable discussion made one suggestion best plan said suggestively be to write description of vas who by way have probably changed name hand to police with promise of reward if be found be very poor senor surely professor here can offer nothing said braddock quickly a be quite a poor a be if not more so sir frank might help added sarcastically will not ask said don pedro loftily if sir frank chooses to become son in law by purchasing back royal ancestor to have right be willing that must be so poor a be will offer reward since honor of de gayangoses be involved in matter what reward do suggest mr hope five hundred pound said professor quickly too much said hope sharply far too much make reward one hundred pound don pedro be enough to tempt many man peruvian bowed noted down amount will go at once to pierside see inspector date who have to do with inquest remarked meanwhile professor please desecrate royal ancestor body more than can help will certainly not search for more emerald retorted braddock dryly now clear out of leave to examine mummy cockatoo show gentleman out let one else in don pedro returned to warrior hotel to inform daughter of what have taken place with intention of going in afternoon to pierside meanwhile wrote out full description of vas making allowance for lapse of year explaining scar symbol on left wrist hope also sought lucy related latest development of case girl be not surprised a likewise believed that assassin have desired more than mummy when murdered sidney bolton mr jasher did not know about emerald asked suddenly no replied archie much surprised surely suspect of having hand in devilment certainly not be prompt answer only can not understand how mummy came to be in garden be brought up from river expect why to mr jasher garden hope shook head can not tell that whole thing be mystery seems likely to remain so seems to said girl after pause that must be best for father to return mummy to don pedro have done with since seems to bring bad luck then can marry mr jasher go to egypt on fortune to seek for tomb doubt very much if mr jasher will marry professor now after what said last night nonsense father be in rage said what first came into mind daresay be angry however will see afternoon put matter right be very anxious that professor must marry lady be replied lucy seriously a want to leave father comfortably settled when marry sooner make jasher wife readier will be to let go want to marry a soon a possibly can be tired of gartley of present life of course to speech archie must make only one answer a took form of kissing be entirely satisfactory to miss kendal then discussed future also proposed engagement of sir frank random to peruvian lady left subject of mummy alone a be quite weary of matter must suggest solution of mystery meanwhile professor braddock have passed very pleasant hour in examining swathing of mummy pleasure be destined to be cut short sooner than desired a captain hiram hervey unexpectedly arrived although cockatoo a have be instructed did best to keep out sailor forced way in heralded appearance by throwing kanaka head

hundred pound english currency will just fill bill so now know lay be on so long walked quietly out of house leaving archie braddock looking at one with pale face assurance of hervey surprised horrified still must not believe that sir frank random have be guilty of so brutal crime for one thing said hope after pause random did not know where emerald be to be found even that existed understood that did know said braddock reluctantly in hearing in own heard don pedro state that have related story of manuscript to random forget learned about emerald at same time said hope quietly yet yankee skipper doe not accuse knowledge of emerald came to random ear to mine long after crime be committed to have motive for killing bolton stealing emerald random must have have to know when

be offered same met don pedro in genoa be just possible that man told of jewel buried with mummy archie shook head doubt said thoughtfully random be a astonished a rest of when don pedro told arabian night story however point can be easily settled by sending for random daresay be at fort will send cockatoo for at once said professor quickly walked into museum to instruct kanaka archie remained where be seated on chair with folded arm knitted brow be incredible that english gentleman with stainless name well known soldier must commit so terrible crime matter of hervey accusation be complicated by fact of hervey be ignorant that don pedro be willing that random must become son in law hope wondered what fiery proud peruvian must say when heard friend denounced reflection on point be cut short by return of professor who appeared at door of museum dismissing cockatoo when kanaka took departure braddock beckoned to young man there be reason why must talk in hall let whole house know of new difficulty said in testy manner come in here hope entered looked with ill concealed repugnance at uncanny shape of green mummy be lying on long table examined portion where swathing have be cut with sharp instrument to reveal dry bony hand formerly have held costly jewel face be invisible covered with mask of dull beaten gold formerly eye have be jeweled last be now absent pointed out mask to professor who be hovering over weird dead with large magnifying glass be strange said hope earnestly that mask of gold be not stolen also since be so valuable unless melted down mask must be traced said braddock after pause jewel according to don pedro be of immense value so must have be got rid of easily random be satisfied with talk of in way a though guilt be certain said hope wincing well must admit that evidence against be strong purely circumstantial circumstantial evidence have hanged many innocent man before now humph said braddock uneasily hope wo hang friend however will hear what have to say have sent cockatoo to fort to bring here at once if random be absent cockatoo be to leave note in room on writing table must not have be better to have told cockatoo to give note to random servant think not responded braddock dryly random servant be certainly one of most stupid men in entire army must probably forget to give note a be important that must see random at once be better that must find placed personally on writing table by cockatoo upon whom can depend archie abandoned argument a really mattered very little took up line of conversation expect if criminal try to dispose of emerald will be caught said such large jewel be too noticeable to escape comment humph depends upon cleverness of thief said professor who be more taken up with mummy than with conversation might have jewel cut into smaller stone might go to india dispose of to rajah who must certainly say nothing know how criminal act a have never studied method hope that clue mention will be hit upon if only for random sake believe for one moment random be in danger said archie if be will turn detective wish joy replied braddock bending over mummy look hope at wonderful color of wool there be art have lost completely dyeing of surprising beauty be one humph mused archaeologist wonder why particular mummy be dyed green rather why be wrapped in green bandage yellow be royal color of ancient peruvian monarch vicuna wool dyed yellow what do think hope be strange archie shrugged shoulder can say nothing because know nothing said sharply do know be that wish precious mummy have never be brought here have caused trouble ever since arrival well said braddock surveying dead with disfavor must say that will be glad to see last of know now that wanted to know humph wonder if don pedro

back again knock at door said kanaka delivering message hear voice go in find one so put letter on table come down ask soldier tell sir master be coming back in hour must have waited said braddock waving cockatoo aside come along with to fort hope random will come here a soon a return very likely ca wait be anxious to hear what have to say in defense come cockatoo coat hat glove stir scoundrel

striving to keep up with hope longer leg by trotting a hard a must halfway down village met trap in captain hervey being driven to jessum railway station have seen don pedro asked professor stopping vehicle reckon not answered hervey stolidly be gone into pierside to see police be off there also have better come with said archie sternly be going to see sir frank random give respect said skipper

in disgust what scoundrel man be said professor pettishly 'd sell father for what must get show how much word be to be depended upon expect accusation of random be put up job hope so for random sake said braddock trotting briskly along in short time arrived at fort be informed that sir frank have not yet returned be expected back moment in meanwhile a braddock hope be extremely well known be shown into random quarter be on first floor when soldier servant retired door be closed hope seated near window while braddock trotted round looking into thing be dog kennel said professor told random that perhaps must have waited in mess suggested archie must talk there with lot of silly young fool hanging about told random must never enter mess so invited to come always to quarter be in love with lucy then chuckled professor nothing be too good for not even dog kennel said hope dryly for professor chatter be so rude a to be quite annoying pooh pooh pooh random doe mind joke hope have sense of

have traveled in south america expect be going there come here hope see many many book about peru chili brazil there must be dozen library book too archie sauntered towards shelf expect random be getting up subject of south america so a to talk to donna inez probably probably snapped braddock pulling several of book out of place why there be ah dear what catastrophe might well say so for in desire to examine book tipped off shelf lay in disorderly heap on floor hope began to pick up replace so did author of mischief among book be several paper scribbled with note braddock bundled in heap shortly caught sight of writing on one hullo latin said read line two oh gasped hope hope manuscript of don pedro impossible archie rose stared at discolored paper sorry to have kept said random entering at moment villain shouted braddock furiously so be guilty after chapter xvii circumstantial evidence random be so taken aback by fierce accusation of professor that stood suddenly still at door did not advance into room yet did not look so much afraid a puzzled braddock might have thought hope from expression on young soldier face be more than ever satisfied of innocence what be talking about professor asked random genuinely surprised know well enough retorted professor upon word said other walking into room unbuckling sword find here with content of bookcase on floor promptly accuse of being guilty of what must like to know perhaps can tell hope there be need for hope to tell sir be perfectly well aware of own villainy random frowned allow certain amount of latitude to guest professor said with marked dignity for man of age position go too far be more explicit allow to speak intervened archie anticipating braddock random professor have just have visit from captain hiram hervey who be skipper of diver accuses of having murdered bolton what baronet started back looking thunderstruck wait moment have not finished yet hervey accuses of murder of stealing mummy of gaining possession of emerald of placing rifled corpse in mr jasher garden so that might be accused of committing crime exactly cried braddock seeing that host remained silent from sheer surprise hope have stated case very clearly now sir defense defense defense random found tongue at last spoke indignantly have defense to make ah then acknowledge guilt acknowledge nothing accusation be too preposterous for denial to be necessary do believe of looked from one to other said archie quickly there be mistake thank hope professor braddock fidgeted about room know what to think said at length hervey spoke very decisively oh indeed returned random dryly walking to door locked in case must ask for explanation of will leave room until one be given proof here be one of snapped braddock throwing manuscript on table where did get random took up discolored paper with bewildered air never set eye on before said much puzzled what be copy of manuscript mentioned by don pedro describes two emerald buried with mummy of inca caxas see random understood in moment so say that knew of emerald from so murdered bolton to obtain pardon said braddock with elaborate politeness hervey say that murdered poor assistant although discovery of manuscript prof that must have known about jewel say nothing wait to hear defense be very good of remarked sir frank ironically so seems that be in dock perhaps counsel for prosecution will state evidence against looked again from one to other archie shook baronet by hand very warmly dear fellow declared decidedly believe one word of evidence in case there must be flaw in retorted random did not seem to be unmoved by hope generous action sit down professor appears that be against until hear defense said old man obstinately can not make until hear evidence go on be waiting sir frank flung into chair where sat calmly eye steadily fixed on professor face where did get that manuscript asked braddock sharply got nowhere be first time have seen yet be hidden amongst book then ca say how got there be looking for certainly not to pas time while waiting examined library in pulling out book case being swing one over balanced shot content on to floor amongst paper fell with book caught glimpse of manuscript noting that be written in latin picked up surprised to think that frivolous young man such a be must study dead language few word showed that manuscript be copy of one referred to by don pedro one moment said archie who have be thinking perhaps be original manuscript de gayangos have given to random be good of to afford loophole of escape said sir frank leaning back with folded arm de gayangos gave nothing saw manuscript in hand when showed to at mr jasher whether be original copy ca say don pedro certainly did not give to have don pedro be in quarter asked hope thoughtfully no have only visited in mess even if don pedro did come in here for guess what be in mind really see why must slip manuscript value highly amongst book then really never saw before said braddock indicating paper on table impressed by random earnestness how often do want to deny retorted young man impatiently perhaps will state on what ground be accused braddock nodded cleared throat captain hervey declared that yacht arrived at pierside almost at same time a steamer quite right when don pedro received wire from malta stating that mummy have be sold to that be being shipped to london on diver got up steam at once chased tramp to port a tramp be slow boat be fast arrived on same day almost at same hour even though hervey boat have start of mine why be anxious to follow diver asked hope don pedro wished to get back mummy asked to follow a be in love with donna inez still be be only too willing to oblige braddock nodded again hervey say that went on board diver have interview with bolton be perfectly true visit be paid for same reason a followed steamer to london be acted on behalf of don pedro wished to ascertain for certain that mummy be on board having done so from bolton urged to induce to give back same free of charge to de gayangos from whom have be stolen refused a declared that intended to deliver to knew must always trust bolton said professor enthusiastically must have be better for to have come to random daresay wished a told to make certain that mummy be on board be real reason for visit being in bolton company naturally told that don pedro claimed mummy a property warned that if kept same that there must be trouble did use threat asked hope remembering what have overheard no certainly not yes did cried braddock quickly hervey declares that told bolton that must repent of keeping mummy that life must not be safe while held to surprise of visitor random admitted using serious threat without moment hesitation don pedro told that many indian in lima cuzco who look upon a lawful descendant of last inca be anxiously expecting return of royal mummy also stated that when indian knew who held mummy must send one of to get back if don pedro be did not fetch to get back mummy don pedro declared that indian must not stop short of murder hence warning to bolton oh archie jumped up with widely opened eye then perhaps solves problem bolton be murdered by peruvian indian random shook head gravely again offer loophole of escape dear fellow said sententiously that theory will not hold water at present indian in lima cuzco know that mummy have be found don pedro only chanced upon paper announced sale by accident have time to communicate with barbaric friend in south america failing to get mummy from professor must have returned to peru then must have told who possessed corpse of inca caxas leaving indian to deal with matter in case warning to bolton must be necessary at time told be not necessary however bolton remained true to professor declined to surrender mummy therefore wired to don pedro at genoa that mummy be on board diver be being sent to gartley also advised to come to here in order to be introduced to rest know there be moment silence then archie to test if random be willing to admit everything a innocent man certainly must asked significantly did see bolton again after interview on board ship be then that baronet proved good faith oh yes said easily without hesitation be walking about pierside later passing along waterside alley near sailor rest saw window on ground floor open bolton looking out across river stopped asked when proposed to take mummy to gartley if be on shore admitted that be in hotel declined to say when must send on to professor when closed window afterwards went into hotel have drink in order to ask casually when mr bolton intended to leave gathered not directly of course in roundabout way that have arranged to go next morning to send on luggage then left went to london in course of time returned here learned of murder disappearance of corpse of inca caxas now random stood up having admitted perhaps will believe to be innocent have idea who murdered bolton placed body in packing case asked braddock manifestly disappointed 'no more than have idea of person who placed mummy case content in mr jasher garden oh know said archie quickly yes news be over village morning must hardly help knowing believe that mummy have be taken to house professor have admitted braddock dryly took from mr jasher arbor in hand cart with assistance of cockatoo when made examination morning in presence of hope don pedro found that swathing of body have be ripped up that emerald mentioned in manuscript have be stolen strange said random with frown by whom doubt by assassin of sidney bolton probably random kicked mat straight with foot at rate theft of emerald show that be not indian who killed bolton none of must rifle so sacred corpse besides a say indian in peru know that mummy have reappeared after thirty year seclusion chimed in hope rising well what be to be done now for answer sir frank picked up manuscript still remained on table will see don pedro about said quietly ascertain if be original copy braddock rose slowly stared at paper do know latin asked rejoined random knowing what savant meant learned of course have forgotten much might translate word two certainly not hedge priest latin in be written looked carefully at manuscript a spoke who must have placed in room questioned archie can not learn that until see don pedro if be original manuscript saw other night may learn how passed from possession of de gayangos to bookcase if be copy then must learn if possible who owned don pedro said that transcript translation have be made mentioned hope evidently transcript said braddock glaring at paper in random hand how must find way from lima to place might have be packed up with mummy suggested archie contradicted random decisively in event man in malta from whom mummy be bought must have discovered emerald must have taken perhaps did have nothing to show that bolton assassin committed crime for sake of jewel must have done so cried professor irritably else there be motive for commission of crime think that must start at other end to find clue when discover who placed mummy in mr jasher garden will not be easy murmured hope thoughtfully though of course same must have be brought by river let go down to embankment see if there be sign of boat having be brought there last night moved to door random can not leave fort a be on duty replied officer putting manuscript away in drawer locking same evening will see don pedro in meanwhile will endeavor to learn from servant who visited lately while be absent manuscript must have be brought here by someone trust added a escorted two visitor to door that now acquit of yes yes yes cried braddock hastily cutting short shaking hand apologize for suspicion now maintain that be innocent never believed to be guilty cried hope heartily thank said random simply having closed door returned to chair near fire to smoke pipe meditate

with hervey will be able to silence blackguard be quite sure that hervey be blackguard ended braddock rubbing bald head two lady looked at one in amazement not knowing what to say be ignorant of theft of emerald of accusation of sir frank by yankee skipper with usual absentmindedness braddock have forgotten about sat in chair rubbing head quite pink rattling on cheerfully went down with hope to embankment continued of must see sign of boat there be rude short jetty of course if boat came boat must go away without leaving trace perhaps be so however must wait until see don pedro hervey again then lucy broke in desperately what be talking about father why do bring in sir frank name in way what do expect to say retorted little man after manuscript be found in room emerald be gone saw that for a did hope don pedro in whose presence opened mummy case mr jasher rose in astonishment be emerald gone gasped yes yes yes cried braddock irritably be not telling so almost believe in hervey accusation of random yet boy exonerated very forcibly very forcibly indeed will explain have happened father said lucy who be becoming more more perplexed by rambling chatter be quite in dark so be so

matter up hunt down real criminal until guilty person be found foresee that will never have moment peace quite agree with said mr jasher earnestly for own sake wish matter of mystery to be cleared up why help added turning to braddock who listened placidly be helping said braddock quietly intend to set cockatoo on trail at once will take up abode in sailor rest on pretext doubt will be able to find clue cried widow incredulously savage like cockatoo be much cleverer than average white man said braddock dryly especially in following trail if one will learn truth must much rather trust kanaka than young hope nonsense cried lucy standing up for lover archie be one to discover assassin will see at once father dear said professor calmly will remain here make peace with future mr braddock have made already said widow graciously extended hand professor kissed unexpectedly then sat back in chair looking quite abashed at outburst of gallantry seeing that everything be going well lucy left elderly couple to continue courting hurried to archie lodging in village however happened to be out landlady did not know when must return rather annoyed by since greatly desired to unbosom miss kendal walked disconsolately towards pyramid on way be stopped by widow anne looking more dismal funereal than ever garrulous with copious draught of gin not that be intoxicated tongue be loose wept freely for apparent reason according to herself have stopped lucy to demand back from mr hope through girl certain article of attire have be borrowed for artistic purpose consisting of shawl skirt bodice be of extraordinary value mr bolton wanted back equivalent in value mentioned that must prefer sum of five pound why do not ask mr hope said lucy who be too impatient to bear with old creature

impatiently know nothing about thing tore dress from widow anne detaining hand to hurry home mr bolton wailed aloud at desertion took way to hope lodging where declared determination to remain until artist restored apparel lucy for moment thought little of interview on reflection thought strange that archie must borrow clothes from mr bolton through sidney not that there be anything strange in archie procuring such garment since may have wanted to clothe model with must easily have got such thing from landlady if from widow anne must have borrowed direct without appealing to sidney why then have dead man acted a intermediate party question be hard to answer yet lucy greatly wished for reply since suddenly remembered how woman in dark dress with dark shawl over head have be seen by eliza flight housemaid of sailor rest talking to bolton through window be garment borrowed a disguise did person who have borrowed desire that must be supposed that widow anne be talking to son there be chill hand clutching lucy heart a went home for word of mr bolton seemed indirectly to implicate hope in mystery determined to ask about matter straight out when came in night to pay usual visit at

about borrowed clothes don pedro looking more stiff dignified than ever be in museum with two men be seated in comfortable chair cockatoo distance away be polishing with cloth green mummy case of fatal object have brought about trouble lucy have half expected to see donna inez de gayangos explained that have left writing letter to lima in warrior inn when miss kendal hope be seated peruvian

bright eye sir frank have explained to also knew nothing of manuscript sir said don pedro quietly to captain hervey apparently did since stole along with mummy from lima confess theft did know what manuscript contained said skipper dryly reckon must have to ask who stole emerald sir must have looted believe did murdered bolton cried random hotly shuck retorted hervey rising with shrug if have wished to get rid of bolton 'd have yanked overboard then must have written accident ' in blamed log book braddock looked at don pedro archie at sir frank what skipper said be plausible enough man must have be fool a to have murdered bolton ashore when must have done so without suspicion on board tramp moreover hervey spoke with genuine regret since have missed emerald assuredly must not have hesitated to steal even at cost of bolton life have known of whereabouts so far have made good defense seeing impression produced strolled to door there halted if gent want to lynch said leisurely

excellent defense said archie cautiously must have be fool a to murder bolton ashore when must have done so easily when on narrow sea agree with there said random quickly if be innocent if did not bring manuscript into room who did wonder if widow anne be guilty said lucy in musing tone present turned looked at girl who be widow anne asked don pedro with puzzled air be mother of sidney bolton man who be murdered said hope quickly dear lucy why do say that lucy paused before replying then answered question by asking one did ask sidney to get clothes from mother to clothe model never in life said hope promptly a lucy saw truly well accidentally met mr bolton to day insisted that son have borrowed from dark shawl dark dress for be not true said hope hotly why must woman tell lie well said lucy slowly struck that woman who spoke with sidney through sailor rest window might be widow anne that have invented story of clothes being lent to account for being worn must be discovered be certainly odd must speak like said random thoughtfully forget miss kendal that proved alibi what of cried don pedro hurriedly alibi can be manufactured will be best to see woman question suggested donna inez archie nodded will do so to morrow by way doe ever come to room in fort random oh yes be laundress know at time brings back clothes servant be usually in though see what mean that might have received manuscript from bolton have left in room yes think that said archie slowly must not be at surprised to learn that portion of hervey theory be correct bolton may have found manuscript packed up in mummy amongst graveclothes in fact if read a must must seeing that be excellent latin scholar thanks to professor braddock training might have formed design to steal emerald when be in sailor rest then someone saved trouble packed off to gartley instead of mummy why must widow anne leave manuscript in room argued random ca see bolton knew that wanted mummy for don pedro be aware how have so to speak used threat in presence of witness since spoke out aloud on deck only to warn bolton against indian pleaded random exactly word be capable of being twisted a hervey have twisted well if widow anne really went to see son from lie about borrowed clothes look like may have given manuscript so a to throw blame on murder said archie testily bolton did not expect to be murdered really believe that intended to fly with emerald hoped that when manuscript be found in room must be accused idea be suggested to believe by visit to diver what do think miss kendal asked random nervously fancy that be possible sir frank turned to peruvian don pedro said proudly have heard what hervey say do believe that be guilty for answer de gayangos took daughter hand placed in of young soldier will show what think said gravely thank sir said random moved shook future father in law heartily by hand while donna inez throwing restraint to wind kissed lover exultingly on check in midst of scene professor braddock returned looking very pleased have induced hervey to hold tongue for few day until can look into matter said rubbing hand be if think wise of otherwise be quite willing to go to morrow tell police said archie rapidly let thresh out matter will save sir name from police court slur at event think there be chance of sir frank being arrested said don pedro politely evidence be insufficient at worst can provide alibi be not so sure of said random anxiously went to london certainly did not go to place where be known however added cheerfully daresay will be able to defend still fact remains that be nearer to learning who killed bolton than be be sending cockatoo to pierside to morrow to stop at sailor rest for time said braddock quickly will watch hervey if there be anything suspicious about movement will soon know turn amateur detective to morrow question widow anne said hope after remark have to explain matter to braddock who have be out of room when mr bolton strange request have be discussed meanwhile donna inez have be whispering to lover pointing to mummy don pedro followed thought guessed what be saying random proved truth of guess by turning to do really want to take back mummy to peru sir asked quietly certainly inca caxas be forefather wish to leave in place body must be restored to tomb indian who look upon a present inca expect to bring

money paid that sum on condition consented to wedding did nothing of sort cried indignantly be not going to be bought sold in manner archie lent money must be returned force to think selfish upshot of argument be that lucy got own way professor rather unwillingly agreed to part with mummy restore thousand pound regretted doing so a wished to get money must to go towards proposed egyptian expedition mr jasher fortune a assured step daughter be not so large a might be thought however lucy overruled retired to bed congratulating that must soon be able to marry hope be beginning to grow trifle weary

even donna inez grew eloquent told widow how have defended sir frank against american skipper what dreadfully wicked man said mr jasher when in possession of fact really believe that did kill poor

flashing eye have good defender dear said widow patting girl hand love said donna inez a if explained everything perhaps did so far a be concerned mr jasher smiled indulgently then turned for further information to lucy can be possible said that widow anne be guilty oh think so must not murder own son especially when be so very fond of archie told just before came here that have called to see still insists that sidney borrowed clothes saying that archie wanted what do make of dear well said miss kendal pondering widow anne herself be woman who talked to sidney through sailor rest window have invented story to save sidney did get clothes intended to use a disguise when fled with emerald in case said mr jasher woman who talked through window still remains problem again if sidney bolton intended to steal emerald must have done so in malta on board boat said lucy decisively mummy be taken directly from seller house to boat perhaps sidney did not find manuscript until looked at mummy then captain hervey kept eye on sidney so that must not open mummy to steal emerald still according to own showing sidney looked at actual mummy opened mummy case be else must not have got manuscript lucy nodded think so of course can not be sure packing case in mummy be stowed be placed in hold of steamer if sidney have wished to steal emerald must not have done so without exciting captain hervey

not have written that letter if did not know said don pedro then think that must be arrested can deal with matter at present be quite safe a certainly will not leave cottage seeing that think be being watched let permit braddock to interview see what can learn then can discus matter come to decision random nodded absently wonder if mr jasher be woman who talked to bolton through window remarked be not impossible although doe not explain why bolton borrowed female disguise from mother mr jasher might have worn must argue understanding between bolton mr jasher knowledge of manuscript before bolton left for malta know that must only have seen manuscript for first time at malta be evidently stowed away in swathing of mummy by father who forgot about when gave original hervey forgot also wonder if be true be certain be said don pedro emphatically for if hervey vas like to call have found that manuscript have got translated certainly must have opened mummy have secured emerald sir frank believe that theory be partly true bolton intended to run away with emerald send empty mummy to professor braddock for if remember arranged that landlord of sailor rest must forward case next morning even if happened to be away bolton intended to be away with emerald then believe that hervey placed manuscript in room declared most emphatically that did not said don pedro when at pierside yesterday went to sailor rest saw told braddock only other day that have lost chance of sailing vessel a yet have not got one when returned to pierside found letter waiting so told giving command of four thousand ton tramp steamer called firefly be to sail at once to morrow believe then what be going to do about murder business can hing at present a if remains in pierside will lose new command to morrow drop down stream meantime intends to write out whole story of theft of mummy have promised to give fifty pound for doing so a want to get back mummy free of charge from braddock think braddock will stick to mummy in event said random grimly not when hervey writes out evidence will not have completed by time sail a be very busy have promised to send off boat to jetty near fort to morrow evening when be dropping down stream will be there with fifty pound in gold supposing fails to stop send boat then will not get fifty pound retorted don pedro man be rascal deserves prison rather than reward since mummy be stolen by thirty year back alone can prove ownership why take trouble argued baronet can buy mummy from braddock said don pedro have right to own property random lingered until late in afternoon until darkness fell a be anxious to see donna inez did not appear until late meanwhile archie hope put in appearance having come to see don pedro with account of interview with widow anne before coming to inn have called on professor braddock from have heard about wickedness of mr jasher surprise be very great must not have believed declared poor woman ah said random rather pleased be more merciful than professor hope call bad woman humph think that braddock be so good that can afford to throw stone said archie rather sourly mr jasher have not behaved well must like to hear complete story before judging there must be lot of good in lucy who have be with great deal must have found out long ago go by woman judgment of woman mr jasher must have be anxious to marry be a professor braddock know said random quickly be not thinking of so much a of what widow anne told oh said don pedro looking up from where be seated so have seen that old woman what doe say about clothes stick to story sidney declares borrowed clothes to give to for model now never asked bolton to do so fancy disguise must have be intended for for mr jasher what have mr jasher to do with demanded random sharply well be odd replied hope slowly mr bolton declares that son be in love with mr jasher when returned from malta intended to marry impossible cried sir frank engaged to braddock only after bolton death remember don pedro nodded be true what say mr hope prof truth of hervey theory in what way mr jasher a know from what random told wanted money must not marry man who be poor bolton be poor of course emerald must make wealthy a be of immense value probably intended to steal in order to marry woman implicates mr jasher in crime yes assented sir frank nodding a bolton did not know that emerald existed before bought mummy in malta see why must borrow disguise beforehand for mr jasher to meet at sailor rest thing be easily settled said hope impatiently let go to mr jasher evening insist upon truth being told if confesses about secret engagement to sidney bolton may admit that clothes be borrowed for may admit also that placed manuscript in room said sir frank after pause hervey did not place there be just possible that mr jasher having got from bolton when talked to through window may have done so nonsense said hope with vigorous commonsense mr jasher must be spotted in moment if have gone to quarter have to pas sentry remember then again have not yet proved that be woman in mr bolton clothes who spoke through window can be settled if speak to evening very good random glanced at watch must get back don pedro will tell inez that will come in evening can then talk further about matter hope will stop here a wish to consult don pedro random nodded took reluctant departure dearly wished a engaged lover must to remain on chance that donna inez might return duty called be forced to obey night be very dark although be not particularly late there be rain random walked rapidly through village down road to fort caught glimpse of light of mr jasher cottage twinkling in distance smiled grimly a thought of invisible spell have placed thereon doubt mr jasher be shivering in louis quinze shoe at idea of being watched then deserved that much punishment at least a random truly thought when entering fort sentry saluted a usual random be about to pas when man stepped forward holding out brown paper package please sir found in sentry box said saluting sir frank took packet who placed there why do give to demanded in surprise please sir be directed to sir know who put in box sir be on duty sir bepose someone must have dropped on floor of box sir when be at other end of beat sir be a dark a sir saw nothing heard nothing when come back sir stepped into box out of rain felt with foot struck light sir found be for sir frank slipped package into pocket went away after grim word so to sentry advising to be more on alert be puzzled to think who have left packet in sentry box curious to know what contained a soon a got to own room cut string bound loosely brown paper then in lamplight there rolled out from carelessly tied parcel glorious sea green emerald of great size radiating light like sun scrap of white paper lay in brown wrapping on be written wedding gift for sir frank random chapter xxiii just in time of surprise in connection with tragedy of green mummy be surely greatest sidney bolton have undoubtedly be murdered for sake of emerald assassin have escaped with spoil for have sold soul yet here be one of jewel returned anonymously to random who must pas on same to rightful owner in midst of amazement sir frank must not help chuckling when thought how enraged professor braddock must be at don pedro good fortune at eleventh hour a be peruvian have got back own at least portion of own placing emerald in drawer random gave order to servant that sentry when off duty must be brought before just a random finished dressing for mess dressed very early so a to devote entire attention to solving new problem soldier who have be on guard appeared must tell nothing more than have already related when doing sentry go immediately outside gate of fort packet have be slipped into box while man be at far end of beat be quite dark when be done soldier confessed that have not heard sound much le have seen anyone person who have brought glorious gem have watched opportunity soft footed a cat have stolen forward in darkness to drop precious parcel on floor of sentry box there man have found by feel of foot when stepped in time later to escape shower what time have elapsed from placing of parcel to discovery by sentry be impossible to say must however a random calculated have be within hour since before then must not have be dark enough to hide approach of person whether male female who carried king ransom in brown paper parcel at first random be inclined to place sentry under arrest for having failed so much in duty a to allow anyone to approach so near fort a have already reprimanded man moreover wished to keep fact of recovered jewel quiet simply dismissed when alone sat down before fire wondering who must have dared so very greatly for what reason emerald have be handed to if have be sent to don pedro even to professor braddock must have be much more reasonable first occurred to that mr jasher out of gratitude for way in have treated have sent jewel remembering former experience smelt parcel must detect sign of famous chinese scent have proved clue to letter of course direction on packet inscribed slip of paper be in feigned handwriting so must gather nothing from still did not think that mr jasher have sent emerald be desperately hard up if have become possessed of gem by murder presuming to have be woman who talked to bolton through window assuredly must have sold to supply own need certainly if guilty must still posse other emerald of equal value undoubtedly have risked neck to gain fortune must have kept entire plunder be likely to cost so dear whomsoever be who have repented at eleventh hour mr jasher be not person perhaps widow anne be woman who have talked through window who have restored emerald be impossible since mr bolton habitually took more liquor than be good for must not have nerve to deliver jewel much le commit crime more especially a victim be own son of course might have found out sidney scheme to run away with jewel so must have claimed share if have be in pierside on evening presence in gartley have be sworn to by three four crony must have guessed who have strangled boy if so not jewel in world must have prevented denouncing criminal with fault be many mr bolton be good mother looked upon sidney a pride joy of somewhat dissipated life mr bolton be certainly a innocent a mr jasher there remained hervey random laughed aloud when name came into puzzled head that buccaneer be last person to surrender plunder to feel compunction in committing crime once skipper got grip on two jewel worth endless money must never let go not even one of arguing thus seemed that hervey be out of running random must think of one else in dilemma remembered that two head be better than one before going into dinner sent note to archie hope asking to come to fort a speedily a possible sir frank be somewhat dull at dinner on evening scarcely responded to joking remark of brother officer jocularly put preoccupation down to love for be open secret that baronet admired fair peruvian although one a yet knew that random be legally engaged with don pedro consent young man good humoredly stood chaff hurled at seized opportunity to slip away to quarter a soon a coffee came on table smoking began be nine o'clock before returned to room here found hope waiting for impatiently see have be dining at pyramid said random seeing that hope be in evening dress archie nodded yes put on kit to have humble chop at lodging professor asked to dinner to talk over matter what doe say asked random looking for cigarette box oh be very angry with mr jasher considers that have swindled called to see afternoon so say have stormy interview with wonder at if speaks a generally doe said other grimly pushing along cigarette there be whisky soda be on yonder table make comfortable tell what professor intends to do well said archie turning half round from side table where be pouring out whisky have already started action by sending cockatoo to live at sailor rest spy on hervey what rubbish hervey be going away to morrow in firefly bound for algiers nothing be to be learned from so told professor said hope returning to armchair near fire mentioned that don pedro have induced skipper to write out full account of theft of mummy from lima thirty year ago also said that signed paper must be handed in at gartley jetty when firefly came down stream to morrow night humph what did braddock say to nothing much merely stated that hervey said toward proving ownership of future father in law that intended to stick to embalmed corpse of inca caxas also that intended to claim emerald when turned up random rose went to drawer of desk be afraid have lost one emerald at event said unlocking drawer what be said hope sharply why did oh gosh jumped up with amazed look a random held up magnificent gem from streamed vividly green flame in mellow lamplight oh gosh gasped artist again where devil did get sent for to tell said sir frank giving jewel into friend hand coming back to seat be found in sentry box hope stared at great jewel then at soldier what do mean by that demanded how dickens must be found in sentry box must be making mistake not bit of be found on floor of box by sentry a tell have sent to consult with a to how deuce got there hervey muttered archie fascinated by gem random shrugged square shoulder catch that yankee shylock returning anything got grip on even a wedding present wedding present said hope more at sea than ever if mind giving detail old chap head must buzz le rather think that will buzz more said random dryly producing brown paper in gem have be wrapped inscribed paper found within related have happened archie listened quietly did not interrupt puzzled look on face grew more pronounced well ended random seeing that remark be made when have finished what do think lord know will go out of mind if sort of thing come along be simple sort of chap have use for mystery beat detective story have ever read that sort of thing be very well in fiction in real life humph what be going to do give back emerald to don pedro of course though be given to for wedding present then then random stared into fire know asked in to assist willingly how random pondered for few moment who sent that emerald to do think asked looking squarely at artist hope meditatively turned jewel in long finger why not ask mr jasher suggested suddenly sir frank shook head fancied might be can not be if be guilty a must be must have sent emerald must not part with plunder when be so hard up be beginning to believe hope that what said be true about letter how do mean exactly that letter be mere bluff that really know nothing about crime by way did braddock learn anything not thing merely said that two of fought expect braddock stormed mr jasher retorted of have too much tongue music to come to understanding by way to echo own phrase have better put away gem will be strangling in order to gain possession of mere sight of gorgeous color tempts beyond strength random laughed locked jewel in drawer hope suggested that with flimsy lock be unsafe baronet shook head be safer here than in woman jewel case asserted one look to drawer certainly one must expect to find crown jewel of description in quarter well came back to seat slipping key into trouser pocket whole thing puzzle why not do a suggest go to mr jasher in case be going there to night be not yes want to decide what to do about woman have intended to go alone a be here may a well come also will be delighted what do intend to do help said random briefly doe deserve replied hope lighting fresh cigarette doe anyone ever deserve anything asked sir frank cynically what doe miss kendal think of business suppose braddock told have too long tongue to keep anything to told at dinner when be present lucy be quite on side say that have known mr jasher for month that there be good in although be bound to say that lucy be trifle shocked doe want mr jasher to marry father now step father corrected archie immediately be out of question must like mr jasher to be helped out of difficulty have fair start be only by greatest diplomacy prevented lucy going to see wretched woman evening why did prevent archie colored daresay be trifle prudish replied after have happened wish lucy to associate with mr jasher do blame same think that mr jasher be immoral woman by mean perhaps not need discus character a know precious little of past doubt told story best suited think will be best to make tell know evening then send away with sum of money in pocket to begin new life will help certainly said random with eye on fire ca say exactly how be opinion that poor wretch be more sinned against than sinning be soldier with conscience random other laughed why must soldier have conscience do take idea of officer from lady novelist who make out to be idle idiot not exactly same many man must not take trouble to behave a be doing to unlucky woman man who be man whether soldier civilian must help such poor creature believe hope that will help also artist leaped to foot impulsively of course be with right along a hervey must say first before deciding what will do to set mr jasher on leg again let hear what have to say can say nothing more than have said remonstrated random believe that replied hope reaching for overcoat may choose to believe that letter be outcome of bluff really truly think that mr jasher be in know what be more believe that bolton got clothes that be woman who talked to went there to see how little scheme be progressing if thought said random coldly must not help mr jasher oh yes must greater sinner more need have of help know dear fellow get coat on let toddle suppose need pistol sir frank laughed a aided by artist struggled into military greatcoat suppose that mr jasher will be dangerous remarked will get what can out of then arrange what be best to be done to recoup fallen fortune then can go where chooses can a french say return to mutton think donna inez lucy must be annoyed to hear called mutton laughed

jasher life random bound up wound in rough ready fashion jane fed pale lip of mistress with sip of brandy mr jasher gradually became more alive faint sigh escaped from lip a wounded bosom rose fell with recovered breath when sir frank be in hope that must speak suddenly relapsed again into comatose state luckily at moment archie returned with young dr robinson at heel also be followed by painter village constable who have luckily be picked up in fog robinson whistled a looked at insensible woman be have narrow squeak muttered lifting body with assistance of random will recover questioned hope

wickedness archie slipped confession into pocket before policeman returned then left cottage with random doctor since nothing else must now be done be between seven eight chilly dawn be breaking sea mist still lay heavily over marsh a though be winding sheet of dead robinson went to own house to get trap drive into jessum there to catch train ferry to pierside be necessary that inspector date must be informed of new tragedy without delay a constable painter be engaged in watching cottage there be messenger available dr robinson random indeed offered to send soldier to afford robinson use of fort telephone doctor preferred to see date personally so a to detail exactly what have happened perhaps young medical man have eye to becoming better known for improvement of practice certainly

thought when left fort last night what time be going to have fancy mr jasher having sent emerald after yes repented a said yet dare say a also said be sorry that acted on impulse if have not be stabbed by damned cockatoo must no doubt have destroyed that confession expect wrote that also on impulse of moment confessed a much said hope leaning head on hand staring into fire must have be cognizant of truth along wonder if be accessory before after fact what wonder said random after moment thought be what braddock have to do with matter hope raised head in surprise why nothing mr

what be saying random what terrible thing must be for lucy if professor be guilty in such way a suggest really fail to see that miss kendal be relation to braddock save by marriage iniquity have nothing to do with with be impossible tell random throughout whole of case braddock have acted in perfectly innocent way be just said sir frank caustically have acted in spite of pretended grief for loss of emerald must not be surprised to learn from that nodded towards confession on table that be in possession of missing gem cockatoo have reason to steal emerald setting aside fact that probably must not know value being semi civilized savage acted under order from master although cockatoo strangled bolton professor be really author gainer moving spirit must make braddock accessory before fact yes mr jasher accessory after fact cockatoo be link a actual criminal who join two in guilty partnership wonder braddock intended to make woman wife even though did not love for knew jolly sight too much for peace of mind be horrible murmured hope desperately be mere theory can not be sure until read confession will be sure soon then for here come coffee last remark random made when timid knock came to door moment later landlady entered with tray bearing cup saucer jug of steaming coffee be meek reticent woman who entered departed in dismal silence in few moment two young men be quite alone with door closed drank cup of coffee then hope proceeded to read confession story told by mr jasher commenced with short account of early life appeared that father be ruined gentleman gambler that mother have be actress be dragged up in bohemian sort of way until attained marriageable age when mother who seemed to have be wicked hard hearted forced to marry comparatively wealthy man called

home together have one child died much to grief yet also much to relief a be so miserable poor mr jasher gave scanty account of sordid year of trouble trial of failure sorrow husband roamed over america then went to australia new zealand where lived wretched existence for many year finally husband died of strong drink at advanced age leaving mr jasher somewhat elderly widow poor woman again took to stage tried to earn bread be unsuccessful afterwards lectured then kept boarding establishment finally went out a nurse in way must seem tried to keep head above water roamed world like bird of passage finding rest nowhere for sole of foot yet throughout story young men must see that have always aspired to quiet decent respectable existence that only force of circumstance have flung into whirlpool of life a said remarked random at stage miserable creature be more sinned against than sinning moral sense seemed to have become blunted however said archie doubtfully small wonder amidst such surroundings seems to that be much better under circumstance than many woman must have be go on in melbourne mr jasher made lucky speculation in mine brought one thousand pound with came to england resolved to make bid for respectability chance led into neighborhood of gartley thinking that if set up tent in locality might manage to marry officer from fort since amidst such dismal surroundings young man might be more easily fascinated by woman of world took cottage amidst marsh at small rent here hoped to eke out what money have left few hundred until coveted marriage must take place afterwards met professor braddock determined to marry a man more easy to manage be successful in enlisting lucy on side until green mummy brought bad luck to pyramid everything went capitally be in connection with name of bolton that first mention be made of green mummy sidney be clever young man although very lowly born having be taken up by professor braddock a assistant must hope day to make position braddock be educating although paid very little in way of wage sidney fell in love with mr jasher in way did not mention how gained confidence perhaps lonely woman be glad to have sympathetic friend at event told past history to sidney mentioned that desired to marry braddock sidney insisted that must marry promised to make enough money to satisfy that be good match setting aside humble birth for mr jasher cared nothing be then that sidney related what have discovered braddock when in peru many year before have tried to get mummy for scientific reason when hervey then known a vas promised to procure mummy of last inca braddock be extremely pleased hervey stole mummy also copy of manuscript be written in latin sent latter to braddock who be then at cuzco a earnest of success in procuring mummy when professor returned to lima mummy be to be handed to unfortunately braddock be carried into captivity for one year when escaped vas have disappeared with mummy a professor have deciphered latin manuscript knew of emerald for year have be hunting for mummy sure to be recognized from peculiar green color in order to get jewel thus secure money for egyptian expedition through seems professor be actuated by purely scientific enthusiasm a in abstract cared very little for hard cash bolton told mr jasher braddock explained how much desired to get mummy did not mention about jewel for long time sidney be under impression that master merely wanted mummy to see difference between egyptian peruvian mode of embalming then one day sidney chanced on latin manuscript learned that braddock real reason for getting mummy be to procure emerald be held in grip of dead sidney kept knowledge to braddock never guessed that assistant knew truth then unexpectedly braddock stumbled across advertisement describing green mummy for sale in malta from color made sure that be that of inca caxas so moved heaven earth to get money to buy at length did from archie hope on condition that consented to marriage of step daughter with young man thinking that sidney be ignorant of jewel sent to bring mummy home sidney told mr jasher that must try steal jewel in malta on board tramp steamer failing that must delay delivery of mummy to braddock on excuse rob at pierside to make sure of escaping borrowed disguise from mother alleging that hope wanted same to clothe model sidney intended to take clothes with after stealing jewel to escape disguised a old woman a be slender clean shaven capital actor must easily manage then arranged that mr jasher must join in paris must sell emerald go to america there to marry live happily ever afterwards like fairy tale unfortunately for success of plan mr jasher thought that professor must make more distinguished husband so betrayed that sidney have arranged what beastly thing to do interrupted random disgusted be not a if wanted to help braddock think le of mr jasher than ever did might have remembered that there be honor amongst thief well be dead poor soul said hope with sigh god know that if sinned have paid cruelly for sin after remark a sir frank be silent resumed reading braddock be furious when learned of assistant projected trickery determined to circumvent agreed to marry mr jasher a if have not done so must have warned sidney must have escaped with mummy jewel by conniving with professor must not risk that a remembering hervey a gustav vas be aware how clever reckless be whether braddock ever intended to marry widow in end be hard to say certainly pretended to consent to engagement be mainly brought about by lucy then came detail of murder so far a mr jasher knew one evening in fact on evening when crime be committed woman be walking in garden late in moonlight saw braddock cockatoo go down along cinderpath to jetty near fort wondering what be doing waited up heard saw for be still moonlight come back long after midnight next day heard of murder guessed that professor slave for cockatoo be little else have rowed up to pierside in boat there have strangled sidney stolen mummy saw braddock accused professor have then opened case have pretended astonishment when

of to woman now for said random settling to hear detail of crime for have often wondered how have be executed braddock read archie from confession for mr jasher did not trouble with polite prefix braddock explained that when received letter from sidney stating that must have to remain with mummy for night in pierside guessed that treacherous assistant intended to effect robbery seems that sidney by mistake have left behind disguise in intended to escape aware of through mr jasher referred to herself made cockatoo assume dress row up river to sailor rest kanaka easily must be mistaken for woman a also like sidney be slender smooth chinned also wore shawl over head to disguise mop of frizzy hair a much a possible for purpose of concealing tattooed face in darkness be after nine o'clock spoke to sidney through window a have seen there earlier when searching for cockatoo said that sidney be much afraid when heard that purpose have be discovered by professor offered share of plunder to kanaka cockatoo agreed saying must come back late sidney be to admit into bedroom so that must open mummy steal jewel sidney quite believed that cockatoo be heart soul with especially a cunning kanaka swore that be weary of master tyranny be when cockatoo be talking thus that be seen by eliza flight who mistook very naturally for woman cockatoo then returned by boat to gartley jetty told master afterwards professor at much later hour went down to jetty be rowed up to pierside by kanaka be when mr jasher saw said random much interested yes said archie then if remember watched for return of couple be nearly midnight when boat be brought alongside sloping stone bank of alley ran past sailor rest one be about at hour not even policeman there be light in sidney bolton window

to obey professor slipped silently ashore into room two men relighted candle pulled down blind then placed corpse of sidney in packing case screwed same down in silence when be completed be about to carry mummy in coffin lid of have replaced to boat when heard distant footstep probably of policeman on beat at once extinguished candle a braddock told mr jasher for one sat trembling in dark policeman if footstep be of policeman passed up street two be safe without relighting candle silently slipped mummy through window cockatoo within braddock without case content be not heavy be not difficult for two men to take to boat when be safely bestowed cockatoo who be a cunning a devil according to master returned to bedroom unlocked door afterwards passed string through joining of upper lower window managed to shut snib afterwards came to boat rowed back to gartley on way cockatoo told master that sidney have left instruction that packing case must be taken next morning to pyramid so there be nothing to fear mummy be hidden in hole under jetty covered with grass why did take up to house asked random on hearing must have be dangerous said hope looking up from manuscript seeing that mummy be supposed to have be stolen by murderer be easier to hide amongst grass under jetty a one ever go there well turned over few page be practically rest be after event want to hear said random taking cup of coffee hope ran eye swiftly over remaining portion of paper gave further detail rapidly to friend know happened said professor pretended surprise when found corpse have helped to pack yes yes why be mummy placed in mr jasher garden be braddock idea fancied that mummy might be found under jetty inconvenient inquiry might be made also wished if possible to implicate mr jasher so a to keep from telling to police what have told cockatoo went down to river one night removed mummy to arbor silently afterwards pretended to be astonished when found must say acted part very well said hope reflectively even to accusing mr jasher be bold stroke of genius very dangerous one not at all swore to mr jasher that if said anything must tell police that have taken clothes provided by sidney from pyramid have gone to speak through window in order to fly with sidney emerald a fact of mummy being found in mr jasher garden must lend color to lie be obliged to hold tongue after a say did mind since be engaged to professor possessed at least one of emerald ah one passed along to how did get that hope referred again to manuscript insisted that braddock must give to a pledge of good faith have to do risk splitting be why placed mummy in garden so a to bring into matter render more difficult for to speak what of other emerald braddock took to amsterdam when went to london time if remember when don pedro arrived braddock sold emerald for three thousand pound be now on way to indian rajah fear don pedro will never set eye on again where be money banked in feigned name in amsterdam intended to account for when married mr jasher by saying be left to by mythical pekin merchant brother of hers savvy yes what infernal little villain expect sent cockatoo down last night for other emerald be not related in manuscript said archie laying down last sheet taking up coffee confession end abruptly at time cockatoo tapped at window expect said when dying that kanaka asked for second emerald if have not sent to in fit of weakness expect must have passed along ca make out added archie musingly why mr jasher confessed when everything be so safe well said random nursing chin staring into fire made mistake in trying to blackmail though why did so ca tell seeing have whiphand of braddock perhaps wanted five thousand to spend knowing that professor plunder must be wasted on confounded expedition at rate gave away by blackmail expect grew frightened if house have be searched might have be searched by police have arrested for blackmail emerald must have be found must have be incriminated therefore got rid of cleverly by passing along to a wedding gift then again grew afraid wrote out confession to exonerate doe insisted hope make out plainly a accessory after fact woman doe understand legal nicety wrote that out to clear in case be arrested for blackmail perhaps in case braddock refused to help a certainly did if remember be hard on confessed archie slowly being such villain said random grimly however cockatoo arrived unluckily on scene when found have parted with emerald have written out truth stabbed if have come just in nick of time must have annexed confession truth must never have become known one ended random rising stretching must connect braddock cockatoo with death of mr jasher with death of sidney bolton said hope also rising putting on cap

iniquity be revealed to archie tried to break news a delicately a possible word must soften sordid story lucy at first must not believe possible that man whom have known for so long to whom be related must behave in such base way to convince hope be forced to let read account in mr jasher handwriting when acquainted with content poor girl first desire be to have matter hushed up implored lover with tear to suppress damning document be impossible said hope firmly if think again dear will not repeat such request be absolutely necessary that must be placed in hand of police that truth must become a

professor life oh archie will hang father hope winced call step father said quickly dear think will be hanged a accessory after fact will certainly be condemned to long term of imprisonment cockatoo

inquiring hunting marsh round cottage be explored great house be searched a well a many cottage in village inquiry be made at local station in vain braddock cockatoo along with cumbersome mummy in case have vanished a completely a though earth have swallowed up inspector date idea be that pair have taken mummy to gartley pier after search made by soldier there have launched boat cockatoo judging from visit to pierside apparently kept hidden in nook be probable said date two have rowed down river have managed to get on board outward bound tramp must easily furbish up story a braddock doubtless have money must easily buy passage for large sum tramp being outward bound captain crew must know nothing of crime even if fugitive be suspected must be shipped out of england if bribe be sufficiently large so be apparent that inspector date have not much opinion of tramp steamer skipper however a day wore on to night nothing be heard of braddock cockatoo mummy when night came village be filled with local reporter with london journalist asking question warrior inn did great trade in drink bed meal rustic reaped quite harvest in answering question about mr jasher professor weird looking kanaka reporter dared to invade pyramid where lucy be weeping in sorrow shame archie reinforced by two policeman sent to aid by date soon sent to right about hope must have liked to remain with lucy evening at half past seven be forced to meet don pedro random outside fort in order to go to gartley jetty chapter xxvii by river a hunt for fugitive have continued day everyone police villager soldier be weary disheartened consequently when three men met near fort there seemed to be few people about be just a well a must have be followed to jetty obviously be best to keep strange meeting with captain hervey a secret a possible however don pedro have taken inspector date into confidence a be impossible to get past cottage of late mr jasher in officer have taken up quarter without being discovered date be quite willing that trio must go stipulated that must come also have heard about captain hervey in connection with mummy thought that must like to ask that sailor few leading question if see fit will detain until inquest be over said date be mere bluff a inspector have warrant to stop firefly arrest skipper three men therefore be joined by date when came along cinder path abreast of cottage quartette proceeded further immediately walking amongst bent grass to rude old wooden jetty near hervey intended to stop ship night be quite clear of fog strange to say considering late sea mist strong wind have be blowing day fog wreath be entirely dispersed full moon rode amongst galaxy of star twinkled like diamond air be frosty foot scrunched earth grass coarse herbage under foot a made rapidly for embankment when reached top must see jetty clearly almost below foot in distance glittering light of pierside vague form of vessel at anchor loomed on water there be stream of light where moon made pathway of silver after casual glance three men proceeded down slope to jetty three of at least have revolver since hervey be ill man to tackle probably date who be too dense to consider consequence be unarmed neither did don pedro think necessary to tell officer that two companion be prepared to shoot if necessary inspector date being prosy englishman must not have understood such lawless doings in own sober law abiding country when reached jetty don pedro glanced at watch illuminating dial by puffing cigar to ruddy glow be just after eight o'clock even a looked exclamation from date made raise head inspector be pointing out stream to large vessel have steamed inshore a far a be safe probably hervey be watching for through night glass for blue light suddenly flared on bridge don pedro according to promise fired pistol be then that date learned that companion be armed what devil did do for inquired angrily will bring constable down on mind since

insisted on counting money don pedro naturally lost temper at insult swore in spanish upon hervey responded with such volubility that anyone must see be pastmaster in castilian swearing row be considerable especially a random hope be laughing at quarrel thought that hervey be worse for drink date clever for once in life did not think so appeared to that boat have gone to end of jetty for reason connected with same reason induced skipper to spin out time of meeting by indulging in unnecessary quarrel skipper also kept eye about insisted that four men must keep together at head of pier daresay be trying to play low down on said with scowl after satisfying that money be correct have got shooter so have cried don pedro indignantly slipped hand round to hip pocket if talk further so
