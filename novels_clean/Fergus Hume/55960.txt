dead woman who be arrayed with unusual splendour quite in keeping with room yet too richly for front parlour of fifth rate lodging house miss ligram body be that of old woman close upon sixty year of age with wrinkled face profusion of silvery white hair turned back in style of marie antoinette be dressed in old fashioned dinner dress of white silk trimmed with valuable lace be designed so a to show lean neck bony arm of wearer anything more incongruous than poor clay clothed in such costly garment can scarcely be imagined seemed to accentuate grimness of crime almost to elevate sordid murder to level of tragedy did miss ligram usually dress like asked gebb turning to mr presk evening replied landlady promptly must have be eccentric be gebb comment on reply very eccentric sir think be quite right here landlady tapped head significantly crazy jane questioned lackland be be answered mr presk enigmatically be mad enough to be shut up acted in queerer way than most people look at

own device set out to seek mr presk in kitchen having found made show house judiciously refrained from commenting on late conduct left elucidation of to gebb left to detective examined dead woman room with minute attention to detail keeping up running commentary while on discovery have habit of talking aloud when alone a if to emphasize opinion while examining boudoir soliloquized with appropriate

lighted cigarette rose to stroll round room not suspecting danger show by way that must have trusted victim let pas behind chair while there slipped loop of cord off nail then when turned up death card pure coincidence doubt threw cord over head choked before poor wretch have time to call out for assistance then robbed body at leisure left house be a clear a day presuming that murderer have gone out by front door gebb left room went into passage to surprise found that front door be locked a detective noted not bolted must have locked after left house thought gebb doubt did so to prevent intrusion too sudden discovery of crime expect threw away key when outside in front garden most probably will look before must put design into execution intended doing by passing out back way mr presk arrived downstairs with intelligence that inspector lackland be still searching upper portion of house for trace of assassin must find nothing one so said expect wretch ran away after killing poor miss ligram by front door gebb informed locked after did said mr presk with stare now be queer why asked detective sharply because miss ligram always kept front door locked key in pocket be one of queer way never must abide without word gebb returned to yellow boudoir searched in pocket of dead woman sure enough found therein large key mr presk immediately declared to be that of front door gebb be puzzled a discovery upset much of previous reasoning in case man must not have cleared out by front said a not having key must not lock door after let see back door may have escaped in direction back door be locked said mr presk promptly have key in pocket when went to lecture be door locked when returned asked gebb more puzzled than ever yes sir be have thought that anything be wrong until came upstairs saw corpse though to be sure added mr presk suddenly fancied strange that light must be burning so late in miss ligram boudoir saw from road know mr gebb sight gave turn can tell must have got out through back window murmured gebb indeed did sir when brought 'tilda out of faint in kitchen looked at window in basement be bolted barred proper 'tilda be careful on account of burglar gebb pinched chin shook head in perplexed manner after walked to window of yellow room examined carefully be fastened by snick position of showed that window be closed must not have be used a exit let alone danger of cove being seen by chance policeman taken up a burglar mused gebb what about upstairs window mr presk be locked sir mr inspector examined one then man must be in house still be gebb final conclusion be insisted mr presk with startled glance over shoulder have looked under bed into room cupboard unless be like sparrow on house top know where can be well there doe seem way by must get out said gebb in vexed tone did hear sound in house when arrived home did sir went up to see if miss ligram be ill a noticed that room be lighted up then saw corpse called 'tilda who ran up fainted ai got nerve mr gebb did lock back door when came in lawks sir be in such flurry to see if miss ligram be ill that just left door anyhow when went upstairs be door closed to think so replied mr presk after pause for 'tilda banged to be locked will take dying word on when came for police did leave by door yes did by back door a miss ligram kept front one locked be closed when went out mr presk looked up suddenly rather alarmed sir be said in startled tone be a might say ajar aha said gebb triumphantly then may depend upon mr presk that when came home assassin be in house in house gasped mr presk lor sir ai possible yes did not know where to find front door key discovering that back door be locked just hid in kitchen until servant went upstairs to look on handiwork then slipped out to escape consequence mr presk knee gave way be fain to sit down a far away from dead body a possible however be past believing moaned rocking to fro lord what escape 'tilda have from being strangulated ugh shuddered look at poor soul sir ai enough to freeze blood did freeze yours that ran out of room asked gebb hoping to take unawares a'be that whispered mr presk turning pale be afeard of what asked detective rather puzzled of sir be unexpected reply indeed then know something about matter yes issued from landlady pale lip noticed something what did notice dare tell must mr presk rose hastily made for door before must reach gebb have placed back against leave room until know what be hiding be hiding nothing burst out mr presk have got eye pointed towards dead woman look cried look chapter iii woman without past a desired gebb looked at gaily decked figure in chair tried to find out what mr presk meant well be looking said at length be blest if can see anything of course ca cried landlady hysterically triumphant 'cause ai there what be there diamond diamond repeated gebb with start a noted that dead woman wore jewellery have diamond must think have said mr presk sitting down again star for hair ring bracelet loveliest necklace ever saw just like dewdrop with sun on wore jewellery night to eat chop saw diamond on afore went to lecture when came back be gone one of replied mr presk defiantly when noticed for to own up mr gebb did notice be gone till be here with talking about dress when did notice ran out of room 'cause be feared might say 'tilda stole nonsense why must say that oh there ai telling said mr presk with toss of head be that why made that howling yes be sir ran out to kitchen to ask if have noticed if diamond be gone when came in first for be that flurried did look for doe 'tilda say diamond be gone yes dessay murdering villain who killed poor dear stole wish have hanging of oh may assist to put rope round neck said gebb well mr presk will come see to morrow must tell know about woman in mean time think doctor coming detective ear have not deceived for approaching footstep be of doctor escorted by policeman who have met mr presk entered in very good humour at being knocked up at so late hour however look of corpse appearance of room astonished interested made examination took only few minute for to decide that death have taken place shortly before after ten o'clock must have be almost instantaneous when examination be concluded gebb inspector left house in charge of policeman returned to station to make report while prosaic lackland set down bare detail of case for information of authority gebb mused over event of night pondered what be best to be done under circumstance a yet have gained information from mr presk about lodger intended to examine on morrow when be somewhat recovered from strain of late event in mean time gebb fancied that strange room designed furnished by dead woman might turn out more important factor in matter than at present appeared even if mr presk did prove to be ignorant of miss ligram past be extremely unlikely strongly marked eccentric taste of lodger a exemplified in illumination colouring furnishing might provide sufficiently stable basis for operation in word gebb considered that most promising clue to mystery be predominance of colour yellow in sitting room criminal problem a knew have be solved by slighter mean a lackland surmised gebb being high in favour with authority a detective of ordinary capability have little difficulty in gaining consent to taking charge of case inspector made report gebb application after due formality have be complied with detective found that responsibility of tracing miss ligram assassin lay solely on own shoulder a comfortably assured be quite capable of bearing burden be more pleased with employment a grangebury murder case promised to be one of mystery loved dead woman strangely furnished room pack of card be element of case so far a gebb must see at present there be clue save lavish use of colour yellow to past of victim identity of assassin in mr presk lay sole hope of gaining intelligence likely to lead to practical result so at eleven o'clock next morning gebb in anxious frame of mind be once more on scene of murder in presence of principal witness in searching light of day mr presk be more uncomely than ever tall gaunt angular dressed in worst possible taste presented few of alluring grace of sex to have woo 'd won lived with strident amazon late mr presk must have be suitor of ordinary courage however made excellent witness a brain be clear courage high have not morsel of imagination moreover hysteria of previous night have disappeared answered gebb leading question in cut dried fashion without discursive rambling after own private opinion with examination detail obtainable therefrom proved to be anything satisfactory considering business like instinct of detective widow more meagre result can scarcely be conceived for how long have miss ligram be lodging with be gebb first question put in form appeared to assume that victim be still in existence for three month replied mr presk referring to dingy little book with have furnished in anticipation of ordeal came to on first of may last left here for heaven hope on twenty fourth day of july so a can see for mr gebb have be with two month twenty four day neither more le there ai court of law a 'd swear different in came in answer to advertisement suppose did contradicted widow advertise be low put card in window be that card made miss ligram apply here for board lodging applied continued mr presk consulting book on twenty ninth of april agreed to take on thirtieth so that entered house on first of may why two day delay because must make up mind about taking in offered too little on contrary mr gebb offered too much wonder thought eccentric said detective with irony kindly explain position more fully asked three pound week for parlour bedroom fire light be little enough be sure a everything in house be of best to surprise miss ligram offered to pay six just double on condition that allowed to dismantle front room refurnish did give reason for singular request said liked own good chattel about replied mr presk though at first did not fancy idea of clearing out parlour be most handsomely furnished yet on thinking over matter decided that double money asked be not to be despised therefore agreed to miss ligram term on last day of april dismantled parlour on first of may miss ligram came in van came in van interrupted gebb profoundly astonished yes rode beside driver assisted to set out parlour in style saw be done in day by pair for miss ligram must not let help perhaps be afraid of asking driver question a to where came from suggested gebb shrewdly might have saved trouble said mr presk grimly did speak to driver asked that very question only to find that be deaf dumb queer murmured detective rubbing nose took good care to hide past wonder why snapped landlady with feminine malevolence be opinion that miss ligram past be not respectable h be must say look like be name on van there be name mr gebb van painted yellow with one grey horse red headed driver deaf dumb be private property of miss ligram be not first time have moved that yellow room about widow nodded significantly why be doubtful of miss ligram past well said mr presk taking time to answer question can only judge person past by person present miss ligram knew too many shady people for taste shady people echoed gebb pricking up ear at hint of clue what sort of people fortune teller conjuror spiritualist such like sir ah gebb recalled spread out pack of card so be rather superstitious superstitious cried mr presk casting up eye be very pagan for omen talisman consultation of card there be fortune teller in london have down here at one time to read hand question star look into crystal ball spread out card be perfect gold mine to swindler believing lie like poor benighted heathen be what did particularly seek to know future be landlady curt reply doubt returned gebb dryly own future at be there particular aim in questioning yes said mr presk with burst of confidence there be found out from one of fortune telling visitor wanted to know if must die by violence so said gebb drawling out word reflectively in german fashion be violent death predicted be by fortune teller asked mr gebb sure enough prediction came true though a rule believe in such rubbish still be queer must die with ace of spade in lap fortune teller be with on night be killed said gebb after pause how do know sir questioned mr presk eagerly because card be laid out death card be in lap of corpse now believe that man by way said

habit for lady to smoke corrected detective mildly many lady do nowadays a according to miss ligram did not smoke be probable that visitor be man found stump of cigarette near chair when got behind to strangle to strangle repeated mr presk horrified do think fortune teller killed yes do believe firmly attracted by diamond verified own prediction murdered in most cold blooded fashion impossible mr gebb be friend of hers ah know man cried gebb pouncing down on admission cried landlady in rather nervous manner for one of iron composure know have visitor on night told have friend coming did say if

murdered yes believe that dean kept word what be reason vengeance said parge opening red book listen will tell case after own fashion will learn reason why miss ligram be strangled at grangebury chapter vi crime of kirkstone hall sometimes happens that youthful spendthrift becomes aged miser hoard money in same extreme fashion a formerly wasted john kirkstone be fair example of specie of human chameleon a father heir drained estate of ready money squandered same in london without regard to economy even reason in riotous life be encouraged by former college companion one marmaduke dean who even went to extent of borrowing money of kirkstone so became debtor for large sum dean subsequently married lady of fortune repaid portion of money must not a be more probable must not discharge whole on point kirkstone who needed money for pleasure quarrelled with friend pair parted to meet more for year must have be better for have never renewed youthful friendship a might be expected old squire kirkstone be by mean pleased with son did not relish leaving large fortune to one who probably must waste in few year hall surrounding acre be entailed be bound to pas into john kirkstone hand old man possessed large income acquired by speculation be at own disposal wrathful at spendthrift son resolved to leave personal property to only daughter accordingly when john became squire on death of father found that sister laura be in possession of good income while have to be content with dwelling far too large for mean several farm whose tenant did not always pay rent shock of discovery be unpleasant salutary in first place kirkstone renounced london profligacy associate came to live at hall in second insisted that sister must dwell with pay handsome yearly sum for privilege in third invited first cousin ellen gilmar to be housekeeper laura kirkstone who be weak bodied weak natured girl readily consented to remain at hall pay what brother demanded a readily welcomed cousin ellen a mistress of household post for have great love having thus arranged matter kirkstone though not yet forty became a penurious a formerly have be wasteful in system of economy be ably assisted by new housekeeper shrewd cold hearted skinflint laura in derision called ellen mr harpagon after molire miser well did miss gilmar deserve name be little black active woman with neat figure somewhat pinched white face eye be hard looking lip be thin be perfect skinflint in management of household even kirkstone inclined a be to economy grumbled at time about excessive economy a month went by fell gradually into saving way of living hall soon gained name in county for be mean niggardly larder be always kept locked servant be ill fed occasional beggar who came to forbidden door be not fed at scraping screwing hoarding of money became order of day kirkstone soon found that be redeeming former waste at cost of hard somewhat hungry life however habit of living thus penuriously became confirmed mr harpagon vied with one in discovering new method of saving money only person in hall who did not relish extreme economy be laura kirkstone attitude adopted by kirkstone towards wealthy sister be fairly amiable one having strong will compelled weaker one to bow to kept sharp watch on lest must marry one of whom did not approve so take money looked upon a rightfully own out of family many young man must have be glad to marry miss kirkstone for money good look for in pink white sort of way girl be pretty kirkstone invited none of must be suitor to house turned cold shoulder to in public laura be forbidden even to speak to being kept closely to own home lived in gaunt grim hall like enchanted princess guarded by two ogre none of young knight who wished to marry have sufficient courage to brave black look of kirkstone acidulated sneer of amiable housekeeper cousin such be position of affair at kirkstone hall when marmaduke dean again entered into life of former friend be death of wife led to dean visit to kirkstone hall have squandered fortune of unhappy lady have treated with so much coldness neglect that have died of broken heart leaving little son dean promptly placed child with distant relative being poor again looked about for mean whereby must procure money recalling easy going generous disposition of kirkstone resolved to apply to for aid quite oblivious to fact that be already in debt to end one day presented at hall be astonished to find that owner from generous friend have changed into miserly curmudgeon kirkstone not only refused to help dean demanded immediate repayment of monies already due dean seeing that only trouble must come of application be on point of withdrawing so a to save danger of being sued for lent money when new idea entered into kirkstone knavish brain made detain dean at hall a necessary element to bring to fruition scheme be none other than marriage of laura to disconsolate widower comprehended division of fortune between brother proposed husband amiable arrangement really amounted to robbery laura forced kirkstone to adopt plan by reason of refusal to let handle fortune have be left to by father like most weak minded people be singularly obstinate on point being cunning enough to see that sole hold over brother lay in retaining command of money always evaded proposal to manage investment beyond income derived from sum paid for board lodging kirkstone have nothing to do with monies of a frequently stated have be robbed naturally be angered to think of loss tried several time to bully laura into surrendering fortune result of ill judged conduct be that laura met force by cunning taking dislike to brother executed secret will whereby left whole of money to ellen gilmar in case there be honour among thief for housekeeper tricked master cousin by keeping secret fact of will when kirkstone tried to marry sister to dean be quite unaware that ellen for own selfish end intended to thwart match if must furthermore new unforeseen obstacle arose to complicate matter for chanced that laura ellen fell in love with scamp be handsome man with plausible manner laura be quite willing to marry to settle half fortune on receiving in return presentable husband with damaged reputation be agreed between kirkstone dean when marriage took place latter must discharge debt to former also pay over certain sum of money by way of commission on marriage settlement so far went well kirkstone invited dean to stay at hall until marriage took place pecuniary arrangement between be settled be then that ellen threw prudence to wind lost heart to dean result of feminine weakness be that ellen did violence to instinct by relaxing stingy rule kept table supplied with better food while dean stayed at hall paid more attention to dress humoured man loved in way altogether behaved in manner so alien to natural self laura became suspicious end of folly be that laura discovered ellen secret lost temper over accused dean of making love to ellen ellen of encouraging advance kirkstone be told by sister seeing chance of losing money by marriage not taking place have stormy scene with ellen threatened to turn out of hall a pauper whereat woman turned at bay on cousin revealed truth about secret will if marriage take place declared lose money a well a if can influence laura to refuse dean will certainly do so if come to point will see who be stronger upshot of conversation be that kirkstone lost temper altogether went to bully sister into revoking will have only remembered that same result must be attained by marriage taking place must have urged on match defied ellen instead of acting thus sensibly vented rage on dean accused of encouraging folly of housekeeper then dean lost temper in turn quarrelled with kirkstone laura so in month of july ' chanced that four people inhabiting kirkstone hall quite misunderstood one for time being be hardly on speaking term dean stormed at kirkstone a trying to thwart proposed marriage kirkstone blamed dean a having encouraged love of ellen laura in weak way fretted ill over whole disturbance only ellen cause of trouble retained placidity did not move inch from position have end to gain in one way be determined to gain be while thing be in unhappy state that country be startled by news that kirkstone have be murdered by dean tragedy took place in certain room strangely furnished by mother of present squire be known a yellow boudoir be favourite apartment with kirkstone who have turned into smoking room on night of th of july kirkstone dean be drinking smoking in room when apparently renewed quarrel with fatal result kirkstone be found dead in room at midnight with knife in heart knife have be brought from america be bowie knife by dean name be marked on handle ellen deposed at inquest that guessing pair might quarrel have gone downstairs shortly before midnight to implore to part then have seen dean leave yellow boudoir in state of alarm alcoholic excitement afterwards kirkstone asked to tell dean to come down again did so dean rejoined kirkstone when parted for second time ellen went to smoking room found kirkstone lying dead with dean knife in heart result of statement be that dean be arrested for murder of friend mainly on evidence of miss gilmar be found guilty man protested innocence in vain must have suffered extreme penalty of law that sympathizing section of public not satisfied with judgment prepared memorial to home secretary sentence be then commuted to penal servitude for life immediate result of crime be that laura on seeing dead body of brother learning that man loved have murdered received shock within three month be dead a will in favour of ellen have never be revoked former housekeeper came in for money also a male heir of kirkstone family be left miss gilmar by will of great great grandfather a daughter of john kirkstone paternal aunt inherited estate therefore ellen gilmar lost man loved found wealthy lonely woman only one thing feared be violent death for dean have declared that unjust sentence be due to lying evidence that if life be spared must day kill apparently have done so such be statement of kirkstone hall crime be undoubtedly in secret way connected with more recent murder of ellen gilmar at grangebury question be did dean strangle out of revenge since have escaped from prison about time miss gilmar left hall on lonely wandering be at large to carry out threat if dean murdered kirkstone must have compunction in committing second crime to revenge on woman who have delivered into hand of justice if dean did not murder kirkstone might be that enraged at unjust sentence have killed miss gilmar to punish for lying evidence have smirched name ruined life in case there be threat to murder miss gilmar on face of implicated convict in grangebury murder deeming man guilty of first crime parge declared that have committed second putting aside first crime gebb maintained that dean be innocent now remains to discover of two be in right chapter vii comment on crime must not be supposed that in informing gebb of detail in connection with long forgotten crime parge gave exact context of newspaper report used rather a note to refresh memory detailed somewhat barren information in conversational manner adding suppressing amplifying evidence in way most necessary to convey clear idea of case to hearer yet at conclusion of reading rather narrative gebb be not satisfied to case seemed incomplete know good deal of what happened before murder said bluntly very little about crime know be reported in newspaper replied fat man casting heavy book on table with irritation probably now wish to know such detail a be not given to public can supply certainly ask what like will answer will arrive at understanding of case soonest way gebb remained silent for few minute watched parge lighting pipe then asked suddenly do believe that dean be innocent of kirkstone hall crime replied parge deliberately on what ground on ground of defence h be said gebb with astonished look be queer ground on to doubt man well absalom can judge for dean declared that be innocent do doubt having regard to new crime said that miss gilmar be guilty no did not accuse ascribed crime to laura what to sister yes mean hound to woman be about to marry be not such foul accusation enough to make believe wretch to be guilty not quite rejoined gebb dryly man may be blackguard without being murderer besides laura seems to have be weak in fact half witted so dean might have have ground for belief however if can recall defence will be in better position to judge briefly replied parge defence be a follows declared that be left alone with kirkstone in yellow boudoir rather smoking room about half past ten o'clock who left kirkstone alone lady accompanied two from drawing room chatted with for few moment before saying good night what cried gebb suspiciously in spite of disturbed atmosphere of house quarrelling yes there existed seemed kind of armed neutrality notwithstanding situation quartet be civil enough to one have doubt about so improbable situation said gebb shaking head well what took place after lady retired kirkstone dean quarrelled over marriage kirkstone seemed began to taunt dean about attention to miss gilmar dean turned round declared that be not attached to miss gilmar for matter of to laura woman said be in love with must marry without consulting kirkstone furthermore swore that if kirkstone insulted more must marry laura without brother consent refuse to pay money doubt at point kirkstone lost temper suggested gebb so dean declared quarrel reached pitch that dean killed kirkstone finished gebb quickly replied parge denied that left room according to own story about eleven o'clock retired to bedroom shortly before midnight when be considering how to act ellen gilmar knocked at door said that kirkstone wanted to see in smoking room dean descended found kirkstone dead at first be tempted to give alarm reflecting on quarrel must have be overheard by of servant fact afterwards proved finding that knife with crime have be committed be own fled back to room then miss gilmar came to see what have occurred found dead body gave alarm accused dean of being murderer because have left kirkstone alive when brought message afterwards found dead when dean fled from room how did dean implicate laura declared that have given bowie knife at own request to prune plant with in conservatory now be ridiculous cried gebb of course be further proof of own guilt lady use bowie knife to prune plant dean however stated that left kirkstone alive when first retired to room miss gilmar stated that cousin be not dead when conveyed message to dean so for defence be maintained that between time miss gilmar left kirkstone time dean returned to yellow room for second visit laura must have killed brother with bowie knife have obtained two day previously from dean why must laura kill brother because a prisoner counsel argued be probable that after last conversation kirkstone fancied that dean might not pay money if marriage came off so resolved to stop by exercising influence over laura while there be yet time laura so dean declared must have revolted killed kirkstone in moment of uncontrollable anger still why must bring knife into smoking room if committed crime on impulse of moment dean did not must not explain that point replied parge with contempt defence be that gave bowie knife that left kirkstone alive in yellow boudoir about eleven that when summoned by miss gilmar found man dead also that held tongue because be afraid of being accused a there have be quarrel between kirkstone wonder be afraid said gebb thoughtfully in case defence be extremely weak what evidence did prosecution bring forward miss gilmar be principal witness a be last person to see kirkstone alive denied knowledge of bowie knife stated that have come downstairs to prevent further quarrelling kirkstone be alone asked to request dean to come back to yellow boudoir went up to dean room asked at first refused later on consented be twenty minute between time miss gilmar left kirkstone alive dean found dead body one point of evidence against dean be that blood be found on shirt cuff explained away by stating that have felt kirkstone heart to see if life remained so got cuff soiled with blood from wound what did laura say to dean accusation denied altogether be horror of thinking that man loved deemed capable of such foul crime be one of cause to bring about death be half witted say said gebb after pause replied parge sharply say so be weak witted soft natured a truly believe perfectly sane see that think might have killed brother in fit of insane rage well be dean defence at least part of laura when in witness box declared that after leaving dean brother in yellow boudoir have not left room night in statement be supported by miss gilmar now can see for gebb that dean be rightfully convicted well said detective reflectively look like justice may not be so for part knowing what do of woman must not be at surprised to learn that miss gilmar be guilty person people suggested a much at time said parge in wise disturbed by suggestion did not believe then now what possible motive must have quite a feasible motive a one ascribed to laura replied gebb did not kirkstone threaten to turn out of door be not intention to deprive miss gilmar of dean by marrying to laura did not try to induce laura to revoke will in favour of housekeeper oh there be plenty of motif when do suggest committed crime why between time dean left yellow room returned to again dare say have row with kirkstone on own account killed then went up to dean with lying message to implicate in matter objected parge again why must accuse dean be man loved yes did not love doubt since be old ill favoured showed dislike to advance too plainly fancy that be case of woman scorned that miss gilmar revenged by accusing dean however be theory added gebb with shrug a such be worth little dean be condemned on miss gilmar testimony doubt intended to kill if must escape although added detective inconsequently believe did why not said parge emphatically did escape believe did kill a sure a sit here be dean who strangled that wretched woman humph humph said gebb perplexed be not certain be absalom why expected to meet with violent death at hand be why left kirkstone hall concealed in various lodging under several false name besides a read in paper constantly consulted fortune teller a to whether must die by violence behaviour showed how lively be fear be very well admitted gebb there be struggle there be wine drunk cigarette smoked by murderer miss gilmar let wander about room what doe prove that knew visitor trusted must not must not have trusted man who have sworn to kill might have gone to disguised a fortune teller suggested parge be rather imaginative suggestion said gebb smiling by way when did dean escape towards end of say that miss gilmar began wandering in year quite so admit that fled to escape dean vengeance be not so certain that killed remember diamond be stolen so may be vulgar murder for robbery after said parge sticking obstinately to point dean killed out of revenge stole diamond to provide with mean of escape have be round pawnshop not yet pawnbroker have be warned also have sent detective over to amsterdam to paris to watch if diamond turn up very good said simon with nod if dean try to pawn jewel will catch believe thief be dean do also that killed miss gilmar well what do intend to do now go down to kirkstone hall see original of yellow boudoir good afterwards interview solicitor who conducted defence for dean mean barrister mean solicitor who be dean solicitor mr prain of bacon lane wo get anything out of absalom said parge warningly be a close a wax who be dean counsel asked gebb ignoring hint clement basson replied parge will induce to talk freely for drink oh be dissipated in sort of way bohemian barrister ruined career through love of pleasure have have few brief not enough to pay life on small income gebb noted nutshell biography in pocket book prepared to take departure have parting glass with fat man after promising to advise of took place in connection with case left house tell cried parge after obstinate to last tell when find dean chapter viii mr prain solicitor when gebb left parge intended to go down to norminster with a little delay a possible look over kirkstone hall there hoped to learn further detail of miss gilmar life to ascertain if possible whether have other enemy besides man have condemned to lifelong imprisonment owing to grasping disposition penurious mode of life be probable that have be extremely unpopular might be that amongst who disliked might be found one who have carried feeling so far a to kill on considering circumstance of case gebb must not bring to believe that dean be assassin same be anxious to ascertain hiding place of convict make certain of innocence of second crime with first be before time have nothing to do on second thought however detective judged must be wiser to call on mr prain beforehand learn opinion on matter also gebb wished to discover why solicitor have not come forward to identify body of miss gilmar from description of yellow boudoir so often referred to in paper must have be aware that so called miss ligram be none other than ellen gilmar if so why have not assisted police to trace woman past history be mainly to elucidate point might be important one in solving mystery that gebb called at office in bacon lane mr prain proved to be small lean faced man with sharp pair of eye hard looking mouth be neatly spotlessly dressed in plainest fashion office somewhat dingy place be a clear trim a when gebb sent in card mr prain have only to glance at name to know that visitor be scotland yard detective told clerk to show in at once be with hard little face set like mask prain received officer of law for have quite expected sooner later to receive visit be not unprepared wish to see mr gebb said solicitor in low crisp voice yes sir about case dealt with twenty year ago oh then have question to ask about case of to day said prain composedly darted sharp look at visitor to see how shot told do know errand asked gebb somewhat uncomfortably for be by mean pleased to find that little solicitor be prepared for reception must not conceive why must be so yes mr gebb do if have not called on be probable must have paid visit be two week since crime be committed mr prain so have have ample time to call doubt returned prain dryly so chanced that be abroad in italy however when saw description of yellow boudoir hastened back at once guessed by description of yellow room that murdered woman be miss gilmar did may ask how found out ex detective told traced identity by same mean a did for recollection of room must have known nothing oh so yellow boudoir gave parge clue said prain thoughtfully yes how did guess referred to parge be detective employed by prosecution to hang client did not succeed for dean still life ah doe do know where be to be found asked gebb sharply replied prain shaking head know that escaped about four year ago that miss gilmar out of fear of left kirkstone hall lest must kill know more know one thing at least retorted gebb astonished at coolness of man that dean killed miss gilmar deny said prain sharply then after pause added do know why came back to england on reading about death how must why intended to call on no will have to answer own question mr prain then will tell said solicitor slowly wish to find out if miss gilmar left confession behind stating why how killed john kirkstone be for reason returned so quickly miss gilmar kill kirkstone cried gebb thinking of own suspicion why even unhappy client did not accuse unhappy client a call be fool retorted prain coolly thought that laura kirkstone be guilty whereas be sure that housekeeper killed master must not bring crime home to dean be condemned to penal servitude on account of murder be certain did not commit when heard of escape thought might find out miss gilmar make confess always intended to escape if possible for purpose gebb thought for moment perhaps killed after because must not confess said with hesitation replied prain dean be wild wasteful between mr gebb not altogether a well behaved a might have be be sure be not man to commit murder believe be a innocent of second crime a be of first well said gebb thoughtfully have doubt regarding guilt in case agree with going by story told to by parge that miss gilmar killed kirkstone who killed miss gilmar unknown person for sake of diamond returned prain promptly diamond yes miss gilmar took possession of laura kirkstone jewel amongst be valuable diamond read in paper miss gilmar wore diamond nightly that when dead body be discovered diamond be gone true enough replied gebb might be case of robbery a say if murderer try to dispose of diamond by sale pawning will be able to catch may tell said prain after reflection that most valuable of laura jewel be diamond necklace see by report in paper be stolen by murderer now that necklace be given to laura by dean miss gilmar have right to how must dean who be almost bankrupt afford to give laura diamond necklace necklace be family jewel said solicitor quickly have description of will have copied give to may assist to trace necklace thereby snare murderer answered gebb thank mr prain description speak of will be very serviceable now wish to ask few question about miss gilmar if mind replying to why must mind retorted prain raising eyebrow parge gave to understand be a close a wax said gebb pointedly use own word prain shrugged shoulder deny said quietly why must twenty year ago be trying to save dean from being hanged while parge be doing best to place rope round man neck naturally be on guard refused to tell parge knew position be different one mr gebb a with desire to learn name of miss gilmar murderer be quite at service can ask what please thank then tell who inherits miss gilmar property do mean real personal estate asked prain replied gebb promptly well then must know that kirkstone estate be entailed entail ended with first murder so heard from parge mr prain in male line yes in male line afterwards by will of kirkstone who bought who lived hundred fifty year ago pas on through female line now male line died out with john kirkstone so that estate passed by will to female line represented by laura when died ellen gilmar inherited through mother who be kirkstone aunt on paternal side now that miss gilmar be dead estate pas to john alder barrister who inherits through mother distant cousin of kirkstones if died edith wedderburn must inherit who be cousin yes even more distant than alder be now at kirkstone hall looking after for miss gilmar who placed there so far a personal estate be concerned miss gilmar can leave by will to whomsoever plea have will yes ca open save in presence of likely to inherit miss wedderburn alder in short relative whom do think money be left to be not place to say said prain with sudden stiffness gebb saw that little solicitor knew content of will be bound by professional etiquette must not disclose well said covering disappointment with cough may leave out of question tell about miss wedderburn have told replied prain sharply be caretaker of kirkstone hall be very poor be very pretty extremely pretty ho ho said gebb in jocular tone in case must have lover have two answered prain dryly one be john alder what heir yes if marries will still be mistress of kirkstone hall wo said prain rubbing chin with vexed air for simple reason that like other lover better who be other lover artist called arthur ferris be poor handsome good look wo make pot boil said gebb sententiously well be not particularly anxious for further information about love affair what wish to know be if miss wedderburn corresponded with miss gilmar ca tell know do think miss wedderburn be aware of cousin death said gebb putting question in form be improbable a must have written to on subject have known by way be body buried of course be two week since murder true forgot said prain thoughtfully wonder if alder know about death ca know unless traced by yellow boudoir oh alder doe know much about room crime a belongs to younger generation story be almost forgotten however will write to on subject be necessary that must learn position a speedily a possible if only on account of will be own concern said gebb rising still might arrange for to have interview with a might throw light on subject fail to see how can said prain raising eyebrow miss gilmar never corresponded with during travel if one will know about will be miss wedderburn ah be going down to see said gebb putting on hat will have look at original of yellow boudoir at same time say said prain a detective moved towards door well replied gebb turning if see edith ask about lover of alder ferris said gebb stolidly mention name of repeated prain slowly ask about lover then well will see what will come of question detective gazed steadily at solicitor what do mean demanded struck by significance of man word look will find out when answer how will answer demanded gebb quite mystified ah said prain with long breath ask see chapter ix kirkstone day following conversation with little solicitor gebb left waterloo station for norminster in hampshire arrived at quaint little town about midday on making inquiry learned that kirkstone hall be mile distant situate amid wood near bank of avon a be fine morning gebb be fond of walking used own leg to reach destination after pleasant stroll through rural lane across flowering meadow reached pair of finely wrought iron gate stood wide open gate be covered with red rust lodge beside be shut up stately avenue curved upward between noble oak tree be overgrown with grass even on threshold a be of estate gebb espied ruinous economy of late miss gilmar on coming in sight of hall found hand of time still more heavily laid upon work of man be quaint jacobean building of red brick set upon slight rise surrounded by stone terrace from main body two wing spread to right left window of be closely shuttered hall door be also closed so far a gebb must see smoke curled from stack of chimney terrace be grass grown garden untended in disorder whole place have silent melancholy aspect a though soul of house have departed be palace of sleeping beauty enchanted spell bound seemed a though there be curse on place wonder said gebb looking at gaunt mansion grim even in sunshine seeing kind of people who lived in crime committed ascended step rang bell before sound have died away be aware of brisk step approaching turned to see young lady walking along terrace on right be tall dark with fine eye handsome face figure be shown to perfection by trim tailor made costume wore in hand carried silver headed cane walked smartly towards detective with air of woman fully alive to importance of time when spoke voice be deep full matter of speech be remarkably business like on whole gebb judged miss edith wedderburn for guessed that be young lady referred to by prain to be clever plain spoken woman with few of weakness of sex to hamper what conceived to be duty good day said lady with comprehensive glance may ask what want wish to see miss wedderburn well see now be miss wedderburn can do anything for yes replied gebb becoming a curt a business like a herself can give trifle of information can said miss wedderburn dryly entirely depends upon humour what want to know also why what to know who be name be absalom gebb be wiser interrupted girl with pointed insolence of new scotland yard detective finished gebb coolly time reply made decided impression on hitherto cool auditor rich colouring of face vanished a by magic became pale even to lip nevertheless forced to smile with composure controlled emotion by powerful effort of will startled a be even attempted to speak lightly what doe mr absalom gebb detective wish with said in low voice eye fixed on man face wish to ask few question said gebb in same vein about what about whom about miss ligram ligram know name said edith calmly who be miss ligram owner of place be wrong there mr

be dead dead murdered murdered oh god when where in suburb of london called grangebury on twenty fourth of last month edith looked rigidly at detective with horror in dark eye for moment seemed scarcely to comprehend news appeared to be genuinely astonished shocked yet next question conveyed to gebb hint that be not altogether unprepared for information did kill stammered laying hand on gebb arm who asked cunning detective trying to trap into hasty speech dean marmaduke dean said girl breathlessly what do know about marmaduke dean everything doubt know more than do have never heard of

gaze with steady look of own whether from fear modesty eye fell turned away to obey request lead within door gebb followed in silence along terrace round corner of house until paused before open french window led into pleasant sunny apartment of great size before entering edith who have evidently be considering last speech turned to excuse mr gebb said with air of great dignity word seem to imply know more than dare tell assure that suspicion be unjust unfounded intelligence of miss gilmar death be terrible unexpected to aid can give to bring assassin to justice will have question ask will answer desire to see in house will show in justice to myself must ask not to credit with guilty knowledge dear young lady be last person in world to do so said gebb quickly for moment suppose that know anything of cousin unhappy death disclaim sentiment with credit must admit that there be necessity for to exculpate a be doing be not exculpating in least rejoined miss wedderburn coldly detective seem to be so suspicious that see ill where none exists gebb laughed have be reading detective novel said indulgently believe detective be not so black a novelist paint a said before desultory conversation be not useful must rather see yellow boudoir edith nodded led way into house gebb followed through sitting room faced terrace down wide passage on wall of hung many picture mostly ancestral portrait at end of passage guide unlocked door with key selected from bunch dangled at girdle threw open so gebb must pas into room before did so without hesitation be yellow boudoir said miss wedderburn following detective be in room that unfortunate mr kirkstone be killed twenty year ago by dean not by dean replied miss wedderburn sharply from have heard dean be a innocent of crime a be then who be guilty asked gebb artfully be not detective said edith moving towards window so can not give opinion if will permit will admit air light so that can see room to fullest advantage when entered boudoir have be in kind of semi darkness a shutter of one window be closed now miss wedderburn threw open sunlight poured in dust raised by foot danced in mote spec in sun ray gebb dazzled by strong glare felt eye somewhat painful however soon became habituated to flood of glorious light looked with deep interest at original of room have seen in paradise row apartment be larger than have be occupied by miss gilmar in grangebury in respect furnishing appointment be same a have carried out whim with utmost care furniture in place of being cane be chippendale window door be differently placed colouring of whole room be more subdued mellowed by time predominating hue be same carpet be yellow sprinkled with bunch of pale primrose flower wall be draped with costly

wedderburn who be standing near window room be similar to in miss lig mean in miss gilmar be murdered girl looked puzzled be making mistake said be kirkstone who be killed here not miss gilmar oh be referring to room at grangebury returned gebb quickly miss gilmar lodging mean asked edith still perplexed yes room be furnished like impossible from what knew of cousin must not have spent money in furnishing costly room nevertheless did replied gebb coolly of course imitation be somewhat gimcrack done on cheap scale for assure resemblance between original copy be marvellous strange muttered edith sitting down on primrose hued couch wonder why ellen tell about terrible murder broke off from beginning chapter x strange behaviour after reflection gebb concluded that miss wedderburn be quite ignorant of cause have led to cousin death also of detail of death therefore told a concisely a possible story of tragedy from time mr presk have be brought to grangebury police station down to visit have paid to prain solicitor point in story suppressed others amplified on whole gave very fair unprejudiced account with attentive ear eye fixed on face of narrator edith sat listening hand clasped loosely on lap several time asked question a rule let account flow on uninterruptedly when gebb ended heaved deep sigh whether of relief pity detective must not say rose to pace up down room evidently be more moved by tragic fate of wretched cousin than chose to admit gebb having told story waited for to recover comment on matter poor ellen said miss wedderburn at length speaking to rather than to companion miserable ending to miserable life be not astonished how be said gebb with sharp look at surely tragedy be unexpected enough miss wedderburn shook head ellen always said that sooner later must be murdered by mr dean yes replied edith quietly by mr dean oh said detective taking long breath thought believed in innocence of dean so do never said did only remarked that ellen declared mr dean must kill well have be murdered in most barbarous manner do say dean be criminal do said edith answering one by asking know what to think replied gebb crossly do responded miss wedderburn then for quite two minute there be dead silence be broken by gebb be miss gilmar unpopular in part asked very unpopular people round here called mr harpagon from miserly habit did like miss wedderburn replied girl coolly did not did like there be love lost between wanted caretaker wished for home staying here be simple matter of business surely be sorry to hear of murder be not utterly without heart mr gebb although seem to think so yes be sorry must be sorry for one who met with so cruel death have miss gilmar enemy asked gebb impatient of fencing kept at distance told be unpopular said edith slowly know that have enemy bitter enough to murder except dean of course replied unmoved always except mr dean then must have killed be not impossible retorted miss wedderburn coolly gebb rare thing for to do lost temper completely madame cried in rage will will not answer plainly there be need to raise voice sir be answering not plainly what do call plainly asked edith with provoking smile know what mean said gebb testily call black black white white call kind of grey believe be grey when mixed however see what mean mr gebb so lose temper wish to know why miss gilmar left place how left why be in charge yes will be glad of information very good said edith calmly then will hear history will be just a well for to tell said gebb dryly at least so far a concern miss gilmar detail be of value in connection with case please go on took out pencil pocket book be orphan said miss wedderburn taking notice of action a lost parent five year ago be then eighteen year of age at school in canterbury on death of father mother be unable to continue education therefore a have parent friend money be in anything pleasant position did father leave money inquired gebb with sympathy if have must not be here sir father died so poor that there be hardly enough money to pay funeral expense tell detail mr gebb so that may understand position here when found thrown on world did not know what to do a be unable to obtain situation a companion governess then remembered ellen gilmar relative of father who knew be living quiet life in place on money left to by laura kirkstone wrote to explained position a doubt found life here extremely dull asked to stay with a companion without salary offer did not attract greatly did ellen on first interview be in unenviable position when beggar ca be chooser so be forced to accept offer have be here for last five year on whole have reason to complain of lot in life be miss gilmar kind to edith shrugged shoulder a kind a must be to one quarrelled once twice about what see that have right to ask question said edith quietly still to show how candid be will answer frankly quarrelled about certain mr alder what john alder barrister yes said miss wedderburn rather surprised do know not personally heard about from mr prain mr prain seems to have be very confidential however gentleman wished to marry miss gilmar thought ought to accept a be heir to kirkstone estate also because intended to leave money without provision for oh said miss wedderburn indifferently ellen be not bound to leave money seeing that have provided with free board lodging advised to marry mr alder so make certain of being comfortable for life did not like so refused to become wife now suppose will turn out of door must be so cruel said gebb with glance at handsome haughty face might might not be much liked by friend suppose have a much charity a most people decides ca stay on here now that be master doe know that cousin be dead ca say think so unless like prain discovered death through newspaper description of yellow boudoir will find out soon have doubt said edith come down to offer choice of being wife leaving hall will certainly go to continue story remained with miss gilmar got on fairly well with told about murder fear of being killed by dean often congratulated that be in prison what did do when heard of escape be beside with terror thinking must come down here to murder determined to leave hall made arrangement a regard money with solicitor asked to take charge of place agreed went away over three year ago have never said miss wedderburn with emphasis set eye on since did know course of wandering sometimes when wrote to inquire if dean have made appearance at hall a rule heard nothing knew not where be last time wrote be about six month ago did not say then where next resting place must be a be not inclined to be confidential did not ask question did know that carried about duplicate of room not until told never see newspaper down here can tell why did so be hard to explain said edith with puzzled look when ellen be here sat constantly in room seemed greatly attached to know why seeing that have be scene of cousin murder suppose wanted to keep threat of dean to kill constantly in mind so framed duplicate of room that might not forget danger run risk of being lulled into state of dangerous security must hardly account for strange fancy for room said gebb shaking head can supply other reason answered edith reflectively ellen be very eccentric one must not always account for whim be superstitious very believed in omen fortune teller kind of rubbish yet fancy have not always be so weak minded be dread of violent death made consult people did ever drop hint about murder dropped hint a call said edith stiffly told whole story very plainly quite believed that dean be guilty yet might have killed kirkstone said gebb after pause be impossible have reason to do so moreover if have be guilty must certainly have betrayed to be use speaking ill of dead mr gebb yet can not say that cousin be good woman perhaps not retorted miss wedderburn on other hand can not say that be murderess well sir have told know see can not help in way be not so sure of replied gebb coolly have not yet closed examination edith flushed looked uneasy like word said in irritable tone sound a though be criminal in dock be strong way of putting miss wedderburn why not compare to witness in witness box oh call what like cried girl rising impatiently let finish conversation a quickly a possible have told about miss gilmar about room about mr alder know nothing more nothing miss wedderburn think again tell know nothing said edith now crimson with rage what do mean by hint mean that have lover remarked gebb acting on advice of prain quite in dark a to what must bring forth miss wedderburn sat down promptly again on couch a though limb refused to support flush on face gave place to deadly pallor shook in limb a though overcome with terror arthur faltered know about voice stopped fell back in faint chapter xi mad gardener gebb be not easily surprised being used by reason of profession to traffic in mystery unexpected fainting of edith at apparently innocent question perplexed beyond measure of course girl have not told whole of history so doubt in portion thus kept back lay explanation of violent emotion gebb being ignorant of cause be amazed at result hullo said throwing open window to admit fresh air there be something queer about prain hinted that if asked about lover might hear something strange action speak quite a loud a word fainting have meaning in well well must revive first question afterwards be easier said than done a there be restorative of sort at hand miss wedderburn lay back on couch motionless white image of death even breeze from open window must not restore sens gebb be about to throw wide open door shout for assistance when through window caught sight of man crossing lawn immediately hailed loudly man jumped round suddenly a though startled by call after hesitation moved forward slowly unwillingly to crane head into room be queer old creature with shaggy white hair untrimmed beard two glittering eye set so closely together a to give uncanny look be dressed in suit of old clothes discoloured rusty with elbow on window sill moped mowed in smiling vacant way at detective at first near glance gebb saw that newcomer be not in right mind here man said making best of doubtful assistant bring water lady have fainted man grinned turned eye towards white face of edith over own shade passed with result of altering from gay to grave even looked terrified with kind of hoarse cry pointed one lean finger at unconscious girl be dead did kill asked in harsh whisper replied detective soothingly a must speak to child have fainted bring water kill whispered man nodding be good room to kill people in use for here wo tell 'd rather see dead than alive be better for grave bed for weary head hush bring water cried gebb shrinking back from horrible creature be off with madman shrank back in turn at peremptory tone of detective vanished with nod just a sigh sounded through room cool draught playing on forehead of edith have at length produced effect with second sigh longer than first opened eye looked vacantly at gebb detective caught hand slapped vigorously whereat girl sat up with effort faintness passed away still brain be not quite clear looked languidly at gebb a though be in dream what did say asked in low voice be have what be passed slow hand across forehead fainted miss wedderburn replied gebb softly yes remember fainted asked about oh god know covered eye with one hand before must speak again harsh cracked voice be heard singing in distance raven be fowl for sits upon gallows tree bravely bravely doth sing in voice so low rich while flaunting in garb of pitch murderer corpse doe gaily swing ho ho have have raven gallows tree ah miss wedderburn shivered nervously a gruesome ditty sounded nearer put finger in ear to shut out singing be martin with fearful song said softly martin who be martin asked gebb amazed at extraordinary proceeding martin martin mad martin croaked harsh voice there at window stood crazy man leering in fawning manner holding tin basin half full of water dipping hand into sprinkled few drop towards edith singing tunelessly while weep till tear roll a flood baptise thee now with blood with exclamation of annoyance edith rose snatching basin out of man hand shut window hurriedly martin gave frightened whimper slunk away while mistress soaking handkerchief in water bathed pale face gebb judiciously waiting development of event stood quietly by wondering silent be lunatic asylum miss wedderburn asked when be more composed judged judicious to recommence conversation of course not replied irritably man be mad quite harmless martin martin know other name be excellent gardener usually quiet enough although will sing gruesome song about gallows murder to day for reason be worse than usual ought to be placed under restraint said gebb carelessly for be too bent on questioning companion to be distracted by lunatic be not to point may ask what caused to faint miss wedderburn girl raised head directed steady stare at gebb in turn may ask why come here to question said defiantly thought explained errand before replied detective mildly be here to learn if possible who killed miss gilmar can not tell know nothing about until gave news be not aware even that be dead yet be not so surprised by information a expected that can be easily explained mr gebb said edith wringing out wet handkerchief a told before knew of cousin fear be perhaps pursued by mr dean when escaped from prison with avowed intention be reported of killing left home a know in order to hide from be possible say added with emphasis be possible that dean tracked down revenged for conduct of twenty year ago wish to learn who killed miss gilmar sir tell know mr dean in opinion be innocent on face of admit that appearance be against perhaps if find man question may arrive at truth be not improbable replied gebb coolly must catch first still miss wedderburn opinion of dean guilt innocence doe not explain recent conduct to put plain question miss 'what made faint ' be business said edith haughtily with averted eye mine too why must faint because ask if have lover besides mr alder refuse to answer in case observed gebb artfully there must be something wrong with arthur how dare call arthur flashed out miss wedderburn call who arthur asked gebb laying trap for hasty tongue mr fer stopped bit lip hesitating a must appear whether to tell name not after momentary pause evidently deemed bold speaking safest policy for continued calmly after there be reason why must not tell name none in world so far a can see answered detective with shrug know that christian name be arthur what be surname of lover miss wedderburn how do know have lover retorted edith answering one question by asking how do know that have two lover corrected gebb coolly because told about one named mr john alder mr prain spoke to about other came here with certain amount of knowledge miss mr prain what have to do with know be waiting for to tell edith clasped hand together with restless movement walked up down room hastily suddenly a though making up mind to inevitable stopped before detective mr gebb said clearly distinctly have reason to conceal anything in life be engaged to gentleman named arthur ferris whose occupation be that of artist have nothing to do with murder of miss gilmar that swear there be need to swear said gebb wondering at vehemence why did faint when asked about thought thought might suspect faltered miss wedderburn in low tone know how suspicious detective be seem to think that know more than tell be wrong suspect mr ferris said gebb quietly be so strange that must faint at simple question naturally wished to find out reason well sir know now know reason choose to give replied gebb significantly will excuse saying that be rather weak one can give other must if wished then refuse to give other rejoined edith with frown quite so replied gebb rising well there be nothing for for to take leave for present added significantly sudden cessation of gebb question alarmed edith more than question have done looked uneasy once twice appeared about to speak closed lip again without word conducted gebb silently out of house detective be rather annoyed by self control a sole reason of manoeuvre be to make miss wedderburn talk nine woman out of ten must have done so have defended with many word girl be evidently tenth knew value of silence however gebb be too experienced to show annoyance mentally resolving to question sphinx on future occasion when be not so much on guard took leave with last warning ought to have mad gardener locked up said looking up to miss wedderburn a stood on terrace else there will be murder in yellow boudoir oh martin be quite harmless replied edith calmly told so before so harmless that have lived in grangebury must have suspected of killing cousin responded gebb dryly forthwith took departure considerably puzzled a well might be by attitude of young lady so far have baffled completely a walked down neglected avenue heard harsh cracked voice of mad martin piping tuneless ditty shortly afterwards met with man face to face with lean bent form picturesque rag venerable white beard man looked like lear insane wretched when saw gebb creature stopped singing broke into cackling laugh have little mirth in gebb usually self controlled careless of impression shuddered at merriment of hell be in love with too asked detective replied gebb humouring man why do think so john alder came here loved said martin reflectively arthur ferris came loved thought might be third wo win heart oh young arthur have done that tall straight dark handsome arthur with mark of satan on cheek mark of satan repeated gebb puzzled by description of ferris hist cried martin with uplifted finger be wizard witch dance in yellow room when moon be up young arthur have red mark on cheek satan baptized there with blood oh blood oh blood moaned wretched creature nothing blood ' knife for rope for death in yellow room be alive be dead hath gotten tomb with long dolorous cry martin ran up avenue swinging arm leaving gebb to puzzle out enigmatic verse a best must chapter xii diamond necklace gebb much to disgust returned to norminster a wise a have left beyond meeting lunatic interviewing obstinate young woman have spent time money to little purpose be with perplexed brain that sat down to consider future movement in face of failure be at loss how to act miss wedderburn with what looked like deliberate intention only repeated story already knew miss gilmar have confessed to fear of dean have fled from hall on account of fear travel hiding extraordinary precaution have be undertaken solely to thwart revenge of dean gebb be aware of fact there be nothing more in likely to instruct have so far exhausted capability what be to do asked for say fiftieth time how be to act in direction be to move miss wedderburn without given reason say that dean be innocent prain be of same way of thinking so be parge alone seems to believe in dean guilt agree with man may be able to supply evidence to reveal truth where be to be found gebb must answer question no more than must others propounded vainly racked usually inventive brain to settle on course likely to elucidate mystery finally after mature reflection resolved to call upon prain ask to explain meaning of miss wedderburn fainting lawyer have told to ask certain question see what answer must bring well have done so answer be that girl without apparent cause have fainted perhaps prain knew reason since edith refused to reveal sole course be to question solicitor so to prain detective went full of curiosity two day after return from country interval have be filled up in attending to business unconnected with grangebury mystery now gebb returned to again sought mr prain in hope of learning something tangible spirit be very low well mr gebb said brisk mr prain after greeting have passed have not be idle since saw last have sent description of necklace to police have informed mr alder of miss gilmar death have received instruction about will there be will then without doubt miss gilmar made will before left hall in favour of mr alder said gebb yes of course by will of kirkstone ancestor mr alder becomes possessed of hall miss gilmar have left personal property be money inherited from laura kirkstone to also miss wedderburn be sorry to say receives nothing poor girl will have to leave hall prain shrugged shoulder be at own discretion said coolly mr alder be in love with so if marries wo marry interrupted gebb be in love with engaged to mr ferris ah told about scamp told very little mr prain fainted when mentioned man under very general description of lover fainted hum prain looked so serious perplexed that gebb be impelled to question further touching matter why did faint asked detective bluntly know be ca exactly say stammered other gebb looked at solicitor who in turn stared at carpet ceiling at paper on desk anywhere at questioner mr prain said seriously be not treating fairly beg pardon said prain nervously a rule be not nervous man see how make out do replied gebb sharply know reason of fainting perhaps do be not at liberty to reveal knowledge secret be miss wedderburn have anything to do with murder replied prain decisively that have not then why did tell to ask about ferris because wanted to be sure of something that fainting have enlightened ca tell more cried gebb with indignation can not answered prain bluntly get miss wedderburn permission will even if did know knowledge must be of use to have miss wedderburn theory about murder not that know of saw last mr gebb doe know who killed miss gilmar why not ask said prain evading question did ca make out what mean say that dean be innocent wo give reason now parge declares that dean be guilty well mr gebb perhaps be indeed sneered gebb who be growing irritated last time saw mr prain denied guilt do so now cried prain warmly believe a do gebb that dean be innocent of crime killed kirkstone miss gilmar know what miss wedderburn reason be be right to defend dean still added prain with shrug deny that many people look on man a murderer doe mr alder believe in dean guilt in double guilt yes be sure of can ask for added prain looking at watch will be here soon will be glad to meet what be opinion about crime told last time saw replied solicitor miss gilmar be murdered by one of fortune teller for sake of diamond recover that necklace will soon trace assassin be not much of idea said gebb scornfully be best have got at event retorted prain with heat have done best to prove truth by sending description of necklace to police dare say description be in hand of pawnbroker by time said gebb thoughtfully well will see what will come of what about ferris ferris repeated prain in wise astonished at abrupt question well be artist bit of scamp with whom edith wedderburn be in love know why perhaps because be scamp woman seem to like scamp for reason best known to be handsome very tall dark rather military looking have mark on one cheek yes birth mark not disfiguring how did know about lunatic at kirkstone hall told called mark of satan by way who be man gardener who used to live at hall in kirkstone time think tragedy of yellow room must have sent off head at event ran away after occurred only turned up year two ago quite mad why did lock up well see miss wedderburn who be rather strong minded young woman think kindness may cure so gave back old post of gardener if miss gilmar have be there think must have be allowed to stay think that miss w experiment will be success sings most gruesome song about murder blood yellow room know replied prain cheerfully be afraid that last muddled brain inspired muse did sing compose verse when knew man complete wreck used to be rather handsome stupid own father must know now be sorry for poor devil a now that alder owns hall dare say will be kicked out have to end day in asylum best place for in opinion said gebb emphatically be a mad a march hare not so harmless hullo who be that knocking come in proved to be note from inspector lackland asking gebb to come down to grangebury in first instance have gone to scotland yard a seemed important have be sent on to detective who have left word that must be at prain in case be wanted seems important said gebb reading wonder what lackland want to see about eh prain prain be not attending to be busy shaking hand with tall broad shouldered man fair haired blue eyed altogether comely to look upon gentleman be introduced to gebb by name of alder whereby detective be informed that stood in presence of miss gilmar heir miss wedderburn lover alder on hearing gebb name looked at keenly saluted with marked cordiality be glad to meet mr gebb said in loud hearty tone indeed be rather like fox hunting squire than barrister how be getting on with case of poor cousin murder have caught dean answered gebb plainly to tell truth be not sure that dean be culprit if knew what dean said about know dean said interrupted gebb also that escaped for think killed miss gilmar kirkstone for matter of hum said alder thoughtfully see be of basson opinion mr clement basson do know asked detective must think so replied alder smiling have known for year be dean counsel in kirkstone case instructed said prain complacently believed in dean innocence a did unfortunately united effort must not get poor devil off think will call on mr basson said detective thoughtfully where be to be found blackstone lane fleet street replied alder promptly what do expect to learn from reason for believing dean not guilty be same a mine cried prain know how stating over again can help doe not know where dean be still mr gebb have better see basson suggested alder with conviction something may come of visit will call on afterwards mr gebb tell what learn from basson be to be found in temple a may guess be most anxious that dean must be traced intend to offer reward of two hundred pound for capture hope will earn hope so too answered gebb much pleased be certain that dean be guilty if be not know who be replied alder emphatically for time being conversation ended gebb left alder to consult with prain a to necessity of exhuming body of miss gilmar for identification took way down to grangebury to learn why bluff lackland have written so earnest urgent note found plethoric inspector in state of excitement bordering on apoplexy wondered what must have occurred to stimulate martinet to such unusual excitement that gebb cried lackland moment detective put nose inside door george be glad to see be found sir found what do think of hey what be found name of murderer something a useful diamond necklace said lackland slowly say so cried gebb excitedly be sold pawned pawned interrupted inspector aaron nathan harold street city came into possession day after murder devil assassinating friend lost time who pawned young man who called james brown james fiddlestick said gebb contemptuously false name what be like tall dark handsome said lackland with military brevity aaron said that put necklace up spout a cool a cucumber be hold on cried gebb eagerly have mark on one cheek birth mark by george have purple spot not large enough to spoil look thought so said detective joyously so be arthur ferris did arthur who asked lackland gruffly arthur ferris of chelsea artist pawned necklace stole diamond murdered miss gilmar hurrah have got chapter xiii arthur ferris unexpected discovery that ferris have pawned necklace spurred gebb to unusual activity no longer doubtful how to act hastened to procure warrant of arrest against young man yet before doing so to be certain that belief be not false one called first at aaron nathan worthy jew questioned closely concerning necklace man who have pawned ornament corresponded in way with description furnished by prain individual on evidence of appearance of birth mark on right cheek must not be mistaken for one ferris furthermore connection with edith who in turn be connected with murdered woman gave colour to gebb assumption that ferris be guilty person understand now why miss wedderburn fainted said gebb to thought when mentioned a lover have discovered truth feared for safety doubt having informed about necklace miss gilmar fear of death killed robbed woman in hope that dean must be blamed if thing be a gebb surmised ferris in hoping that crime must be laid to charge of dean displayed amount of cunning hardly compatible with disposal of plunder have accomplished crime so cleverly have escaped so mysteriously that gebb must not understand why have pawned necklace so openly very next day under obviously false name of james brown rashness nullified former caution for might have guessed information concerning jewel must be sent to pawnshop a criminal ferris evidently have to learn abc of craft why did not wait until storm blew over before pawning necklace murmured gebb much perplexed at least take stone out of setting sell separately either in london paris amsterdam discovery must have be more difficult in case why did pawn so hurriedly unless intended to leave england in case edith wedderburn must have known of intended departure probably must have gone with rum sort of cove must be gebb in manner argued case for against ferris for young man conduct displayed mixture of caution rashness a to perplex detective still be no use a well knew to waste time in making brick without straw when arrest of culprit might enable to gain frank explanation of obviously silly action so gebb on evidence of pawning procured warrant proceeded to take ferris in charge a further mark of man folly have given wrong name right address gebb proceeding to chelsea asked at eden street house for mr brown only to be told that mr ferris be sole lodger in nave simplicity of novice in crime almost made detective swear to innocence on spot confound said gebb disconcerted by man have gone about pawning so openly that really believe be guiltless of crime be born fool although even be doubtful miss wedderburn be not sort of woman to love idiot although doe protect one seems to a be dealing with lot of crazy folk ferris chanced to be absent at time of gebb visit be expected back moment so on intimating that wished to see artist on matter of importance must wait for return detective be shown into studio be bare apartment of size with ample light few decoration ferris seemed to be rather hard worker than artistic dandy for there be scattered around none of knickknack bibelots many painter love to collect there be sprawling clay figure near carpeted da for model specimen of work on wall plaster head unfinished picture lying about in disorder on easel beside rusty iron stove landscape picture in progress of painting altogether studio looked anything that of sybarite in wise accorded with prain description of ferris a scamp for scamp a rule owe doubtful reputation to assiduity in gratifying taste best worst yet must have be hard pushed for money to murder old woman in order to rob said gebb so if be economical here expect be wasteful in other way hullo here be letter on writing table with norminster postmark empty added in disgust finding letter inside yet be from girl be certain handwriting be that of woman hum yesterday date see by postmark have be writing to warn know about matter wish must find letter be deep one girl a sharp a needle must have bungled murder a ferris have done with doubtful tribute of admiration gebb calmly proceeded to turn over paper on writing table examine drawer must find letter from edith amongst loose paper drawer proved to be locked showed that ferris be more cautious man than conduct in pawning necklace indicated how far gebb must have proceeded with search how successful must have be be hard to say for just a be casting eye towards bureau thought might contain paper likely to illuminate ferris dark way door opened man entered with brisk step appeared agitated rather pale on whole composed business like for moment so did not speak looked at gebb with very friendly expression of countenance on side detective scrutinized face of newcomer with close attention to see in what degree corresponded to description of prain martin beheld tall slender man with intelligent expression brilliant black eye on short upper lip there be small pointed moustache gave rather military appearance on right cheek purple mark size of sixpence skin being so dark did not show very conspicuously be dressed quietly in good style to appearance be man who respected too much to indulge in profligacy with be credited by prain gebb be rather favourably impressed by than otherwise must not help regretting errand be told be waiting to see said ferris civilly may inquire business be name arthur ferris be may ask what arrest in queen name interrupted gebb laying one hand on young man shoulder with other drawing forth warrant ferris turned white even to lip leaped back with exclamation of alarm surprise detective action seemed to amaze arrest why what for who be name be gebb be detective here be warrant for arrest mr ferris on charge of murder murder repeated ferris much agitated a be natural accuse of murder there be mistake people in position always say so replied gebb dryly there be mistake murdered woman called gilmar on twenty fourth of july last be lie more murdered miss gilmar than did have yet to be proved sir here be warrant have couple of men outside in case of need however have desire to make trouble if come along with quietly will use civilly can drive to prison in hansom ferris who be looking round wildly a though for mean of escape started recoiled at sound of ill omened word to prison echoed hoarsely great god must not take to prison be innocent tell know nothing of murder have evidence to contrary said gebb quietly advise sir to hold tongue anything say now will be used in evidence against will not hold tongue said ferris with more composure there be nothing can say likely to inculpate in matter protest against action protest against being treated a criminal can protest a much a like mr ferris must come with may thank star have not put darbies on give word not to attempt escape will walk out arm in arm one will guess where be going see wish to make matter easy for will not try to escape said unfortunate young man proudly a have done nothing wrong if must go to prison on charge must thank mr gebb for civility swear before god that be innocent of crime with speech resumed hat walked slowly out of studio gebb followed forthwith slipped arm within of ferris so that pair seemed to be leaving house in friendly way two men be waiting at distance on gebb nodding to to intimate that charge be amenable to reason walked off shortly afterwards detective ferris got into hansom gebb directed driver whither to go then turned to comfort companion for whose despair felt extremely sorry certainly young man conduct did not suggest guilt cheer up mr ferris said kindly if be innocent will soon be out of trouble know how ever came into replied ferris disconsolately mean kindly mr gebb therefore in spite of what say regarding remark being used against will speak freely did not know miss gilmar at never set eye on in life until yesterday be not aware of death see miss wedderburn wrote informed of said gebb coolly what do know of miss wedderburn asked ferris in surprise have seen spoken with know from own lip that be engaged to on writing table saw envelope with norminster postmark yesterday date so guessed that wrote to about miss gilmar death did have reason to conceal did not mention that have conversed with perhaps not mr ferris be young lady who can keep own counsel have secret know of said ferris haughtily gebb shrugged shoulder have one about said calmly indeed replied other with sarcasm do know what be mr gebb did not know when saw know now miss wedderburn be aware that killed miss gilmar did say so asked ferris anxiously guess be secret be guilty know swear be not rejoined ferris vehemently never saw miss gilmar did not murder know nothing about woman do know anything about diamond necklace diamond necklace stammered ferris changing colour with visible start for leading question evidently took by surprise yes necklace pawned on twenty fifth of july to aaron nathan be be mine replied young man a clearly a consternation must let be not yours said gebb sharply be miss gilmar wore on night of murder be taken from corpse did not take did not take yet pawned yes pawned swear did not take then how did come in possession refuse to answer question said ferris sullenly gebb shrugged shoulder just a please said fact of pawning that necklace be cause of arrest if can explain explain nothing intend to keep business to myself then will be in danger of gallows ferris bit lip shuddered be innocent said wonderfully calm considering position refuse to state how became possessed of necklace chapter xiv surprising discovery next day ferris be brought up before magistrate on charge of murdering miss gilmar looked pale ill heard evidence of pawning of necklace in absolute silence when be asked to defend refused to utter word declined even to engage solicitor so in face of conduct there be nothing for to commit for trial ferris asked for bail request being refused be taken back to prison still silent might have be stone image for information law got out of one marvelled at obstinacy so dangerous to so inexplicable to others gebb must not understand why acted in way risked neck in so obstinate manner certainly ferris declared to be innocent refused to prove truth of word preserved impenetrable silence at once perplexed provoked detective only reason must conjecture for mulish behaviour of artist be that evidence against be too strong for disproval that knew to be case still might make effort to save thought gebb a sat meditating in office if only to tell lie although quite see what must say mr presk declared that miss gilmar wore jewel on evening when found body jewel be gone principal jewel be necklace be pawned day after murder by arthur ferris who know miss wedderburn who knew miss gilmar refuse to state how necklace came into possession if murdered woman possession of diamond be easily accounted for if be innocent must have obtained necklace from assassin therefore if not guilty must know who be be plain logic logic not result of argument be very unsatisfactory gebb in own mind be unable to decide either for against ferris have that morning informed prain by letter about artist committal for trial asked to call at prison to discover if possible reason for strange conduct of ferris also requested prain to call at office tell result of interview so when meditation be interrupted by sharp knock at door quite expected to see little solicitor enter in place of prain however beheld burly form of john alder who appeared to be different from usual genial self be doubt surprised to see here mr gebb said when first greeting have passed be greatly disturbed about ferris be friend of mine know gebb did not know about friendship be well aware that ferris be alder favoured rival with edith wedderburn so wondered at tender heartedness of man who be distressed over removal of obstacle to wooing why be disturbed asked gebb rather sceptically what make worry over ferris because be sure be innocent of murder replied alder oh heard about arrest committal for trial from prain who have gone round to see so thought must come tell that be convinced of innocence pawned necklace mr alder admits that did then must have obtained necklace from one else may be sir said gebb quietly if did refuse to say a much gave necklace killed miss gilmar what defence doe make asked alder looking puzzled none asserts innocence refuse to explain how became possessed of necklace if ca explain wo explain diamond will hang in what way quite see how arrive at point miss gilmar wore necklace on night be killed explained detective be gone when found body so by strongest of circumstantial evidence assassin must have taken may be true mr gebb doe not prove that poor ferris be guilty think doe replied gebb coolly seeing that pawned necklace in question if be principal be accessory before fact wo confess how became possessed of diamond not to refuse to say word in own defence then tell said alder gravely quixotic young man be defending person be shielding assassin if be that show to be accessory before after fact repeated gebb who be person think be shielding dean believe man killed cousin doe mr ferris know dean asked gebb looking up sharply did know miss gilmar so far a knowledge go said alder with nod ferris have be friend of mine for many year although for certain reason be not very intimate be sure be not guilty of crime if ferris did not know dean doe not know very well see how can be shielding cried gebb irritably if will excuse saying so mr alder think be talking sheer nonsense be sorry think so said alder stiffly of course only state that ferris be not acquainted with dean so far a be aware may know for why asked gebb pertinently because be certain that dean be guilty admitting that be on strength of romantic vow how did ferris become possessed of necklace know only ferris can explain well then mr alder wo explain so on face of be guilty dean be tell be innocent said alder angrily friend mr basson can prove basson clement basson barrister said gebb with stare why what on earth have got to do with saw ferris on night of murder saw where at grangebury in evening miss gilmar be murdered at grangebury said detective why look a though ferris be guilty evidence rather condemns than exonerates not at rejoined alder tartly read evidence of murder in daily paper although did not know at time miss ligram be cousin ellen gilmar well what of inquired gebb rather puzzled by irrelevancy of remark much mr presk servant be at lecture on dickens in grangebury town hall know well mr gebb that lecture be given by basson by clement basson barrister who defended dean twenty year ago same must know that basson be friend of mine continued alder conversationally barrister like be by mean well off a be fonder of play than of work suggested to that must write deliver few lecture in order to make money for have fine voice be excellent orator adopted suggestion wrote lecture on dickens being nervous wished to make experiment in suburb before attempting to interest london audience suggested that must deliver in grangebury town hall a know many people in suburb consented delivered lecture on twenty fourth of july be on very night cousin be murdered mr presk attended lecture with servant reflected gebb did know that miss gilmar be in grangebury took lodging in paradise row under name of ligram know said alder have not set eye on for year in fact not since left kirkstone hall out of terror lest must be killed by dean kept address secret from although believe occasionally wrote to miss wedderburn on business know replied gebb with nod miss wedderburn have not heard from cousin since six month before murder so be not aware of miss ligram rather miss gilmar presence in grangebury have lecture to do with ferris innocence be coming to said alder quietly a have suggested lecture to basson wished to have large audience so asked friend in grangebury to attend also invited london acquaintance amongst ferris did ferris go to lecture yes saw at door when spoke few word to sat in front row basson who know told that stayed almost to end of lecture oh said gebb meaningly almost to end well at event stayed until ten o'clock replied alder rather nettled a cousin be killed about time ferris must not have murdered certainly not so far a can see ferris can prove alibi if so why doe not defend in way alder shrugged shoulder ca say unless be shielding one suggest dean a really believe that dean be guilty then so far a know ferris be not acquainted with dean be anybody for man have not be heard of since escaped from prison see mr gebb that if cousin be murdered at ten o'clock medical evidence say be ferris who be in grangebury town hall at hour can not be guilty admit that will look into matter said gebb let tell mr alder that think very well of for coming forward with evidence a know that mr ferris be rival with miss wedderburn said alder colouring true enough for want to be hanged when know that be innocent if miss wedderburn marries ferris will just have to put up with be gebb be about to express further admiration of alder conduct when door opened unexpectedly prain came hurriedly into room little man looked worried with nod to brother lawyer threw into chair near detective desk well gebb said in vexed tone have be to see that young as ca induce to speak there will be need for said gebb quietly know now that be innocent mr prain how be that asked solicitor in amazement whereat gebb with assistance of alder told of presence of ferris in town hall at hour murder be committed prain be more amazed than ever great heaven said if man be innocent can prove a say why doe speak out because be screening one think said gebb know be said alder believe that one be dean why asked prain with sharp look believe that dean committed crime mr prain yes also believe that ferris doe not know dean cried gebb crossly so why must shield be paradox said alder smiling prain looked up with grave expression on face be paradox can explain said shortly ferris doe know dean doe know dean cried hearer in amazement yes may a well tell that arthur ferris be son of marmaduke dean chapter xv revelation of mr prain arthur son of dean repeated gebb looking alternately at solicitor barrister well never heard of such thing did know of mr alder alder shook head with unqualified amazement not said suggested that ferris be shielding dean only because be certain dean be assassin only assassin must have given necklace taken from dead woman to ferris have idea that there be relationship even acquaintance between nevertheless be true replied prain with nod be dean lawyer a know told much of family history when wife died placed son arthur with of relative went a bachelor down to hall to court laura kirkstone for second wife meet with fate when be imprisoned for murder of kirkstone relative of arthur gave mother name of ferris have kept eye on young man life rather life of twenty five year have even assisted on occasion with money be son of dean right enough although still keep to name of ferris oh know who be then said gebb sharply certainly have known for many year have idea of whereabouts of father questioned alder no must have told if have a be well aware that consider father innocent must not give up to law even if knew of hiding place do believe that dean be innocent in instance mr prain little man moved restlessly evaded direct reply to inquiry of alder be question can not answer said dubiously asked ferris if obtained necklace from father denied that did added that be ignorant of father whereabouts declared that have not seen father since be five year of age oh of course must say cried alder with scorn in order to shield father a suggested although until spoke did not know who dean really be evidence against dean seems clear enough to in what way asked gebb anxious to hear alder ground of accusation since appeared so certain of dean guilt in way retorted barrister dean hunted miss gilmar down killed in paradise row being hard up a must be seeing that be outlaw in hiding stole jewel wore doubt gave necklace to ferris a know young man be a poor a church mouse kept other jewel to say that ferris knew at time father have killed miss gilmar when mr gebb here stated that necklace be taken from dead body ferris be quick enough to put two two together guess what father have done therefore hold tongue refuse to say from whom got necklace man with life in jeopardy must not keep silent without strong motive what stronger motive can ferris have than one concern safety of father to affair be a clear a day case be very ingeniously constructed admit said prain dryly argue rope round dean neck in fine style nevertheless theory be theory nothing more well said alder with shrug doe mr gebb say mr gebb say nothing at present rejoined that gentleman after moment thought least said soonest mended when gather more evidence will speak more freely where do intend to look for evidence at kirkstone hall will ask miss wedderburn why fainted on occasion of mentioning about ferris although did ask once lied can explain observed prain quickly said must not do so without young lady permission a have be forced to tell about dean relationship to ferris may a well reveal rest miss wedderburn know that arthur be son of dean so when asked about dare say thought struck that knew of through intended to accuse of killing miss gilmar to avenge father with revulsion of feeling fainted there have explanation from point of view be very well mr prain wish to have explanation from miss wedderburn point of view where be now still at hall said alder gloomily intends to leave now that be master there oh said prain with smile refuse to be mistress yes mind confessing be infatuated with ferris when went down other day to ask for last time to be wife refused declared that intended to marry ferris bear ill will said alder generously love miss wedderburn prefers in poverty to with money still know how can bear idea of marrying son of murderer perhaps like belief in dean innocence said prain dryly if be guilty of first crime be guilty of second well said gebb thoughtfully there be something in unless dean have be guilty of kirkstone murder must not have be so bent upon punishing woman who accused of be just possible murdered out of revenge however believe that dean be innocent of crime a to second will see ferris again try to learn if got necklace from father a to first added gebb emphatically will search kirkstone hall for miss gilmar confession confession repeated alder surprised what confession ah said prain taking notice of barrister question addressing gebb so be coming round to opinion that miss gilmar killed kirkstone have be opinion for time rejoined gebb coolly believe that miss gilmar left confession behind telling truth think must risk discovery by carrying about with so be probable wrote out concealed in hiding place at kirkstone hall in case search hall said alder disbelievingly have full permission to do so will certainly avail of mr alder so miss wedderburn leaf hall what about protg martin that lunatic know have better stay where be for present although think must be locked up what doe miss wedderburn think say be mad not dangerous asked to let stay on at hall until be settled with ferris suppose when will take with nice companion will be to young married couple be afraid that marriage wo take place for time said prain gloomily even if arthur doe escape be too poor to keep wife in case said alder rising to take leave there may be chance for while there be life there be hope know prain shook head with doubtful smile while arthur ferris life miss wedderburn wo marry said positively alder stopped at door looked back see here mr prain remarked earnestly be fair square above board gebb here will tell that before came defended ferris because consider innocent believe that father killed kirkstone cousin be certain that crime will be brought home to in case have doubt a to whether proud girl like edith will marry son of murderer if doe not will accept of be certain will do everything to bring marriage about well said prain have known edith life think will marry will see about rejoined alder confidently swung out of door with look of determination in blue eye prain shook head shrugged shoulder for thought that barrister be over confident for lover then took up hat to go addressed last question to gebb well sir said grimly what do intend to do now three thing mr prain mind telling what be intend to question ferris miss wedderburn intend to search kirkstone hall for confession of miss gilmar really believe exists intend to call upon mr clement basson what about basson can prove anything can prove alibi in favour of ferris said gebb forthwith related to prain that have be told by alder regarding lecture in grangebury town hall prain listened attentively nodded head approvingly for be pleased to find loophole for arthur escape very creditable to alder said when detective finished conduct in speaking up for ferris deserves praise few men must be so generous to rival if be so why did not ferris clear before magistrate must be free now have done so well said gebb thoughtfully so far a go come back to mr alder belief ferris be shielding father if be said prain dean must be guilty look like tell what mr prain cried gebb emphatically a sure a sit here dean be innocent whosoever killed miss gilmar be expected by be friend with whom be at ease be proved by smoking wine must not have be at ease with dean might have be disguised a fortune teller suggested prain believe disguise must have hidden from eye of woman who feared so whosoever killed that woman be dean then why be ferris shielding dean know if be said that denied know did know doe cried prain in despair god bless soul what case be more talk about more confused doe become tell what gebb only chance of arriving at truth lie in forcing ferris to confess where got necklace in hunting down dean will try first of suggestion at once said gebb putting on hat if ferris wo confess to will write ask miss wedderburn to come to town what good can do can make confess truth what man wo do for justice may do for love however will see at once justice will make first attempt love second will fail cried prain 'd better catch dean good man be easier said than done retorted gebb two parted more le exasperated very naturally for perplexity of grangebury murder case be enough to anger mildest nature of prain gebb be rather reverse irritated puzzled by complexion of affair gebb did not let grass grow under foot at once visited prison in arthur ferris be confined easily obtained permission to see entered to find young man looking ill worn a firm a ever in policy of silence gebb came to reason of visit forthwith well mr ferris be nice gentleman to stay here when word from in court must clear of what word asked ferris suspecting snare speaking cautiously why word where be at time of murder know did not kill miss gilmar how do know asked young man with start because be in grangebury town hall listening to lecture on dickens replied gebb mr alder told be very kind of alder to defend replied ferris frankly yes mr gebb be quite true be not near miss gilmar on night be innocent then why did say so did several time why produce alibi because choose to retorted ferris slowly turned sulky again so be shielding father after who told about father asked tremulously mr prain said gebb father be dean who swore to kill woman for accusing of kirkstone murder escaped killed gave necklace wo speak because want to save father neck father have nothing to do with mr gebb did not get necklace from know where be be last word said ferris firmly be gebb begged implored threatened to purpose ferris knew kept to chapter xvi miss wedderburn having failed with ferris owing to artist obstinate refusal to speak gebb thought that must hear what basson have to say knew from prain that barrister have defended marmaduke dean although have not succeeded in obtaining acquittal believed that client be innocent dean of course must have known that counsel held opinion so on escaping from prison with desire to prove innocence be not unlikely that might have called secretly on basson implored assistance if so basson might know good deal about man if must only be induced to speak out be to gain confidence in matter gebb paid visit of course may know nothing thought gebb a walked next day towards blackstone lane in mr basson according to alder have abode on other hand if dean called on be not unlikely may know good deal wish to learn where dean be hiding how manages to live what movement be towards end of july last basson may be able to inform of matter if can so much better if ca will go down to kirkstone hall to search for confession see miss wedderburn before leaf place if ca force ferris to speak one else can man be a obstinate a pig with elegant simile gebb turned out of fleet street into blackstone lane shortly found climbing narrow staircase of mr basson being poor briefless evidently careless of ease lived at very top of high building after ascending four flight of steep stair detective came upon door with name clement basson painted on in black letter also there be dingy scrap of paper on be written back in five minute so seemed much to gebb disappointment a though basson be not in office however two three sharp knock brought forth grinning boy in suit several size too small for lad having put gebb through short examination with intention of discovering if have bill writ judgment summons in pocket at length relented announced that mr basson be within evidently back in five minute label be used to beguile creditor into thinking that mr basson be absent that announcement conversation with juvenile cerberus gave immediate insight into state of mr basson finance bohemian mode of hand to mouth living shortly be ushered into dingy chamber very barely furnished very dirty there be yellow blind pulled up askew on unclean window below deal table covered with green baize ink stained worn out be piled up with dirty paper ancient bookcase with brass screen be filled with array of untidy looking volume in calf skin with red label there be two chair one for lawyer one for possible client rusty grate filled with torn up paper empty japan coal scuttle in midst of ruin of prosperity like marius amid remains of carthage sat clement basson tall jovial looking man with fine head of grey hair quick eye neatly trimmed beard moustache be carelessly dressed in kind of sporting fashion wore old cricketing cap on back of head man be clever kindly quick witted be also thriftless weak willed untidy worser quality weighed down better with many qualification for climbing to top of tree mr basson preferred out of sheer idleness lack of concentration to dance gaily round trunk in ragged attire looked like survival of grub street one of feather headed crew who wrote pamphlet starved in garret naturally belong to reign of early george be quite out of place in late victorian epoch ironical survival of unfittest good day said in rich baritone voice advancing to meet visitor what can do for mr gabb gebb sir not gabb answered detective seating in one other chair boy said gabb retorted basson returning to chair be thinking of own gift maybe laughed heartily at rather feeble joke well mr gebb have brought brief said gebb smiling for man good humour be infectious be in different branch of law to solicitor deal in brief so much a in handcuff ah be detective bow street runner yes in charge of grangebury murder case just so said basson with nod looking grave read about in paper now remember name be mentioned well have caught blackguard who murdered poor woman not yet have come to see if can help said basson much amused have come to wrong shop then how must know assassin if can believe mr alder knew once be gebb reply ah so alder have be speaking to about think that dean be guilty be dean counsel in kirkstone case be that be driving at mr gebb just be do believe that dean be guilty basson did not reply immediately lighted german pipe of porcelain blowing out match placed in little pile lay near inkstand then puffed out cloud of smoke through looked at visitor why do ask demanded abruptly want opinion know from mr alder that did not believe dean guilty of kirkstone murder no did not rejoined basson hastily no more than believe mr ferris poor boy guilty of one be coming to tell that be at lecture on night of murder alder said must speak to about did gebb nodded know that ferris be innocent have necklace in possession be suspicious circumstance saw about in paper said basson nodding well how doe say necklace came into hand decline to tell doe with neck in noose so to speak precisely mr basson did not even confess presence at lecture said be innocent for rest held tongue basson stared pressed tobacco in pipe bowl with little finger now be queer said why doe act in way think wish to shield father did know have father thought father be dead a good a dead be afraid dean be father what basson pipe fell out of hand looked at gebb in amazement dean man defended ferris father yes ferris lived with relation who changed name when father be condemned now mr basson believe dean be guilty of second murder on other ground than that did kill woman gave ferris necklace to pawn can account for young man silence doe say that dean be guilty asked basson picking up pipe no denies refuse to confess how became possessed of necklace mr basson tell on what ground believed that dean did not kill kirkstone motive rejoined basson people commit murder without motif year two ago got anonymous letter strengthened belief in innocence wait bit will get for opened small safe standing at end of room near bookcase after five minute groping in depth at length fished out dingy bit of paper brought back to gebb spread out on table raised finger to enforce attention of detective dean declared innocence to said barrister with forensic force believed thought that laura kirkstone be guilty that in mad fit killed brother did not agree with for held then hold still that ellen gilmar stole knife from laura murdered kirkstone before went upstairs to call dean inculpate in murder now when dean escaped from prison received letter read gebb glanced eye rapidly over scrap of paper contained two line of writing running thus if see dean tell not to hunt down wretched woman when dy justice will be done to there be name date envelope gebb inquired after latter be sorry to say destroyed by mistake said basson with regret remember that have norminster postmark on therefore be sure note came from miss gilmar why must write to inquired detective fancied dean on escaping might visit to get aid to prove innocence thought such might be case said gebb thoughtfully did come near at time after escape said basson emphatically never saw from time went into prison know where be wish did a note show that miss gilmar know to be guilty have left sort of confession behind to be read after death clear dean where do think confession be to be found know may have hidden in kirkstone hall may have have with when got note went at once to hall to tax miss gilmar with writing however have fled out of fear of dean must not learn whereabouts next heard be murder at grangebury under name of ligram do think dean killed asked gebb anxiously know might have found tried to force into confession failing getting to do so have killed know well said gebb getting on leg have idea that there might be confession concealed in kirkstone hall now on evidence of note be sure of will go down search tell frankly mr basson do know where dean be to be found said basson solemnly swear must rely on then said gebb with sigh will see again mr basson will be glad to help sir replied barrister bowed detective out of dingy room gebb retired in exultant frame of mind a have discovered beyond doubt that confession by miss gilmar be in existence must probably exonerate dean from complicity in kirkstone murder question be where to search for on way back to office gebb tried vainly to find answer to query be banished from mind when discovered that le person than miss wedderburn be waiting to see approached at once when entered there be sparkle of rage in eye intimated that object of visit be not peaceful one here be at last mr gebb said in wrathful voice pray sir what do mean by arresting mr ferris oh be trouble be miss answered gebb coolly well dear young lady arrested mr ferris because pawned diamond necklace what have to do with may ask much miss necklace be property of miss gilmar be removed from dead body nothing of sort cried edith vehemently ellen be alive when gave away that necklace gave away that necklace repeated gebb starting up what do mean what say rejoined miss wedderburn tartly gave necklace to arthur be miss gilmar who presented to in paradise row on night be murdered chapter xvii explanation took gebb time to grasp meaning of miss wedderburn remark for information conveyed seemed impossible of belief looked so doubtful that repeated speech with impatience tell miss gilmar gave that necklace on night be murdered at what hour gasped gebb not quite master of shortly after nine o'clock did see on night of course did said edith sharply how else must have got necklace told at kirkstone hall that did not know miss gilmar be in grangebury be perfectly true rejoined edith colouring told many thing be false be forced to do so to protect arthur so knew of murder when paid first visit yes when inquired after arthur fancied have discovered pawning of necklace that intended to accuse of crime naturally be anxious to save be why fainted said gebb suddenly enlightened be in moment saw arthur danger a knew well must not say that gave necklace so thought made faint when learned later that knew nothing held tongue did to purpose congratulate on power of acting miss wedderburn deceived completely what else be to do said edith resentfully must not have have betray arthur how did find out that necklace be pawned that will explain later replied gebb annoyed by attitude in turn may ask why killed miss gilmar edith stared at in surprise laughed be making mistake said with haughty coolness did not kill ellen gilmar be with on night so be left at nine o'clock then be alive well why must kill to obtain necklace what nonsense talk mr gebb gave necklace for arthur of own free will even if have refused to give to must certainly not have murdered love arthur very much be true hardly enough to commit so wicked deed for sake do swear that be innocent asked gebb looking at keenly yes swear be answered meeting look with much frankness if necessary can prove innocence that of arthur oh mr alder have proved innocence already very kind of said edith with sarcasm for dare say be glad enough to hear of arthur arrest do wrong miss wedderburn on seeing case in paper mr alder came round at once to see stated that mr ferris be present in town hall at mr basson lecture therefore must not have be with miss gilmar at ten o'clock hour when be killed proved lover innocence edith raised eyebrow looked surprised why did mr alder do that said half to herself hate arthur because because be engaged to finished gebb be mistake miss for mr alder be quite friendly with mr ferris bear grudge for winning hand may not credit mr alder be real gentleman leopard can change spot then said edith still puzzled must never have thought that mr alder be so generous be very strange finished musingly very strange indeed detective quite agreed with thought that whole affair be wonderfully strange particularly a be ignorant of how edith have obtained valuable necklace from old miser like miss gilmar also must not understand reason for taking quite saw that have deceived in order to save ferris from being accused of murder be doubtful if be so innocent of knowledge concerning death a feigned to be with idea in mind addressed with sharpness asked leading question if did not kill woman said who did know answered edith candidly be alive when left at nine o'clock when saw death in paper be a much surprised a one knew then that called miss ligram at grangebury oh yes else must not have known be victim though to be sure added edith with nod description of yellow boudoir must have made suspect spoke falsely for own end when told that saw newspaper at norminster well miss wedderburn said gebb after pause see reason to doubt innocence must like to hear reason for getting necklace will tell whole story mr gebb indeed be sorry now that did not do so when called to see be afraid of getting arthur into trouble so held tongue be silence caused arrest said gebb have spoken out must not have be arrested must have exculpated protested edith earnestly dare say in order to shield a now see refused to speak however can talk of thing later miss wedderburn tell story certainly will explain fully said girl quickly anything quite understand can ask about afterwards well mr gebb must know first of arthur be son of marmaduke dean who be aware of fact interrupted gebb prain told very good said edith composedly make task easier yes be son of dean when father escaped from prison year ago came down to kirkstone hall to see if poor man have returned there know that dean desired to revenge on miss gilmar for share in condemnation well arthur thought that father might have gone to hall to punish so came down to warn miss gilmar prevent second crime if possible what did miss gilmar do be greatly alarmed by news terrified lest dean must really come went away a told before hid in london under several name be in way became acquainted with arthur be very friendly used to visit frequently in end fell in love with one a be natural said gebb smiling before proceed tell if dean ever came to hall a be expected no replied edith vehemently never did know where be doe ferris know asked detective eagerly not neither of have set eye on father poor man may be dead for know be not so sure of said gebb thinking of murder go on please must not tell about engagement said edith who did not relish smile of detective therefore spoke with resentment that be necessary for safety of arthur must speak freely mr ferris adopted more formal style of mention to keep gebb in order mr ferris came to see frequently confided to trouble be greatly in want of money a picture did not sell have one to help must not a have money be simply earning living a cousin housekeeper at kirkstone hall in july ar be mr ferris be in such distress resolved to aid by obtaining from miss gilmar diamond necklace have belonged to father know said gebb who be listening attentively necklace dean gave laura kirkstone yes be family jewel dean gave to laura only because be to be wife when died must have be returned to dean a be convict to son miss gilmar however seized rest of laura jewel with other jewel have nothing to do be resolved to obtain necklace for arthur be not right to do so yes rejoined gebb promptly necklace certainly belonged to mr ferris a father must not benefit by wonder be how got from what have heard of miss gilmar must have thought task impossible one be difficult to obtain did so in end told said edith with colour did not know miss gilmar be at grangebury well be not true for wrote to stating that be living in paradise row under name of ligram in letter asked about business resolved to visit grangebury a did not know where be asked arthur to escort did know of intention curiously enough week wrote to be going down to grangebury to hear friend lecture be on twenty fourth of july so came up to town went with on night to lecture well not at first lecture did not begin until close on nine o'clock wished to see miss gilmar so sent arthur in to town hall intended to join when got necklace then visited miss gilmar be alone in house admitted be much alarmed at seeing still more so when demanded necklace wonder at did refuse to give up yes although be wearing at time told then that if did not give up to for arthur must search for dean tell where be indeed added edith reflectively be not sure what did not say that knew where dean be did not said gebb looking at keenly certainly not rejoined hastily said so to frighten miss gilmar be terrified implored not to take necklace tell dean knew be acting rightly so in end gave necklace put into pocket left at once about what time about half past nine think miss gilmar seemed anxious to get away from house almost pushed out of front door locked after then went to town hall a arthur be in one of front seat lecturer be speaking did not wish to create disturbance by joining so sat down near door have conversation with doorkeeper a to where mr ferris be seated so if ask will tell that sat near until lecture concluded at half past ten o'clock then arthur joined in much alarm a thought have got into trouble returned to london where gave necklace told to pawn pay debt slept at grosvenor hotel near victoria station arthur went back to room in chelsea so see mr gebb be quite innocent seems so said cautious gebb not committing be so insisted edith haughtily doorkeeper can tell that mr ferris be in town hall before after ten be about time miss gilmar be murdered be one with when called told be alone there be wine on small table with way pushed out be sure expected one did meet one in street going there not soul saw one everybody in grangebury seemed to be at lecture did write tell mr ferris about visit to yes did warned not to pawn necklace a might be suspected be too late for pawned day after gave to be innocent a see mr gebb surely will be released when trial take place will said gebb must have be let off before if have told story to magistrate ah said edith in low voice held peace for sake good brave arthur wonder love chapter xviii what mr presk found gebb continued to question cross question edith until became thoroughly acquainted with detail of visit to miss gilmar at grangebury when in full possession of fact permitted to depart took precaution to ask for london address in case must require further evidence edith informed that since leaving kirkstone hall have be staying with old schoolfellow in bloomsbury square be likely to remain there for time at event until must find situation must work know mr gebb confessed frankly be very poor yet have accepted mr alder must accept mr alder interrupted edith colouring must sooner sweep street than marry one arthur mr gebb added imploringly now that be convinced of innocence do get out of prison will do best promised detective will come up for trial in week two in mean time if place actual fact of case before magistrate who committed have doubt will be admitted on bail anything anything dear mr gebb so long a be set free detective proved to be a good a word worked zealously in interest of ferris a forthcoming trial must probably be mere matter of form seeing that later evidence acquitted magistrate readily accepted bail for small amount to edith astonishment person who guaranteed be mr alder came forward in most friendly way to stand security for rival must not even hear of edith thanking when arthur be released through generosity knew be not guilty said benefactor to edith told gebb be shame keeping innocent man in prison how can ever thank said edith tearfully there be need to thank miss wedderburn of course must like to marry a ferris prof to be lucky man can only make best of misfortune in own heart edith must not understand kindness of mr alder for up to present have always thought hard hearted selfish perhaps succession to kirkstone estate have wrought change for previous to death of cousin barrister have be in deep water a basson frankly told gebb be ill wind blow nobody good said bohemian lawyer wretch who killed that old woman put power of money into alder pocket be man to live on nothing have rather expensive taste so if have come in for property 'd have be in queer street be truth be telling to latter remark gebb quite assented a alder have rather worn look of man who lived hard made most of life be pity miss wedderburn doe marry observed might keep in order be ship need anchor in opinion well well mr gebb ferris be better man of two not richer mr alder have offered two hundred pound reward for capture of miss gilmar assassin intend to earn suppose said basson smiling if can at present see chance of finding criminal upon word cried gebb in disgust against better judgment be beginning to believe that dean be guilty after think so if be idea why find dean tax with crime interview with must put matter beyond doubt know where to look for said gebb grumbling think will look up parge about matter if one know where dean be to be found parge be man yes will see parge may see parge said basson in tone of contempt be doubtful if will ever see dean have vanished so completely must not be at surprised to learn that be dead if be alive in hiding surely police must have found out before now police only perform miracle in novel replied gebb dryly went off to see parge fat ex detective received almost a wrathfully a have done on occasion of previous visit gebb have be so busily employed in searching for miss gilmar assassin that have foolishly omitted to pay mr parge attention gentleman considered due therefore be greeted by chief in anything friendly way want to hear more excuse said parge scowling too much time be lost in telling unnecessary lie let know how much further have got on with case glad to escape further blame detective related have discovered in relation to ferris miss wedderburn parge listened attentively be gracious enough to signify approval of gebb conduct have not done badly said with nod although discovery have be due more to good luck than to own intelligence if girl have not confessed about visit giving of necklace to ferris must still be in doubt about innocence must protested gebb before miss wedderburn spoke be quite sure that ferris be guiltless alder evidence proved that be at lecture at time crime be committed did prove how ferris became possessed of necklace however snapped parge see that be much further on than before have examined doorkeeper a to miss wedderburn presence in lecture hall on night at hour of murder have not have time simon to morrow morning be going down to see at grangebury suppose said parge will find man there yes doorkeeper be also caretaker of hall then at same time have better call on mr presk suppose good of miss gilmar have be moved by alder a heir yes body be exhumed have be identified now alder have taken possession of estate prain be attending to legal matter concerning will by alder direction dismantled yellow boudoir see what will gain by seeing mr presk can find out if have discovered anything touching on first second murder quite understand bah cried parge angrily ca understand that woman must not be left in possession of dead woman good without satisfying curiosity in way will bet absalom that mr presk have searched in miss gilmar box clothes paper to find out what can about now be just possible that mr presk may have come across confession talk about do think exists asked gebb with scepticism yes do hint in anonymous letter written to basson show that miss gilmar have in mind to do justice to man wronged declared that dean be guilty said gebb recalling first conversation so did seemed so at time rejoined parge promptly have altered mind especially since told about letter written by miss gilmar to basson laura kirkstone killed man know do so for gratification of mutual curiosity clearance of dean have better find that confession well simon if confession be anywhere be hidden at kirkstone hall might be replied parge cautiously on other hand miss gilmar might have written after fled from hall have carried about with from place to place if mr presk have found be just kind of woman from description to make money over by refusing to give up until get own term call on mr presk absalom find out truth will do so said gebb making mental note of what about dean well believe that dean be guilty of murdering miss gilmar said parge even if be innocent of first crime committed second in order to punish woman who unjustly condemned be sure have cause to wish ill treated most vindictively be use discussing that matter said gebb tartly believe on argument furnished with before dean be innocent think be guilty time discovery may prove of be right question now be where be to be found ca say absalom escaped from prison in hunted for high low without success vanished a completely a though earth have swallowed up thought might have gone to kirkstone hall to kill miss gilmar searched neighbourhood be nowhere to be found from day to not word have be heard of suppose there be use hunting for be waste of time to mind retorted parge crossly see what mr presk be doing question question servant who by way what be servant name matilda crane know nothing be a well to ask however warned parge people who seem to know least usually know most now go away absalom be so long in looking up again be anxious to get to bottom of case ca be more anxious than be replied gebb disconsolately at event be more hopeful rejoined parge dismissed pupil who went away with conviction that old man be worn out that be past work that aid useful advice must be expected from gebb still have sufficient reverence for elder not to hint at thing besides parge might have turned table on have be too frank next day went down to grangebury called at town hall to interview caretaker proved to be smart ex soldier with observant eye good memory gift made use of on present occasion for benefit of gebb also of own pocket remember lady quite well said after thought young gentleman called mr ferris told be going in that lady by name miss wedderburn must come afterwards asked to bring up to where be sitting in front seat came in about half past nine o'clock refused to let take up to front a did not wish to disturb lecturer sat down near door when lecture ended young gentleman joined went out together be in hall before ten o'clock asked gebb yes sir before ten after ten saw unprejudiced testimony put matter beyond doubt so gebb gave man florin went away quite convinced that ferris edith be innocent next called upon mr presk have interview with lady with servant what landlady told may be gathered from conversation later in day gebb have with edith be in afternoon when miss wedderburn saw be sitting with arthur in drawing room of mr barrington at bloomsbury be anxiously discussing case of miss gilmar death when gebb be announced neither edith lover be particularly glad to see detective a association with have be anything pleasant however gebb took black look short answer a portion of ill incidental to profession conversed with pair in most amiable persuasive fashion have be down to grangebury to day said addressing edith saw mr presk landlady of late cousin from obtained railway ticket be piece of evidence of such importance have come to mr ferris about railway ticket repeated edith looking puzzled from what station ticket said gebb producing from pocket book be dated twenty fourth of july be return portion from london to norminster be not mine then cried miss wedderburn did not take return ticket came up on twenty fourth of july from norminster did not certainly to see ellen bought single ticket second class second class said detective looking at ticket be third class return be sure be yours quite sure said edith decisively why must deceive about why indeed said gebb ironically with hint at former deception be mr ferris arthur shook head if travelled at must be third class admit did not go to norminster in month of july thought so said gebb with air of relief then a ticket belongs to of third person must have travelled from norminster to grangebury on twenty fourth of july believe that person added gebb emphatically to be murderer of miss gilmar on what ground cried edith arthur together because mr presk found ticket in yellow boudoir must have be dropped there by assassin chapter xix unexpected occurs gebb found impossible to discover owner of third class railway ticket went to norminster to find out if possible to whom have be issued in vain station master have taken situation in scotland ticket clerk be absent on annual holiday none of porter must remember particular person who have gone up to london on particular day on whole circumstance seemed to be against gebb in following clue after several vain attempt gave up at event for present confessed to parge who at once reproved for faint heartedness preached lengthy sermon on folly of being discouraged expect roast duck to fly into mouth do said parge indignantly of course be easy task to hunt down criminal 'd

for day two there be heap for to do where be going grunted fat man be off to ask mr alder to let search in kirkstone hall for confession of miss gilmar then be going down there to look up wo do good towards finding out who killed said parge shaking head know so much about simon replied gebb coolly must be bit surprised to find a person who killed kirkstone be one quite different from suspect must be miss g miss k said parge knowing truth about wo help to spot assassin look for dean first absalom leave confession alone for while replied gebb obstinately will look for confession fly round afterwards for dean let negotiate job in own way simon with determination of parge by mean approved be unable to hinder gebb went off to make last venture in solving mystery by time be in furious rage at many failure swore under breath come what might must hunt down punish unknown assassin of wretched old woman who have be strangled in paradise row have three design in head one of hoped might serve to attain much desired end firstly intended to search for confession of miss gilmar in belief that might throw light on later case secondly resolved to follow clue of railway ticket learn who have come up from norminster on fatal night to visit miss gilmar since such person on evidence of ticket found in yellow boudoir be undoubtedly murderer thirdly be bent upon making search round pawnshop to see if of other jewel taken from body have be turned into money appearance of necklace be accounted for by edith a have received from old woman before assassin have arrived ring bracelet hair ornament be still missing sooner later in order to benefit by crime murderer must seek to turn into cash when thought storm have blown over then be time to trace capture french have proverb run in english that nothing be certain unforeseen certainly gebb proved truth of when arrived at alder lodging a yet barrister pending administration of estate have not moved from room in temple intended to do so shortly already have engaged handsome chamber in moon street however be never destined to occupy for on very day gebb called to see met with accident seemed likely to result in death a one pleasure to be gained from rich alder have purchased horse shortly after coming into fortune morning went riding in row be good rider not having indulged in exercise for year by reason of impecuniosity have lost portion of skill with result that horse fiery animal with trick of alder be ignorant bolted unexpectedly threw rider against rail alder fell across with such force that have injured spine now be lying in room in crippled condition do think will get over asked gebb when alder servant be relating occurrence sir answered man shaking head doctor say be bound to die sooner later spine be injured poor master ca feel anything below waist be death in life already end be sure to come can see asked detective after thought sir doctor left word that be to see one with gebb be forced to be content a already have obtained alder permission to search hall went away rather low spirited seemed hard that man must come to untimely end just when inherited kingdom moreover have behaved very well in defending ferris in face of evidence releasing from prison therefore gebb thought just a well to send line to artist edith so that might come forward in turn to do what must for man who have acted so generously towards be hard line said gebb to when have posted letter do call hard alder gained fortune be true lost woman wished to marry now loses life be queer world give man pleasure only to take away from again understand working of providence nohow with philosophical reflection gebb went home to make plan before going down to norminster next day have little hope of success however now that alder be dying wondered if did capture murderer if reward must be paid to of course will said to on reflection for if alder dy miss wedderburn becomes mistress of hall chapter xx needle in haystack be bright sunny day when gebb found once more at kirkstone hall in sunshine building looked grim desolate smokeless chimney closed door dusty window grass grown terrace gave place forlorn wretched aspect absence of life silence broken only by twittering of bird neglected garden created even to detective prosaic mind atmosphere of menace dread looked like place with history gebb wondered if miss wedderburn on becoming mistress must care to inhabit again when marries ferris begin new life dare say will seek more cheerful abode thought a stood on terrace looked on silent house must be foolish for young couple to dwell with ghost of past be not imaginative myself must not care to live here not if house be given to rent free if be miss wedderburn 'd pull down build new place without past ghost while gebb soliloquized thus heard hoarse voice in distance saw martin spade on shoulder passing across lawn singing one of gruesome song evidently have caught sight of detective on terrace for not until came towards did begin to sing then danced grotesquely over green turf croaking wild ditty looking strange figure in strong sunshine yet not unsuited to lonely place with grim association when moon shine clear shadow dance in silver light when moon lie hid in cloudy sky shadow with take flight remain in falling rain calling upon shadow in vain shadow dear wait here alone in lonely night when came close to gebb stopped song dance suddenly looked inquiringly at detective with head on one side do want croaked there be nothing here death misery have come to look at house martin can show over said gardener shaking head walk through valley of dry bone if sit in yellow room hear dead tell secret what kind of secret asked gebb humouring how sister killed brother how who killed laughed laughed 'but died at last in deep despair when satan caught in snare ' gebb looked fixedly at man have be in house at time of kirkstone murder so might be that poor wit retained memory of tragedy be possible that light must be thrown on darkness by madman detective asked that question once twice a listened to poor creature rambling on how laura have killed brother at instigation of miss gilmar be mr dean innocent asked suddenly god saint know that have hand in cried martin with remarkably sane look on face woman ruined one woman slew other poor soul lie in chain in chain fell to weeping a though heart must break with sorrow pain wonder if be truth thought gebb perhaps after laura did murder brother miss gilmar to save denounced dean there be sense to be got out of lunatic evidence must not stand in court of law only thing be to search for confession so sooner set to work better martin said aloud can show over house not not ask old jane come will take to old jane shouldering spade again martin walked off round comer of terrace singing god far away ala devil be beside a wander thro world be one to guide give with grin wage of sin when fiend hath paid stand outside gate of hell with christ alone to aid old jane proved to be grim elderly female in rusty black dress still rustier bonnet came out of side door wiping hand on coarse apron curtsied to gebb while martin introducing pair with regal wave of hand danced off round corner what may be pleased to want asked old jane when scarecrow gardener have disappeared have received permission from mr alder to look over house replied detective wish to show to there ai much to see sir croaked ancient dame be dust darkness doubt if old leg must carry over oh well can go by jane said gebb cheerfully mr grix if please snapped jane indignantly only allows miss edith to call by first name poor pretty dear be gone away for ever must be too sure of rejoined gebb dryly mr alder have met with accident may die in case miss wedderburn will return here a mistress mr alder ill be said jane in very regretful tone may die ah well with lachrymose whine flesh be grass that be if miss edith doe come back hope will shut up yeller room for what reason mr grix 'cause be haunted by spirit replied mr grix with mysterious look have heard two of 'em quarrelling there two what two asked gebb who began to think that old lady have be at bottle miss gilmar master 'aunts yeller room fight know 'cause sleep here alone save for martin a life in back part ' hears voice do wonder be not more afraid of madman than of ghost mr grix smiled in cunning significant manner oh ai afraid of martin sir one a know fear why asked gebb sharply question mr grix did not choose to hear mumbling shaking old head hobbled along passage in direction of yellow room ushered gebb into with chuckle threw open shutter to let sunlight shine on faded time worn decoration of room s'pose will want to see first said mr grix most folk like to see room a murder be done in there be stain of blood over in corner master blood miss gilmar must never let be wiped out dessay master come look at wish have body again be awful bad one mean mr grix lifted up pair of dirty trembling hand be of 'em skinflint said with nod whom be speaking of mr grix of miss gilmar mr kirkstone sir did know did know echoed hag with scorn of course knowed bad lot pair of 'em be give miss laurer fine time can tell wonder did go off with mr dean do be here when murder took place asked gebb lor bless yer sawr 'ole of croaked mr grix master be lying over there with knife in 'eart miss gilmar be 'ollering for police did dean kill kirkstone ah be telling said mr grix cunningly ask question young man wo be told lie must tell cried gebb seizing by wrist be from scotland yard detective shook beldame furiously mr grix raised feeble wail of horror lor ' be perlice be whimpered jist let go know nothin ' did laura kirkstone kill brother dunno swear dunno be miss gilmar criminal mr grix leered never told be sir did carry yeller room about with for nothing what do mean said gebb releasing mr grix rubbed wrist have be somewhat bruised by clasp leered again miss gilmar wrote down said confession cried detective dunno what call sir know wrote down 'cause said to 'it will be all right when be dead well be dead said mr grix ai all right unless left writin behind where be that confession dunno wish did there be money in have hunted over 'ouse ca come across nohow well mr grix what be opinion be dean miss gilmar miss laura who killed man look about for paper lovey said mr grix coaxingly will tell ye tell know for certain never mind what be opinion will ye give money for depends upon information then sha tell ye cried mr grix backing towards door can look for what wrote sha 'elp keep fro ' work maybe will tell ye summat to make wink not now not now old jane grix ai fool lovey gebb made step forward to detain mr grix hobbled through door vanished in darkness a mysteriously a of ghost have be talking about at event when detective slipped out of yellow room into twilight of passage eye be somewhat dazzled by sunlight glare of colour within saw nothing for moment mr grix be quicker on old foot than supposed in way hobbled out of sight into one of numerous passage so that when gebb eye became accustomed to gloom did not know into one have gone also heard rapidly retreating footstep not heavy hobble of old woman rather light dancing step of martin a to confirm impression heard hoarse voice of gardener singing one of wild song light will come not from above joy will come not from love glow of hell lust of hate impatiently for wait have said gebb to a hurried down passage martin have be listening wonder why believe be mad after for that old woman miss wedderburn be afraid of must be feigning madness for reason have cried detective with sudden start can martin be murderer of before must finish sentence heard series of piercing shriek from mr grix hoarse growling from martin noise sounded far in distance gebb ran down passage through sitting room into have be shown by miss wedderburn on occasion of first visit on to terrace here saw mr grix running from martin who be rushing after with furious face gebb stared not at terrified old woman who be hurrying towards with wonderful activity for one of year at martin face wore savage scowl there between eye be deep mark spoken of by parge dean cried gebb thunderstruck be dean yes yes screeched mr grix getting behind gebb be dean sure enough be going to kill 'cause wanted to tell ye martin rather dean stopped when heard name then turned leaping over terrace ran like hare down avenue chapter xxi found at last on seeing pseudonymous gardener speeding down avenue gebb lost time leaving mr grix to rage lamentation vaulted over terrace in turn raced at top speed after fugitive detective be lean young excellent runner whereas dean alias martin be old scant of breath so only thing equalized contest be despair winged foot of wretched quarry if dean be caught by bloodhound of law must be shortly relegated to prison whence have escaped so flew wildly over ground running knew not whither to escape fate awaited gebb who personified nemesis followed hot footed in track road to norminster ran straight through field like white ribbon laid upon green velvet town be distant mile from kirkstone hall down amid cloud of white dust gebb saw dean running way ahead setting elbow to side followed steadily surely reserving wind for termination of race result of must only be capture of ragged figure now flying for dear life carter pedestrian labourer in field stared in amazement at chase with love of sport inherent in breast joined gebb in man hunt after dean have covered quarter of mile began to fail to zigzag in course bounding wildly from one side to other wasting strength in useless way gebb with shouting train drew steadily nearer miserable hunted wretch must hear cry beating of foot on hard white road still endeavoured to shake off pursuer escape for by powerful effort managed to run quarter of mile then age fear exhaustion told on failing limb with wild cry dean flung up hand despairingly fell amid puff of dust when gebb arrived be lying senseless in middle of highroad so said detective to a knelt beside ragged creature have found at last mr dean know truth of matter at rate in way will force into confessing at present moment seemed a though dean must never speak again in world for lay a still a corpse white head whiter face resting on gebb knee frowning mark between eye by detective have known be smoothed away there be expression on blank countenance movement in slack limb gebb however knew that apparent death be only temporary faintness whipping out brandy flask forced drop of fiery liquid between white lip of prisoner while engaged in kindly office labourer who have joined in pursuit came up with much amazement expressed on honest sunburnt face what be matter with mad martin mister asked one looking at unconscious dean be madder than usual be said gebb have nearly killed mr grix at hall yonder must take to norminster get doctor to look after will die here detective made artful speech with intention of enlisting sympathy of bystander for martin alias dean a popular feeling generally incline towards defiance of law order moreover detective be not admired character with common people gebb have desire to render task of capturing dean more difficult than be necessary by stating vocation so for diplomatic reason spoke a above result justified precaution for labourer be most anxious that mad gardener a knew to be must be taken at once to norminster placed in charge of medical man cart be coming along road into dean be hoisted by friendly hand gebb having taken seat beside vehicle rolled slowly towards norminster while labourer returned to work quite vivacious after exciting episode have broken monotony of day gebb knowing what be at stake felt thankful to get rid of so easily a be mile to norminster from spot where dean have fallen cart soon arrived there man have revived thanks to gebb brandy sat staring straight before in kind of sullen stupor made one effort to escape when be set down at door of gaol gebb with assistance of near policeman soon overpowered carried within while carter drove off wondering in slow thinking mind that man brought to see doctor must be taken to county gaol for care however have received five shilling from gebb so did not trouble head about matter spent most of at next public house where narrated episode with such addition a drunken humour suggested to governor of gaol gebb explained that dean be escaped prisoner for whom police have long be looking mentioned own name occupation result of be that dean be confined in cell with warder to watch lest must in despair attempt suicide then gebb repaired to hotel wrote to governor of gaol whence dean have escaped asking to come down send responsible person in order to identify prisoner detective also sent urgent wire to ferris requesting to visit norminster at once on business connected with martin for shrewdly suspected that artist knew of man identity with dean that mention of name must bring arthur edith immediately to kirkstone hall be shortly after midday when gebb sent telegram so quite expected that if matter stood a imagined ferris must come down not alone for if ferris knew that martin be father edith also must be in secret doubt must accompany then gebb who be really angry with young couple for many concealment determined to have thorough explanation of strange behaviour important matter having be attended to gebb returned to gaol saw dean interview proved to be anything success whether man be mad not gebb must not decide without evidence certainly present sullen silence formed strange contrast to former excitement talked recklessly sang wild song limb be at rest eye looked dull although formerly have be bright glittering with vacant gaze sullen expression sat huddled up in corner of cell absolutely refused to speak even notice questioner man be thoroughly exhausted worn out gebb left cell with firm conviction that dean be perfectly sane that madness have be feigned to more effectually baffle dangerous inquiry like fox in fable for trick man have be caught at last gebb wondered if after have murdered miss gilmar did that return third class ticket dropped in room at paradise row belong to dean detective asked must not be surprised if did a miss wedderburn denies that be hers dean under name of martin be only person who must have used in case must have remained in london night for a crime be committed at ten o'clock must not have caught return train so late to norminster now mr grix life in hall so be most likely person to let know if dean be absent on twenty fourth of july will see at once get to know can pending arrival of ferris miss wedderburn may deny dean complicity in crime so must be prepared to baffle having made up mind to question mr grix detective making hurried meal walked out to kirkstone hall arrived to find old woman solacing with gin water after fatigue of morning be excessively nervous when gebb reappeared a be conscious have said too much in rage with martin now guessed that be about to be thoroughly examined touching knew concerning mr grix to save own skin be quite prepared to equivocate gebb guessed a much for went to work with in severe official way frightened considerably now mr grix said when be comfortably established in kitchen have come to ask few question know nothin protested mr grix beginning tactic know great deal replied gebb sharply if answer truthfully will arrest on suspicion put in gaol 'longside of dean so now know lawk mussy squealed mr grix have put in prison yes have so tell truth will put in also will speak out sir cried old wretch much terrified want to go to prison have done nothing have spied listened searched retorted gebb for sake of gaining possession of other people secret extracting blackmail when possible now answer question will be worse for be willing sir said mr grix meekly know a much a think only suspect like can tell who killed kirkstone asked detective be one thing know for certain replied dame if arsk sir bel have a miss gilmar did on what ground do suspect becose wrote out summat telling truth hid must have done that unless be guilty then be in love with mr dean mr kirkstone wanted to marry miss laura so think a miss ellen got out of way be clever one be miss ellen do know where confession be martin be always hunting for to clear if found did tell martin be dean yes be ai no good tellin lie lovey be dean thought there be gardener here at time of murder called martin there be replied mr grix coolly be queer too tell not a queer a martin knowed be dean a soon a clapped eye on though be sorely altered from 'andsome man be then impersonated martin to save from police did be more mad than be thought be safer to pretend being crazy song be awful said mr grix shuddering did miss wedderburn know truth of course sir when knowed a knowed tole to 'old tongue paid for doing did give much lovey did mr ferris know seeing a mr dean own born father knowed fro listening to be talking did did dean kill miss gilmar mr grix did not reply to question with former glibness rightly know of said slowly if did be here for miss ellen be in london long time be dean ever in london while stayed here under name of martin yes be just about time of murder be in july miss ellen died be be replied gebb eagerly on twenty fourth of july ah well must be surprised if dean did kill be always talking of punishing continued mr grix with relish did think 'd go so far a murder what make think that did asked gebb why said mr grix nodding be up in london in july stayed there night on twenty fourth ca be sure sir be at end of month when came back be queerer than ever oh dessay went up to kill miss ellen said mr grix with conviction ca swear to be sure did serve right too chapter xxii secret hoard on concluding examination of mr grix lasted time owing to inherent objection of lady to speak truth gebb spent afternoon in searching house for miss gilmar confession by time have quite adopted opinion of mr grix regarding guilt of former housekeeper on same authority be certain that have written out hidden away account of crime question be where be concealed for house be so large rambling dusty dusky gebb almost despaired of finding paper at first thought might be hidden in yellow room in fatal apartment crime have be committed to keep perpetually in mind of dean threat against life wretched woman have lived during concealment in precisely similar apartment decorated furnished in same manner so seeing that have attached such importance to probability be that have hidden paper within precinct strict examination of floor wall carpet hanging furniture proved that confession be not there gebb be disgusted at result turned attention to rest of house in few hour have to examined nearly room in place not forgetting sleeping apartment of dean mr grix be situated in back part of house made several discovery of more le importance object of search failed to find towards five o'clock gave up hunting for needle in haystack for search be quite a difficult impossible repaired hot dusty to mr grix from old woman obtained water to wash in brush for clothes afterwards supplied with cold supper beer just a gebb finished feeling very refreshed heard sound of voice stepped on to terrace to find ferris edith have arrived looked pale nervous grim way in detective eyed inspired with confidence be here see said ferris a edith seemed unwilling to speak miss wedderburn can guess reason of very peremptory telegram think know reason very well said gebb grimly else must not be here however there be need to talk secret in open so if will come with to yellow boudoir can speak more at ease perhaps more openly finished detective with dry cough edith looked at lover in quick terrified manner judged wiser to make remark two meekly followed gebb into yellow room here sat down side by side on primrose hued couch while gebb after glancing outside to see that mr grix be not listening closed locked door then drew chair in front of couch surveyed pair in very friendly manner well miss wedderburn mr ferris said with much displeasure seems have to find out thing for what thing asked edith flushing for not knowing extent of gebb knowledge ferris be prepared to speak freely thing know miss wedderburn about must have informed if have known then what know now added gebb with emphasis might have have le trouble more result in murder case understand faltered ferris doubtfully may understand better when tell that father be in prison again father dean yes dean martin whichever like to call do mean to say that mad martin gardener be really mr dean said edith making final attempt to baffle gebb yes miss wedderburn do why must mr ferris there pretend ignorance of what know to be true recognized dean from description given by parge one can mistake mark between eye when frown mark see mr ferris have at moment to make sure that martin be dean have evidence of mr grix mr grix have told have told everything interrupted gebb dean tried to punish for talking then ran away chased into norminster where now lie in gaol be mad said ferris eagerly who be mad demanded gebb turning on father martin gardener ferris made despairing gesture since know so much said in low tone admit that two be one same martin be really father marmaduke dean who have be concealed here be insane be nothing of sort mr ferris insanity be feigned for better baffling of police miss wedderburn can deceive longer have kept silence have told untruth altogether have given endless trouble now must insist upon speaking out of time know so much that can not deceive will force to speak suppose refuse cried edith indignant at rough speech if do will arrest a accessory after fact to murder of miss gilmar ah look afraid know know dean murdered that woman be aware of father be innocent cried arthur with groan if be what be doing at grangebury on evening of murder why did stay in london night what be return ticket to norminster doing in miss gilmar room at paradise row man be guilty tell defend if can tell truth if dare for once of act honourably straightforwardly detective spoke with much vehemence rising from seat walked rapidly up down room much a edith resented language yet be conscious that in great measure be deserved for reason restrained passion spoke frankly to purpose mr gebb said detective paused to listen deny that much say be true neither mr ferris have spoken so openly a might have done must not forget that have much that be dangerous to ourselves to conceal if have told about necklace might have suspected of crime be dread of such danger kept silent know that be innocent said gebb coldly about dean did not speak of dean of father for same reason struck in arthur earnestly be imprisoned for crime did not commit must not have have own son betray perhaps not be hard thing to ask responded detective now that know so much perhaps will tell more inform how be that father came here when be that first recognized certainly replied arthur with glance at edith for permission to speak heard almost immediately about father escape from prison knowing hatred for miss gilmar came to kirkstone hall thinking might go there to revenge however although have not come miss gilmar with guilty conscience doubt took fright went to hide in london on first visit met miss wedderburn afterwards frequently came to see one day while be here old man arrived asked to see miss gilmar saw so did miss wedderburn when heard name have examined carefully saluted a son at first must scarcely believe that be father a have not seen for close on twenty year be too young to retain much recollection of soon proved to that be marmaduke dean told how have escaped did come to hall to kill miss gilmar asked gebb anxiously said ferris with emphasis that threat be uttered only in mad passion wanted from be proof of innocence wrote to about said edith taking up tale be afraid of mr dean swore that killed kirkstone though be certain interposed arthur that killed accused father because be jealous of love for laura may be said gebb nodding proceed with story let tell rest cried miss wedderburn mr dean be so broken down ill with life have led in prison suggested must stay here let look after police have be to hall not having found there have left did not think must come again so believed that mr dean must be quite safe so stayed for day so until mr grix recognized bribed with money to silence suggested that for safety mr dean must pretend to be martin gardener not quite right in head who have left hall after tragedy be twenty year since have gone mr dean be much altered from former self so in end adopted name of martin pretended to be mad so now know mr gebb when saw first reason why be not afraid of madness thought real knew to be feigned did one round here think be really martin come back yes kept within hall ground saw few people left alone because of madness so there be truth mr gebb not truth said gebb significantly have not told how killed miss gilmar did not kill cried ferris furiously did insisted gebb be in grangebury on twenty fourth of july impossible said edith much alarmed did not know that even if be went on doe not prove that killed woman be pretty good a circumstantial evidence said gebb coolly have stronger proof look here out of pocket detective took canvas bag when opened displayed bracelet ring diamond star miss gilmar jewel cried edith recognizing at once yes said gebb miss gilmar jewel found concealed in dean bedroom chapter xxiii convict defence shaking in body white in face ferris looked upon jewellery seemed positive evidence of father guilt then flung back on couch with groan hand over eye to shut out terrible sight for terrible be to son of marmaduke dean edith also gazed fearfully upon heap of gold glittering stone not doubting truth of gebb story yes said detective raking jewel together replacing in bag in looking for miss gilmar confession found in room of dean be hidden on top of tall press in dark corner felt rather than saw case against father be clear enough mr ferris although be doubtful of at first mr grix can prove that spent night of twenty fourth of july away from hall ticket found in miss gilmar room show that must have be there since one must have possessed in especial instance ticket from norminster to london will have evidence of station master ticket clerk to prove purchase of shortly finally possession of jewellery place matter beyond doubt there must be mistake said edith when found tongue for although evidence be against mr dean ca believe guilty be old broken down man timid cowed to plan carry out so ingenious remorseless crime must need more spirit determination than be possessed of besides added very reasonably if a think mr dean be guiltless of kirkstone death why must kill miss gilmar be rather argument against than in favour of said gebb quietly if condemned unjustly bore false witness against a truly believe did very fact must make more anxious to punish for such perjury what do think mr ferris what can think groaned young man evidence seems to prove father guilt still on face of agree with miss wedderburn can not be guilty innocent men have be hanged on evidence a conclusive yet afterwards truth have come to light judge jury found guilty of kirkstone murder be now certain did not commit so be possible that despite evidence to contrary may be innocent of second crime mr gebb added ferris entreatingly know whole of matter be more experienced in such case than miss wedderburn tell truly do believe in father guilt detective hesitated looking from one to other rubbed chin in perplexed manner will answer honestly mr ferris said after pause be not certain of father guilt said that possession of jewellery placed matter beyond doubt against must place fact established by strong circumstantial evidence that miss gilmar received assassin a friend be afraid of dean even after lapse of twenty year must have recognized in place of giving wine cigarette impulse must have be to cry out for help moreover without knowing about visitor presuming be disguised must not have let into house on whole be doubtful fact of jewellery being found in room prof guilt fact that miss gilmar conversed with a friend show innocence who can decide matter know said edith suddenly mr dean say that be in norminster gaol mr gebb well be only mile from here so let three go there question mr dean with evidence for against must declare innocence admit guilt be most straightforward course said gebb with nod what do say mr ferris be content to abide by father word replied arthur rising anything be better than uncertainty let go to norminster gaol be rather late said gebb glancing at watch however dare say will have difficulty in seeing prisoner come along in then tumble down deserted condition of kirkstone hall there be vehicle obtainable evening be pleasant norminster great distance away so three walked briskly along road in cool grey twilight conversing about case made way seem short soon arrived in little town halted before gate of gaol word from gebb procured instant admittance be shown into presence of governor retired major with bluff manner twinkling eye be not unobservant of edith good look well sir said gebb almost immediately how be prisoner clothed in right mind replied governor have given over sulking feigned madness evidently seems resolved to make best of thing indeed must be surprised mr gebb if intended to make father confessor for have asked several time after good said gebb rubbing hand look like business have thrown up sponge will see now asked governor with side glance at edith at once if please wish lady gentleman to be admitted with well be hardly regular to admit stranger at hour mr gebb said major still a captured man be a well for to hear confession if wish to make be content to accede to request have interest in matter asked looking at edith inquisitively yes man be hidden in place under name of martin replied with blush not deeming wise to further enlighten governor indeed be miss wedderburn of hall thought so well go along of remain more than hour with prisoner have to lock up for night shortly may be tempted to keep so fair lady in castle know laughing at own mild joke governor gave visitor over to guidance of warder be soon ushered into cell where found dean sitting on bed chatting cheerfully with man who watched sprang up to receive after warder have exchanged few word with watcher withdrew leaving lamp in cell gebb be much gratified by mark of governor trust spoke to dean with great complacency see have come to sens mr dean said civilly enough with point be about time think a say about time replied dean who have be greeting edith son have given over fighting against injustice of world be condemned innocent man twenty year ago escaped from prison in vain hope of getting ellen gilmar to prove innocence be dead be again in hand of wo say justice injustice why did kill miss gilmar asked gebb for ferris edith sat by quietly letting conduct conversation a most capable person did not kill miss gilmar replied dean firmly sadly god know who sent that wicked woman to last account be not yet uttered threat against did in first wrath at injustice of sentence nearly twenty year of imprisonment removed revenge from heart came down to kirkstone hall not to kill to implore to tell truth free from undeserved shame have fled thinking in guilty mind intended to harm told miss wedderburn did not also ar mean mr ferris can call arthur said gebb coolly know that be son be so asked dean looking with surprise at ferris yes father told mr gebb truth rather admitted a have already learned relationship to from prain know everything have come to ask to right in eye to confess confess arthur do believe that killed kirkstone said arthur with conviction edith said dean looking at girl be opinion that be guilty of miss gilmar death replied edith in turn appearance be against truly believe to be guiltless so be for before go on interrupted gebb looking up think will be best for to approach matter with more particularity be not at grangebury on night of twenty fourth of july yes admitted dean promptly be went to see mr basson who have be counsel about what about confession of miss gilmar what cried gebb in surprise found found on twentieth of july concealed in yellow boudoir where ellen gilmar have hidden know now who killed kirkstone miss laura cried detective knowing dean belief miss gilmar herself be murderess well never said gebb looked at edith lover who be not much astonished where be confession now mr alder have be unexpected reply alder why belief to be guilty said so several time asked to replied dean quickly mr alder have be good friend to through have be good friend to said edith touching arthur hand doe mr alder know who be yes have be present at trial know in spite of altered appearance recognized on one of visit to hall begged to keep secret did asked to talk of a guilty so might be more effectually concealed see how must help interrupted gebb sharply why not if alder have gone about insisting be innocent might have suspected that have seen lately while by stating what everybody believed question must be asked true enough said gebb brow clearing confess disjointed information of yours puzzle not little suppose tell whole story from time first masqueraded a mad martin certainly assented dean readily intended to do so a wish to help to establish innocence also owe to son miss wedderburn to relate thing formerly kept from be attention said edith leaned forward eagerly when be feigning madness at hall said dean glancing at three auditor be wondering time how must prove innocence of kirkstone murder one night mr grix who have found out true name told that miss gilmar have written confession of crime a believed have hidden in house gathered from word let fall by miss gilmar thenceforth became aim of life to find confession although looked everywhere must not discover then mr alder came visiting at hall a know edith guessed who be feeling must not deceive confessed be really marmaduke dean consulted a to possibility of proving innocence alder scoffed at idea of confession being in existence a said if miss gilmar be guilty must not put fact down in black white advised to consult basson who have be counsel to see if must not be cleared be afraid to do lest basson must hand over to police oh must never have done said gebb remembering personality of basson be good nature so alder said continued dean still be too afraid to venture remained in hiding at hall thankful alder kept secret must say that in way acted like true friend for must easily have given warning about to authority wonder did not do so for miss gilmar sake said gebb have deemed guilty must have done so cried dean quickly told whole fact of case declared that laura being possessed of knife have killed brother alder in end said believed in innocence declined to look upon laura a assassin fancied that miss gilmar have committed crime to shield punish for not being in love with accused still declined to believe that have confessed guilt in writing be certain however from what mr grix said that have be very well interrupted gebb quickly doe not explain visit to grangebury chapter xxiv proof positive impatient of interruption dean looked at gebb in quick irritable way like man whose nerve be not under control in own interest answered quietly enough be coming to grangebury visit shortly said be necessary for to explain what led to so that may not misunderstand reason for going there beg pardon mr dean replied detective pray go on a said before continued prisoner be certain that miss gilmar have left confession behind after month of search found where asked edith much interested in yellow room be sewn into hanging between satin lining for particular minute search made must never have be discovered dare say ellen gilmar hid thus safely so that might not be accused of crime in lifetime doubt when dying intended to indicate hiding place so that might be set free character cleared after be safe from punishment of man a be observed ferris bitterly leave to god said dean slowly a have sown so will reap wish worse fate well continued will understand that a soon a discovered proof of innocence be bent upon clearing be not so easy to do have escaped from gaol be discovered must be at once taken back when a fancied confession might go astray prove useless be towards end of july last found consulted mr alder who came down about same time to visit edith yes said edith colouring came to ask again to marry alder advised to place confession in hand of basson offered to take up to at moment be unwilling to let proof of innocence leave hand determined to go up to london see basson thinking might be discovered feared to do so at event to go to basson office wrote told alder so suggested must go to grangebury where mr basson be giving lecture on twenty fourth of july said must come up late see mr basson before lecture place confession in hand with instruction what to do then return by late train to norminster thus said in letter must be exposed to le risk of discovery advice seemed good to adopted where did get money to visit london asked edith for never gave borrowed from mr grix told be visiting friend explained dean also asked to tell have gone into norminster in case missed did miss at there be need for mr grix to say anything said miss wedderburn same added reproachfully might have trusted also interposed ferris must have have confession not basson be right replied father with sigh behaved foolishly admit acted a thought for best on twenty fourth of july by five o'clock train went up to grangebury did know that miss gilmar be there asked gebb with glance at edith did not answered dean why do ask because miss wedderburn knew of miss gilmar whereabouts be true enough responded edith calmly did not think necessary at time to tell mr dean one later on arthur knew that miss gilmar be lodging in paradise row continue mr dean arrived late in grangebury about six o'clock went to public house where have tea made a respectable a possible to go to lecture intended to see mr basson before began then take nine o'clock train to norminster have return ticket asked gebb remembering one found in yellow room yes third class return however in public house fell asleep being worn out with trouble fatigue did not waken until be nearly nine o'clock then went to town hall mr basson be already on platform so must not speak to yet be anxious to get back to norminster on night a did not want edith to know have be in london why said edith must have be aware that must trust wished to know nothing dear until basson proved innocence replied dean sadly must have trusted see now however did not go back night for lost ticket where did lose asked gebb eagerly for be most important point dean shook head ca say replied saw mr alder at door of town hall told be going back gave confession asked to show to basson tried to get to remain be bent on returning knew that confession be safe in hand ran to station there found have lost ticket where know not have money to buy so went back to town hall saw mr alder again about half past nine o'clock then to surprise saw edith enter hall have just returned from getting necklace from miss gilmar explained edith came up to grangebury after did did not know be out of kirkstone hall said dean well did not trouble to wonder why be there lest must see kept out of sight then explained position to mr alder gave money advised to stay night at grangebury be unwilling to do so a last train have left be forced to stay slept in public house where have be before left by early train next morning did hear of murder before left a departed early so see mr gebb can prove alibi for at time of murder ten o'clock be paper said be asleep in public house keeper of can prove be what be name of public house golden hind near railway station gebb noted name in pocket book rose to foot so be have to tell said briskly enough too know who killed gilmar be not if hotel keeper can prove alibi will be right mr dean confession say mr alder have yes asked to make use of replied dean for a be in grangebury on very night about very hour that ellen be murdered be afraid if alder acted on confession might be accused of second crime certainly have defence evidence be so strong against that did not wish to risk appearing do know who killed miss gilmar cried dean vehemently then what about said gebb suddenly produced jewel of miss gilmar ornament belonged to dead woman be taken off body by wretch who killed found hidden in room at kirkstone hall yet swear that know name of assassin what be to understand by contradiction be plot to ruin said dean becoming very pale did not know that jewel be in room never saw before edith arthur what do know of know nothing said simultaneously come mr dean said gebb imperiously ornament must not have be hidden in room without knowledge if alibi be to be believed be innocent on evidence must know who be guilty dean gave long sigh lapsed into old sullen manner know nothing about said in piteous tone one must have put there know who have told truth even will not help one will be condemned for second time innocent man oh god be cruel cruel tear ran down cheek after there be little more to be said old man be ill feeble for moment have braced to tell story hope of being righted have given unnatural strength now that be told nature claimed own dean fell back on bed thoroughly exhausted ferris desired to stay beside father when warder came back must not permit in end three left prison in street gebb turned to speak few word to edith before leaving for town a have decided to do what be intention asked will stay here until to morrow replied be too exhausted to return to london to night must go up in morning a promised to see mr alder alder repeated gebb who have half forgotten man how be very ill dying say sent for to see must not go to day a came here with arthur to see what have be done about father do

remember much more memory have be severely taxed to day know will speak to to morrow whatever tell will tell mr gebb very well replied gebb dubiously walked briskly to railway station a be anxious to reach london to see parge tell what have discovered also desired advice of parge regarding jewel for despite arthur promise did not trust altogether young man have deceived before must occasion arise might do so again so gebb determined to act independently of anything might be said by dean in morning be surrounded on side by people who with own end to gain be more le unscrupulous so behoved to be wary otherwise must never pluck out heart of mystery on arriving in town gebb went to office there found three letter for two from station master ticket clerk of norminster station be corroborative of dean visit to town on evening of twenty fourth of july for stated that mad martin gardener of kirkstone hall have purchased return ticket have left for london by five o'clock train knowing what did evidence came too late to enlighten gebb in degree so tossed letter aside opened third one proved to be from parge requesting to call see at once on important business concerning grangebury murder

parge who received with look of subdued triumph well absalom said have discovered who killed miss gilmar have simon have yes found out truth from who do think know said gebb impatiently mr presk perhaps not from mistress from maid matilda crane gebb looked at ex detective in amazement why what did know about knew who visited miss gilmar on night of murder said have not examined that girl properly absalom so sent for to put few question then discovered that have found cast into grate among other paper letter written by assassin to miss gilmar here be gebb took bit of paper handed to read a follows dear miss gilmar wish to see on evening of th july between nine ten o'clock about information touching dean get rid of one in house at time expect for certain will be better for to be alone burn yours truly john alder alder repeated gebb in amazement alder yes be alder who murdered that wretched woman chapter xxv how deed be done gebb quite agreed with parge regarding guilt of alder on looking back over collective evidence wondered that have not suspected before wonder have come forward to defend ferris for bad a be man have conscience did not wish to see guiltless person hanged for crime even though person be rival in love what gebb must not understand be why alder have be so kind to dean be to ascertain amongst other thing that left parge a soon a be able went off to alder room man be dying for clearance of person concerned in matter be absolutely necessary that must make confession of guilt even at eleventh hour must tell much that have discovered said gebb slipping incriminating letter into pocket a alder be dying there be time to be lost in getting to confess agree with replied parge promptly knew that be dying a saw account of accident in paper get to confess for purpose take mr basson with a witness then come back to tell everything wish to write out detail concerning very extraordinary case put report in collection certainly merit replied gebb putting on hat dare say confession will be most wonderful of by way why did not servant give up letter before because be cunning artful little minx burst out parge in great wrath wished to make money over found a told while cleaning out grate when room be stripped by alder letter be torn across a miss gilmar evidently did not think while to adopt alder advice burn be lucky did not death must have gone unavenged a be a be man will escape law interrupted gebb dare say will be punished somehow be sure deserves to be did mr presk know of 'tilda discovery no 'tilda kept discovery to herself intended to sell information to highest bidder took two hour to wring truth letter out of did in end for evidence paid five pound have doubt miss wedderburn will pay when come into estate what five pound exclaimed parge wrathfully why expect reward reward be to be paid by alder argued gebb although be blind can hardly expect man to pay for own detection next heir must pay said ex detective doggedly miss wedderburn be next heir then will apply to cried parge be going to be paid for trouble seems to simon have have trouble said gebb dryly have sat in armchair done nothing have found out truth if call that nothing retorted parge growing red have used brain be more than have done there be life in old dog yet absalom temper also rejoined gebb who be rather sore about reward eh simon well well will argue matter hereafter must go to alder forget to take basson wo if be right about alder be wrong about dean did not kill kirkstone then who did grunted parge rather displeased miss gilmar retorted gebb departed swiftly leaving to friend to indigestible morsel parge raged trifle after gebb have gone a did not like to be put in wrong when recollected triumph in new murder case be quite content to set against failure in old one so sat placidly in armchair enjoyed success prospect of getting two hundred pound with so little trouble of be satisfactory to wife also a kept parge in good temper for one entire day state of thing be little le than miraculous in frequently disturbed household in mean time gebb with desperate fear in heart that might be too late went a quick a hansom must travel to basson room keeping cab at door ran up long staircase so quickly that arrived at top with failing breath beating heart perennial legend back in five minute be still on barrister door gebb on knocking be again greeted by boy in small suit latter admitted that master be at home stated that must not be seen 'cos ai well explained cerberus be have shock kind of shock accident asked gebb replied boy after consideration not that sort of shock quite kind well be sorry to disturb mr basson said gebb must take card tell must see be matter of life death boy still seemed unwilling gebb thrust card into hand insisted so in end be taken to basson in le than minute cerberus returned with information that master must see mr gebb at once with nod detective stepped into dingy inner office found mr basson with arm on mantelpiece head bent down on in attitude of dejection when heard footstep of visitor firm quick business like footstep be turned slowly displayed very pale face eye so red that looked a though have be cry what be matter asked gebb rather taken aback by evidence of grief have have shock replied basson using very same word a small clerk have done nothing serious hope serious in one way not in still be glad to see if have not come to must have paid visit in course of day have right to know know what demanded gebb beginning to feel uncomfortable knew not why alder be dead dead gebb with burst of anger unusual in one of self control dashed hat on floor by used strong word so have escaped after what cried basson leaning forward in chair have flung into know know that alder killed miss gilmar heard morning have evidence of own handwriting to prove guilt when did hear of how did hear of heard about at eight o'clock morning shortly before alder died then confessed crime did be sent for at seven o'clock at particular request told whole story in order to clear innocent person who might be suspected wrote down what said got to sign doctor be witness confession be locked in desk yonder be coming round to office later on in order to place in hand how did find out truth be long story mr basson will tell to other time learned that killed cousin came here to get to go with force to confess did so voluntarily said basson sadly made what reparation must for wickedness do wonder received shock mr gebb be terrible to hear man have known so long whom have liked so much confess murderer be terrible grant replied gebb somewhat moved by grief of old bohemian must never have thought of a be proved by fact that never suspected seemed kindly honest pleasant gentleman perhaps however there be excuse that did deed in fit of rage from what have heard of miss gilmar be woman to irritate archangel basson shook head there be not even that excuse said crime be committed in cold blood planned carried out in most ruthless manner why in heaven name did desire death of wretched cousin money mr gebb money alder be desperately hard up on verge of bankruptcy a cousin refused to help killed to gain wealth be motive of act well added basson with sigh did not enjoy ill gotten gain long for in midst of prosperity hand of god struck down have confession say here be basson unlocked drawer of desk took out sheet to be precise several sheet of paper handed to gebb detective turned to end saw three signature then slipped paper into pocket will take too long reading just now said apologetically have much to do will be so kind mr basson a to tell fact in own way be curious to know how so many people concerned in case came to be collected in grangebury on night of murder alder collected said basson nodding planned whole affair in most wonderful manner so a to throw suspicion of crime on one have lived must have escaped suspicion think not replied gebb feeling for letter have received from parge own handwriting must have committed be one of little accident mar plan of most accomplished criminal however be neither here there let hear confession basson thought for moment then began seems that miss wedderburn be not only person miss gilmar wrote to corresponded also with alder about business matter for a have left property to by will did not think that must betray to dean a matter of fact be simply putting temptation in man way for alder be desperately hard up be looking forward to time when must come into possession of miss gilmar money however did not know kept advised of change of address did know that be in grangebury oh yes did not visit there for already be thinking of getting rid of by violent mean difficulty be how to do without incriminating then two accident helped first be that while on visit to kirkstone edith told that be bent on getting necklace for arthur ferris be going up to grangebury on evening of twenty fourth of july to get ferris said be to escort later on while alder be still in hall dean told how have discovered miss gilmar confession wished to give to be afraid however to come to office lest must be recognized afterwards alder induced to lecture at grangebury wrote to dean telling to come up see there then gave ferris ticket for lecture told must wait for miss wedderburn in town hall while went to see miss gilmar so now see mr gebb on twenty fourth of july alder have three people likely to be suspected on spot very ingenious idea said gebb suppose did care on whom suspicion fell think did admitted basson candidly preferred to be guided by circumstance really wanted suspicion to fall upon dean a have threatened to kill miss gilmar well know about arthur edith yes know that waited in town hall that got necklace joined later that returned to london also know that dean came up a be too late to see gave confession to alder know how alder managed to get away from hall without suspicion oh be easy replied basson be busy seeing after ticket on behalf looking at house so none of attendant knew where be at moment believed to be in part of town hall when edith came back with necklace sent into hall got rid of dean who have missed train by giving money telling to stay night in grangebury fact favoured plan then coast being clear went alone to paradise row shortly before ten o'clock saw miss gilmar in accordance with instruction be alone in house a have sent mr presk 'tilda to lecture admitted yes locked door after be inside did not see where hid key then told that dean have found confession miss gilmar a may guess be in great state immediately with usual superstition got out card to see what must happen turned up death card yes how do know because found in lap yes said basson again picked up death card while gazing at in horror alder who be striding about room smoking slipped behind with cord torn from nearest curtain strangled then robbed of jewel slipped into pocket then tried to get out found door locked did not know where key be mr presk have key of back door miss gilmar that of front said gebb quite so alder did not know that did not dare to get out by window lest must be taken for burglar arrested so stepped down to kitchen waited till mr presk came home heard go upstairs then call 'tilda so that knew crime have be discovered when servant went up to yellow boudoir alder ran out of back door returned to town people in charge of money ticket thought that have be with fancied have be with a inquiry be made see nobody must guess that have be away have committed crime why did leave jewel in dean room at kirkstone hall ah know said basson much surprised why hid so a to throw blame on dean everything be suspicious against man be presumably guilty of first crime have threatened to kill miss gilmar be in grangebury on night of murder jewel a alder arranged be to be found in room be found said gebb found for moment believed dean guilty about ticket found in yellow boudoir be purposely dropped there by alder to further incriminate dean how did get ticket in giving confession fell out of dean pocket alder picked up so see mr gebb that in way chance played into alder hand wicked flourish like green bay tree ' not for long said gebb grimly tell why be alder so kind to ferris oh be deceit said basson with sigh fancied that when dean be accused of second murder edith must never marry ferris a being son of such man be kind to because wanted to ingratiate with edith so that might marry after parting a thought must with ferris infernal scamp cried gebb swearing when knew that poor devil be innocent have miss gilmar confession here be alder gave to clear dean entirely so suppose will receive free pardon suppose so said gebb putting confession of miss gilmar into pocket along with of alder life be ruined be only sorry for one thing alder did not live to be hanged well can not agree with after be friend said basson sadly be blackguard retorted gebb took departure chapter xxvi end of one month after death of john alder two detective parge gebb sat in room of former discussing now solved mystery of grangebury murder case on table there lay cheque for two hundred pound made payable to absalom gebb signed by edith wedderburn conversation be mostly about cheque how must be divided between so a to compensate with due fairness matter be delicate one must not be settled without sharp word on side after simon remonstrated gebb in vexed tone did most of work deserve reward for pain deserve of retorted parge captiously claim of say divide into two part of one hundred pound will pay much more than compensate know so much about grunted fat man have done deal of thinking over case can tell be who found out murderer so in justice ought to have whole two hundred pound gebb snatched up cheque slipped into pocket if talk like wo have single penny cried wrathfully for be disgusted with avarice of coadjutor in goodness of heart miss wedderburn considered that must pay reward out of estate did so to there be word of mr parge when signed cheque dare say not growled simon savagely be gratitude be yet if have be for father in law to be must have swung for murder a did commit make mistake about simon replied gebb dryly mr dean must have proved innocence without in case confession of miss gilmar show that killed kirkstone evidence of hotel keeper of golden hind prof that dean slept there at very hour of murder must have be declared innocent even if have discovered truth well did anyhow declared other sulkily so did mr basson if come to rubbish cried parge only heard confession of alder well did that reveal truth a matter of fact in face of confession miss wedderburn need not have paid reward to one however thought that deserved payment for work so gave money be only because be pal because know have helped in matter give fifty pound for fifty pound roared fat man growing purple with rage said one hundred just now so did have taken off fifty for greediness simon need to give single stiver if come to will never help again much care retorted gebb can get on without ca say a care to work with man a doe know when friend be doing good turn say word simon parge will reduce reward to twenty five pound if parge have be able to move must no doubt have fallen on gebb chained a be to chair must hing glare at junior with fierce eye very red face knew very well that gebb be acting in most generous manner in offering to share reward so fearful of losing by opening mouth too wide sulkily signified that loaf be better than none dare say be said gebb tartly only get quarter of loaf brought two fifty pound note with a have be so avaricious will only have one there be gebb clapped bank of england note into hand of parge closed on readily enough keep one hundred fifty said with frown do have earned simon by sweat of brow now that have behaved towards deal better than deserve will go bank money will not see here again in hurry cried parge seeing that greed have carried too far softened by money after have be earned very easily go absalom ca do without have be generous simon yes have take man up so short sit down have pipe glass of grog talk over case with dignity gebb accepted olive branch thus held out resumed seat afterward parge seemed so repentant of late behaviour that dignity of absalom disappeared altogether moreover whisky tobacco proved strong aid to patching up quarrel in ten minute pair be chatting together in most amicable fashion well
