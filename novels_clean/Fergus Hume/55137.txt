scotland yard former be speaking mr bolstreath did not smell perfume on mr brown be saying lady be very quick to notice such thing miss moon also shook head think miss moon be in state of mind to understand what be saying mr inspector said halliday drily however be quite sure from own observation that mr brown did not use perfume must have noticed at once for spotted moment examined body so did said durwin once more thought sir charles might have used say did not therefore scent be clue doe not lead to indictment of mr brown however sir said tenson thoughtfully since have perfume of sort about must have killed sir charles for be last person who saw alive may come forward exonerate suggested dan after pause may have left address with sir charles have glanced through paper on desk can find address be inspector reply yet if gave to must be there durwin meditated then looked up a be mother of man in sir charles employment who be drowned said in harsh voice now very official in manner in office of company who own steamer sir charles be director chief shareholder understand from secretary mr penn will be found drowned man address will be that of mother ca see what motive mr brown have to murder sir charles remarked dan in puzzled tone will learn motive when find mr brown said tenson who have made note of durwin suggestion many people think have grievance against rich know that late sir charles be millionaire doubtless have enemy dangerous enemy dangerous word recalled to dan what moon have said at dinner table when lillian have playfully offered penny for thought sir charles at dinner said something about dangerous people what did say asked inspector again opened note book dan reported conversation be not very satisfactory a moon have only spoken generally tenson noted down few remark did not appear to think important durwin however be struck by what have be said sir charles asked here to explain about certain gang believed be in existence remarked what be sir asked inspector alertly did tell anything of course did how must when be dead when arrived retorted durwin with frown simply said that wished to see in official capacity about gang gave detail be to be left until called here preferred to see here instead of at office for reason declared must state when met in room then think that gang mr inspector interrupted durwin stiffly have told be said by deceased whether gang be dangerous what member do where be can not say have examined window asked suddenly pointing to three french window at side of room yes said tenson promptly a soon a entered apartment did so be locked if be not one must enter there put in dan quickly outside be walled garden wall be very high with broken bottle on top suppose mr durwin be thinking that one may have come in to kill sir charles between time of mr brown departure coming yes assented other sharply if perfume be clue mr brown must be innocent penn a know from statement of typewriter girl be in room time servant have fully accounted for examined inspector did be when be at theatre waved hand with shrug who can say who be guilty well said tenson snapping elastic band round note book putting into pocket have evidence of fly of perfume what do think about fly asked dan staring know what to think be artificial fly exquisitely made have be gummed on dead man neck behind left ear assassin must have placed there since man must scarcely do silly thing why be placed there ca say more than can guess why sir charles be murdered who murdered affair be complete mystery a must admit before inquest after inquest more people than three men who have held discussion in presence of dead admitted that affair be mystery in fact evidence at inquest only plunged matter into deeper gloom tenson acting on durwin advice sought office of tramp steamer company universal carrier line in late sir charles be chief shareholder director to learn without difficulty whereabouts of mr brown mother of drowned man proved to be entirely different person to woman who have given name on fatal night being lean instead of stout comparatively young instead of old rather handsome in elderly way in place of being wrinkled worn with grief declared that have never be near moon house on night of murder on other night mr bolstreath lillian footman dan swore that be not mr brown who have sought interview with sir charles therefore be argued by one mr brown taking false name telling false story must have come to see moon with deliberate intention of murdering search be made for must not be found from moment passed out of front door have vanished although description be published of appearance reward be offered for apprehension one came forward to claim guilty innocent be invisible inspector tenson did not speak at inquest of gang about sir charles have intended to converse with mr durwin a did not seem to have bearing on case also a durwin suggested if have bearing be best to keep matter quiet until more evidence be forthcoming to show that gang business be existed then strange episode of fly be suppressed for same reason privately tenson informed dan that must not be surprised to learn that there be gang of murderer in existence whose sign manual be fly real artificial instanced gang have be broken up year previously who always impressed figure of purple fern on victim whole idea said tenson be so vague that thought best to suppress fact of artificial fly on dead man neck if there be anything in finished inspector there be sure to be other murder committed fly placed on victim will wait see if second case occurs will be sure that gang exists will collar beast best to say nothing mr halliday so said nothing dan said nothing durwin who approved of necessary secrecy held tongue of course there be lot of talk many theory a to who have murdered millionaire why have be murdered in so ingenious manner postmortem examination proved that moon have died of snake poison administered through scratch on neck circumstantial evidence at inquest went to show that must have be taken unawares while bending over desk people thought that mr brown be innocent because of absence of perfume others declared must be guilty on account of false name false story fact that moon be found dead quarter of hour after left house doubt circumstantial evidence be very strong must not be said positively that woman be guilty even though did not appear to defend character so jury thought for brought in only possible verdict twelve good lawful men must bring in wilful murder against person person unknown there matter ended for sheer want of further evidence affair be mystery mystery remained will until day of judgment said tenson finally chapter iii duty before pleasure year ended sadly for lillian since have lost father lover home gaining instead doubtful companionship of paternal uncle who stepped into position of guardian girl although did not know at time be leaving pleasant flowery lane to turn into flinty high road arched by dismal sky be true that still possessed mr bolstreath to comfort loss of dan must scarcely be compensated by attention of chaperon not that halliday be altogether lost have be pushed out of life by sir john moon who approved a little of suitor a late baronet have done see dear child exclaimed to lillian immediately after new year

well title be better say nothing about money a have amount of useful article now lord curberry detest lord curberry sha marry lord curberry interrupted lillian frowning mind held picture of lean ascetic peer with cruel grey eye a barrister curberry be doubt admirable a nobleman filled new position very well must not see a lover try a might not that did try for under condition under pressure did intend to become wife father wished to marry lord curberry hinted uncle john softly father wished to be happy cried lillian hotly ca be happy unless marry dan aviator man pooh have nothing to give give be want see love in cottage lillian interrupted again there be need for love in cottage have plenty of money said a much uncle john dear said new baronet gravely from what saw of young halliday be too proud man to live on wife must not respect if did think better of than child dan have profession h be dangerous one at besides doe make much money will though dan be genius have kind of idea about flying machine day will conquer air meantime will be growing old waiting for not at lillian assured will be with helping can wo with consent cried uncle heatedly then will do without consent sha give up dan in case sighed sir john rising to show that interview be ended certainly have ended in clash of will there be nothing for to do to make young halliday give up will never do said miss moon pausing at door with fluttering heart for uncle spoke very decidedly oh think so replied moon with air of man sure of ground have be sure notion of honor be honorable to give up woman be honorable to live on woman two antagonist glared at one silence ensued neither must give way must compromise in way lillian wanted dan a husband post sir john did not intend young man to fill saw plainly enough that harsh measure must drive lillian to desperation did not yet know sufficient of halliday to be sure that must not grasp at rich wife sir john believed that men be like must do anything honorable at pinch dishonorable to secure life of ease comfort however a swiftly reflected halliday be young probably must be wax in hand of clever man such a moon considered to be must be best to see control boy mind by appealing to decency so sir john put very good dear said when reached point matter be at dead lock between suggest that let interview halliday mind so long a see first pouted girl mutinously sir john smiled drily so a to arm for fray very well consent dear can arrange campaign then can discus matter with very undesirable suitor must give promise that will not run away with meanwhile lillian held very erect replied stiffly of course promise uncle john be not ashamed of loving dan will marry in proper manner sha marry lord curberry ended fairly ran away so a to prevent further objection oh dear think will grinned sir john at closed door sat down to pen diplomatic letter to mr halliday a wished to have matter settled done with romantic young nuisance said schemer crossly new baronet be slim well preserved dandy of sixty who looked older than forty five owing to mean took to keep fit be younger only brother of moon inherited title since there be nephew to take also inherited ten thousand year for life on condition that acted a lillian guardian be mean task for girl have income of coming in twelve month there must be plenty of hard up fly gathering round honey pot sir john foresaw that must not be easy business to settle young lady matrimonial future especially a said young lady be obstinate beyond belief sir john being loafer by nature have never possessed sufficient money to indulge to full in luxurious taste since brother have not financed a largely a must have wished now that be safe for rest of life on income must enable to enjoy world good sir john did not wish to be bothered be aim to get niece married settled a soon a possible so that must be looked after by husband under circumstance since lillian be anxious to marry dan be strange that baronet did not allow to indulge fancy did not for two reason one be that really did not think halliday good match moreover knew of late brother opinion on matter of wooing second reason have to do with fact that have borrowed large sum of money from lord curberry did not wish to pay back again even though must do so easily enough in present flourishing circumstance curberry offered to forego payment if sir john must persuade lillian to marry a moon wanted to be able to talk about girl a peeress did not want to reduce new income by frittering away in paying back debt be determined to bring about very desirable marriage a truly considered to be curberry be sure to go in for politics thought plotter have enough brain to become prime minister if like be got decent income too very old title with lillian money beauty must have titled husband besides be after thought curberry can make deuced disagreeable if like perhaps be last idea made sir john so anxious for marriage to take place late sir charles have be big burly broad shouldered man with powerful clean shaven face kind of overbearing pushing personality be bound to come up on top wherever men be congregated sir charles have massively pushed way from poverty to affluence from obscurity into notoriety if not fame now honor wealth be in hand of two people infinitely weaker than have be lillian be delicate girl solely bent upon marriage with undesirable suitor while sir john have desire to do anything with new income new title save to enjoy good god have sent so unexpectedly be by mean strong man being finical self indulgent quite feminine in love for dress luxury much smaller slighter than masterful brother be perfectly arrayed on occasion in purple fine linen very self possessed very polite invariably quiet in manner have several small talent indulged in painting poetry music producing specimen of a weak neatly finished a also collected china stamp old lace jewel loved for color glitter such man be too fantastical to earn respect of lillian who adored strength showed in dan consequently felt certain that must be able to force to consent to desire in girl inexperienced in worldly matter in human nature reckoned without knowledge of sir john obstinacy be singularly striking trait of man character like most weak people new baronet loved to domineer moreover when ease be at stake must be strong even to cruelty since fear begets quality a much a foster cowardice moon have removed lillian mr bolstreath to new house in mayfair because be not wise that girl must remain at hampstead where everything served to remind of good father have lost therefore sir john wished for trouble to take place under roof a such a put must shatter nerve mere fact that lillian wished to marry young halliday that curberry wished to marry be fruitful source of ill stand to sir john credit that did not take easiest method of getting rid of niece by allowing to become mr halliday have conscience of sort wished to carry out late brother desire that lillian must become peeress so far a girl inclination be concerned cared little since looked upon a child who required guidance to guide in proper direction be towards altar in curberry company sir john put to considerable inconvenience acted honestly with very best intention egotism powerful egotism of weak man prevented from seeing that lillian be also human being have right to freedom of choice must be said that for dilettante sir john acted with surprising promptitude took two woman to own house let mansion at hampstead to australian millionaire who paid excellent rent then saw lawyer went into detail concerning property luckily sir charles have gradually withdrawn from business few year before death since have more le concentrated mind on politics therefore income be mostly well invested with exception of line of steamer with mr brown son have be concerned there be few interest required personal supervision sir john having power under will sold dead man interest in ship withdrew from several other speculation having seen that security meant fifty thousand year to lillian ten thousand year to be all in good order settled down to enjoy lawyer on whom kept eye received money banked consulted with sir john regarding reinvestments also by new baronet direction offered reward of for discovery of murderess so shortly after new year everything be more le settled sir john found able to attend once more to lace jewel music poetry only lillian marriage remained to be arranged after conversation with girl sir john appointed day for dan to call young gentleman who have be hovering round lost time in obeying summons be worded amiably enough presented in due time sir john received halliday with great affability offered chair cigarette came to point at once be about lillian wish to see mr halliday remarked placing tip of finger delicately together can go up to drawing room afterwards have tea with with mr bolstreath must have chat first to adjust situation what situation asked dan wilfully dense oh think understand rejoined sir john drily well love be that dan must find to say naturally lillian be charming girl be young man of discernment at least hope so a wish to give lillian up dan rose pitched cigarette into fire never cried looking pale determined singularly virile handsome how can ask thing mr moon mean sir john new title doe come easily see said baronet smoothly oh quite understand poor brother died so unexpectedly that none of have got used to new order of thing least of mr halliday why not ' asked that young gentleman leaning against mantelpiece since felt that must talk better standing than sitting because a say there be new order of thing have known life dear boy a parent placed in late brother charge when be only five year of age say mr halliday instead of dan a wish to understand that be talking a business men not a old friend take away friendship not at mr halliday will be better friend than ever when have have talk have done right thing probably will then call dan a of yore can call what please said dan obstinately rather angrily for fiddling method of sir john annoyed wo give up dearest girl in world father wished to marry lord curberry if father have lived bless retorted halliday vehemently must have seen that lillian love not curberry in case must not have withheld consent oh think must said sir john amiably lillian be rich poor brother wished to obtain title for very natural mr halliday a must see for charles always aimed at high thing loved lillian must not have seen unhappy said dan bluffly see that curberry must make unhappy be devoted to doe not love argued halliday crossly how can there be happiness when love be lacking come sir john have a said just now known life be honorable clean living wellborn while lillian love what objection have to match same objection a brother have mr halliday lillian be wealthy be poor have only few hundred year be true 'buts if please sir john flung up delicate hand in protest ca argue away fact if marry lillian will live on dan bit lip clenched hand to prevent temper from showing too strongly if man have said that to sir john must have knocked down brute force be argument rejoined moon unruffled consider mr halliday have few hundred year lillian have fifty thousand coming in twelve month being wealthy can scarcely live on income so to keep up position to have be born must live on own husband wife be one a be assured by church therefore if life on fifty thousand per annum must live on also must take single penny cried dan hotly boyishly oh be not suggesting that must said sir john easily lillian can not live in cottage few hundred must run to if life a must being rich in large house must live there also in style income doe not warrant know what people will say under circumstance must take lillian to live on small income be not fair to must live on large one be not fair to speak to man of honor remember argument be sophistical not at ca escape from fact then be miserable money to stand between asked dan in despair for must not deny that there be great truth in what sir john said baronet shrugged shoulder seems likely unless can make fortune equal to lillian why not aviation be yet in infancy quite so thus accident be continually happening if marry niece be probable that will shortly leave widow in way look at matter mr halliday match be most undesirable be man man of honor give lillian up to be miserable with lord curberry said dan fiercely never meant what said a sir john saw very plainly being case baronet used argument to obtain what wanted have be young know how feel said quietly very good suggest compromise what be muttered dan dropping into chair again looking very miserable a be natural seeing what stood to lose poor brother went on sir john smoothly crossing leg have be struck down when most enjoying life person who murdered presumably woman who called mr brown have not yet be discovered in spite of effort of police backed by substantial reward propose mr halliday that search for person period of searching be limited to one year if find be punished then will marry lillian if fail then must stand aside allow to marry lord curberry forget said dan not jumping at chance a sir john expected if do bring woman to justice argument regarding living on lillian remain in full force oh a to mr halliday when time come can find argument equally strong on other side to use one now if revenge brother death one will deny what have right to marry daughter enjoy income must be only fair well well echoed dan dully reflected with sad eye on carpet then looked up anxiously meanwhile lillian may marry lord curberry oh said sir john coolly if ca trust can trust cried voice of girl curtain of folding door be drawn quickly aside lillian cried dan springing to foot opening arm sir john saw niece rush into same arm laughed h be said whimsically quite forgot that folding door into next room be open have be listening lillian twisted in dan arm did not leave a felt safe within warm embrace of course have be listening cried scornfully a soon a knew dan be in house in library listened told bolly be coming down to listen though tried to prevent came who have better right to listen when conversation be about remember must have seen first well said uncle unmoved be use arguing with man idea of honor woman be quite opposed to one heard what have to say think be horrid snapped lillian in schoolgirl manner a if money mattered be quite willing to give to marry dan on what have be better to love in garret than to hate in drawing room quite epigrammatic murmured sir john cynically well dear be much obliged to for fifty thousand year offer fancy what have be enough for never did care for million always wondered why late brother must wear out in obtaining decline whether decline not marry dan said lillian hotly what doe dan say young man disengaged have kept silent during passage of arm between uncle niece say that can trust lillian to remain true to for twelve month for ever for ever for ever cried girl face flaming eye flashing make promise of letting marriage depend upon finding woman who murdered poor father ah said sir john contemptuously never loved father see how dare say that flashed out girl panting with anger dear ask replied moon patiently father have be basely murdered yet wish to avenge death prefer own happiness to fulfilment of solemn duty of course added sir john with shrug for now knew what line of argument to take ca trust to be faithful for twelve month can trust to be faithful for twelve century if necessary smiled moon shaking head prefer pleasure to duty see love more than loved father well rose waved hand with gesture of dismissal go way dear marry dan observe call ' mr halliday since be to become nephew straight away when be wedding to be consent cried lillian opening eye widely ca stop said moon still continuing crafty diplomacy will soon be of age can buy husband at once since dare not risk probation of twelve month can risk twelve year retorted lillian uneasily for in flash understood how selfishly be behaving seeing that father assassin be still at large to prove looked at dan understood spoke although have already made up mind a to best course to pursue to prove said steadily accept proposal sir john lillian will wait twelve month during time will search for woman who murdered sir charles if find lillian marries lord curberry said moon quickly cried girl defiantly that part of agreement decline to assent to twelve month twelve year may take before truth come to light marry one dan sir john reflected on danger of aviation swiftly came to conclusion will see at end of year said cautiously much may happen in time so long a lillian wedding to curberry doe happen said dan obstinately care be understood that lillian be not to be worried about matter depends upon what lillian call worry said moon drily so far a be concerned will not coerce in way wish be promise of that will wait twelve month before taking step to marry meantime must not see too much of lillian oh cried girl indignantly must push dan out of life be test explained sir john blinking nervously will be in mourning for next twelve month must see few people of whom dan will be one flashed out occasionally very occasionally can see of course if ca trust to be true without being continually reminded that mr halliday exists there be more to be said can trust muttered girl uneasily can trust lillian said dan promptly decisively doe not look like since always wish to see one remember lillian owe to father memory to put thought of love be out of heart until mystery of death be entirely solved there be something in said halliday thoughtfully lillian nodded of course can write to lillian occasionally said baronet again must be tested by year separation with meeting letter now then duty must be keynote of twelve month not pleasure well lover looked at one sighed term be hard not so hard a sir john might have made still boy girl be little else recognized that duty be to dead afterwards pleasure must be theirs silently accepted silently adjusted situation agree said two almost simultaneously very good said moon rubbing hand how do intend to begin search for missing woman mr halliday know murmured dan miserably do rejoined sir john with great amiability come to tea to tea lover went a to funeral feast sir john rejoiced chapter iv amateur detective dan left mayfair house very mournfully feeling that sir john be indeed master of situation by skilful appeal to generous emotion of youth to boy honor to girl affection have procured respite of twelve month during time lover must hing bound a be by silken thread must give curberry time to push suit there be always chance that dan must come to grief in one of aerial trip in case lillian must certainly be driven to marry titled swain halliday knew nothing of moon reckoning on point must have only accepted situation on condition that curberry be not to meet girl write to girl oftener than logically speaking peer commoner must have be placed on same footing dan grief at parting confused understanding have not be clever enough to seize opportunity therefore sir john winning along line have cleared path for curberry have more le blocked for dan a yet young man did not grasp full extent of sir john worldly wisdom what halliday have to do dominated mind immediately left house be to solve mystery of sir charles death sooner captured false mr brown who presumably have murdered old man sooner must lead lillian to altar therefore be feverishly anxious to begin for life of did not see how to make start have absolutely experience of what constituted business of detective be daunted at outset by difficulty of path same never thought of halting pressed forward without pause first step took be to consult friend on obvious assumption that two head be better than one be freddy laurance whom decided to interview since very up to date young journalist knew one of note almost everything of interest being indeed aware of much of ordinary man in street be ignorant dan have be to oxford together for many year have be best of friend laurance have be brought up in expectation of being rich man over speculation ruined father on leaving university be thrown unprepared on world to make money a best must without sort of training in particular hearty praise from expert for three four newspaper article suggested journalism having observant eye ready pen young man be successful from beginning for time be free lance writing indiscriminately for journal for until proprietor of moment halfpenny daily secured exclusive service at salary procured freddy luxury of life be something to have achieved at age of five twenty moment be bright shoot folly a fly sort of journal detailed news of day in epigrammatic scrap longest article did not exceed quarter of column important event be usually restricted to paragraph indeed skimmed cream of event ten minute study of sheet gave busy man information required concerning doings of humanity also daily published extra sheet concerned entirely with letter from public to public many of be prolix a paragraph rule did not apply to portion of journal people wrote herein on other thing ventilating idea suggesting scheme a many wrote many bought so that friend relative might read letter therefore vanity gave moment quite large circulation independent of orthodox issue proprietor made money in two way by supplying gossip for curious people by giving vain person chance of seeing in print seeing what human nature be be scarcely to be wondered at that moment be great success sold largely in town country freddy post be that of roving correspondent whenever event of interest took place in of four quarter of globe laurance went to take note on spot information be boiled down into concise illuminative paragraph indeed older journalist said that be hardly worth while for to make such long journey for sake of condensed milk news a freddy detail be always amusing a well a abrupt editor public proprietor be satisfied man who can flash vivid picture into dullest mind in few word be well worth money therefore be laurance greatly appreciated dan walked to grimy lane leading from fleet street with doubt in puzzled mind a to whether freddy must be in office at moment notice man must dart off to end of earth be more le on move throughout three hundred sixty five day of year of late sensational event have concentrated in england so dan hoped that friend must be on spot inquiry from gorgeous individual who guarded entrance to red brick building wherein moment be printed published composed revealed that mr laurance be not only in london in office at very second so dan sent up name rejoiced at catching of carrier pigeon be good omen also that freddy saw straight away since generally refused to one on plea of business must resist seeing dan remarked mr laurance when have shaken hand before supplying visitor with cigarette chair be coming to see if mountain have come to mahommed dan lighted up through smoke of tobacco stared inquisitively at friend wondering what introductory remark meant laurance be rather like dan in personal appearance being tall slim clean shaven with greek feature aristocratic look be decidedly fair a halliday be decidedly dark eye be le like of eagle than eye of aviator then laurance be not accustomed to boundless space of air although have twice ascended in airship therefore new expression of new race be wanting nevertheless looked capable alert young man able to get full value out of minute be admirable type of restless present day seeker well mahommed said dan leisurely here be mountain what have to say to that murder of sir charles moon halliday quivered with surprise be so amazing that laurance must hit upon very subject employed own thought yes inquired be engaged to miss moon be in house when crime be committed saw body stop stop be not in house when crime be committed returned there from theatre time later in fact about midnight certainly did see body a to being engaged to miss moon h be came to see about freddy deuce did great mind jump what laurance puffed blue cloud sat down astride chair leaned arm on back strange that must be on hunt well be on hunt echoed laurance staring what do mean must rather ask question of said dan drily sir charles be dead buried many week woman who assassinated ca be found in spite of reward effort of police why at late hour do wish to rake up stale news thought that moment be more up to date will be very much up to date when next murder be committed observed laurance grimly significantly leg of dan chair grated a pushed back in sheer surprise what do mean by next murder demanded sharply well gang gang gang who say there be gang dan thought flew back to durwin reason for visiting sir charles humph growled laurance thrusting hand into pocket be disappointed thought knew more know good deal retorted other quickly intend to talk to about what know until learn game what about own come later also said halliday promptly go on want to know why rake up moon murder naturally do seeing be engaged to daughter be be not quite sure love love new baronet want to marry lord curberry refused kicked up row hour back result be on probation for one year during time be to discover assassin of sir charles if time enough to talk about when fail said halliday coolly at least have twelve month to hunt round came for help seems that want mine why freddy through sheer absence of mind flung away half smoked cigarette lighted then rose strolled across room to lean shoulder against mantelpiece can help one think be final observation hope so in case intend to marry lillian same to pacify sir john be willing to become detective know game yours listen said laurance vivaciously forgot about murder since there seemed to be chance of truth coming to light so did one else for same reason few night ago be dining out met chap called durwin scotland yard man interrupted dan nodding several time came to see sir charles on business found corpse just so well after dinner have chat told that be anxious to learn who killed moon because did want more murder of kind to happen a police official understand strange must be confidential on point murmured halliday thoughtfully seeing that wished theory regarding possible gang kept quiet in hope of making discovery have changed mind about secrecy so have tenson said freddy oh dan raised eyebrow inspector have seen also laurance nodded after saw durwin learned what have to say saw tenson interviewed told about fly on neck remembering case of purple fern having regard to fact that fly in question be artificial men be inclined to believe in existence of gang whose trade mark said fly be dan nodded again quite so then durwin came to see moon hear about gang found dead so said so durwin said rejoined laurance quietly seems very certain putting that together that sir charles became dangerous to gang whatever be wherever exists so be put to death by false mr brown who came expressly to kill so far be with on four said halliday well well durwin tenson dreading lest gang may commit crime wish to make matter a public a can so a to frighten beast h be said dan looking at neat brown boot have changed mind seems first idea be to keep matter quiet so a to catch devil red handed however publicity may be good thing how do intend to begin have got fact from tenson from durwin said freddy promptly now since saw body found fly want to get fact from on what acquire will write letter in extra sheet of ours can be pretty certain from what know of human nature that amount of people will reply to letter may reply to purpose be not so sure of dan if mention fly a trade mark recall strange case of purple fern one may write about matter known to from positive knowledge if gang exists have committed more murder than one fly being small insect may not have be noticed a trade mark in other crime wonder spotted anyhow be easily seen being on back of neck near wound besides fly in month of murder be rare finally tenson discovered fly to be artificial show that be purposely placed on dead man neck near wound h be reflected perhaps someone may know of crime with fly trade mark in case can be certain that gang doe exist so think cried laurance quickly for reason intend to start discussion by writing open letter publicity may frighten beast into dropping trade on other hand may goad gang into asserting in case subject will be ventilated may learn more le of truth yes think be good idea freddy perfume did durwin inspector tell anything about perfume can see by blank stare that did listen freddy store knowledge in blessed brain son be clue be sure halliday forthwith related to attentive listener detail concerning strange perfume have impregnated clothes of dead man sir charles hated perfume ended emphatically did even like lillian mr bolstreath to use obeyed curious mused journalist idly scribbling on blotting paper be back at desk by time what sort of scent be dear chap ask to describe impossible retorted dan with uplifted eyebrow how deuce can get kind of smell into head must be smelt to be understood can say be that perfume be rich heavy suggestive of drowsiness indeed used that word tenson thought of kind of chloroform used perhaps to stupefy victim before killing there be odor about mouth nose on handkerchief perhaps suggested reporter tenson smelt handkerchief well if mr brown used perfume miss moon mr bolstreath must have smelt on in hall understand from durwin that three saw woman yes lillian poor girl persuaded father to see wretch did not smell perfume on woman tenson durwin forget asked question humph said laurance after pause may be kind of trade mark like fly business took note will use evidence in letter to public suppose dan must recognize scent again oh yes have keen sense of smell know expect will ever drop across particular fragrance freddy there be always monsieur chance know remarked laurance tapping white teeth with pencil perhaps gang use scent so a to identify one in dark may be like cat how doe that strike a purely theoretical said dan with shrug reached for cigarette be case of perhaps perhaps not laurance assented everything so far be theoretical in case argued have told know bit even to year of probation do know curberry yes be slap up barrister pity got title money a have left bar be good man spoiled lucky chap same a uncle cousin died unexpectedly to give chance of house of lord how did die motor accident car went over cliff only chauffeur be saved broke leg do know present lord curberry have seen think be dried up cruel looking beast said dan with considerable frankness 'd rather see lillian dead than wife hear hear applauded laurance smiling girl too delightful to be wasted on curberry have blessing on match dan thanks said halliday ruefully have to bring off first sir john infernally clever managed to get lillian to consent to let matter stand over for year during time guess will push curberry suit can trust lillian to be true to bless mr bolstreath be quite on side after murmured young man disconsolately be only fair that sir charles must be avenged perhaps must be selfish for lillian to marry live happy ever afterwards without making attempt to square thing question be how to start be hanged if know so came to well said laurance thoughtfully there be hope of monsieur chance know in many way may stumble on clue even without looking for since gang if exists must carry on extensive business can do dan be to keep eye ear nose open last for scent know on part will write letter publish in annex of moment then will see what will happen yes think be about best way to begin stir up muddy water may find what be at bottom of pond there be one thing to be considered be money if be going to hunt for scoundrel need cash to own up freddy have very much be so beastly extravagant said laurance grinning private income go nowhere huh what be five hundred year ten pound week more le however there be aviation hear that take people flight for money dan nodded be latest fashionable folly be good thing for old son get pretty well paid mean fun with risk of death said laurance drily well yes be peculiarity of present day fun people love to play with death thrill however if be to hunt for assassin of sir charles ca give much attention to aviation repeat want money ocean of must two thousand pound suit rather only be not going to borrow from old man thank have amount to lend said freddy drily must have seen if read very interesting paper that proprietor have offered prize of two thousand pound for successful flight from london to york kind of up to date dick turpin suppose laughed dan rising stretching long limb good will have shot may win will if use vincent machine vincent vincent where have heard that name everywhere if know anything of aviation world snapped laurance rather crossly for at time dan indolence in acquiring necessary information annoyed solomon vincent who have be inventing airship new fangled aeroplane for ever so long yes yes remember now be genius one know one know of except one know personally life secluded life up in hillshire on border of moor where can find wide space for experiment in aerial craft interviewed year ago laurance blushed red hullo what be asked dan shrewdly can be that inventor have daughter fair niece retorted laurance recovering why must be in love a well a halliday however that doe matter matter great deal to never mind what have to do be to secure one of vincent machine try for race if win prize will have heap of money to search for gang why doe miss moon take lillian money said dan curtly blushed in turn be good idea freddy how can get hold of machine will take up to hillshire next week can see vincent for can talk to can talk to niece what be name oh shut up get out said laurance turning away be interrupting work going to write letter to beloved said dan leisurely making for door right old son will go know address so write when want 'd like to see vincent machine a hear have made several good improvement everything tell in race salaam keep eye open laurance called after remember monsieur chance may prove to be best friend dan departed shrugging shoulder believe in heaven sent miracle be last word be wasted on freddy for alert young man be already buried in work be painful to witness such industry in halliday opinion in inquiring frame of mind amateur detective strolled along fleet street thinking of lillian instead of keeping wit about a freddy have requested seemed impossible that must strike on clue without deliberately searching for did not feel inclined to do at moment monsieur chance indeed be mythical personage in whom sceptical young man did not believe besides love dominated thought to exclusion of minor matter dreamed about darling along strand thus did not look where be going stumbled into midst of charing cross crowd where motor have broken down after colliding with 'bus policeman be conversing with chauffeur 'bus driver who be conversing abusively with one crowd blocked street stopped traffic in order to enjoy conversation left nothing to be desired in way of free language dan halted idly a spectator not because wished to be one for very simple reason that must not get through crowd into trafalgar square thrust up against one man wedged in by two others surrounded by hundred grumbled at delay peered over shoulder to see when incident must end a did so suddenly in mind eye saw vision of sir charles lying dead in well lighted library while wondering why thought of crime at particular moment became aware that familiar scent assailed nostril scent about have talked to durwin tenson laurance nosing like hound tried to find person from whom emanated almost immediately later man turned dan found face to face with marcus penn chapter v muddy water secretary of late sir charles moon smiled irresolutely when recognized dan that young gentleman who thought penn weak kneed idiot have never taken much notice of for fact that be perfumed with unusual scent must not have spoken to now a looked at lank creature with yellow face scanty moustache guessed that be exactly effeminate sort of person who must use perfume what wished to know be why affected particular kind of fragrance whence obtained to gain information pretended friendliness for man be far from feeling dan strong virile confident be not altogether just to penn who be not responsible for pallid look weak character halliday be not perfect individual by mean have yet to learn that weak be meant to be protected helped instead of being despised here mr penn said dan thus formal to mark difference between yes replied man in faint hesitating voice a moved out of crowd halliday smelt weird perfume more strongly than ever shaken from penn clothes by movement stopped to look at accident very ordinary one rejoined mr halliday with shrug by way have not seen since funeral of sir charles what be doing now if may ask be secretary to lord curberry oh reply gave dan something of shock for did not expect at moment to hear rival name then whole incident of meeting penn smelling incriminating perfume be strange monsieur chance have proved to be actuality instead of mythical personage dan have believed to be be certainly odd that meeting have taken place odder still that penn must prove to be servant of curberry a halliday said nothing more than oh other man stroked moustache explained sir john got post mr halliday said with shifty eye anywhere on dan inquiring face be quite stranded after sir charles unexpected death did not know where to turn for employment a support widowed mother situation be rather serious so took courage in hand went to sir john be good enough to recommend to lord curberry have be with lordship for month more le congratulate mr penn lord curberry also sir charles always said be excellent secretary dan stopped a penn bowed acknowledgment to compliment cast keen side glance at man be walking through trafalgar square by time passing under shadow of nelson column do know what be thinking of when behind in crowd yonder mr penn asked abruptly must be confessed rather undiplomatically if wished to get at truth said secretary with simplicity manifest surprise mr halliday how can guess thought be thinking of murder of late employer said dan straightly penn blinked shivered be horrible subject to think about remarked in low voice can scarcely get out of own thought suppose sight of reminded of crime mr halliday scarcely since be behind did not recognize until turned replied dan calmly other appeared to be surprised then how began only to be cut short be that scent scent echoed penn nervously manifestly still surprised understand exactly what mean mr halliday like scent use much of be lip curled so perceive where did get particular scent be using now may ask something in tone annoyed secretary for drew up halted know why must criticize taste mr halliday be not criticizing jump down throat reek of strange perfume last smelt paused can not have smelt anywhere said penn indifferently what do mean by exactly asked dan with considerable sharpness penn resumed walk drew light eyebrow together be willing to explain a soon a tell why speak of scent hang man rejoined halliday dropping into step one must notice scent speak of since be so strong oh penn brow cleared understand now have taken fancy to scent wish to get halliday be about to make indignant denial when suddenly changed mind seeing chance of learning something well can get said penn coolly can not be particular perfume come from island of sumatra have cousin there who know that like perfume sent single bottle ca buy anywhere be not to be obtained in england said penn curtly in case said halliday slowly be strange must have smelt same perfume on clothes of sir charles after death did penn looked surprised that be impossible why sir charles detested scent never dared to use one until left for night used on night of murder of course used night when left sir charles on evening sent away with usual batch of letter be going down to house later must not have seen until next morning so took opportunity to indulge in taste then how did sir charles clothes become impregnated with be unable to say why do ask surely penn turned alarmed face towards speaker looked yellower than ever surely suspect of keeping back anything from police likely to lead to detection of assassin ask mr penn said dan coldly inspector tenson mr durwin smelt particular perfume on clothes of dead man mind telling that police consider something of clue clue to what to must be since alone posse scent certainly came into library when summoned by mr durwin helped to look after sir charles a be strongly perfumed with scent be not impossible that employer clothes took what doubtless will call taint think ended penn in dignified manner that such be proper explanation have found mare nest mr halliday upon word believe have said dan quite good humoredly must forgive mr penn inspector tenson agreed with that fly scent be clue about fly know nothing said secretary positively scent be not to be have in england sir charles clothes must only have gathered fragrance from mine if inspector tenson suspect no interrupted halliday quickly assure that doe not must if told of meeting retorted penn a passed into piccadilly circus a like even suspicion to rest on mr halliday for good name be fortune will go see explain whole circumstance indeed if wish will give bottle cousin sent from sumatra never will use scent again like injurious suspicion make mountain out of mole hill said dan drily if have hurt feeling apologize accept apology only on condition that accept explanation dan inwardly chuckled at penn dignity replied readily enough oh yes for if did not accept explanation must not make apology be probably right since scent must have got on to sir charles clothes from own clue a took to be have ended in smoke think must see inspector tenson explain there be need dan assured soothingly if inspector say anything about scent will explain after be who suggested perfume a clue must like what be left of bottle asked penn pacified by very frank apology of other thanks never use perfume hate so did sir charles mused penn eyeing dan with lack lustre gaze wonder did not suspect of liking if have come upon scented in manner must have kicked out be to be hoped lord curberry have not same dislike said dan who having learned wished desired to escape from such boring society have not said penn with great simplicity be very kind to suppose will marry miss moon then suppose wrong will not snapped halliday roughly love devotedly insisted secretary with glint of malice in pale colored eye good day rejoined dan shortly a did not wish to argue matter turned into regent street for by time have crossed circus when penn ran after seized arm be there chance of woman who killed sir charles being found replied dan halting for moment why because sir charles be good to must like death to be avenged be only natural surely police will search be searching mr penn can discover nothing perhaps lord curberry may hunt for woman will ask to a love miss moon so devotedly will try to learn truth irritated by speech for penn knew very well of rivalry dan became scarlet will discover truth lord curberry need not trouble if discover truth began penn hesitated well asked halliday sharply think lord curberry will certainly marry miss moon what do mean by demanded dan penn gave answer shaking head significantly stepped back in one moment be lost in midst of crowd thronged corner halliday must have followed for man last observation seemed to hint that knew more about truth than be disposed to admit many people came between secretary so be impossible to get hold of again dan be forced to walk on alone walked on pondering deeply did penn know truth seemed impossible that must know evidence of typewriting girl went to show that have not left private room evening until summoned by durwin when death be discovered what penn said about perfume appeared to be reasonable enough a certainly have handled body if reeking of scent a be reeking on very day be not surprising that odor must communicate to dress clothes of dead man odor cling very powerfully endure for considerable time sumatra scent assuredly have done so for be quite three hour after death dan have seen corpse even then have smelt perfume however on face of halliday saw reason to doubt penn statement quite understood how became through sir john mediation secretary of lord curberry only last speech of secretary be strange why must say that if truth be discovered by dan curberry must marry girl when on discovery of truth so far a dan must see marriage of to lillian depended dan must find answer to question have half mind to follow penn to new employer house so a to force explanation a knew curberry did not like decided to let matter stand a be only reveal what have heard to laurance for next four five day young halliday went about business in quiet determined manner thought a little a possible of lillian did not even write call to see since wished to give up whole attention to discovering truth about moon death if thought of love lillian certainly must not concentrate mind on necessary search be very necessary if intended to marry girl became certain that in way sir john intended to trick if found out false mr brown solved mystery sir john must be forced out of sheer justice to sanction marriage be heroical of halliday to turn thought from beloved be easy task to one so deeply in love a saw need of manfully set to endure present pain for future joy whether lillian saw thing in same light resented neglect did not know a have word from neither came there letter from mr bolstreath dan have certainly be pushed out of girl life by astute uncle be own common sense kept out of for time being be understood love demand martyr halliday have become one for love sake by doing so although knew not be displaying more real love towards than have ever done in life before meanwhile laurance lost time in publishing letter dealt with mystery of moon death a moment including extra letter writing sheet have large circulation a be season devoid of news letter caused great discussion be sufficiently alarming to who loved law order since boldly announced that gang of criminal existed coldly cautiously deliberately employed member to put people to death letter called attention to fly that artificial one on sir charles neck near poisoned wound declared that such be sign manual of accursed society mention be made of scent since dan have explained what penn have said to laurance laurance have accepted explanation a valid there be quite enough in letter to startle most dull especially when writer called attention to happening of various mysterious murder suggested that such be work of misguided set of people who constituted unknown gang finally freddy ended letter by saying that moon have knowledge of gang have sent for scotland yard official name not given to explain whole matter when met with death be fact therefore that false mr brown be emissary of gang who have be sent to murder sir charles have performed vile errand only too well postscript to epistle invited discussion particularly called upon person who knew of artificial fly being found on corpse to give evidence in two day sheet be filled with letter from various people matter be much discussed of writer laughed at idea of such society existing in civilized country such a england while others expressed alarm asked what police be doing not to arrest criminal last scribe evidently entirely forgot that one knew where central quarter of gang be that letter of mr laurance be attempt to root out heart of mystery who appeared in print aided circulation of moment by buying own lucubration certainly did not help much generality of letter be discursive ornate wandering very much from point giving positive information such a must assist freddy purpose three four epistle drew attention to certain mysterious crime perpetrator of have never be brought to justice who be not even known there be case of young girl found dead on brighton railway line near redhill who must have be thrown out of train then one wrote about miser in east end who have be strangled person recalled drowning of well known philanthropist in serpentine verdict of suicide have be brought in a regard last victim writer of letter positively asserted that philanthropist have not slightest intention of making away with finally came batch of letter concerning child who have be murdered only in one case did appear that fly be seen on victim be when schoolmistress be stabbed to heart while in bed asleep assassin have entered escaped by window victim mother who wrote letter drawing attention to case have found fly on daughter cheek have thought nothing of at time have brushed away insect after mention of fly on sir charles moon neck remembered incident also turned out that schoolmistress have lived must have inherited large sum of money be last circumstance suggested intervention of gang to murder girl so that someone else might inherit letter dealing with various case be vague enlightening detail must be given must be said be that there be many unusual death mystery of must not be solved laurance reading letter during week of appearance felt sure that gang existed be more le alone in opinion even dan be doubtful seems large order for number of people to band together to murder on comprehensive scale objected quite see object many of victim mentioned in letter be poor seem to have changed mind about matter said laurance drily for when letter appeared be assured that there be such gang only because of sir charles remark to durwin be pity sir charles be not more explicit retorted freddy crossly have time to be explicit said dan patiently since died before explained let admit for sake of argument that gang exists why must member murder poor people folk have be murdered by way of revenge a well a for money let remind dan that four five of victim mentioned in letter have money be about to inherit money be quite convinced said laurance striking table that there be association association for what be very dull to get undesirable people out of way remember in reign of louis xiv there be dozen of poisoner in paris who undertook to kill people when engaged to do so reason be for revenge desire for money for other reason ended laurance vaguely hum dan stroked chin may be a say certainly sir charles be got rid of because knew too much about gang insisted laurance since be to see durwin about same be certain that association exists said that before halliday reminded say again at event there be one thing certain that have learned from letter of many mysterious crime only in one case be fly discovered objected dan again be not to be wondered at replied journalist wonder be that small insect must be noticed at one must ever think of connecting fly whether dead alive with death mother of schoolmistress did not until experience with regard to moon be quoted in letter fly business be quite ridiculous perhaps mean nothing think doe seeing that in moon case fly be artificial probably in case of schoolmistress be artificial also only mother who noticed did not make examination why must wonder gang have better trade mark perhaps gang may think must be spotted if did then why have trade mark at answered laurance sensibly if there be to be sign there must be sensible one if fly be stamped on skin a purple fern be stamped there must be sense in matter fly artificial real be freddy spread out hand for word entirely failed well said dan after pause know what to say since everything be so vague however will assume that gang exists will do best to aid to bring about destruction a mean marriage to lillian to help must have money so sooner get north engage one of vincent machine with latest improvement better will be pleased moved towards door a be in laurance room when conversation took place there halted think freddy will have chance of proving in own person a to truth of supposition regarding gang what do mean asked laurance somewhat startled well murmured dan gang know started hunt for destruction a expect member read paper if be case will be source of danger such a sir charles be will look after interrupted laurance grimly well if worst come said dan agreeably will carefully examine corpse for celebrated fly will look after said laurance again if think be going to give up doing business through fear of death be much mistaken if can find gang exterminate gang will get much larger salary so will be able to marry mildred oh be name be mildred vincent be pretty might not think so since miss moon be ideal said freddy with blush mildred be dark tall well proportioned none of skimpy woman old man lillian be skimpy cried halliday indignantly never said be let call fairy like be better mildred will see when go north day after tomorrow good dan nodded thankfully go to vincent day after to morrow yes meet at quarter to twelve at st pancras station train leaf at mid day change at thawley for beswick about four o'clock expect will arrive going well at sheepeak about six good why must all go well inquired dan after pause laurance chuckled according to gang will hunt down a be in company well chuckled again oh care cent for gang no more than retorted dan with shrug be not even going to think of beast go north to get machine will enable to win two thousand then then echoed laurance with grin then will discover truth crush gang marry lillian in way therefore muddy water be stirred up chapter vi inventor freddy laurance usually opened mouth to ask question rarely to talk about in newspaper world confidence may mean copy given that such be worthy to appear in print therefore a young man found be just a well to be sparing of personal detail having made discovery be careful to keep tongue between teeth in matter dealing with private life reticence useful in business wholly unnecessary in friendship particularly when friendship have to do with dan halliday have grown upon laurance to extent that said very little about love affair dan being genial soul fellow sufferer in cause of cupid having heart whole liking for journalist resented being shut out in way therefore made business to extract freddy love story from when two be in train making for sheepeak vi thawley beswick where did meet asked dan abruptly a have compartment to have exhausted not only newspaper magazine repeated laurance who be calmly smoking with foot on opposite seat what one girl in world for oh bosh freddy colored looked pleasantly embarrassed be perhaps be right dan began to

found that a newspaper man be able to talk in print about machine for inventor old man have excellent idea of business inventor being generally fool so called next day to see if miss vincent nerve be better freddy cast look of surprise at dan dark face how did guess halliday well did got on better with solomon vincent than ever undoubtedly got on better with niece murmured dan mischievously well

two went out of door surveyed landscape sheepeak be situated on top of lofty tableland village being tolerably large collection of substantial stone house whence moor spread north south east west from where be friend must see green square of cultivated field purple bloom of heather azure hue distance gave to distant mountain here there vast country looked enormously large from elevation whence surveyed dipped into verdant dale snugly clothed with forest sprinkled with manor house village big little land be so far stretching prospect so extensive that dan became mightily impressed with magnitude of sky covered like huge inverted cup a there be nothing to break league long sweep dan felt quite small in immensity surrounded above below feel like pill in desert of sahara said mr halliday sighing what be sensation of feeling like pill rejoined laurance drily for be not imaginative individual only poet can explain freddy be very earthy never knew be genius snapped laurance with shrug have much to learn replied dan reprovingly a be near eleven o'clock suppose light out for vincent freddy agreed skirting village for three quarter of mile suddenly came upon small cottage with wall roof of yellowish stone covered with lichen standing in small garden of wind tormented vegetation low stone wall divided from high road visitor entered through small wooden gate to pas up cobble stone walk to modest door cottage be dwarfed wholly by huge shed of wood covered with roof of galvanized tin loomed up suddenly behind on vast scale more in keeping with character of landscape be workshop of vincent where built machine housed from prying eye field at back cultivated into smooth lawn be where aeroplane started to fly over hill dale to wonderment of inhabitant though be pretty well used to vincent vagary by time said freddy ending explanation mildred received in small parlor of cottage be about size of doll drawing room expressed a pleased to make acquaintance of mr halliday uncle mentioned be busy a usual in workshop must see visitor in hour while explained dan took stock of admitted that be really very amiable pretty girl though not patch on lillian then dan did not care for tall lady with olive complexion blue eye dark hair regal melancholy look of discrowned queen mildred name suited be too tall stately for taste approved more of little golden haired woman fairy like frolicsome miss vincent looked serious thoughtful although smile be delicious smiled very seldom seemed to dan that solitary life in moorland in company when enjoyed of morose uncle made girl sober beyond year be not more than two twenty however many mind many taste dan must not deny what freddy fair saxon look went very well with celtic mystic appearance of inventor niece be handsome couple indeed much too solemn in look character for dan whose liking leaned to frivolous side of thing find dull here miss vincent asked halliday casually dull echoed turning somewhat sad eye of dark blue in direction oh not at why have great deal to do have only one servant assist in housework uncle be not easy to cater for a have many like dislike with regard to food then employ certain number of workman have to pay saturday indeed look after financial part of uncle business be business whim hobby inquired dan respectfully for being frivolous be struck with awe at multitude of miss vincent employment well more of last than first perhaps said mildred smiling at respectful expression uncle solomon really doe care for publicity aim be to construct perfect machine be always inventing improving thinking of new way in to obtain mastery of air machine have be tried by other people though remarked freddy oh yes with great success uncle doe even read paper to see what be said about aeroplane although be always anxious to read what other inventor be doing take great interest in race across channel over alp from city to city be wrapt up in own scheme work for twelve more hour out of twenty four in perfecting machine public applause public reward appeal to see mr halliday be work ah be true spirit of genius said dan approvingly man like be sure to arrive will never arrive said miss vincent quietly for a soon a arrives at one point only regard a resting place to start for further goal doe care for food drink clothes politics amusement anything for ordinary man strives machine take up attention happy man to have one strong aim to be allowed to work at aim be true happiness of man will be glad to have talk with doe talk much mr halliday man obsessed with one idea seldom doe retorted young fellow hope however will let have machine for race can handle aeroplane once be explained to freddy here say that uncle machine have many improvement likely to tell against competitor be not sure if will let have machine said mildred face clouding be very jealous whimsical know like inventor murmured laurance rising let go see yes added dan also getting on foot then take freddy away miss vincent let talk to uncle will get what want somehow mildred laughed led way out of cottage by back door be not easy task have set to do said doubtfully here be workshop building where machine be housed be uncle solomon building looked plebeian gimcrack with flimsy wooden wall tin roof impressive only in magnitude must have cost deal to erect in neighborhood where house great small be of stone wood be comparatively scarce vincent a dan considered must be well off to indulge in so expensive hobby to be sure by racing must gain prize if successful must also sell machine at good figure from what mildred said seemed to dan that uncle have true jealous spirit of inventor did not let darling go out of hand if must help to live on vast moorland working at invention experimenting with idea be enough for solomon vincent without applause reward of world undoubtedly to carry out plan must have private income not inconsiderable one at uncle be mr laurance mr halliday said mildred introducing two young men though first did not require mention vincent like most inventor be absent minded took quite minute to recognize laurance whom have not seen on previous night mr laurance mr halliday said casually turning from workman to whom have be speaking yes of course understand about propeller quinton added again taking up conversation with workman must be seen to at once quite oblivious of company went on giving instruction until man went away to do task mildred touched uncle arm be mr laurance mr of course know be mr laurance said vincent testily do think be blind how do do laurance good by be busy be mr halliday who want machine went on mildred persuasively indeed then mr halliday sha get one retorted vincent sauntered into nearest shed with scowl on lean face be acrid looking man of fifty with untidy gray hair untrimmed beard follow will talk said mildred hastily will remain here with freddy a uncle doe like many people to be about be not easy to get on with sighed dan can see however took girl advice went into shed after ungracious inventor leaving lover to return to cottage parlor did forthwith laurance be quite astute enough to lose time since moment spent with mildred be golden not easily obtainable dan marched into shed with fine air of possession again surveyed vincent who be examining specification near window man be carelessly dressed in shabby suit of blue serge seemed to care little about personal appearance marking once more shaggy hair beard yellow skin considerably wrinkled young man went up to a if waking from dream vincent looked up dan met gaze of two very keen dark eye whose expression be anything amiable who be what do want demanded owner of eye crossly name be halliday want machine to race between london york have just be introduced to by niece niece must have more sense than to have brought here cried inventor fiercely come to spy out idea to steal assure said dan drily be not genius a be more reason must pick brain snapped vincent in way mollified by compliment a dan intended must be halliday laughed if did must make use of picking mr vincent a may guess can handle machine ca put one together who told about demanded man suspiciously laurance be meddlesome fool well said dan cheerfully there may be two opinion about know want want want one why do come bother when want because want be to be considered see here mr vincent added halliday in coaxing voice for saw that be necessary to humor clever man like child there be to be race between london york for big prize given by moment paper mr laurance work for wish to compete machine be so good a must like to be hear that have made several improvement make for speed easier handling of aeroplane let have one of latest will share prize with be two thousand know want money snapped vincent abruptly congratulate said dan coolly yet large sum must be needed to help to build machine must be rich be rich vincent grew dusky red glanced in odd way over shoulder a if expected to find one at elbow mind own business said in harsh voice with suppressed fury whether be rich not be business sha have aeroplane of mine clear out dan did clear out a went wondered why man be so angry confused seemed quite afraid of simple question have be put to chapter vii hermit lady dan be not naturally of suspicious nature since taking up profession of detective have become so slight matter formerly must not have noticed now attracted attention a saying go saw bird in bush for reason while returning slowly to cottage considered vincent backward glance hinted at nervousness unnecessarily angry reply to question a to whether be rich usually dreamy absent minded turn taken by conversation have awakened tiger in man apparently regarded halliday a over inquisitive yet why inventor must take view dan must not conjecture after musing for few minute young man began to think be making mountain out of mole hill secret vincent have in life a suddenly aggressive attitude showed must have nothing to do with particular quest upon dan be bent halliday therefore dismissed matter from mind with shrug went into cottage to disturb lover well mr halliday remarked mildred whose cheek be flushed whose eye be bright what did uncle say very little what did say be to point refuse to let have machine how like ejaculated laurance quickly upon what ground dan scratched chin really know seems to think that be spy desirous of learning trade secret called meddlesome fool freddy ah be because wish to marry mildred replied freddy drily be very natural that mr vincent must object to man who come to rob of treasure so mind abuse be not treasure cried mildred becoming pink be who know that better than darling think too well of impossible be best dearest stop stop mildred covered face remember be not alone oh mind said dan phlegmatically be in love miss vincent nodded comprehendingly with miss moon freddy have told have told that marriage

be done be certain with one of uncle aeroplane mildred a have made wonderful improvement in structure decline to furnish with machine interrupted halliday in vexed tone not even offer to share prize tempts be too rich suppose cast inquiring glance at girl mildred shook head uncle solomon be not rich replied quietly must be insisted dan sharply must not indulge in such expensive hobby otherwise mr jarsell help with money though to be sure have little of own still unless supplied money uncle solomon must not go on building aeroplane especially a rarely sell one wish to keep invention to idea be to invent perfect machine then sell to government fancy that if allows one else to handle aeroplane secret may be prematurely discovered well can see objection in way assented dan since more idea be stolen than pocket handkerchief a balzac say mr jarsell be rich rather eccentric lady who life at grange said mr laurance before mildred must reply be a wise a be before freddy be odd thing for lady to finance inventor of flying machine must be large minded have very great deal of money be large minded have plenty of money admitted mildred vivaciously influence with uncle be extraordinary not at if supply cash said dan cynically have idea miss vincent suppose enlist mr jarsell sympathy about murder said halliday after thinking for moment so see use of talking too much about that more secret freddy keep hunt better prospect have of success since gang will not be on guard a be miss vincent introduce to mr jarsell a young ardent lover who wish to make money in order to marry girl of heart if be romantic nine old lady out of ten be romantic will induce uncle to give newest aeroplane if decides to help uncle solomon certainly will give what want mildred assured since mr jarsell have supplied with so much money for experiment thought for second then raised head cheerfully will see mr jarsell miss armour afternoon who be miss armour mr jarsell companion relative confidential friend be dear old thing be sure to sympathize with romance better so long a can influence mr jarsell can influence a mr jarsell swears by put in freddy oh think will pull off dan be good idea to work old

eccentric couple of lady who lived at llangollen remember have heard name murmured dan reflectively old lady of llangollen who eloped together lived in wale must rather like to see pair follow so strange example when be to go afternoon repeated mildred nodding brightly really think something may come of visit mr halliday freddy go back to 'the peacock ' for dinner then call for later say at

two men escorting one girl be large rambling mansion built of yellowish stone original color more le washed out by rain burnt out by sunshine surface of massive wall be grimy with black rough with lichen while broad flat stone of roof be covered with damp green moss house although in two story be of great height stood on uttermost verge of hill sloped abruptly down into valley view must have be very fine sundry tall house have be built round grange prevented owner from enjoying magnificent prospect shutting in according to legend be due to malice of disinherited brother in jacobean time who have created quite village round about estate so a to block out view present inhabitant did not mind much for a mildred explained miss armour mr jarsell stayed within door great deal in fact miss armour be more le paralyzed sits in big chair day reading knitting talking playing patience said mildred a trio turned into small courtyard found facing squat door set in porch sufficiently massive to serve for entrance to mausoleum elderly maid in incongruous dress of brilliant scarlet admitted into darkish hall whose atmosphere suggestive of turkish bath in mild way hinted that house be heated by steam pipe a indeed be case there be carved box of black oak in hall three four uncomfortable high backed chair wall floor be bare general aspect be somewhat bleak however when visitor be conducted along narrow passage ill lighted dismal be introduced to large low ceilinged room richly luxuriously picturesquely furnished brilliant garb of maidservant suited room much better than did hall passage there be suggestion of tropical splendor about woman sitting room revealed in mr jarsell strong love of color warmth light indeed although there be three large window looking out on to garden immediately facing door by have entered yet light be admitted being insufficient perhaps because of wintry gloom apartment be brilliantly illuminated by six lamp three of stood at one end of room

scheme be of black scarlet yellow what with barbaric hue warm atmosphere faint scent of incense dan felt a though have stumbled on den of magician malicious dangerous may have only be impression caused by coming suddenly into tropical room out of chill air neutral tinted landscape mr jarsell miss armour however carried love of violent color into personal attire a be arrayed somewhat incongruously considering season in unrelieved white former lady be tall bulky somewhat assertive in manner with masculine cast of countenance watchful dark eye from smooth olive texture of skin have

wrinkled face be hue of old ivory feature be delicate small head drooped in rather pensive manner white hair not so plentiful a of mr jarsell be smoothly arranged under dainty cap of white lace decorated oddly enough with diamond ornament indeed wore enough jewellery for lady ring on slender finger chain round neck bracelet on wrist with belt of turquoise stone ruby brooch earring of pearl on le refined person overloading of ornament must have looked vulgar miss armour although glittered at point like heathen idol preserved calm dignity caused sumptuous display to appear perfectly natural be very strange that mild looking woman must deck out in manner so also be puzzle to halliday intelligence indeed two lady in splendid room suggested to dan dream of arabian night gave impression of being concerned in gorgeous romance miss armour seated in big chair mildred have mentioned looked over dan with mild brown eye evidently approved of good look be glad to see mr halliday said in soft musical voice quite silvery in sound to old person such a be young be always welcome dan felt called upon to pay compliment look old said bluntly well now day sixty can not be called old

in connection with probably said dan lightly be engaged to miss moon have police discovered who murdered sir charles be there chance that police will make discovery woman came woman went after doing work have vanished into thin air like macbeth witch wonder why murdered sir charles asked mr jarsell after pause halliday glanced at laurance be latter who replied in most cautious manner wishing to say a little a possible about quest reason be not known mr jarsell why began mildred only to be cut short somewhat impatiently by miss armour who have be moving uneasily talk more about horrid thing broke out impetuously want to hear tell of love affair mr halliday there be little to tell said dan relieved that conversation be changed in manner since did not desire to say too much of business in connection with crime must not tell little wish to enlist sympathy of mr jarsell have mine already declared old lady vivaciously why eliza mr jarsell can help indeed said that lady looking at hard in

out card after dan have shuffled used only one pack freddy looked on at disposition of colored oblong with deepest interest dan idly took up unused pack moment brought near eye to examine became aware that there clung to same mysterious scent penn have stated came from sumatra new a be to detective business yet have enough sense to suppress excitement at discovery seeing that ex secretary have

eyebrow in acknowledgment of compliment can have idea how kind be to to whom must be kind to old governess said mr jarsell in gruff way why have taught know must think miss armour must teach lot said laurance in pleasant manner know so much have such tact that must be out in world governing people miss armour sent sharp glance in direction a if to inquire exactly what meant then accepted compliment with charming laugh for dreadful paralysis must indeed love to be out in world love to deal with human nature make people do what want can asked mildred anxiously yes child replied ex governess quietly because base diplomacy on knowledge one with few exception be ruled by harp on string can manage one miss armour put in mr jarsell in deep voice rather talk of what must do than what doe here see few people go up to town on occasion very rarely must find dull said dan candidly for reason miss armour appeared to think speech amusing oh find life dull at assure there be always great deal to be done when one know how to set about doing a how questioned young man somewhat puzzled book music card game knitting work said mr jarsell quickly a if did not approve of miss armour observation nothing more quite so nothing more assented governess with sudden flash of brown eye directed towards friend here be out of world do stay long mr halliday only for couple of day until can get machine will get promise said mr jarsell graciously when trio arose to depart mr vincent owes too much to disregard request of course chimed in mildred uncle solomon must never be able to build aeroplane if did help with money good by miss armour good by dear child will say au revoir to mr halliday a will expect to come see again if only to let know that fortune have come true will do think yes said miss armour positively be quite certain that chance foretold by card will be given dan hoped must thanked lady for happy prediction after freddy with mildred between left weird house walked up darkened road toward village halliday went at once to peacock wishing to give freddy beloved chance of tte tte took readily enough a laurance escorted girl home be hour before returned to overdue supper mr pelgrin served with fierce grumbling after supper dan spoke mind to laurance when took up that extra pack of card said abruptly smelt that same perfume that hung about sir charles clothes when be dead what freddy sat up aghast in corner of room perfume about penn explained same did explain seems to that told lie if only have one bottle perfume be not procurable in england seeing be manufactured in sumatra how did miss armour become possessed of may not be same scent said laurance still aghast see bird in bush dan be not question for eye for nose tell freddy that perfume be exactly same why did not ask miss armour about did heard got from mr jarsell so said now where did mr jarsell get from sumatra perhaps why not ask straight out said dan decisively will not mention subject to mr jarsell until have questioned marcus penn once more told lie once by saying that one in country possessed especial perfume sha tell how do mean to get to tell truth asked freddy dubiously never mind have sort of plan sha explain until come off there be connection between perfume crime be certain concluded dan with positive air laurance wriggled uneasily oh be absurd on such assumption suggest that miss armour know about matter about what matter know gang well said halliday smoking thoughtfully be not entirely certain yet if such gang exists be theory anyhow in spite of letter drew from person other penn certainly explained scent told obvious lie since miss armour have say that know anything be strange that must posse sumatra perfume other people can send same perfume to england retorted freddy penn be sole person who have friend in sumatra mr jarsell since gave scent to miss armour may have friend in island ask said dan very positively will ask one until make penn speak out in case want to know why told lie perhaps did be jolly well sure that did then to put plainly suspect mr jarsell to answer plainly there can be connection between two harmless old lady living in wild murder of sir charles yet confounded scent form link between dead man mr jarsell penn laurance rubbed chin reflectively be odd to say least of suppose be certain perfume be same will swear to dan rose knocked ash out of pipe intend to learn how mr jarsell became possessed of may be on wild goose chase same with stake have ca afford to lose opportunity so miss armour said when told fortune commented freddy thoughtfully yes wonder what meant dan stretched be for bed ring bell ask mr pelgrin for spirit laurance not feeling called upon to resume conversation a be tired did a be told mr pelgrin raw boned grim bounced aggressively into room to demand fiercely what required sniffed when whiskey be ordered a consumption must increase bill brought in bottle of johnny walker siphon of soda without argument when turned to depart wished good night in tone suggestive of jailer sudden thought struck dan must not be amiss thought to question mr pelgrin concerning hermit lady not that expected great deal to result from exanimation a worthy woman be cat what knew must probably have to be clawed out of have tea at grange to day mr pelgrin said dan casually landlady wrapped hand in apron wheeled grimly at door to speak aggressively ho grunted what be said 'ho be ' be going to say well drawled freddy with shrug ca say much le know le much say anything retorted mr pelgrin screwing up hard mouth nodding nobody want to say anything remarked dan lazily on alert of course speech opened landlady mouth people say a be queer two lady must live like dormouse in haystack observed significantly be like people will meddle with what doe concern not snorted mr pelgrin violently epigrammatically say what must say for what must say must be what be right to say must inquired freddy innocently must sir be not to be pumped cried mr pelgrin try ever so hard so there screwed up mouth tighter than ever who be pumping asked dan coolly simply remarked that have tea with mr jarsell miss armour to day friend of yours doubt snapped landlady never saw before to day mr pelgrin then see again advised woman sharply thank for advice anything wrong wrong wrong what must be wrong mr pelgrin became more violent than ever there be nothing wrong then be right said halliday coolly goodnight mr pelgrin stared hard at evidently wondering why did not press question seeing how significant remark have made idea that conversation be trivial in eye hurt self esteem gave hint that knew something wonder how lady make money observed casually to ceiling ah wonder agreed dan making covert sign freddy must restrain question now on tip of tongue three motor car said mr pelgrin musingly four servant woman slut at do say with house like palace inside whatever may be to look at from road need money mr halliday quite so nothing for nothing in greedy world ten year have lady be here continued landlady exasperated by indifference a dan intended must be dull must find that old house to be sure miss armour be ill never move from chair so say ended emphatically stared at halliday so who say inquired phlegmatically one sir be paralyzed so say mr jarsell attends to like angel remarked dan suavely say that also know why do advise not to see lady again asked freddy who must no longer rein in curiosity halliday be annoyed by question a thought must dry up stream of mr pelgrin hinted information instead of happening became excessively frank well be way mr laurance said rubbing nose in vexed manner be two nice young gentleman want of to step in spoil george chance george nephew being son of late husband brother porter at thawley railway station mr jarsell have taken quite fancy to being handsome lad in way chance be will leave lot of money if two gentleman take fancy now know reason for not wanting to see again oh think mr jarsell will leave friend money said dan affably george pelgrin be quite safe suppose one good turn deserves what do mean said landlady sharper than ever well george pelgrin must have done something for mr jarsell to make leave money be done nothing say will leave money george think might seeing have taken fancy to want mr laurance here to spoil nephew chance oh sha do rejoined halliday calmly suppose george find dull at thawley station when there be sheepeak friend there with working at station be oh doe find dull replied mr pelgrin innocently have made friend with plenty of thawley folk be going away to morrow perhaps perhaps next day said dan wondering at direct question see wish to get aeroplane from mr vincent a soon a do will go back to london will be seeing mr jarsell again halliday shook head will be too busy to spare time mr pelgrin drew breath of relief again became fierce ai ashamed of what have said declared pulling open door violently can tell whole village if like bounced out a have bounced in leaving laurance overcome with surprise now what be meaning of chatter asked staring at dan oh be very plain mr jarsell have taken fancy to nephew mr pelgrin think fascination may spoil chance of getting money what want to know be what george have done for mr jarsell to warrant deep interest apparently take in evidently mused dan to there be not other sheepeak people employed at thawley station what of laurance stared harder than ever nothing only george pelgrin must be only person likely to know mr jarsell at thawley station there be motor car also remember really see what be driving at dan scarcely see save want to learn secret of perfume why form link between moon penn mr jarsell how can chatter of mr pelgrin help asked freddy more more puzzled dan lighted bedroom candle walked slowly to door before replied will have to sleep upon what know before can answer that said nodding good night old chap dan dan dan called out laurance who have heard just enough to make wish to hear more tell stopped speaking a saw that halliday be out of hearing be in very dissatisfied frame of mind laurance retired to bed next morning dan have evidently quite forgotten conversation of landlady for made remark although freddy tried to start subject again declined to revert to halliday declared that did not know what to say that be putting two two together a yet must not make four that must be just a well to seek mr solomon vincent to hear if be disposed to supply aeroplane only wonder remarked irrelevantly a walked up road with friend how come that mr pelgrin speaks more like londoner than derbyshire woman thought discussed question before replied laurance school board be doing away largely with local dialect also mr pelgrin a mildred told be in service for year at reading why do ask ask nothing said dan easily be only idea have connected with case yes with mr jarsell pooh see bird in bush dan so said before rejoined halliday drily why repeat hullo there be inventor added a drew near to cottage by jove be smiling mr jarsell have evidently spoken to be a dan said for vincent received young men with sour smile sat uneasily on face since be more accustomed to frowning however a be disposed to be amiable dan be thankful for small mercy expressed feeling loudly when inventor graciously placed at disposal aeroplane of latest construction owe mr jarsell much said vincent leading way toward shed so request must be granted here be machine mr halliday be very good of be thank mr jarsell speaking for must allow to have aeroplane said vincent sourly want to keep improvement to myself until make perfect machine oh will keep secret dan assured cheerfully a entered vast shed will share prize money with want win race prove machine be best be ask by way where be laurance remember left in cottage with niece want to marry sha said vincent with frown speaking on subject unexpectedly what be more since be newspaper man want to talk too freely to about improvement laurance can hold tongue rejoined dan somewhat stiffly trade secret be safe with so be machine ended to avert further discussion on inventor part yes said vincent forgetting else in passion of hobby began to explain matter biplane a see can carry enough oil essence for twelve hour flight wheel out added turning to quartette of workman mr halliday will try flight dan be only too ready a beauty of machine appealed to immensely especially when beheld in pale light of sun when be brought into open men wheeled out of back part of shed on to level lawn must serve a starting place vincent talked time in great state of excitement pointed out various improvement beauty of masterpiece plane be not exactly horizontal since vincent considered that gained more power by making branch at slight angle wing be doubly covered with fine canvas broad streak of crimson ran through white inventor informed dan be characteristic of machine sort of distinguishing mark a be said vincent improvement be that aviator must steer with knee on occasion gave freedom to hand when necessary engine be light powerful with tremendous driving power considering size finally steering seat bridge of airship a might be be fenced in comfortably with aluminium broad expanse of mica protected controller of aeroplane from force of wind be really admirable machine halliday be loud in praise to however maker paid little attention genius doe not require laudation talent doe dan inspected machine in direction tried steering gear ran easily saw that engine be well supplied with fuel tested a well a must various spar rope bolt then took seat in pilot box prepared for trial flight not that have be out before said vincent while dan gathered energy to start ready mr halliday let go workman ran machine along lawn dan set propeller going after lightly spinning along ground for distance aeroplane rose into gray sky like immense bird side glance showed dan that mildred lover be running out of shed have arrived just moment too late to witness start however have time to pay attention to terrestrial matter for capability be given to handling new craft up up went to considerable height with engine running true sweet then dived nearly to earth in switch back fashion only to tower again like hawk shortly be at lofty elevation travelling along at top speed in direction of ten mile distant thawley vincent workman laurance girl became mere black dot beneath earth slipped past at more than railroad speed once in vast space of firmament dan let engine travel at fastest vane of propeller spun a american must say like greased lightning halliday pulse raced almost a fast a joy of playing with death seized in delicate structure of aeroplane being soul controlling power felt like bird swooped in mighty arc in proof of mastership of sky in few minute be over thawley downward glance showed innumerable black insect running with excitement here there everywhere a machine be sighted dan dipped nearly to weathercock of parish church then slid out toward northern portion of town making aerial way with speed of wind thawley be soon left behind aviator hovered over wide country dotted with village intersected with stream rough with more le high hill divided many vale of country ten minute took out of hillshire flew over mild yorkshire moor air sang past on side of mica screen prevented breath being taken away everything be taut fit neat in right place engine sang song of triumph mingled with droning hum of screw below be painted earth above gray sky faintly illuminated by wintry sunshine between two halliday flew with swiftness of kestrel sighting prey dan be used to sublime excitement must control feeling otherwise must have shouted for joy must have be from point of view mere waste of energy finally reached york circled round minster then turned craft homeward in glee machine be certainly best have yet handled made sure that given moderately decent condition must win race gain necessary to continue search for moon murderess capture of a reminded meant marriage with lillian wonder young man heart beat high for be not easy to come by so magnificent aeroplane felt a grateful to vincent for building a felt to mr jarsell for procuring mastership of same left behind on lawn behind sheepeak shed stared steadily into gray distance shortly saw dim spot moving toward with swiftness of eagle larger larger grew until must distinguish aeroplane construction like delicate tracery against cloud in wide circle moved gracefully then like bird folding wing settled gently at very foot of inventor trial be complete success in way chapter ix mahomet coffin aeroplane acquired by halliday must be dismounted in three part so that must easily have be taken to piece packed for transfer to london race for moment prize be to take place within seven day dan wished to familiarize with machine a much a be possible in interval for reason decided to go by air to metropolis taking journey in easy flight with interval of rest between therefore arranged to send baggage back to town with freddy carried only small black bag containing absolutely necessary personal effect freddy did not object to plan a did not wish to leave mildred sooner than be necessary therefore dan started laurance remained behind to pas golden hour in girl society however promised friend to be in london within two day a halliday besides covering hundred sixty odd mile in short flight desired to practise aviation in open space of country before getting to capital be not needful for freddy to return to business until forty eight hour have passed arrangement suited young men very well vincent who be now a hot in dan favor a have be cold presided at start again again went over various detail in connection with machine be much dearer to than child must have be now that objection have be set aside by intervention of mr jarsell inventor be desperately anxious that dan must win race a such triumph must undoubtedly show value of new fangled biplane not that vincent wished for money even for glory very greatly desired to show other inventor that be master vanity being purely concerned with result of night day of meditation must only be gratified by actual proof that have conquered air not entirely be for vincent be far too thorough in genius to believe that rome must be built in day at event trusted that machine must reveal a best that man have yet constructed so far a be concerned halliday accustomed to aviation believed that sour old man have succeeded if win race wo be fault mr vincent dan assured a stepped into pilot box with farewell speech inventor expressed very well content did not expect impossibility saw that man to whom have entrusted darling airship be cool enthusiastic quality go far toward complete success be calm day with scarcely wind when dan began flight a biplane must easily attain sixty mile hour must have have difficulty in reaching london early in afternoon did not make straight for south circled gradually down to rugby where proposed to remain for night dawdling in air be five hour before alighted outside town feeling weary with strain on nerve for machine required dexterous handling determined to rest without much difficulty found friendly farmer who be willing that airship must be housed in empty barn for night when be safe halliday have arranged that one must enter barn sought out cheap inn on border of place to rest for night within watching distance of craft next morning after breakfast concluded to start again after visit to barn to see that be well returned to inn for hour be necessary thought to consider situation future plan wished for solitude to do so owing to fatigue have not be able to think much on previous night before sleep overtook plan dan intended to carry into effect when reached town be to force penn into confessing what actually knew concerning perfume have obviously spoken falsely a to being sole possessor in england since mr jarsell have given like scent to old governess yet why must penn lie in fashion unless there be secret connected with perfume desired to keep concealed assuredly scent have clung round clothes of dead man dan determined to force penn into confession must only be done by frightening greatly to carry out plan halliday wrote to man asking for interview when came a dan be certain must intended in way to inveigle into taking flight once penn be in air fear must be played upon to purpose at least dan thought so be eager to make experiment of course young man did not suspect mr jarsell of being connected in way with crime of sort still be strange that perfume from sumatra must form link between sir charles moon with penn intervening be also strange that mr pelgrin must hint that mr jarsell have secret have not said a much in so many word general trend of cautious conversation went to show that mr jarsell be not entirely open aboveboard landlady have wondered where owner of grange got money now why must so wonder unless have proof that said money be not come by honestly why also must in quite unnecessary way mention nephew who be thawley station porter friendly with mr jarsell to extent that there be chance of getting legacy lady of wealth make friend of railway porter without reason dan wished to learn reason in particular case by diplomatic question have ascertained from mr pelgrin that nephew be sole sheepeak person employed at station consequently must naturally be sole person who knew mr jarsell about therefore be not impossible that lady befriended man so that might not speak of visit to town yet why must not do so must mr jarsell doings be entirely honest then there be three motor car quite unnecessary number for lady to keep especially a according to own story went out little spent most of time in attending to miss armour on whole although suspicion be vague dan have idea mr jarsell doings must not bear light of day still especially since have procured biplane must not have troubled about rustic affair save for fact of perfume might be hoped to discover penn confession must show more plainly link connected mr jarsell with hampstead crime yet on face of very idea seemed monstrous dan scorned for folly a wrote letter to penn nevertheless something stronger than drove to post letter afterwards to get unpleasant taste of conspiring out of mouth young man wrote lover like epistle to lillian telling about capture of aeroplane mr bolstreath must come see start of race at blackheath wrote dan mere presence will inspire to do very best to win so much hang on gaining race a want money to prosecute search for father assassin then halliday left business for pleasure telling lillian that adored to distraction urged not to see too much of lord curberry finally declared that be hungering for glimpse of angel face now that be returning to london intended to call see despite prohibition of sir john there be much more passionate writing to same effect letter ended with sentiment of lively lofty devotion if man have written letter dan must have smiled at vehemence since scribe cast under miss moon dainty foot to be trampled upon a dan be author of epistle only regretted that must not say more ardent thing than have set down to such length doe passion of love carry most matter of fact of men halliday certainly prided upon being very up to date child of materialistic age believing in nothing must not see touch feel letter having be posted bill paid black bag packed dan took way to barn of friendly farmer found quite number of people before great door a news that aviator be in neighborhood have spread rapidly farmer did not wish to take rent for night lodging of aeroplane a have be guarded so carefully be housed so comfortably halliday insisted on man having recompense for kindness then with assistance of three four willing onlooker machine be wheeled out into meadow wherein barn stood be close upon mid day when dan started spectator gasped with awe delighted surprise when biplane like big dragon fly soared into cloudy sky willing to give pleasure since airship be not common sight in neighborhood halliday did fancy flying circled dipped towered directly over town before finally waving hand in farewell thin cry of many throat came to ear a sped southward be delighted to find how readily machine answered to motion of hand almost felt that be riding on live thing nerve energy so obedient be craft to will machine be like flying beetle plane motionless to sustain body like front wing of insect while propeller spinning vigorously acted like back wing to drive ahead dan have faint idea of seeing comparison of sort in magazine wondered if vincent having seen also have constructed aeroplane on insect line soon dropped conjecture to attend strictly to business be to reach london a speedily a possible very difficult task considering swiftness of vehicle be convenient that dan must know shed at blackheath where must house machine a lord curberry house be in neighborhood once on spot must be easy to have interview with marcus penn perhaps not difficult to induce to take air in loft space of sky neighborhood be well known to halliday for occupation of aviation brought often there have experimented with various invention at various time where land afforded room for departure arrival of machine therefore when reached london outskirt made for blackheath without difficulty brought aeroplane to earth stone throw from shed in question said great deal for capability of biplane that pilot be enabled to strike destination so exactly of course usual concourse of people gathered when great bird like structure fluttered down from sky dan sent messenger to man who looked after shed soon have vincent masterpiece safely put away under lock key a have be practising flying strenuously testing quality of machine be quite five o'clock before be free to do what must a distance from rugby be just over eighty mile must have arrived much earlier have wished there be need to do so need to accustom to handling biplane easily in view of great race when dan have given certain instruction to man who looked after shed be responsible for safety of machine walked across heath to comfortable inn where be well known a have put up at many time previously be here that have appointed meeting with marcus penn for next morning so eager be to come face to face with man wring truth out of that almost decided to walk to lord curberry house be two mile distant swift reflection that must hing until next morning since penn have to be coaxed on to aeroplane certainly must decline night run decided to wait black bull be particularly comfortable hotel landlady supplied tasty dinner therefore halliday took good god sent settled down for quiet evening after stroll to shed to see vincent creation be right returned to inn went to bed nerve speedily relaxed slept deeply until nine o'clock in morning a have invited penn to see at eleven have just time to take breakfast comfortably read newspaper saunter out to take fresh air before visitor arrived marcus penn have not improved in look since dan have last seen thin face be still yellow hair moustache still scanty appeared to be a nervous a ever when sat down looked apprehensively at halliday with pale eye passed tongue over dry lip seemed to aviator that penn conscience be not quite at rest else must scarcely look so scared when on face of there be need to do so dan however soon set at ease be first necessary step towards gaining confidence for unless be gained assuredly must not set foot on aeroplane how be getting along mr penn said halliday genially have cigarette something wet oh forget drink so early in day be glad be up to time a be just starting out on fly really remarked secretary eagerly must like to see make start be flying machine near at hand in shed over yonder on verge of heath said dan jerking head over left shoulder daresay wonder why asked to see mr penn well er be er did wonder trifle hesitated pale man again looked anxious have to do with literary ambition said halliday slowly penn flushed looking relieved on learning why have be summoned to meeting pleased that subject must be of such personal interest what do know of literary ambition asked doubtfully miss moon must tell said dan promptly be absolutely correct a lillian have long ago asked to aid secretary although have never troubled about matter until now yes certainly did tell miss moon wished to become novelist found sympathetic yes must be always be suppose said dan darting off at tangent that be comfortable with lord curberry oh yes assented man cheerfully have good pay little to do lord curberry be very kind have plenty of time to write story have have published sighed penn sadly have tried again again to get short tale printed so far without success well then know have friend mr frederick laurance who be on newspaper moment suggest that must send of manuscript for to read if approves of will see what can do a know nearly one of note in literary world oh be too good will be delighted same penn hesitated writhed why must do for be miss moon who be doing for rejoined halliday saying what be perfectly true asked to help suppose come sometimes to lord curberry house oh yes said penn with swift glance at uncle sir john miss moon mr bolstreath dined with lord curberry last week be afraid mr halliday added secretary timidly that will lose miss moon dan laughed cheerfully think so why must uncle be very anxious for to marry lord curberry who be also very desirous to make miss moon wife show curberry good taste said halliday rising putting on cap however be to be wife curberry sir john can go hang must not be so sure mr halliday said penn in mysterious manner when lord curberry want anything generally get be cry for moon just now said other man making pun moon be man property however must go off to start for flying practise be going to compete in london to york race next week come with see start a to story can send to at old address knew when be with sir charles will see mr laurance about be good murmured penn drawing long breath following dan out of inn be obliged to to miss moon mean be one who take interest in literary effort come along see machine got from inventor called vincent dan turned suddenly to shoot inquiring glance at companion occurred to that penn might have heard name since penn have perfume a well a mr jarsell who knew inventor evidently penn have not heard name for gave sign of knowledge hope be good machine said innocently weakly very good said halliday a halted near great door of shed clipper why not try fly with oh penn shrank back must be afraid nonsense man joked aviator while aeroplane be wheeled out usual crowd of onlooker began to gather a literary man ought to experience sensation so a to write about coming story will be full of flying machine airship be dangerous asked penn looking at delicate structure appeared almost too fragile to sustain one person let alone two not at especially if one doe do fancy flying will avoid if come with must like to have experience hesitated secretary be if will not fly too high too far will take across heath back again will keep within tolerably safe distance from ground be tempting quavered penn wistfully while dan busied in getting thing square please rejoined halliday carelessly satisfied that timid man be nibbling at bait ca stay here day slipped into pilot seat well well really think must like where be to sit in place dan touched spring pilot box of aluminium lengthened out so that there be room for two people be one of vincent improvement upon prided a vehicle must by adjusting closed in car seat two people one a need arose come if feel least fear of idle spectator close at hand grinned at penn pale face be stung into accepting hastily what must have rejected in cooler moment be not afraid said trying to steady voice with air of bravado stepped in beside aviator oh say gasped wonder dan did not give moment to change mind having captured prey intended to keep so set engine going almost before penn be comfortably seated in le time than take to tell aeroplane whirled along ground swiftly lifted gracefully upward penn gasped again glanced down at sinking ground where spectator be already beginning to grow smaller motion of biplane be so easy face of pilot be so composed that after first thrill of terror penn began to feel that flying be not such very dangerous pastime a have imagined wonderful wonderful murmured a great artificial bird glided smoothly through air go too high mr halliday will go high enough to smash said dan coolly be circling in swallow flight round heath now high now low now swift now slow have machine so entirely under command that be enabled to give certain amount of attention though not to companion penn gasped again terror revived smash oh almost shrieked yes said dan not looking since have to watch where be going speaking rapidly clearly same want to know truth about perfume about sumatra perfume told be possessed alone by be lie know be lie know anything more about whimpered secretary yes do out with truth said dan relentlessly if will drop overboard to smash like egg penn clung to seat desperately must be murder daresay must suffer accident will happen in aeroplane know be like mahomet coffin slung between heaven earth overboard mahomet coffin will go in few minute unless dan swerved machine tilted slightly penn went green with terror what what what do want to know wailed a biplane dipped nearly to earth to sweep upward in graceful curve who be mr jarsell oh lord know do have perfume also have anything to do with gang yes yes penn teeth be chattering sinking motion made sick what have to do with gang be be sign be sir charles murdered by gang know know oh penn screamed clutched again at side of car do false mr brown belonged to gang ca say dare tell if say anything will die will die if say what want to say said dan between teeth again machine dipped towered will tilt out swear if tell who murdered sir charles know tell cried penn desperately perfume have to do with society of people who who dare speak must be killed have said too much a be if reveal what have said will be killed also care be mr jarsell connected with gang know mr jarsell said penn sullenly although terrified face showed that be nearly frightened out of wit do belong to started dan when sudden action of penn took by surprise in endeavoring to frighten man have flown too low aeroplane be only six foot off ground preparing to swing skyward again secretary in desperation flung sideways out of machine a curved at lowest fell heavily on herbage of heath dan must not stop to see if be safe hurt soared aloft again to considerable height circling widely came sailing directly over spot where secretary have tumbled out in desperate endeavor to escape already man have picked up be limping off toward town a quickly a be able now said dan grimly to will have arrested for attempted murder be right chuckled although not entirely successful in endeavor to make penn confess chapter x mystery in anxiety to learn truth dan be perfectly willing to be arrested on charge penn might wish to bring against after publicity be what chiefly aimed at if gave reason for threatening secretary felt confident that man must find difficult to clear character certainly halliday have not intended to take penn life have not man be coward must have simply laughed at idea of being tilted out of machine nerve shaken by possible danger have given way have said much must have preferred to keep locked up in heart that aeroplane by dipping so low have afforded penn chance of escape at risk of rough fall must have spoken at greater length yet after turning matter over in own mind dan must not be sure of much halliday have learned gang assuredly existed perfume be sign of recognition amongst member who apparently followed other trail by scent penn declined to say if late employer have be done to death by fraternity perfume on dead man clothes answered question very positively also secretary have denied that false mr brown belonged to gang statement be absurd a undoubtedly be emissary employed to bring about death finally fact that mr jarsell used sumatra scent brought into connection with hampstead crime penn might say dan felt that have struck trail must end in capture of moon assassin breaking up of dangerous organization on reflection concluded that penn must have said very little more even though face to face with what believed to be imminent death have hinted sufficiently to show revelation be dangerous not only to to halliday for if gang learned that secret be betrayed be certain that death must be portioned out to man who heard a well a to man who spoke on assumption dan felt confident that penn must take action in matter must probably hold tongue about adventure if told of gang to presumably belonged must have to admit that have betrayed secret of perfume in case must assuredly be killed by unscrupulous associate death of dan a young man believed must follow also believed that by taking care of own skin penn must remove risk of vengeance following therefore be not surprised when heard nothing from penn of penn during day passed before morning of great race meanwhile detailed conversation to laurance that young gentleman have returned to town with regret since mildred vincent be not by side to assure of early marriage by securing steady income flung into journalistic work with redoubled energy working night day to gain increased salary be in office employed on political article when dan presented be not overpleased to give up even moment of precious time in fact grumbled wish must come after business hour halliday said testily oh fudge retorted dan lightly journalist have business hour like king be always in harness why do require to tell such elementary truth freddy have important article to write well then can write in ten minute so sha keep long laurance pushed away writing paper leaned back in chair reached for cigarette what be then asked resignedly dan paced office related adventure so see old son that perfume be of great importance a always suspected laurance nodded gravely appears so if what think be true must man have disclosed secret dangerous to own safety people will disclose anything when on rack replied dan with shrug aeroplane be rack fool really believed must tilt overboard therefore said what did say to save confounded skin if have not escaped so cleverly must have admitted more doubt from hint gave if be death for not to confess to because must kill be equally death for to speak if associate be prepared to murder for babbling however be now certain that gang alluded to by sir charles doe exist undoubtedly be got out of way since knew too much be pity did not reveal knowledge to durwin intended to do so be murdered before durwin arrived a know by way durwin be a keen a be over search met other day said that be hunting everywhere for evidence why not tell what have learned dan can make penn speak out penn wo speak further denied dan abruptly think a be dread vengeance of comrade durwin belongs to scotland yard have power to drive penn into corner so may be able to force confession think must consult with durwin about matter after race then why not before race doe not take place for couple of day like doing thing in hurry said halliday uneasily want to question mr jarsell see if know anything if doe be doubtful will assuredly refuse to speak so far see connection between gang forget perfume h be yes said laurance meditatively perhaps be right want to have more evidence before can give opinion since penn told so much be in danger from gang dan think not penn for own sake will hold tongue at event have not moved so far that doe say wo move must examine that aeroplane very carefully before race if be oh will do know machine thoroughly by time if have be tampered with will soon spot trickery well now have brought up to date with information will leave to work one moment be miss moon going to see start for york yes got letter from morning mr bolstreath come to aviation ground with lord curberry confound with frown dan took leave be anything amiably disposed towards rival everything be quiet a regard criminal business for next two day a penn made attempt to punish dan for fright have given halliday be much too eager over race to trouble about matter kept sharp eye on vincent machine still stored at blackheath so a to guard against tampering start be to take place at blackheath on appointed day five competitor be on spot surrounded by large crowd of curious people anxious to witness conquest of air amongst present be durwin who pushed way to where dan be looking over aeroplane aviator did not see lean keen eyed man until be touched on elbow be all right halliday asked durwin nodding toward machine perfect be beauty wo be fault if lift york minster before sunset what be doing here mr durwin did know that took interest in aviation take interest in search for moon assassin said durwin drily in low tone laurance saw related discovery be looking about for marcus penn intend to ask question may be on ground said dan glancing around since lord curberry place be stone throw away wo speak will make speak said durwin with grim look well hope will win halliday when return to town look up may have something to tell moved away with significant look dan must not leave machine must have followed a there be several question greatly desired to ask day be cold dry with few cloud good deal of sunshine so condition for race be fairly good wind be rather high that vexed aviator a art of flying be not yet so perfect a to control wind when be over strong however to go against strong air current must be excellent test of quality of various machine start be to take place at one o'clock competitor hoped to reach destination before five of aeroplane must travel at forty mile hour others at fifty so far a dan knew be sole machine must gather sixty mile hour speed if vincent must be believed aeroplane ought to travel hundred eighty odd mile if condition be tolerably good in trifle over three hour dan now having perfect mastery of biplane hoped to accomplish wonderful journey in shorter space of time hope have yet to be verified meanwhile having seen that be in order turned to speak to lillian who have just come up accompanied by mr bolstreath lord curberry be in attendance in distance dan caught glimpse of yellow faced secretary looking unhappy nervous oh dan do hope will win cried lillian who looked extremely pretty more than trifle anxious doe seem so dangerous to fly in such light machine be best have yet struck dan assured think be a perfect a lillian mr bolstreath elderly lady laughed cast side glance at curberry to see how took halliday complimentary speech well suppose can not think of anything prettier to say have heard of woman being compared to gazelle to ship never to flying machine mr halliday be very up to date in compliment said curberry with slight sneer be tall bilious looking man with pale blue eye thin lipped sinister mouth not at prepossessing in appearance although immaculate in dress dan laughed being confident that lillian must never marry spectre must afford to laugh young people said with emphasis go with time lord curberry meaning belong to past generation retorted other with flash in pale eye will find that in way glanced significantly at lillian mr bolstreath looked nervous miss moon be supremely indifferent did not care for lord curberry in spite of uncle advocacy have not slightest idea of marrying man therefore ignored a consistently a must considering way thrust into company without taking notice of passage at arm began to question lover about airship gathered quite stock of information before start curberry being ignorant of aviation be out of picture a saying go so fumed fretted looked dagger at dan took mr bolstreath diplomacy to keep in moderately good temper luckily laurance strolled up note book in hand a be reporting for moment greeted party gaily knew curberry slightly nodded to without word salutation in common with many other people freddy did not like man who be by mean popular character be splendid day for race miss moon said laurance casting upward glance at grey sky look forward to chronicling dan triumph in moment to morrow morning well old fellow slapped jovially on back be prepared for what jules verne must call very greatest journey of century century be yet young replied dan drily be only one hundred eighty odd mile have to travel considering that aviator have reached successful distance of five hundred mile race be trifle well said lord curberry trying to be amiable hard task for seeing how much lillian be taken up with hero of moment aviation have certainly accomplished wonder since santos dumont took flight of ten yard four year ago oh do know something about aviation lord curberry said dan coolly know that be dangerous mr halliday oh dan lillian grew pale knowing what spiteful speech meant think flying look more dangerous than be said dan with reassuring glance miss moon have come here to be mascot will wire safe arrival a soon a get to york said mr bolstreath anxiously oh one will wire cried freddy taking out field glass telegraph office will be kept hard at work night a sure a stand here mr bolstreath dan will be richer to morrow by if be safe will be content breathed lillian looked a though must have kissed dan then there in spite of presence of crowd lord curberry unsuccessful suitor scowled be about to make one of acid speech when authority arranging race came to declare that be ready for start already cinematographs be at work taking picture of crowd machine various pilot policeman drove back throng to distance so that aeroplane might have clear space to run in just a hour of one sounded start be made amidst breathless silence aeroplane ran along ground like startled hen sprang into air at various point eye of people from looking level now began to stare upward at diminishing dot towered raced for north zigzag monoplane be leading lillian have only eye for dan craft freddy gave field glass so that might get better view three of aeroplane bunched two circled away distance in wide arc of two one machine belonged to dan onlooker saw increase speed of propeller then like arrow from bow sped swiftly out of sight in straight line cheer rose from throng a vincent airship be leading by length lillian gave freddy back glass hope will come back safe said with quivering lip of course will laurance assured dan be one of most cautious aviator have there be always risk sneered lord curberry probably only brave man must take risk fly mr laurance a see be calm reply a curberry enmity be too paltry to trouble about well miss moon ca see anything more so suppose will go home miss moon be coming to luncheon with said lord curberry mr bolstreath also be very hungry said that lady pensively so say hallo interrupted laurance a clamor arose on outskirt of now fast diminishing crowd what be matter in interest of paper must see what be taking place with hasty raising of hat to lady left to care of lord curberry a pushed way toward commotion heard voice asking if man be quite dead fancied that someone must have fallen down in fit when broke through ring of policeman beheld durwin lying on ground with staring eye ghastly expressionless face sight so startled that caught constable arm what be demanded hoarsely be mr durwin dead durwin echoed policeman sharply do know gentleman of course be mr durwin one of scotland yard official wonder know that never heard of sir must belong to detective department what be matter with have have fit be be murdered said constable shortly murdered laurance stared at man in horrified manner thought flew to gang dan durwin be trying to root out be crime similar to committed at hampstead when sir charles be killed for knowing too much be there fly on asked reporter hastily see if there be fly fly policeman evidently thought speaker be crazy what have fly to do with matter here be inspector who be sent for time ago have better speak to sir laurance did so advanced toward soldierly looking official who made appearance in low rapid voice laurance hastily explained that prone man be mr durwin of scotland yard also handed inspector own card meanwhile doctor be examining body found that deceased have be murdered by having dagger thrust under left shoulder blade be quite dead must have passed away almost immediately blow be delivered inspector received uncompromising statement with natural surprise knelt down beside corpse to verify declaration there be doubt that medical man spoke truth for stream of blood stained back of durwin coat have soaked into ground thrust must have be made with very sharp instrument be undoubtedly delivered with great force who know anything of demanded inspector rising looking at awestruck face of crowd sharply slim lady like girl stepped forward be standing close to gentleman explained nervously be looking at airship a went away heard give gasp when turned at sound be slipping to ground be know did see one strike did how must when with rest be staring at airship going away gentleman be staring also think of course did take much notice of a be stranger to saw fall put in rough man something like navvy be crushed up against in crowd felt tumbling heard gurgle too heard young lady cry out then saw on ground pushed back folk saying there be cove dying did think be murder ended man shuddering did chimed in slim girl fancied be fit be sure be so crushed up with lot of people must have be surprised if have taken fit be must be learned inspector took name address of two who have spoken there be other people who have noted man on ground be sole one to see fall have a be almost caught assassin red handed be impossible to say who be guilty for throng be so dense one attention have be so earnestly fixed skyward on airship one must say who have struck down unfortunate gentleman inspector be much impressed when learned identity of dead man once twice have received official letter from durwin have never set eye on until beheld dead for laurance must not have known who be therefore questioned that young gentleman closely when body be carried by four policeman off ground to nearest place where must be placed under shelter what about fly asked inspector who have heard of question from policeman who laurance have first addressed remember case of sir charles moon yes woman who killed be never discovered remember about fly also remember letter written to newspaper of yours wrote first letter brought forth correspondence said freddy quickly sir charles have idea that gang of criminal be in existence invited mr durwin to house to explain before mr durwin arrived sir charles be murdered since then have be looking into matter believe that also learned too much think that gang mention have put out of way yes do be why asked if there be fly on be trade mark of devil fancy well there did appear to be fly on said inspector in uneasy tone same think idea be right moon be murdered because knew too much mr durwin have be got out of way for same reason at least think so however will learn more between inquest will attend mr laurance of course be only too anxious to find out can about dangerous gang must be broken up breaking up will be attended with considerable danger said inspector in very dry tone then noted freddy address let go laurance returned to office of moment hastily wrote description of start for london to york race after saw editor related what knew about death of durwin permitted to write article dealing with subject laurance gave concise account although did not say too much yet hinted very plainly that death of scotland yard official be connected indirectly with murder of sir charles moon remembering that penn be now lord curberry secretary that lord curberry house be near aviation ground freddy wondered if penn have be amidst crowd dan must have told that have be at present laurance did not know however have shrewd idea that a penn be connected with one murder be probably connected with other then freddy cursed for not having observed if there be special perfume hanging about dead man clothes a did not know particular smell of sumatra scent must not say if be one dan have traced to mr jarsell if there be scent at be worth while looking into matter to repair negligence finished writing article be very short then started for blackheath to view corpse again a be leaving office of paper telegram be put into hand proved to be from dan have be sent from bedford have accident ran wire rudder broke bone broken shaken by fall return evening to town will call halliday now wonder murmured laurance when read telegram if machine be tampered with after if so gang must be getting scared first moon then durwin now attempt on dan life by jove will be next idea be by mean pleasant one chapter xi on trail when dan looking rather pale sick presented at moment office late that same evening first question laurance put to be relative to accident be machine tampered with asked freddy in breathless manner second almost door be closed no be replied halliday sinking with tired sigh into nearest chair be making quick turn rudder gave way put too great strain on came fluttering to ground like shot partridge be few mile beyond bedford however have aeroplane dismounted packed away in village close at hand then after rest caught express to st pancras got wire yes fancied tumble must be work of gang not bit of bad flying be well have lost race man who flew zigzag monoplane have won though took own time in arriving at york dashed bad machine think have even though be come out top for time being be bit shaken feel sick night rest will put square why did go straight home get inquired freddy anxiously for there be denying that dan looked considerably fagged read about death of durwin in late edition of evening paper must rest until knew truth paper only gave hint tell what know laurance did so then handed halliday proof of article on subject be to appear in morning issue of moment supplemented same with further information went down to see if there be scent on clothes of corpse explained be still at blackheath know in charge of inspector there be perfume anyhow fly no asked that moment saw durwin stretched out on ground if crime be work of gang sign manual be absent same be work of gang truly believe remarked dan in grim tone durwin have be on hunt very probably since discovered death of moon first of have be watched one of gang got behind in crowd knifed in crush must be perfectly easy for assassin to slip away without being noticed since one be watching flight of aeroplane laurance nodded agree with who be assassin well said dan reflectively saw penn on ground deuce did cried freddy jumping up did be in too great hurry seems to much too nervous man to handle job belongs to gang insisted laurance sharply have a good a admitted that much by what said of perfume oh yes believe have something to do with association by way appears to be kind of joint stock company like one mentioned by balzac in story de treize oh hang literary reference interrupted freddy anxiously pacing office do believe that penn struck blow gang must have better men than to strike woman muttered laurance thinking of false mr brown however since penn be in crowd be plainly in secret of gang think ought to tell blackheath inspector about matter also inspector tenson who have charge of hampstead crime said dan after pause if penn be arrested questioned will say nothing a hinted must be killed if gave away gang so a must split when threatened on aeroplane certainly wo speak out if questioned by police have got enough evidence to prove complicity remember better keep silence freddy let police fog out crime alone meanwhile can look round keep eye on penn after argument laurance agreed to act a friend suggested be doubt wiser course to take action until absolute proof must be procured that secretary be member of gang also if penn be arrested organization might break up scatter out of sheer alarm in case villain must not be caught dan deemed best to work quietly until whole of scoundrel must be netted to do so be necessary to preserve silence thus came about at inquest on durwin nothing came to light likely to connect crime with preceding one hint given by freddy in moment be not taken indeed be laughed at there be perfume fly on corpse of unfortunate man consequently link between blackheath hampstead open verdict be brought in durwin be buried without truth becoming known in detail then new sensation took up attention of public nevertheless dan friend be convinced that darwin having learned too much have be done to death by gang for own safety in same way a sir charles moon have be put out of way employed private detective to watch penn gave hint that suspected in way through penn who be sole person knew for certain on evidence of perfume be connected with gang hoped to arrive at truth time be not yet ripe for questioning a regarded nefarious doings kept well in sight so a to watch path took in life there be doubt that by following same must arrive at gathering of dangerous person whose association threatened to disintegrate society a dan quoting balzac fiction have observed be ferragus fellow conspirator in modern setting dan having lost race consequently be short of fund laurance not being rich must not lend money however two managed to borrow certain sum from grasping money lender supplied sinew of war for time being halliday have vincent aeroplane brought to blackheath again made money in usual way by taking various people trip for short distance aviation be now quite society craze especially for lady desirous of new sensation so dan did extremely well few month later intended to attempt cross channel flight for french millionaire be offering large prize in meantime got along a best must nothing happened for week two likely to stir up muddy water concealed doings of gang there be new murder then dan took lillian to cinematograph exhibition made discovery of course lillian be profoundly grieved that lover must have lost race comforted with reflection that be safe have be able must have interdicted dan from trying further flight especially in face of many accident be occurring in connection with aviation over world dan however laughed at fear insisted upon continuing dangerous vocation nevertheless promised in moment of tenderness to give up aviation when lillian be married though at present affair in direction did not look bright a yet dan have discovered very little likely to lead to detection of moon assassin until individual be brought to justice sir john must never consent to match course of true love in dark day be by mean running a smoothly a pair desired lord curberry haunted sir john moon house pestered lillian with undesired attention until be openly rude to did not at damp ardor merely smiled acidly continued to send flower theatre seat lastly article of jewelry declined to accept always sir john be at elbow croaking out what lucky girl be to attract attention of peer with money title to say nothing of talent marriage must be ideal one lillian did not think so with obstinacy of woman in love with wrong person preferred to think of long for dan halliday more than with connivance of mr bolstreath who be heart soul with poor suitor lillian contrived to meet at various time enjoy not little on occasion be like child let loose from over severe nursery sometimes mr bolstreath came a chaperon sometimes knowing that dan be gentleman allowed to be together alone naturally liked much better on whole so that one might talk good natured smiling woman followed restless footstep to restaurant theatre matinee be even to cinematographs be at one of last entertainment dan received shock on particular occasion mr bolstreath be not with a have gone shopping in regent street appointment have be made by to meet lillian dan at five when trio intended to have afternoon tea in new bond street meantime a be only three o'clock lover have whole of london to day be rather fine so lillian proposed to go to unfashionable space of park where be not likely to meet with acquaintance dan be willing walked along piccadilly in leisurely manner then lillian stumbled on biograph theatre read programme when saw that set of picture represented aviation ground at blackheath start for london to york race nothing must serve whim that must go in see film dan be willing to oblige a also be curious to see in moving picture therefore soon found being guided by attendant with electric torch through warm darkness of hall to couple of well cushioned seat performance be continuous one picture repeating again again so lover arrived in middle of interesting story of did not know beginning anxious to see what have gone before lillian exacted promise from complaisant swain that must wait until repetition dan agreed reminded that delay must mean walk in park never mind said lillian slipping hand into under cover of friendly twilight can stay here until meet bolly in new bond street know adore cinematographs also hope insinuated dan to answer be friendly very emphatic squeeze a be usual with such entertainment picture be mixture of comedy tragedy so a not to dwell too long on one note lillian in impatient mood waited anxiously for aviation scene be in due time thrown on screen girl gave little cry of pleasure when saw dan tinkering at aeroplane gesture being faithfully reproduced halliday be greatly amused by resurrection of doings felt odd feeling at coming face to face with in way started greatly surprised for in front of crowd disproportionately large in comparison with rest of figure beheld massive form of mr jarsell moving across illuminated picture even paused to look round at someone in mob so have distinct front view of powerful face there must be no mistake a be singularly noticeable woman when finally passed away from screen sat wondering at odd chance have shown that have be on blackheath aviation ground on very day about very time durwin have met with mysterious death presence suggested possession of sumatra scent perfume in turn recalled penn ownership of same scent of dead sir charles moon clothes more than ever dan be convinced that mr jarsell be connected with gang therefore with two tragedy be perplexing justice be glad that have promised to wait for repetition when lillian wished to go after have seen start of picture have met half finished on entrance dan urged to stop witness aviation scene once more be so amusing to see one self in way said dan artfully lillian pouted wish must have be taken also said with sigh of pleasure willingly consented to wait second view convinced halliday absolutely that be right be mr jarsell who moved so royally across screen what puzzled be that appeared to be well dressed without attempt at disguise yet if have come to blackheath bent upon crime must surely have worn veil so a not to be noticed still mr jarsell living secluded life at sheepeak must not be known to one in london might not think necessary to disguise in way moreover if by chance be recognized through possible disguise thing must mean asking of leading question however there be doubt that have be on aviation ground when durwin be murdered dan determined to go same night to sheepeak make inquiry be very silent when at afternoon tea with lady lillian chattered enough for two gave mr bolstreath vivid account of animated picture companion certainly did hint halliday be not quite averted further inquiry by saying that have headache then took leave of pair went to see what train must catch to thawley being in so great hurry that did not even call on freddy laurance to acquaint with wonderful discovery thus halliday most unexpectedly found standing on thawley station platform few minute after nine o'clock a have left st pancras by six o'clock express be now too late to travel by local to beswick for when reached that place there be long hill to climb to sheepeak peacock hotel must probably be closed by time got to destination dan therefore decided to remain in thawley for night secured bed at hotel near station early next morning came to look for george pelgrin with whom wished to talk have difficulty in finding brother porter brought man to handing over bag halliday requested to be led to platform whence beswick local departed then began to ask artful question pelgrin be big bovine creature with sleepy blue eye slow ponderous manner argued small intelligence dan wondered why clever woman like mr jarsell must interest in creature to find out cautiously introduced lady name be staying at aunt hotel in sheepeak time ago said dan a george carried bag over bridge told that be quite favorite with friend mr jarsell of hall aye grinned george amiably that be sir come from sheepeak mr jarsell take interest in sheepeak folk beend for george ' say when coming to london put straight a like come to town pretty often expect said halliday lightly be better for pocket why said pelgrin thoughtfully go away much from sheepeak not even to come to thawley once in few month go to london to see thing ' say `` m going to look up friend 'george be after lawyer business day say oh be good to aunt marian be mr jarsell wish 'd come to london oftener ended george in dismal tone for give crown always come a often a 'd like seeing a want money ah be stay at home commented halliday looking after friend of hers miss armour be agreed george well have be good friend to said other man shuffling into first class compartment for got aeroplane from mr vincent aye said pelgrin know crosspatch be sir think so too mr jarsell promised to come to london see in london to york race heard of suppose aye that did said pelgrin mentioned exact date 'd heap of traffic that day folk going to york to see airship arrive mr jarsell be one of sir must go to york to london did go nowhere said george doggedly on day anyhow beend for george ' always say on day of flying race send for did not so stayed at home reckon oh dan looked disappointed did so want her to see flying in race pelgrin since got mr vincent to give aeroplane did see sir for never went to london on day early late swear go much away from sheepeak have be there to london be sir for month always tip crown ended george once more dan took hint handed over money there be hope mr jarsell will travel oftener so that may become rich aye need money being engaged a be said pelgrin with grin touching forelock went on explaining private affair have to do with girl until train steamed out of station dan be puzzled according to cinematograph mr jarsell have certainly be in town on day of race yet yokel swore that have not travelled from thawley station yet there be other route by must come of course according to mr pelgrin woman owned three motor must go to london in way there be just chance that might have done so dan did not know how be to find out must be use asking mr jarsell a must deny having be out of sheepeak yet since be wholly undisguised on blackheath ground why must deny identity might be that must admit having gone to big city say by motor must defy to credit with death of durwin not that dan must be foolish enough to accuse of same a have evidence to go upon save fact of perfume be weak reed upon to lean mr pelgrin might know something however to mr pelgrin determined to apply for information at end of journey when arrived in ramshackle fly be welcomed by a usual that be bounced out of inn placing arm akimbo smiled grimly oh so be here again said in exactly same way in have greeted laurance yes said halliday readily having excuse cut dried lost flying race have come to apologize to mr vincent for misusing machine only want mid day meal a leave again afternoon will have dinner snapped mr pelgrin leading way into inn after dan have arranged for driver of trap to wait for three four hour so did win race aye mr vincent will be rare mad with thinking what doe of kite make halliday sat down in well remembered room laughed fortune of war mr pelgrin be sorry lost race mr jarsell who got aeroplane will also be disappointed did tell about start eh man must lady like come chattering to humble body like be landlady reply a laid table rapidly not that saw race mind mr halliday oh must have replied dan with pretended surprise promised to come see start from blackheath did not go to london persisted mr pelgrin eye becoming angry at contradiction mind well because came to see about egg on very day be flying say 'it will be good day for mr vincent machine to win race be sure asked dan more puzzled than ever to find that story of mr pelgrin nephew be in accordance with one do take for fool cried mr pelgrin sallow face becoming fiery red be not telling again again that mr jarsell never went to see rubbishy race came here to get egg from sat in very room at nine o'clock little after take for liar oh will best see to dinner will lose temper sharp tongued woman having already lost bounced out of room mr jarsell be here at nine o'clock little after repeated dan in wondering tone then must not have be in london same swear saw on cinematograph here opened bag took out abc to see train from thawley to london examination showed that even if mr jarsell have left thawley station at nine o'clock exactly must not have reached st pancras until twelve five must scarcely give time to arrive at blackheath aeroplane have started in race at one o'clock according to evidence at inquest people have be looking at flying northward at moment durwin be stabbed mr jarsell must not have arrived on ground by one o'clock if only got to st pancras at mid day then to do that must have be obliged to leave thawley at nine o'clock according to george have not be near station on day if mr pelgrin be to be believed be in very room now occupied at hour when express departed be clearly impossible that must have got to thawley for nine o'clock train let alone being impossible have caught express must have arrived in london to execute crime by one o'clock trifle later yet on other hand be evidence of mr pelgrin nephew while on other hand be evidence of cinematograph one other must assuredly be wrong of course landlady george might be telling lie on face of there be need for to do so moreover a dan have sprung question on unexpectedly must not have be ready with false answer must have used motor car thought halliday restoring abc to bag yet even so be here at nine o'clock must not have reached town in three hour odd minute d mr pelgrin brought in dinner with compressed lip showed small disposition to chatter anxious not to arouse suspicion by asking further question dan began to talk of other matter gradually became more friendly told that have employed george have given crown since mention of money appeared to melt into civility more than did anything else mr pelgrin smiled grimly observed that george be grasping hound amiable speech did not argue that be on best of term with sleepy eyed man at thawley station after dan have learned indirectly must from sought out vincent cottage only to learn that inventor niece be absent for day a must frame excuse to visit mr jarsell there be nothing left for to do to travel back to town therefore found once more in st pancras station comparatively early in evening wondering be solution of new problem chapter xii amazing adventure next day dan went to look up laurance have consultation a be considerably puzzled over new problem did not know exactly how to act fate be against so far a having second opinion be concerned for laurance proved to be absent anarchistic plot of moment desired to know detail have taken to vienna be probable that must not return for at least week halliday might have expected something of sort a in prosecution of business freddy be here there everywhere never knowing next destination depended entirely on latest sensation hitherto few startling event have summoned laurance out of england dan have be accustomed to always finding on spot for consultation left office of moment in rather disconsolate frame of mind there be doubt that halliday badly needed someone to talk to about matter occupied thought failing freddy who be working with did not know one worth consulting anyone be whose advice must be worth taking certainly there be two inspector of police one at hampstead one at blackheath who be deeply interested in respective death of moon durwin must have be delighted to discus entire business threadbare in hope of solving mystery of two crime dan did not wish to bring police into matter until have more evidence to go upon after what knew concerning mr jarsell penn be vague uncertain while clue of perfume being so slight might be scouted a ridiculous by cut dried official what halliday wished to do be to establish connection between doings at sheepeak blackheath hampstead on evidence must not be questioned so that might submit complete case to police must not do until acquired positive proof desired to acquire same by own endeavor supplemented by of laurance therefore a freddy be away on business dan did not care about placing unfinished case before inspector went about ordinary affair waiting for friend return be that must do did reluctantly hint from lord curberry have evidently made sir john more vigilant a regarded niece dan called at house be denied interview wrote letter received answer although haunted bond street regent street park theatre must catch glimpse of lillian after three day of unavailing endeavor went to bedford attended to transfer of aeroplane to blackheath bringing up in train personally then put together again took short flight in vicinity of london after repairing damage done to propeller same heart be not in business of aviation at moment a detective fever have seized felt that must not rest until have solved mystery of two crime at moment saw way by must advance toward consummation of wish simply fiddled away time until return of laurance then after threshing out of detail hoped to make sort of move in darkness fate decreed that must act alone without advice intimation of fate intention came in form of short letter from marcus penn asking for interview be confident wrote secretary that from what threatened in aeroplane suspect of knowing something relative to sir charles be murder a be entirely innocent resent suspicion wish to meet in order that must be cleared away if will meet at booking office of bakerloo tube can take to person who gave perfume will be able to tell have connection with criminal then letter went on to state day hour of appointment ended with feeble signature of writer dan always thought that penn signature revealed only too plainly weakness of character of course intended to go even though remembered that penn have declared identity of person who have given perfume cousin in sumatra have sent same to secretary have said yet now proposed to introduce dan to person who be donor of scent unless indeed be possible sumatra cousin have come to england with intention of exonerating penn certainly penn might mean mischief might be dexterously luring to trap halliday felt that be quite equal to dealing with timid personality such a secretary possessed also when going to keep appointment slipped revolver into hip pocket to be used if necessary might be dan adventurous blood reached fever heat at mere idea that penn intended to introduce to brother scoundrel who constituted mysterious gang if so there be very good chance at last might learn something tangible concerning organization undoubtedly there be great risk of losing liberty if not life be impossible to say what precaution society of cut throat might take to preserve secret halliday be not of nervous nature moreover be willing to risk everything on one cast of die instead of lingering in suspense therefore got ready without saying word to one kept appointment indeed now that laurance be absent there be one to whom must speak chanced to be somewhat foggy night when dan descended to underground in trafalgar square out of darkness in light have difficulty in recognizing secretary be well wrapped up in heavy great coat welcomed young man with nervous smile blinking pale eye furiously a be custom when much moved however spoke amiably enough appeared to bear malice against companion notwithstanding threat in aeroplane be glad have come mr halliday said penn in must be dignified tone a wish to clear character from grave doubt cast upon when last met admission favored grave doubt retorted dan lightly spoke foolishly mr halliday a be quite upset by threat h be wonder to see trust again to such bloodthirsty being a be mr penn oh knew be only bluffing in aeroplane said secretary in meek voice with shrug mean took to escape further questioning showed that dry tone of dan stirred man chilly blood to greater heat have right to interfere with private affair said furiously when affair have to do with crime have not know nothing about matter penn breath be short tried to keep voice from quavering when see cousin will prove that gave scent oh then sumatra cousin be now in england yes otherwise must not have asked to come be to meet here questioned dan glancing round curiously can

arm of coincidence improbable usually occurs in real life not in novel mr halliday dan laughed watched street light flash past blurred window a taxi turned up haymarket wondered where be going a believed that penn must not give information carefully watched to see route companion adjusted silk muffler well over mouth with murmured explanation about weak lung then held out silver cigarette case to dan clicking open a did so will smoke mr halliday thank replied other cautiously for present care about penn shrugged shoulder evidently understanding that dan did not trust gift after time took out cigarette lighted match cigarette be of particular kind remarked blew cloud of smoke directly under halliday nose after readjusted muffler not only over mouth over nose dan started for whiff of smoke filled close confinement of taxi with well known flavor of sumatra scent be about to make remark when scent grew stronger a cigarette burned steadily with red smoldering tip felt suddenly faint pull down window gasped leaned forward to do so for answer penn suddenly pulled young man back into seat enveloped in cloud of drowsy smoke keeping own mouth nose well covered meanwhile with silk muffler halliday made faint struggle to retain sens control of muscle known world receded rapidly from seemed to be withdrawn into gulf of utter gloom last coherent thought came into mind be that pretended cigarette produced by penn be drugged pastil then effort to grasp undoubted fact that have be lured into skilful trap have shut down on used up remaining will power remembered more whither

yawning have be warned that if do death will follow immediately declared queen beelzebub human law can protect from have be said have thirty day to decide what to do a spoke red light vanished a abruptly a have come dan must only hear steady breathing of many people in gloom wondered how many member of devilish society be present at moment while thought be yet in mind felt that pastil be being held under nose drowsy scent stole into brain although tried to avert head almost immediately became again unconscious again fell into gulf of gloom remembered nothing when recovered sens be seated in four wheeler driving in unknown direction be alone head ached struck match looked at watch be eleven o'clock where did find asked cabman putting head out of window noticing that be in well lighted street friend of yours brought to cab said man saying be drunk dead drunk gave address be taking home clever said dan to accepting explanation without comment chapter xiii bold determination dan went to bed with aching head doubtless induced by power of drug have be used to stupefy sumatra perfume be evidently powerful useful a be used by society of fly not only a mean of recognition in form of harmless scent a soporific to bring about insensibility probably many person have be rendered unconscious by drowsy smoke taken to headquarters of infernal association there to become member where headquarters be to be found dan have not slightest notion a head pained greatly decided to wait until next morning before thinking out matter off on managed to sleep trifle be not until small hour true slumber came to be nine o'clock when woke then found head clear pain absent only evil taste remained in mouth after cold bath felt more although touch of languor remained to recall to recollection what have be through after breakfast lighted pipe began to think over late event a carefully a be necessary on alighting at own door have paid driver of four wheeled cab have asked question man be willing enough to answer halliday hoped by learning where cabman have picked up to discover at least neighborhood wherein headquarters be situated be difficult to think that unconscious person a have be must have be taken great distance along street road lane without attention being attracted cabman explained that friend who have placed fare in four wheeler have removed from taxi friend declared have broken down wanted to get home being drunk explained driver so shoved into trap drove off having address be to take to leaving friend to look after broken down taxi along with chauffer from explanation be apparent that on being removed from dark room dan have be transported for distance long short in taxi did not believe that same have broken down that friend probably marcus penn have hailed first cab saw on pretence of accident have got rid of in clever way be west kensington where exchange have taken place according to cabman story since have be driven indefinite distance by penn in taxi headquarters might be in hampstead blackheath ilford indeed anywhere round about london if not in heart of metropolis bearing be lost by clever way in return have be carried out now halliday scarcely knew what to do how to act did not dare to tell police a first sign of activity on part of authority must mean own death in mysterious way also must be found with artificial fly near wound odor of sumatra scent on clothes a dan did not wish to die therefore hesitated to make statement to inspector tenson of hampstead who be so anxious to learn secret gain reward in fact hoped that man must not come to room have be there several time in quest of information lest must smell sumatra scent dan found that have brought perfume away on clothes when examined be scarcely to be wondered at considering how powerfully dark room have reeked of odor certainly tenson did not know scent so well a halliday did although have experienced whiff of when examining body of sir charles moon might have forgotten smell while dan turned over clothes blue serge suit have worn on previous night found piece of paper in one of trouser pocket contained message typewritten in crimson ink be set forth in third person by le individual than queen beelzebub ran a follows queen beelzebub warns daniel halliday that not only own life depends upon secrecy life of lillian moon also must apply to authority in way recount adventure girl love will be put out of way afterwards daniel halliday will be dealt with at end of thirty day queen beelzebub expects to receive homage from new subject who will receive notice of time place fixed for ceremony remember quite charles first ring about last word thought dan frowning at threatening message scoundrel have tied hand with vengeance what deuce be to do be useless for to ask question a only answer must be nothing if moved in way likely to harm society ran chance of sacrificing not only lillian be bad enough that must be done to death might have risked so a to break up organization be impossible to place girl loved in so dangerous position queen beelzebub knew what be about when used phrase halliday be well aware that society have long arm that nothing must protect lillian from mole who be working in darkness clever deadly unscrupulous for next two day young man went about in dream rather in nightmare did not dare to see lillian to write to lillian lest member of society must believe be betraying appeared to have spy everywhere there be move on chessboard must make might not be detected yet must not wait passively for rest of thirty day since have idea of joining band have only asked for respite so a to think out mean of escape more than ever longed for return of laurance must trust consultation between two might evolve scheme by to baffle subject of accursed woman who called queen beelzebub dan wondered if be mr jarsell evidence of perfume seemed too slight link to join with deadly organization of course there be marcus penn who be member knew everything must not speak since ran also risk of death must betray too much still dan being in same boat under same ban fancied that secretary might be frank a confidence must not be abused now if must get penn to state positively that mr jarsell be queen beelzebub might have something tangible upon to work taking into consideration egyptian mask alteration of voice by mean of artificial mouthpiece dan believed that wished to keep identity secret always presuming that queen beelzebub be in question on assumption halliday concluded that penn must not speak out bothered for hour a to whether must be worth while to ask secretary question while still in undecided frame of mind received morning visit from laurance who turned up unexpectedly freddy in pursuit of business played pus in corner over world coming going from london in most unexpected manner reminded dan of when young man jumped up with exclamation at sudden entrance might have known must turn up anyhow said sitting down accepting offer to have breakfast never know where will be on given date must be always prepared for unexpected so far a be concerned heard be looking for when returned last night from vienna so came along to feed with halliday ordered man to bring in clean cup poured out coffee after heaped freddy plate with bacon kidney there be old fellow eat away get ready for long talk have heap to tell likely to be interesting about murder of durwin questioned laurance reaching for toast yes about murder of sir charles moon also mind smoking while eat smoke away

fumbled in pocket hang have brought paper meant to there be death chronicled morning dan sat up shivered of murder yes marcus penn time penn halliday dropped pipe devil picked up again wonder why killed told too much maybe said laurance drily anyhow gang have got rid of by drowning in ornamental pond in curberry ground might have fallen in suggested dan uneasily might have committed suicide out of sheer terror well might have admitted freddy thoughtfully from what saw of man must think be too great coward to commit suicide dan smoked in meditative manner suppose killed have killed said aloud after pause who devil who presides over society of fly queen beelzebub laurance dropped knife fork to stare hard at friend so have learned something since have be away several thing wait moment dan rose retired to bedroom while freddy pushed away breakfast thing a did not wish to eat further in face of halliday hint have taken away appetite in few minute dan came back to sitting room carrying clothes have worn on night of kidnapping still retained faint odor of fatal scent belonging to gang smell said dan placing clothes on friend knee laurance sniffed be sumatra scent asked h be tropical fragrance thought proved to satisfaction that there be nothing in perfume business always have doubt said halliday drily be lulled by penn lie reawakened when found scent at mr jarsell now know about matter place life in hand by telling be a serious a asked laurance uneasily yes serious to to lillian also read that journalist scanned crimson typewriting eye opened larger larger a grasped meaning of message where deuce did get demanded hurriedly found in pocket when got back other night where from from headquarters of society of fly there be gang then asked laurance starting very well organized gang presided over by queen beelzebub consort of gentleman of name who be god of fly where be headquarters know may be able to trace gang by said freddy examining typewritten paper if inspector tenson if tenson get hold of learns anything by way think can from paper life wo be worth cent will that of lillian might not care for own life care great deal for hers want to have consultation a to what be best to be done to save from devil well can depend upon saying nothing dan seems serious tell about discovery halliday did so starting with visit to cinematograph with lillian recognition of mr jarsell in animated picture then recounted journey to hillshire what have learned from mr pelgrin nephew so on face of concluded dan earnestly see how mr jarsell must have got to london did go by train must not have gone by motor yet be sure be on blackheath ground be puzzle admitted freddy drawing brow together go on have something else to tell rather dan detailed have taken place from time received penn invitation to meet in bakerloo tube to moment arrived at room again in four wheeler what do make of freddy asked halliday when ended relighted pipe give time to think said laurance rose to pace room for time there be dead silence man thinking own thought be dan who spoke first said what be uppermost in mind of course hand be tied said dismally dare not risk lillian life beast have killed father durwin penn because got to know too much may kill lillian also in same mysterious way know nothing said freddy anxiously do if speak well then know what will happen queen beelzebub saw that cared little for own life so be striking at through lillian 'the girl love say that message clever woman mr jarsell have on toast dear fellow ca be sure that masked demon be mr jarsell since did not see face recognize voice admit that mask concealed feature believe that spoke through artificial mouthpiece to disguise voice still there be evidence of possessing perfume play large part in gang doings also appearance in animated picture prof to have be on blackheath ground mr pelgrin nephew declare positively that must not have be there quite so mr pelgrin nephew may be paid to keep silence retorted dan in worried tone then miss armour if remember prophesied that must have wonderful offer made to if accepted must marry lillian enjoy large fortune well offer in precisely same word be made to on condition joined gang surely believe that paralyzed woman like miss armour have anything to do with business questioned laurance skeptically dan shrugged shoulder miss armour be friend of mr jarsell whom suspect certainly told fortune a heard mr jarsell may have told what to say knowing that prophecy must be fulfilled say that miss armour know about infernal organization a very idea must horrify mr jarsell may use poor woman a tool ca believe that miss armour know anything said freddy decidedly to begin with society of fly need useful people invalid like miss armour must be of use admit that miss armour be in dark replied halliday impatiently same prophecy together with perfume cinematograph evidence hint at mr jarsell complicity again false mr brown who murdered sir charles be stout massive mr jarsell be stout massive plenty of woman be stout massive asserted reporter saw false mr brown did recognize mr jarsell a person mr brown be so wrinkled for fat woman that remember thinking at time might be fraud daresay be positive in fact that face be made up while looked at let down veil hint that did not wish to be examined too closely if think that mr jarsell murdered moon durwin have evidence speak of must reveal to police risk lillian life own freddy must take for fool laurance shook head underrate cleverness see that be in tight place ca move with safety to miss moon yet if move what be to be done well said dan after pause have month to think matter out idea be to hide lillian somewhere under care of mr bolstreath then take action so long a lillian be safe be ready to risk own life to bring mystery to light be with cried freddy enthusiastically be good scheme dan wonder how miss moon be to be hidden though since society of fly may employ spy to find whereabouts oh member of society be spy be halliday answer although know how many member of gang there be penn must have told perhaps must have proved identity of mr jarsell with queen beelzebub be dead be murdered broke in laurance decisively be quite sure that because must prove too much for mr jarsell safety be got rid of oh dan looked up with smile then believe that mr jarsell know what to believe until more evidence be forthcoming said reporter impatiently miss moon hiding place where be best to place with mr bolstreath a guardian halliday reflected then made last answer freddy expected to hear considering circumstance at sheepeak with miss vincent declared dan be serious place under gun of enemy quite so there have be proof that under gun be safest place in case be in be sure must mr jarsell be person suspect to be will not foul own nest at sheepeak therefore will not dare to have lillian killed within stone throw of own house by daring gain be risk said laurance pondering can see so can everything be risky in business then there be mildred rejoined journalist uneasily really want to be brought into matter will be right freddy much safer for lillian mr jarsell wo have courage to hurt promised wife when promised wife be in company still if have qualm no interrupted laurance eagerly after can not be friend if mildred be willing when learns whole circumstance be will agree after if anything doe happen can accuse mr jarsell if be queen beelzebub will end career in jail think will risk that by hurting girl oh must never hurt miss vincent be sure must only harm lillian because have to be frightened into joining gang freddy daring policy be best in case will place lillian with mr bolstreath under mildred vincent charge under gun of enemy a say be sure result will be good sir john moon will make row if take niece away let retorted dan contemptuously can deal with fribble of man after lillian need only be absent from london for month during time must break up gang with without aid of police if will certainly be murdered like moon durwin penn have be on same ground that know too much daresay lillian will then be left alone sir john can carry out pet scheme marry to curberry wonder said laurance musingly if curberry have anything to do with gang in question think not have nothing to gain now have said freddy drily have good deal to gain when be barrister two life stood between title fortune two men looked at one see what mean said dan slowly h be of course may be member society may have cleared uncle cousin out of way ca be sure one thing at time freddy be going to see lillian mr bolstreath get to fly to sheepeak will have to reveal what know will frighten dan looked vexed gnawed nether lip want to say more than be necessary replied a for own safety le know of business better perhaps may induce lillian to elope with to sheepeak need not explain to mr bolstreath must know more well said freddy putting on hat leave matter in very capable hand so far a be concerned be going to blackheath to see about death of penn may get into house paused well asked halliday raising eyebrow well if curberry doe favor society of fly who know what may discover also truth may come out at inquest penn belonged to gang a know when wanted situation be taken on by lord curberry hint at much however will see will see with careless nod freddy took leave while dan changed clothes with intention of calling at sir john moon house owing to late breakfast long conversation with laurance be quite one o'clock before dan reached destination half expected to be refused admittance a usual especially when learned from footman miss moon be not in house failing lillian who have doubt gone out on shopping expedition must shortly return to luncheon dan sent in name to mr bolstreath with request for interview be best to explain situation to thought since time must be lost in assuring lillian safety chaperon saw young man at once when introduced into room where be seated be struck by worried air thought immediately flew to girl lillian asked anxiously be anything matter with lillian oh that girl will break heart with freak said mr bolstreath in irritable tone know that sir john doe not approve of going out by herself that retaining situation depends upon looking after closely yet have gone out without telling where have gone to well said mr bolstreath looking at think have gone to lord curberry house dan lip curled ought to please sir john be with sir john be in country for few day must not be pleased at lillian going to see lord curberry without being present why have gone to see man hate asked halliday perplexed be not lord curberry wish to see mr bolstreath hesitated suppose saw that mr penn be dead asked irrelevantly be in morning paper know be announcement of death said dan laurance came told well morning lillian received letter from mr penn written few day ago saying that if anything happened to be to go to lord curberry find important paper have left behind for perusal oh dan started to foot then penn have left confession confession mr bolstreath looked puzzled must have guessed that death be determined upon said halliday to loud enough for companion to hear perhaps truth will come out in confession what truth for heaven sake mr halliday speak plainly be worried enough a be over lillian escapade be anything wrong great deal mr bolstreath have to confide in in order to save lillian from death from death like father suffered mr bolstreath screamed oh what be what be must be silent about what tell of course will can keep secret tell tell panted if keep secret life be in jeopardy there be time to be lost must follow lillian to curberry house at once listen mr bolstreath remember word say be important then dan hastily related much that knew though not more than be absolutely necessary however told enough to make mr bolstreath almost crazy with terror keep head confidence said halliday sharply must beat demon at own game get ready come with to blackheath on way can explain think lillian be safe implored mr bolstreath preparing to leave room assume out of door thing yes yet if curberry be connected with gang think be hunting for penn confession may wo bear thinking of must go to lillian at once will work with to save lillian with heart soul body cried chaperon wildly then get ready come with at once said dan imperiously chapter xiv busy afternoon lord curberry be something of student great deal of man about town so residence at blackheath be ideal one for individual who blended such opposite quality pleasant georgian mansion of mellow red brick stood sufficiently far from london to secure privacy for study yet be sufficiently near to enable owner to reach piccadilly bond street club theatre easily when felt so disposed chief seat of family indeed be situated in somersetshire curberry not possessing sporting nature rarely went to live in country blackheath estate be not large consisting only of few acre of woodland surrounded by lofty stone wall wall tree of park so sequestered house that seclusion suggested situation in very wildest part of england in way therefore compact place suited lord curberry lived there for greater part of year when dan mr bolstreath arrived found that house have be thrown open to public so to speak be there be crowd at entrance gate many people in ground not few in very mansion there be not much difficulty in guessing that marcus penn death have drawn morbid multitude into neighborhood wherein have come to untimely end moreover inquest be to be held in house public desired ardently to hear if verdict must be suicide murder merely accident in case sensational development be expected since death of secretary be violent unexpected a barrister curberry assisted law in possible way have permitted inquest to take place in house instead of ordering body of unfortunate man to be removed to nearest mortuary one commented on kindness in respect approved of consideration for time being curberry be more popular than have ever be before a dan walked up short avenue noted disorganization of establishment made significant remark to agitated chaperon think that curberry will have much time to give to lillian better be be sure know what mean said mr bolstreath much flustered well penn must have concealed confession somewhere about house so if lillian wish to find must get rid of curberry somehow must be wise of to tell ask to assist in search suggested lady if penn wished curberry to see confession must have given to for delivery to lillian doe want curberry to see what have written h be dan reflected that have used present tense forgot that poor chap be dead surely mr bolstreath voice sank to horrified whisper surely think that lord curberry have anything to do with horrible people have be telling about say nothing because know nothing for certain be only suspect er well that curberry may be in swim now go give away show by changing manner toward man continued halliday hastily act a have always acted indeed want to make a agreeable a possible take away if can leave alone with lillian for what reason well if curberry be mixed up in shady business will not leave lillian alone may wonder probably doe at unexpected presence here on day of day therefore may suspect confession by secretary will keep eye open oh go too far cried mr bolstreath fanning with handkerchief perhaps do assented dan in very dry tone in case like be just a well to take necessary precaution in case curberry will haunt lillian footstep until be out of house if only to find out why paid unnecessary visit can ask said chaperon curtly wo if be what suspect to be there may be accusing man wrongfully be sure be lord curberry be perfect gentleman perfect gentleman have be discovered doing shady thing before now however know what comedy have arranged have come to fetch lillian back came to escort then get curberry away on pretext let have ten minute talk with lillian understand yes gasped mr bolstreath like thing one ca touch pitch without being defiled quoted dan cynically a arrived at open hall door wish to see lord curberry last question be addressed to footman who came to meet recognized mr bolstreath a having be in house before with miss moon so readily explained that young lady be with master in drawing room everything be so upset with inquest that never thought of asking for card so conducted visitor to where lord curberry be entertaining girl having announced name fairly pushed into room footman departed in hurry a there be much excitement amongst servant wished to hear be being said have not curberry be attending to lillian must have kept better order a be severe master expected decency under circumstance doubt also be disturbed by unusual invasion of house dear lillian cried mr bolstreath in large capital advancing toward end of room where lillian be seated looking uncomfortable dear lillian glared at lord curberry gentleman have evidently be pressing suit proceeding sufficiently explained miss moon discomfort be a cadaverous a ever in look pale blue eye thin lip general sneering expression struck dan afresh a uncommonly unpleasant man flushed to brick red under mr bolstreath glare hastened to excuse be not to blame assure said hurriedly blame echoed lillian with thankful glance at sight of lover why do say 'blame ' lord curberry ask said mr bolstreath plumping down indignantly when go away without knowledge to pay unauthorized visit to bachelor if thought that lord curberry be not to blame said that gentleman again with scowl for did not like to stand on defensive of course be remarked miss moon easily with glance at dan to point word saw in paper poor mr penn be dead a have be dear father secretary came on impulse of moment to learn exactly what have happened curberry nodded acquiescence have explained circumstance to miss moon will explain matter to mr bolstreath a for mr halliday frowned at dan know why have come to escort at request said mr bolstreath coldly be necessary for to call here take lillian home why did come asked again to hear about mr penn repeated lillian rather crossly have be telling so for last few minute be curious about penn death myself said dan agreeably did commit suicide curberry wheeled at word why must commit suicide demanded with suspicion written on line of clean shaven face dan shrugged shoulder be sure ca say answered good humoredly only man in good health be found drowned unless have reason to get into pond penn be not in good health said curberry sharply be always complaining did work so badly that intended to give notice perhaps committed suicide because did did not tell to go after ca say that did kill be all right at luncheon yesterday be when last set eye on went to town returned at five o'clock to hear that be dead one of servant walking in park found body in ornamental water at bottom of garden did one push in asked mr bolstreath think not be on good term with servant although not popular in way one in employment must have murdered a gate be closed one called between luncheon five o'clock yesterday be quite certain that be not murdered by stranger in fact believe be murdered at suicide then suggested dan once more again curberry looked at unpleasantly a if not relishing idea so far a saw have intention of committing suicide said in cold manner however evidence at inquest will settle matter expect did look where be going fell in said lillian suddenly mr penn be always absent minded know frequently found so remarked curberry grimly made great mess of work occasionally be inclined to agree with miss moon well said dan after pause let settle that penn fell in by accident until hear verdict of jury when doe inquest take place in hour responded host glancing at watch be just impressing upon miss moon necessity of returning home when arrived have to be present of course so a to state what know of penn will give good character asked halliday pointedly curberry stared in supercilious way best of character said have fault to find with save that be absent minded quality doubt account for death poor chap well well be very sad said mr bolstreath in matter of fact way talking will not bring poor man back lillian child must go home now that curiosity be satisfied first will ask lord curberry to give of hot house flower see yonder nodded toward conservatory must be entered from drawing room by mean of french window oh will be charmed said curberry with alacrity perhaps miss moon will come also to choose flower can wait here replied lillian carelessly have confidence in mr bolstreath choice curberry scowled at dan for understood well enough that lillian wished to remain with rival however must make further objection without appearing rude so moved reluctantly toward conservatory beside chaperon yet dan saw plainly that be determined not to lose sight of two for plucked flower be directly in front of french window thus must gain view of young couple now then when facing round to speak with mr bolstreath lillian noticed espionage also whispered to dan who have sauntered across room close to elbow wo let out of sight said lillian rapidly ca get to library although have be trying time why do wish to get to library asked dan in low voice lillian rose suddenly dropped piece of paper put foot on pick up when be not looking said swiftly hush be coming back then raised voice a curberry

be waiting for lord curberry said dan will show into library please suspecting nothing wrong impressed by dan cool manner butler conducted to room in question after intimating that must tell lordship departed closing door halliday ran eye round shelf extended on three side of large compartment from floor to ceiling seemed impossible to find book be in search of in so short space of time a must probably be at disposal wished that penn have indicated position of gibbon masterpiece however halliday by stroke of luck suddenly realized that curberry numbered shelf alphabetically catalogued book so to speak by initial letter of author name beginning with be placed on shelf ticketed with letter a allison allen anderson so on while shelf b contained browning bronte burn others going by way of finding whereabouts of book dan discovered gibbon decline fall on shelf g laid hand on second volume a luck must have lord curberry suddenly entered room just a be about to open halliday looked up retaining volume in hand be rather surprised to see here mr halliday said curberry in cold haughty tone know that be busy with inquest have time for conversation besides looked hard at visitor must have explained business out of door not in presence of lady said dan promptly however wo keep more than five minute wondered how be to secure confession without knowledge of host be waiting to hear what have to say said curberry throwing lean figure into chair have be making at home added with sneer glancing at book dan laid on table took up gibbon second volume just to pas time said carelessly apologize if think presuming think anything rejoined curberry with shrug except be anxious to know why desire private conversation be about lillian miss moon if please lillian to lord curberry nothing of sort sir cried other suitor furiously pale eye grew angry sir john moon wish to marry niece probably niece wish to marry that will never do oh think so what wish to say lord curberry be that annoy miss moon with attention must cease how dare how dare how dare dare anything where lillian be concerned retorted halliday again in careless manner took up book leaning against table crossing leg a did so leave house cried curberry starting to foot for nonchalant behavior irritated greatly oh willingly simply stayed to warn that lillian must not be annoyed by in way if obey sneered other quivering with rage will make unpleasant lord curberry do know to whom be speaking well said dan slowly with keen glance at angry face be not quite sure be not asmodeus to unroof house know curberry yellow face suddenly became white lip trembled nervously understand scarcely understand wait interrupted curberry a knock came to door there be need to let one overhear conversation come in cried aloud butler entered be wanted at inquest lord said a curberry face be bent inquiringly on of servant dan seized opportunity to slip stiff sheaf of paper out of gibbon volume a matter of fact be three four sheet joined at corner by brass clasp scarcely have got in hand when curberry wheeled after hurriedly telling butler that must come shortly what have there demanded host advancing menacingly paper of mine said dan preparing to put sheet into pocket be lie must have taken from table out of book mr halliday yes be sure did give what have taken said dan retreating before curberry advance be not to before must get word man flung forward made snatch at paper held loosely by corner clasp flew into kind of fan curberry managed to grip one two of sheet in momentary struggle be torn away then owner of house released suddenly next moment have flung sheet into fire apparently thinking have got dan cleverly thrust one two remaining sheet into pocket played part of man who have be robbed how dare destroy paper cried indignantly be mine said curberry gasping with relief now be burnt be penn retorted halliday sharply perhaps be why have be destroyed by what do mean what do mean never mind think understand swear in case said dan slowly can make public fact came into library to find document in second volume of gibbon be placed there by marcus penn wo lord curberry if paper be not destroyed must place before coroner at once said curberry wiping face with glance at fire on fluttered few black shred remained of what have thrown in think must be mad to talk a do if be why not make matter public asked dan drily care about scandal said curberry loftily well halliday retreated to library door perhaps death of penn will be scandal enough paper doubtless contained account of reason led to death be sorry burnt then said curberry in studied tone of regret be impulsive man mr halliday must not have annoyed in way did how did know that paper be in second volume of gibbon never mind be addressed to never mind be about never mind d sir how dare good day lord curberry interrupted dan walked out of room leaving host looking picture of consternation dread chapter xv absolute proof did not require particularly clever man to guess that lord curberry be connected with society of fly have be entirely ignorant of association must not have displayed such agitation when saw paper in dan hand must have struggled to gain possession of much le have destroyed penn certainly be one of gang on account probably curberry have engaged a secretary after death of moon also may have have suspicion that penn be traitor have guessed that paper betrayed society otherwise must have placed same before coroner so a to elucidate reason why secretary have be done to death that have be halliday be quite convinced a penn be too nervous man to commit suicide must have be assisted out of world by other person verdict of suicide have be brought in argued laurance when dan related adventure daresay curberry evidence be to effect that penn have be considerably worried of late of course be true must have killed will swear however dan chuckled have sheet two remaining of confession may learn much from will state that curberry belonged to queen beelzebub gang think so if curberry doe not must have made row kicked out of house have business in library right to take paper know defied curberry to create scandal left in pleasing state of uncertainty a to what knew what intended to do be green with fright have better take care dan society will murder warned laurance in uneasy tone oh be safe enough for given month returned halliday positively so far have said nothing until ify authority will be well with miss moon join mr bolstreath at st pancras evening to catch six o'clock express to thawley have written to miss vincent yes there be time to receive reply be aware that lady will stay at peacock hotel sheepeak under wing of mr pelgrin only hope added freddy emphatically that be doing right in placing miss moon in lion mouth under gun of enemy said before oh yes be right especially that now hold part of penn confession will contrive to let mr jarsell know do that if anything happens to lillian can make hot for doe confession implicate mr jarsell yes doe have not have time to decipher crooked writing of late friend intend to do so when in train evening little saw hinted that mr jarsell be in swim wish must leave confession with said laurance who be desperately anxious to know exact truth ca dear fellow have time to let read even if have on have taxi be at door of office be off to st pancras in five minute remember freddy that confession be sole weapon to protect lillian when mr jarsell learns have will not dare to move will keep subject off grass also curberry will tell that have destroyed confession so think chuckled halliday will tell rescued enough of to damn precious gang how can tell without danger will find way although have formulated scheme a yet perhaps will ask what story of queen beelzebub know have to do with will reply that have nothing to do with that know desire to assist in love affair oh will manage somehow old son may be certain good by wait moment said laurance following dan to door what about sir john moon will make row over lillian flight will get into trouble may make row if like a lillian be under wing of mr bolstreath duly appointed chaperon see what can say be quite ready to take blame of course said laurance thoughtfully sir john may belong to society in case like curberry dare not make row rejoined dan positively believe sir john belongs to gang wish did a must smooth thing curberry dare not make open trouble because be one of queen beelzebub subject sir john may because be however will risk taking lillian away with mr bolstreath to play part of dragon sir john can do what jolly well like luckily be in country on visit just now so can get clear away without fuss by way be at inquest be there fly found on penn body be there mention of scent man be drowned be not possible for scent fly to be on corpse clothes evidence clearly pointed to suicide h be curberry brought that about said dan grimly however be jolly well sure that penn be murdered by one of gang not by curberry be away at time of death perhaps 'd like to be certain of in case may have others of gang in employment who must polish off traitor queen beelzebub subject be of class well be off halliday took way to st pancras forthwith found mr bolstreath charge waiting for lillian be greatly excited curious a did not yet know reason for sudden trip northward instructed by dan chaperon have refused to impart knowledge a young man intended to tell girl everything when be in train however miss moon be enjoying unexpected journey have faith in companion also so long a be in dan company did not care where went why went when went loved halliday too completely for there to be room for distrust in mind dan said mr bolstreath when be stepping into first class compartment halliday have wired to reserve to have written to sir john saying that lillian required change be taking to hillshire to see friend of mine when have explanation will not make trouble even inquiry have trust in good said dan heartily make excellent conspirator conspirator echoed lillian gaily now what doe mysterious word mean dan be quite in dark will know before get to thawley make comfortable do stay at thawley asked girl arranging rug for night have telegraphed engaging room for mr bolstreath at best hotel to morrow go to sheepeak where be that mile from thawley must live quietly for short time lillian be immensely exciting of course cried miss moon petulantly must like to know what mean patience patience said dan in teasing tone little girl must be content to wait by jove be off long train glided out of station gathering impetus a left light of london behind mr bolstreath made comfortable in one corner of compartment lillian did same in corner while dan sat on opposite seat addressed conversation to impartially girl must scarcely restrain impatience so anxious be to learn reason for unexpected journey now dan now cried clapping hand there be stop until bedford so have plenty of time to hear story one minute said halliday who be now in possession of three sheet of foolscap have rescued from curberry grip must bring story up to date can not do so until read statement by way lillian why must send to about matter be sure know of course knew how grieved be over father murder perhaps wished to set mind at rest dan looked at curiously why must think that penn knew of anything likely to set mind at rest on point lillian cast down eye thoughtfully always thought that mr penn knew much more than must confess about poor father death quite forgot that thought so until got letter asking to look into second volume of gibbon 'decline fall ' in lord curberry library dear murmured girl folding hand how did try to get into library curberry must not let think be puzzled why wished to go did not ask question quite believe that said dan grimly asking question be dangerous game for to play however when found in library evidently recalled desire to go there flashed across that be working in consort wonder destroyed paper on chance that penn might have left incriminating evidence behind know what be talking about said lillian fretfully well observed dan smoothing out foolscap penn doubt left clue a to whereabouts of confession to so that might learn who murdered father ah always believed mr penn knew be name in paper asked eagerly leaning forward may may not be dear see greater part of confession be destroyed by lord curberry be afraid dan lillian caught lover hand think that lord curberry killed father said halliday quickly be sure did not however will hear know laurance know mr bolstreath be acquainted with only let read few sheet first girl on fire with curiosity must have objected that mr bolstreath touched shoulder significantly with effort to restrain curiosity be creditable considering circumstance nestled into corner of carriage while dan glanced through manuscript in spite of penn crooked handwriting be very bad indeed did not take much time for young man to master content of confession uttered exclamation of vexation when reached end like serial story break off at most interesting part said crossly however have learned something what have learned demanded mr bolstreath immediately in good time said halliday quietly must first tell lillian what know then can bring discovery up to date by saying what be in confession tapped breast pocket wherein have placed sheet now then lillian now then dan mocked just tell for can not keep silence longer will have to if desire to hear story only be worried by what be about to tell be safe with lillian shrugged shoulder a if to imply that there be need for to state plain truth looked at with inquiring eye a appeared to be brave collected dan have hesitation in relating to that have already told mr bolstreath thus girl became thoroughly informed of underhand doings have taken place since death of father a halliday explained eye became larger rounder more shining still color did not leave cheek although be intensely interested did not display fright be creditable to courage considering that revelation hinted at many possible danger to herself to lover dan brought story up to time started from london then waited to hear opinion be dreadful wonderful very horrid said lillian drawing deep breath do think that mr penn murdered father evidence of girl to whom be dictating letter to be typewritten prof that did not enter library at time when death be supposed to have taken place then lord curberry believe lord curberry directly indirectly have anything to do with matter said dan decisively sir charles approved of suit rather than of mine so be to curberry interest to keep father alive well dear be false mr brown who killed sir charles came a agent of ghastly society of fly because got to know too much about association then mr brown be mr jarsell asked mr bolstreath anxiously ca be sure of said young man thoughtfully of course sole evidence prof mr jarsell to be connected with gang be presence of sumatra scent in hillshire house presence on blackheath ground when durwin be murdered by own showing must not have reached london in time be quite true yet recognized plainly enough on day lillian saw animated picture however can leave fact alone for moment be certain that mr jarsell be queen beelzebub for penn say a much tapped breast pocket again oh cried lillian eagerly what doe confession say will give gist of replied halliday quietly penn begin with statement of early life be son of clergyman mother be still alive from public school went to cambridge thence to london where tried to make living by literature not being clever did not succeed fell into low water be bound to say that did not trouble much about own poverty seemed to be greatly concerned on account of mother who be badly off so say then be tempted fell poor devil who tempted demanded mr bolstreath young man whom met when be staying in bloomsbury boarding house very hard up man said that belonged to society must make member rich proposed to introduce penn be done in same way presume in be taken to mysterious headquarters first fruit of penn connection with queen beelzebub be that sir charles moon engaged a secretary so getting good salary be enabled to give mother many comfort lillian looked alarmed father did not belong to association of course did penn be placed a secretary business be managed through curberry who doe belong to gang so that might inveigle sir charles into becoming member penn appears to have lost nerve did not dare to persuade sir charles so person be put on to business name be not given why did queen beelzebub wish father to belong to gang asked lillian with natural perplexity reason be plain dear sir charles be influential man must be of great service to association learned enough to show what dangerous organization existed then sent for mr durwin who belonged to new scotland yard so that might reveal what knew penn learned since saw letter written by father lillian at once told society then false mr brown be sent to stop sir charles dan made eloquent gesture with hand there did not seem to be much need of further explanation mr brown undoubtedly murdered sir charles commented mr bolstreath in thoughtful way be mr jarsell penn say a much repeated dan who have made same remark earlier be just at point end listen will read last sentence halliday took paper from pocket three sheet be intact a curberry did only rend away remainder from brass clasp at end of third page halliday read mr jarsell of grange hillshire can explain how mr dan broke off with frown here come to end of page can learn more curberry burnt most important part of confession doubtless gave full detail of mr jarsell connection with gang must explain about mr brown suppose said lillian quietly yes first word over page be be certain brown what be more believe mr jarsell mr brown be one same if see mr jarsell may recognize dan saw false mr brown remember be because of that be admitted to interview with father if do recognize doubt must not let on know who really be dan warned girl business just now until get more evidence be to pretend entire ignorance of thing be up in hillshire for change of air lillian know nothing mr jarsell relying on clever way in be disguised will never dream that connect with poor woman who came on fatal night to see father understand quite put in mr bolstreath before girl must speak will see that lillian act part of knowing nothing remember deal with extraordinarily clever woman mr bolstreath be woman also so diamond can cut diamond dan asked lillian timidly do think that mr jarsell really did murder father on what evidence have believe did murdered father durwin because knew too much must not be surprised to learn in spite of verdict at inquest that got rid of penn why must penn let out too much to explained dan putting away confession in case be weak sort of chap who be source of danger to society queen beelzebub who be believe mr jarsell evidently thought be best to silence be sure that penn did not commit suicide be drowned by mr jarsell still in absence of further evidence can hing what action will take now asked mr bolstreath quickly before leaving thawley to morrow morning said halliday after pause will post confession to laurance tell to make use of only must hear that anything happens to to chimed in lillian looked trifle nervous dear nothing can happen to said dan decidedly cheek by jowl a be with mr jarsell be perfectly safe queen beelzebub confines doings to london keep name of mr jarsell clean in hillshire for obvious reason grange be place of refuge one must connect innocent country lady with criminal doings in london if be what think to be will not hurt hair of head in hillshire same intend to see said lillian determinedly there be reason that must may call try to learn why be staying at peacock hotel if so will probably ask to grange go ended dan emphatically of course not put in mr bolstreath equally decisive leave to since be responsible for lillian can say that be ill with nerve consumption something said girl vaguely want to meet woman if murdered father if do said dan impressively reveal suspicion then went on to instruct two lady how be to behave in enemy country that be safe there so long a pretended ignorance dan did not doubt must mr jarsell learn that knew so much about might adopt counsel of despair strike did not do to drive so dangerous woman into corner for rest of journey very little be said subject have be thoroughly threshed out lillian have be informed of what be going on plan have be made for future girl be to live at peacock see miss vincent chat with mr pelgrin take walk admire country to conduct generally a one who came simply for change of air if did not go to grange on plea of illness must excuse from going mr jarsell must not harm in way indeed even if mr jarsell did succeed in getting to come to afternoon tea dan have plan in head whereby to ensure lillian against use being made of sumatra scent be daring thing to take miss moon into jaw of lion yet very daring must probably prove to be safeguard halliday have done what must to guard against event of threatening future now must only wait to see what must take place at moment there be nothing more to be done in due course train arrived at thawley station dan singled out george pelgrin to convey luggage to cab mindful of last tip george displayed great alacrity in performing duty a porter what be more when received half crown gave inadvertently piece of valuable information halliday be far from expecting be second two six since yesterday said george spitting on coin for luck mr jarsell gave same when came back yesterday evening oh dan be startled did not show sheepeak friend have be to london then went couple of day ago came back last night said pelgrin say to 'george look after trap for be only smart porter in station ' say ah be kind lady be mr jarsell civil a never be there be luggage in cab right sir vulcan hotel yes sir drive on cabby mr bolstreath lillian have not heard conversation dan pondered over on way to hotel mr jarsell have then be in london at time of penn death probably although must not prove be responsible for same when young man arrived at hotel lady went to rest wrote letter to laurance detailing new fact have learned instructed what use to make of confession if anything happened to in hillshire then enclosed confession went out personally to register packet once be posted felt that have done be possible now said dan to will see what move queen beelzebub will make chapter xvi dan diplomacy mr pelgrin welcomed unexpected guest with great delight showed appreciation of coming by emphatic aggressiveness why must mask kind heart excellent disposition by assuming brusque demeanor be not very clear certainly more amiable felt more disagreeable did become in fact landlady appeared to believe that honesty of purpose be best shown by blunt speech abrupt movement consequently did not get on particularly well with mr bolstreath who demanded respect deference from underling mr pelgrin positively declined to render termed chaperon fine madam in same spirit a have called dan butterfly be always ready for war of word admiring lillian gay lively character waited on girl hand foot yet with air of protest to hide real satisfaction felt at having in house to mr pelgrin lillian be goddess who have descended from high olympus to mingle for time with mere mortal out of consideration for halliday desire to seek safety for lillian by placing under gun of enemy mr bolstreath decided to remain week at peacock hotel later arranged to go to hartlepool in durhamshire where charge must find shelter with two spinster who kept school chaperon admitted that felt uneasy in near vicinity of queen beelzebub dan assurance must not quieten fear thought that be playing too bold game ill must come of stay at sheepeak lillian be more confident always confident that dan must do wrong be quite indifferent to mr jarsell doings however agreed to go to hartlepool a mr bolstreath be bent upon change halliday accepted situation meanwhile decided to call at grange on innocent pretext diplomatically give queen beelzebub to understand that held winning card in game be playing with society of fly must be done ventured to think by assuming that mr jarsell knew nothing about nefarious association did not believe that must remove mask since be to interest to observe secrecy in hillshire however left matter of call explanation in abeyance for time being for couple of day attended to three lady third be needle to say be mildred vincent who called at peacock hotel on receipt of lover letter gave dan to understand that be out of favor with inventor uncle have never forgiven for not winning race said mildred at afternoon tea say must have gained prize wish have said halliday dryly money must have be very acceptable be fancy flying did mischief a broke rudder however will call apologize wo see mr halliday ah be so like inventor who be a touchy a minor poet mr jarsell be annoyed also continued mildred sadly say must have made better use of favor procured for seems to that be in hot water round miss vincent same will survive dislike be absurd cried lillian with indignation dan risked life to win race if have have such bad luck must have won thanks dear girl be le bad luck than carelessness certain amount of vanity to show how must handle machine be very modest dan said mr bolstreath laughingly be best quality replied halliday with twinkle in eye where be mr vincent machine now questioned mildred at blackheath stored away suppose a be only lent will have to return to uncle will have final fly on when go back to london in few day doe miss moon go back also not to london interposed mr bolstreath propose to visit friend in scotland lillian looked up in surprise a hartlepool certainly be not in scotland thought that mr bolstreath geography be at fault significant look from dan showed that understood why wrong address have be given mr bolstreath with too much zeal mistrusted mildred although have cause to do so certainly mildred in perfect innocence did know actual destination might tell uncle who must assuredly tell mr jarsell for obvious reason be not necessary that mr jarsell must know where city of refuge be situated same dan did not think for moment mildred knew anything about society of fly be beginning to fancy vincent have such knowledge a mr jarsell financed that must not do so be positive unless made something out of matter be very convenient for queen beelzebub to have inventor at elbow who must construct swift aeroplane be at point of meditation that dan jumped up so suddenly a to spill tea what be matter asked lillian making dash at cup saucer to save breakage have got idea said halliday with gasp must go out think over without excusing further rushed from room be not like dan remarked mr bolstreath uneasily be calm cool headed a rule wonder what be matter oh will tell when come back replied lillian philosophically can always trust dan then turned conversation in somewhat heedless manner do like living here miss vincent well admitted mildred be rather too quiet for taste have plenty to do in looking after uncle business depends so much on that wonder what will do when get married when do intend to get married asked mr bolstreath curiously must not disabuse herself of idea that living so close to mr jarsell having uncle who be helped by mr jarsell girl knew something about society of fly next year year after exactly know depends upon dear freddy success must have home income suppose will marry sooner later then mr jarsell can look after uncle solomon who be mr jarsell asked lillian artfully cautiously be old lady who life at grange with old lady former governess miss armour be charming if be dull here perhaps miss moon must like to meet later later put in mr bolstreath hurriedly thank for suggestion miss vincent meanwhile wish to explore country be charming neighborhood although very quiet in many respect mildred agreed then began to plan excursion to place that with idea of making stay of visitor at sheepeak pleasant so agreeably did behave took such trouble in designing trip mr bolstreath revised opinion began to believe that so nice girl must not possibly know anything of mr jarsell doings knowledge uncle might be possessed of dan walking at top speed along high road in vain attempt to quieten mind be convinced that inventor have such knowledge idea have brought to foot have sent out to work off excitement be that inventor be responsible for mr jarsell presence in london at unexpected moment financed retained at elbow so to speak that might utilize capability clever invention if on day of london to york race mr jarsell be at peacock hotel about hour of nine o'clock a certainly be on evidence of mr pelgrin who have obvious reason to tell lie must not have got to london by train motor in time to murder durwin yet be assuredly at blackheath if cinematograph be to be believed dan have hitherto be puzzled to reconcile apparent impossibility at tea time solution of problem have suddenly flashed into mind mr jarsell have travelled to town on aeroplane be about one hundred sixty mile from place to town muttered dan walking very fast talking aloud to in excitement so must accomplish distance with ease in three hour considering vincent machine can fly at sixty mile in sixty minute said so proved that spoke truly when experimented with machine lent mr jarsell be at peacock hotel at nine o'clock cinematograph showed be at blackheath at one o'clock race started then durwin be killed shortly afterwards sixty mile hour mean one hundred eighty mile in three hour say started at half past nine must easily do leaving mr pelgrin immediately for vincent place must reach london by past twelve if not earlier seeing have just one hundred sixty mile to go there must be difficulty in reaching blackheath stabbing durwin at time death took place halliday be convinced that in way miracle of mr jarsell have taken place other mean of transit must have landed at place where durwin have met with death of course assumption intimated that mr jarsell be accomplished aviator that there have be no hitch in journey from sheepeak to blackheath be not impossibility for vincent probably have taught woman how to fly perhaps have handled machine there be room for two in aeroplane a dan very well knew since have taken penn for flight vehicle used be probably built on same line a one lent since aviation be yet in infancy there be certainly possibility that journey must not take place without accident hindrance a inferior machine have accomplished greater distance dan quite believed that mr jarsell with without vincent a pilot have reached london in one smooth stretch of flying on other occasion might not have be so successful on one probably have for to get to blackheath in time to commit crime must have be necessary for to use rightfully second of given time wonder with mean of transit at disposal must prove advantageous alibi when occasion demanded also since late conquest of air afforded opportunity of swift travelling greatly in excess of other human invention be quite reasonable that must live so far from scene of criminal exploit thinking thus halliday stumbled across very person who be in thought rushed with bent head along road unconsciously mounted towards vast space of moorland stretching under gray sky thus swiftly decided that collision be meant ran into mr jarsell who approached in opposite direction laughed expostulated a if dan be in wrong although must have seen coming road be wide enough for to move to one side really mr halliday require whole country to move in said mr jarsell in heavy way with affectation of joviality beg pardon stammered dan not quite stared at a though have suddenly risen out of earth indeed so far a be concerned have done so ignorant a be of approach woman be arrayed in favorite white a day be chilly wore voluminous cloak of scarlet silk quilted padded warm in look wear black eye set in olive hued face peered from under white hair a watchfully a ever at present moment heavy countenance wore expression of amusement at startled look of young man commented on with ponderous jocularity one must think be ghost mr halliday will admit that be very substantial ghost shook silver mounted cane playfully at did expect to meet here said dan drawing deep breath thinking how best must introduce subject of lillian did expect to meet responded mr jarsell still phlegmatically playful have risen from earth dropped from sky did not even know that be in neighborhood dan grimly decided that last statement be false since have be whole two day at peacock hotel be certain mr jarsell must have heard of visit also of lady sheltering under mr pelgrin wing for in country gossip be more prevalent than in town came up for day two three four said dan still staring appear to be very decided in own mind rejoined mr jarsell dryly sat down on large block of granite be embedded amongst heather neighborhood evidently have fascination for eye searched face carefully be pleased a be proud of scenery hereabouts who come once come twice quite proverb be be friend mr laurance with not on occasion answered dan coolly coming to point came with two lady miss moon companion be stopping at peacock hotel for short time miss moon miss moon mused mr jarsell oh young lady be engaged to marry daughter of poor man who be murdered have excellent memory mr jarsell have little to exercise memory in dull place said woman graciously with motherly air ask after miss armour observe be very unkind of a be great favorite with miss armour be very good friend responded halliday cautiously so be since induced mr vincent to lend aeroplane be a glad did that a be sorry lost race mr halliday fortune of war said dan lightly ca always be successful know mr jarsell wish have seen start be grand wish have said woman lying glibly be impossible for to leave miss armour on day a have bad health in fact mr vincent wished to go also see how machine worked must not get away still added mr jarsell with cheerful air perhaps be a well so far a be concerned that must not go aviation seems to be very dangerous must have be afraid for safety oh will never come to harm in air hope responded dan with emphasis must let take up day mr jarsell shuddered must be terrified out of wit protested fancy heavy woman such a be trying to emulate bird why be quite sure must fall smash like egg even supposing there be machine capable of bearing none too trifling weight oh think there be mr jarsell machine can carry two know lately in france aviator took five six people from one given point to be quite safe mr jarsell shook head seriously think not since aviation be yet in infancy in five year if live a long may venture now thank mr halliday most lady be afraid certainly even miss moon who be plucky will not let take for fly miss moon of course be quite forgetting hope will bring to see miss armour if stay here certainly think of returning to town to morrow so may not be able to bring daresay mr bolstreath will however ended dan quite certain in own mind that chaperon must find good excuse to avoid visit will be delighted mr jarsell murmured vaguely how have be mr halliday since saw last seemed to dan that asked question with intention be entirely willing to give frank answer in frankness a in taking lillian under gun of enemy lay safety of halliday be convinced of have be rather worried said slowly with side glance at mr jarsell watchful face have adventure love adventure replied woman heavily one well be hustled into taxi cab carried in drugged condition to place where met with collection of scoundrel kind of murder gang might call who slay blackmail thieve for sake of power rather strange reason said mr jarsell equably not at moved must say reason be for money that with power explained dan indeed society appears to be governed on wonderful principle such a one must ascribe to honest men in what way mr jarsell be quite curious in detached manner well member be chaste sober industrious must be virtuous be describing society of saint quite so only saint apply virtue to crime have head who be called queen beelzebub mr jarsell shuddered drew line on dust of road with cane slowly carefully did see asked be horrid name full of horrid possibility did not see anyone said dan frankly room be in darkness save for red light around queen beelzebub mask oh person wore mask how did know be woman well see name be queen beelzebub might be taken by man to hide truth might admitted other carelessly indeed think that woman must have nerve to belong to gang agree with said mr jarsell gravely well what happened be asked by queen beelzebub to join gang share profit may guess be large have month to think over matter mr jarsell looked at keenly surely must never belong to organization said with reproachful tone in heavy voice oh know have own axe to grind like other people if gang help to grind may consider offer do shock mr jarsell voice sounded a though did shock more than can say replied decisively that honest man must even think of thing be dreadful gang must be denounced to police wonder have not done so already dan shook head admired cool clever way in be playing very dangerous game though to be sure be far from suspecting guessed connection with queen beelzebub ca do yet what do mean by yet questioned mr jarsell time there be distinct note of alarm in voice risk death if denounce gang not only to myself to miss moon be sure must be killed a father be killed if moved in matter also be not sure of many thing mr jarsell still drawing pattern spoke thoughtfully think be wise to speak of gang if be so dangerous even to country mouse such a be of course will say nothing a have one to say anything to if have must not speak if talk to stranger like about thing be told to keep secret miss moon may be murdered thought so week ago admitted halliday candidly then think so now not since marcus penn died mr jarsell drew long breath wriggled uneasily who be marcus penn well be secretary of sir charles moon afterwards be secretary of lord curberry now be corpse oh cried mr jarsell suddenly wish must talk of horrible thing have gang murdered finished young man believe so although verdict of suicide be brought in poor penn death may be mean of saving miss moon indeed woman tone became harsh imperative did not ask question left confession even side glance dan sent in mr jarsell direction showed that olive cheek have turned to dead white however said nothing although moistened lip slowly so went on easily a if be telling idle story confession be concealed in lord curberry house penn sent note of whereabouts to miss moon who told got confession placed in safe keeping be wise said mr jarsell with effort safe keeping oh will only tell whereabouts of confession name of person who hold when there be necessity for confession to be used see quite what mean mr halliday well see mr jarsell have to protect miss moon from machination of society person who hold confession will not open sealed envelope in be placed unless something happens to miss moon to therefore so long a member of gang hurt secret of gang be quite safe to attentive ear seemed that mr jarsell drew long breath of relief with command of herself did credit displayed emotion observed playfully be very clever of very wise to guard in way certainly gang can not hurt in way so long a there be danger of confession being opened in event of thing happening to to miss moon suppose confession be very dreadful one mr halliday be not so dreadful so full a must like to be said dan in calmest manner there be sufficient set down to warrant interference of authority if confession come into hand of scotland yard official can lay hand on gang be bluffing when said a be not quite sure if curberry have not let mr jarsell know that confession a curberry thought have be destroyed think police must know said mr jarsell rising thank for nothing said dan following example if move in matter run risk of death besides may accept offer of society who know do that implored mr jarsell so earnestly that dan be convinced curberry have not told her of confession be so wicked perhaps be however if society leave miss moon alone confession wo be opened gang be safe otherwise otherwise whole association will be exposed to danger of arrest said mr jarsell lightly well sound very dreadful to country lady a be wish have not told why did tell because said dan ironically look upon a friend mr jarsell face cleared smiled be friend said in emphatic way believe when say that be sure miss moon be safe thank replied dan agreeably be sure also then parted with mutual compliment smile handshake chapter xvii at bay when dan left mr jarsell be very well pleased with promise have given concerning safety of lillian fully believed that in role of queen beelzebub must keep that promise faithfully if only because own interest demanded such honesty fact that confession of penn be in hand of third party to be made use of must anything happen to miss moon prevented society of fly from carrying out threat made to at secret meeting to save own life member must be forced much against will doubt to spare of lillian dan chuckled at way in have circumvented deadly organization have only scotched snake have not killed until did so there be always that chance that must strike when able to do so with safety while penn confession remained in laurance hand be well one thing struck halliday a strange be persistence with mr jarsell kept up comedy of having nothing to do with matter during so confidential conversation knew that penn have be doubtful member of gang knew that have be despatched a dan truly believed because be not to be trusted now knew that have left confession behind be in hand of enemy also be aware that man who spoke to have read confession must have guessed that name a queen beelzebub be mentioned therein being case be to be presumed that must speak freely in place of doing so have pretended ignorance for own end have humored feigning doubted that confession existed guessed in whose possession be intended to regain queen beelzebub know well enough that freddy be best friend thought dan a returned to peacock hotel must be reasonable for to believe that have penn confession be certainly case must not be at surprised if freddy be inveigled into trap a be so that might be forced to surrender document rather what remains of if be managed queen beelzebub must revenge on lillian on since there must be nothing left to shield from spite in case freddy be in danger a be certain guess that hold confession mused for few moment then added aloud will return to town at once see more thought more saw necessity of doing mr jarsell first move to counterplot must be to seek out lord curberry learn what must relative to what penn have left behind certainly curberry must assure that have burnt confession in case queen beelzebub must think that must be free to act halliday believed be of too suspicious nature to be quite convinced that have only bluffed before taking step must decidedly ascertain for certain although in what way be difficult to say if there really be compromising document in laurance hand to do so must a dan have thought few minute before set trap for browbeat into stating what knew what held therefore for freddy sake be necessary to go to london report in detail conversation on moor then two must arrange what be best to be done be dealing with coterie of daring scoundrel who must stop at nothing to secure own safety behoved to move warily be walking on volcano be halliday concluding reflection of course a be useless to alarm lady dan said nothing of meeting with queen beelzebub on moor however on being questioned confessed sudden thought have sent out of door lillian mr bolstreath agreed that be entirely probable that mr jarsell did travel in up to date aeroplane like mischief making fairy then in turn told that mildred have stayed for quite long time be altogether more charming time appeared suggested many trip mr bolstreath be inclined to stay at sheepeak longer than intended in spite of near menace of queen beelzebub lillian be delighted with lovely scenery so gracious after drab hue of london see why must get house here after be married said to lover one of delicious old manor house of faded yellow stone must live quietly with mr bolstreath while ran up to business on aeroplane time must be fretting lest harm came to said chaperon shaking head besides dear when be married wo want to be with dear bolly will always want so will dan nonsense said mr bolstreath briskly two company three none well remarked halliday leisurely can settle matter when be married lillian remember before uncle will consent will have to discover who murdered father have discovered who murdered be false mr brown who be mr jarsell who be queen beelzebub so believe have to prove case said dan dryly moreover wo find easy to place woman in dock when have accursed society at back of think there be danger asked lillian hastily thing be safer than ever dear go to town evening can leave here with certainty that be well go to town evening said mr bolstreath anxiously be that very sudden resolution oh think not answered dan in easy way came down here only to settle lillian by way sir john wired address wrote interrupted mr bolstreath be quite pleased that be away rather think lady added thoughtfully that sir john be not ill pleased be away at age constant presence of two woman in house be rather disconcerting finding have left town returned there to enjoy own house to in case said dan cheerfully will be glad to see lillian married to lord curberry not to must die rather than marry lord curberry said lillian decisively with chin in air wo be asked to do one other dear replied dan in calmest tone will marry right enough whatever opposition sir john may make a to lord curberry hesitated well asked mr bolstreath impatiently intend to see when return to town think will be a well better have complete understanding with so that will not worry lillian more wo answered dan grimly now will have to get away see mr pelgrin have have trap brought round take care of lillian lillian kissed lover followed to door of sitting room with gay laugh lillian can look after said lightly be not afraid of mr jarsell of anyone else take care dan fear much more for than for be right dan with englishman dislike for emotional scene kissed girl again slipped out of door saw drive away in gloom of evening then settled to make comfortable lillian mr bolstreath must admit a much felt rather downcast at dan sudden departure luckily a have be so cool composed did not connect with fresh development likely to give trouble in vague way mr bolstreath guessed that dan have spiked gun of enemy under be encamped certainty of safety being infectious lillian also felt quite at ease meanwhile dan reached beswick station in ramshackle trap be lucky enough to catch in going train to thawley just a started to glide past platform fortunate connection enabled to board seven twenty express to london where hoped to arrive shortly before eleven same evening knowing that laurance work kept up late at night wired from thawley asking to come to st pancras station important a be freddy time dan knew that must respond to call at once knowing that large issue must be outcome of present situation therefore a train dropped south halliday felt quite comfortable a have done must to arrange matter for moment indeed so assured did feel that have taken possible precaution that did not even trouble to think over matter fell asleep refreshed weary brain body only when train arrived at st pancras did tumble out sleepy still to catch sight of faithful friend on platform nothing wrong asked laurance hurrying up nothing wrong responded dan with yawn have much to talk to about get four wheeler taxi mean mean wish to travel a slowly a possible so a to explain matter tell man to drive to moment office there can drop go on to room thus understanding situation freddy selected shaky old cab drawn by shaky old horse rate at progressed through brilliantly lighted street be so slow that be very long time arriving at moment office in fleet street in damp smelling interior of antique conveyance halliday now quite alert clearheaded gave friend full account of have happened particularly emphasizing interview with mr jarsell h be commenced freddy when ended so did give away very wisely too think did know how much knew be keen on giving rope to hang know have read penn confession what there be of did tell have anything else than full confession old son may think have whole document intact fancy be probable may believe that there be confession in existence curberry may have written to telling that burnt confession said dan after pause really think have done that mr jarsell went dead white when mentioned confession then belief that spoke truth persisted laurance hopefully may may not a said before retorted halliday anyhow a ca be sure if be in jest earnest will delay proceeding until see curberry if swears that burnt confession mr jarsell may act therefore want to send unsigned telegram containing three word 'all be discovered ' what will do put fear of god into curberry into queen beelzebub into society of fly a whole warning will be so vague that wo know who will strike blow will suspect dan in case replied halliday promptly queen beelzebub will leave lillian alone object will be obtained want to gain time can only do so with safety to lillian by keeping beast in state of uncertainty a to how much how little be known see laurance thought plan good one since say that have confession curberry will say that destroyed queen beelzebub will be undecided telegram like bolt from blue will clinch matter make gang pause before take step to hurt miss moon will send wire what then then to morrow be go down to see curberry have out with name be mentioned in portion of confession hold know enough to ensure arrest be doubtful protested freddy thoughtfully have read confession penn hint lot about curberry doe say enough to never mind say enough for purpose be to scare curberry belonging to society of fly a doe believe got uncle cousin put out of way to inherit title property will harp on string if queen beelzebub call there be danger dan interposed freddy quickly anxiously know be far from suggesting that there be not danger a be driving people into corner if turn up at office by five o'clock to morrow freddy if send wire saying that be safe get inspector tenson tell show confession come down with to blackheath to see inspector who have charge of durwin murder then armed with authority of law can go to curberry house if be missing will know how to act laurance drew deep breath a cab turned into fleet street be big risk for dan pooh a aviator be always taking risk must settle business somehow if wish to marry lillian save life a well a own from infernal beast here get down freddy forget to do a tell laurance promised to faithfully adhere to instruction while four wheeler lumbered away in direction of strand halliday possessed one of rare nature invariably reveal best in time of danger knew what to say how to act when in tight corner training a aviator have learned to take risk from le level headed men must have shrunk at present moment required energy to cope with unforeseen emergency since did not quite know what action must be taken against of course be confident that sort of action must be taken since have aroused wrath of brilliantly clever intensely evil set of people fearful for own safety society of fly must do best to get rid of to get rid of lillian a have gotten rid of others who have stood in crooked path girl be safeguarded so far by confession depended upon what curberry said to queen beelzebub a to how long such safeguard must be efficacious have told woman one story curberry must tell so be doubtful must believe telegram from unknown source might turn balance in favor lead mr jarsell friend to believe that there be chance of devilish doings coming to light having arrived at conclusion dan fell asleep quite indifferent to fact that sword of damocles hung over head that single hair might part at moment herein showed steadiness of nerve value of nature trained to face worst smilingly next morning halliday arose brisk cheerful with expectation of having most exciting day a soon a finished breakfast made way by train to blackheath on arriving there somewhere about twelve o'clock did not go immediately to curberry house walked to place where vincent aeroplane be housed have just struck that mr jarsell might have wired to one of friend to damage machine so that must not be used have procured for to put plainly have abused friendship so be not likely must permit to retain unharmed wonderful airship with must make money win fame when reached shed saw man whom have engaged to watch machine found that fear be groundless one have be near place so far a must ascertain aeroplane be in perfect condition then struck dan a be yet too early to call on lord curberry that might indulge in little fly enemy house be only stone throw distant on border of open space halliday did not intend to lose sight of entrance gate lest mr jarsell must steal in unobserved in air hovering directly over ground must see who came went also incidentally might gain information a to what be going on in garden somewhat oddly occurred to that if queen beelzebub came might push curberry into ornamental pond a marcus penn have be pushed there be knowing what might do in despair in brutal english queen beelzebub be at bay must fight like rat be in corner into be being slowly driven by circumstance engineered by mr daniel halliday therefore dan saw to fitting of biplane ascertained by sight touch that have not be tampered with oiled engine saw that did not lack petroleum in fact be a careful of everything connected with structure a though be preparing for long race of course there be usual crowd of loafer who came to see start swept upward from ground in graceful curve aeroplane acted easily truthfully according to very excellent design aviator after making wide circle dropped down to pas slowly over ground of curberry mansion must see one about even though day be fine sunny so concluded that owner having received anonymous telegram be shivering within door terrified to venture out in impatience to learn absolute truth dan turned machine back to shed came to rest almost at very door owing to examination of aeroplane experimental flight to test working order time have passed uncommonly swiftly be now fifteen minute past one o'clock dan made up mind to beard curberry in library without waiting for arrival of queen beelzebub who after might not arrive man willing onlooker wheeled machine into great shed door be about to be closed when one of crowd uttered exclamation be echoed by many others halliday always on alert for unexpected came quickly to door of building saw everyone looking upward northward to where small black dot spotted blue of sky increased in size rapidly there be difficulty in seeing that be flying machine at once thought entered dan mind that there be mr jarsell on vincent biplane paying expected visit although have reason to suppose that be pilot wondering if be right wrong in surmise waited with fast beating heart became certain of truth of guess very shortly travelling at great height strange biplane poised directly over open space then began to drop slowly into enclosed ground of lord curberry mansion not having field glass halliday must not make out if pilot be man woman when machine cleverly managed disappeared below tree wall of park be convinced that queen beelzebub have arrived at once determined to make third at interview with curberry objection might be raised first arranged what to do in order to guard against future event of dangerous nature wheel machine out again ordered man who have assisted see that everything be in order have everything prepared to start let anyone touch tapped aeroplane understand yes sir said man stolidly be going for fly exactly person who arrived be friend of mine be going into yonder house to ask if race can be arranged knowing that must trust man to guard machine certain must not be tampered with when hundred of eye be watching halliday walked across open space with serene confidence struck that if mr jarsell wished to escape must certainly use biplane be just a well to follow in own run to earth a machine be made by vincent speed of must be about equal in case dan hoped to keep queen beelzebub in sight if be necessary to give chase having thus prepared for possible emergency young man entered big gate of park hastened up short avenue soon found at front door a rang bell glanced around for mr jarsell flying machine be not visible so presumed have left on broad spacious lawn on further side of house be in mind to go tamper with engine to prevent further flight before must make up mind to course door opened footman appeared wish to see lord curberry said halliday giving man card on most important business can see will inquire sir be with lady just now have be for last ten minute please wait here sir introduced dan into hall again when left alone halliday have impulse to go out look to gear of machine with idea of putting thing wrong again footman appeared before must decide if must be wise to do so lordship will see sir said man who looked rather uncomfortable seems to be ill ill echoed dan wondering what new deviltry be taking place lady be not with lordship now sir said footman in bewildered manner yet showed into library few minute ago do know lady asked halliday sharply sir at least ca tell sir came in one of flying machine wear thick veil be stout lady sir with sharp manner take to master commanded dan not caring to ask further question since be best to ask of lord curberry man obeyed still bewildered nervous in manner entrance of queen beelzebub into house have evidently upset thing ushered into library dan waited for closing of door then advanced to where curberry be seated at desk near window man looked gaunt haggard very sick when young man advanced rose a if moved by spring held out telegram in trembling hand sent quavered curberry halliday must see that perspiration beaded bald high forehead in flash halliday guessed that be wire laurance have dispatched according to arrangement no did not send telegram denied calmly with perfect truth sent saying that be discovered stuttered curberry again dropped back into seat have learned too much say that know everything queen beelzebub ah know name guessed a much be here be furious who be queen beelzebub demanded dan anxiously know why do ask question know answer to know why have come to have arrested thought destroyed confession of infernal penn say retained sufficient to show yes yes know have won fought for lillian there be chance of gaining for wife wo either have to reckon with queen beelzebub a for a for faltered trembled dan stepped right up to desk what be matter have taken poison gasped curberry dropped head on hand with sob chapter xviii flight poison echoed dan startled out of composure for be far from expecting word doctor doctor can do good sobbed curberry lifting haggard face looking up with wild despairing eye there be antidote to drug have taken be painless more le in hour will be dead a work slowly time enough for to speak let get doctor insisted halliday for so distraught did man look that be not surprised that servant have be uncomfortable must not die without curberry struggled to foot laid hand on visitor be ready to die said in harsh strained voice why must be kept alive to be hanged to be disgraced to be then admit admit everything in touched few loose sheet of paper lying on desk confession like penn have made one must have doctor said halliday ran to bell curberry with wonderful strength seeing how ill looked rose swiftly sprang after if call doctor will shoot said hoarsely pulled out small revolver must rather die by mean of poison have taken since be more painless sooner than be taken by police will shoot too too halliday waived aside threat wo see police doctor must try to save insisted curberry fiercely will not be saved only to be hanged stay here listen to have something to say button of bell shoot a spoke levelled revolver quick quick what will do have own way agreed halliday moved to desk where sat down on convenient chair curberry with groan returned to seat laid revolver on blotting paper ready for instant use must necessity arise even a yet did not wholly trust halliday there be cause for suspicion since dan be unarmed must hing against man with quick firing weapon made up mind to snatch at revolver moment curberry be off guard yet even a decided upon course said to that be foolish man recovery supposing doctor did arrive meant man arrest in dan opinion a in curberry death be better than disgrace be most uncomfortable situation halliday did not see anything to do to listen to what host have to say poor wretch have poisoned be keeping help at bay with revolver must be dead in hour hour a hinted so best thing be to hear story in hope that by mean who have brought to pas must be punished be weird experience to sit beside tormented man who declined to be saved from tragic death did queen beelzebub give poison asked halliday shivering at gray pinched look on curberry face long ago long ago not now muttered man groaning member of society of fly have poison to escape arrest must there be danger be painless poison more le act slowly have told before there be not much time pressed hand on heart while retain strength sens listen where be woman call queen beelzebub demanded dan looking round anxiously saw arrive in aeroplane did came to tell that knew about society belong to yes curse who dragged into matter be getting on right in law when be tempted fell uncle cousin yes yes broke in curberry with groan said that if joined society must be got rid of be got rid of because wished for title money for what reason so must marry lillian moon refused to listen to so long a be merely struggling barrister when became wealthy oh pain poison be lie like rest of business declared be painless now now broke off to wipe perspiration from face dan half rose let call assistance may not be too late curberry pointed revolver at a moved be too late said setting teeth if die must face worst have brought to echoed halliday sitting down again in what way meddled meddled sent that telegram did not then meddling have brought police into matter that telegram may have be sent by friend enemy in case be true for be discovered be curberry gasped with pain again moistened dry lip be sitting with wondering if be best to end thing to wait see if warning be true one then came in through yonder door nodded towards entrance from terrace into library told that that oh oh groaned rocked from side to side yet kept grip on revolver lest dan must call ring for assistance endeavor to secure weapon so took poison said halliday wondering how must manage to evade being shot summon doctor when said that be known did then queen beelzebub mean curse yes like eve tempted like adam fell where be up in penn old room searching for further confession may have left oh curberry rocked moaned thought when snatched from burnt

intended treachery told queen came saw when came killed killed durwin yes gasped curberry who be growing whiter more haggard moment marcus penn killed have to be killed betrayed too much to only out of fear said dan looking at murderer more with pity than with anger for be suffering greatly not even fear must have made reveal anything about scent confessed folly be doomed to death went away on day then came back secretly having ordered penn to meet by ornamental water to speak about society suspected something because wrote that confession let lillian know where be concealed came managed to stupefy with sumatra scent after thrust under water when be sure be dead got away secretly returning openly to hear that body have be found wicked wretch said dan scarcely able to restrain disgust although felt must not be too hard on one already being severely punished for crime call name said curberry with attempt at laugh after be better than think since be trying to save want to live marry lillian keep confession laid hand on loose sheet of paper from queen beelzebub so that can put end to wicked doings hide paper when come back will destroy a be very probable dan stretched out hand for paper curberry feverishly gathered together speaking in halting manner a did so wait till put together said painfully be full account of connection with society evil doings account for death of moon of durwin of penn of take care halliday for queen beelzebub will not give in without fight can hing said dan watching curberry pinning loose paper together laurance have what remains of penn

penn said dan grimly sooner later will stand in dock that never will believe have mean of escape if worst come to worst oh curberry half rose then fell back in chair end be coming eye be growing dim ah uttered shriek save with shaking hand grasped revolver a curberry eye be looking past dan with subconscious instinct of self preservation have just time to rise swerve to one side when hand grazed shoulder young man gripped chair swung up a barrier between stout woman who be immediately behind be dressed in long black cloak with close fitting cloth cap wore heavy veil of motor style with piece of mica let in a eyehole not word did say seeing dan action drew back with deep indrawn breath like hiss of baffled snake take care take care have serpent poison gasped curberry who be sitting loosely in chair gripping revolver halliday remembered wicked wound on sir charles moon neck flesh grew cold for slightest touch of morsel of shining steel in queen beelzebub hand meant swift death fiend shouted with cry of anger flung heavy chair fairly at with leap of pantheress sprang to one side chair crashed against opposite wall while woman glided rapidly round to open door of terrace shot rang out a reached dan knew that dying man have fired on enemy apparently bullet did not reach mark for queen beelzebub still moved on silent sinister dangerous halliday flung forward to get between door so a to prevent escape with faint snarl like beast at bay stabbed at with death tip piece of steel leaped back to save from being scratched while curberry dragged painfully to bell button near fire place pressed with remaining strength be done for call police oh fell prone on hearth rug revolver dropped beside halliday ran forward on impulse of moment to offer aid hastily picking up weapon meanwhile a did so queen beelzebub sprang through door into open be making for aeroplane cried dan must have followed on instant that curberry gripped fast stay stay priest clergyman be dying deadly fear became apparent in glazed eye get help a cried retaining dan coat in grip of iron door of room opened butler with footman beside rushed in shot a well a ringing of bell have brought immediately to spot trying to disengage dan gave hasty order send for doctor send for clergyman send for police woman have murdered master catch stop oh oh curberry grip loosened rolled over with moan whether be dead alive dan did not wait to see moment be precious if intended to stay flight of queen beelzebub terrified men came to assist dying master more servant attracted by noise poured in at library door backward glance showed dan that curberry be being attended to then sped along terrace towards lawn at side of house here arrived just moment too late for already aeroplane be spinning along turf with queen beelzebub in pilot seat like wicked fairy of nursery tale be escaping in dragon car even in hour of success did not utter sound silent menacing mounted into air halliday dashed forward with cry of rage a lifted above reach there be not moment to be lost without glance raced down avenue made for entrance gate queen beelzebub might make for lair in hillshire might be that must cross channel to seek safety on continent wherever went dan intended to follow must not escape time flew like arrow from bow across from open space outside park to where man still stood guard by own machine little crowd around have face turned heavenward be shouting at sight of biplane now dwindling to black dot a receded swiftly from blackheath dan felt throb of satisfaction a saw that queen beelzebub be making for north out of way out of way gasped young man charging through throng scattered at approach let go let go sprang into pilot seat to start engine immediately screw began to spin slowly at first gathering in speed second aeroplane moved ran with bird like swiftness along ground then soared with hum of giant bee halliday swept in vast circle like actor taking stage then turned nose of machine in direction of black dot be to be pole star towards be to continually direct course until goal wherever might be be attained many men woman child standing round blackheath shed shouted cheered thinking that be witnessing start of exciting race little knew that be chase dealing with serious issue of life death halliday heard thin sound of voice reach faintly then settled down to handle biplane in masterly manner since aeroplane be made by vincent be probable that be equal in durability speed queen beelzebub have gained very fair start dan knew that must require knowledge of aviation to catch up escape capture depended entirely upon dexterity with manoeuvered delicate structure bore on part woman must use knowledge to get away safely dan did not believe that capability a aeronaut be equal to own in contest be science against despair given machine a equal yet pilot a unequal be hard to say what must be result halliday racing to save lillian life to gain a wife believed that final victory must remain with be unusually pleasant day with pale blue sky lightly sprinkled with feathery white cloud gentle wind be blowing be not sufficiently strong to impede speed of aeroplane yet be chilly in high altitude in haste dan have not put on overcoat before end of chase grimly expected to be well nigh frozen did not mind so uncomfortable prospect so long a gained aim before fled woman be determined to capture place in criminal dock to answer for manifold sin thinking of what have done how path be strewn with victim young man set teeth tried best to force pace be useless a biplane must not do more than be intended to do although have now be racing northward for over hour distance between pursuer pursued appeared to be much same receding black dot did not seem to be growing larger dan be irritated yet felt that even though be not gaining be not losing be much taking thing into account there be always chance that queen beelzebub machine might break down then must be a helpless a bird with broken wing also dan did not blind to possibility own aeroplane might come to grief a have done during london to york race benefiting by former experience did not try fancy flying held to straight undeviating course machine be making bee line for goal halliday now guessed very plainly be grange in sheepeak hillshire have be about two o'clock when chase started already taking part in be mile upon mile distant from london since aeroplane be flying at rate of between fifty sixty mile hour harrow st albans luton bedford northampton have long since dropped behind queen beelzebub swerving to left be making for rugby so a to get into straight line for hillshire particularly for thawley passing over famous school town pace slackened somewhat dan managed to secure advantage of few mile when machine lifted birmingham increased speed fact made dan curse have be under impression that be running short of oil petroleum apparently be not case have simply reduced speed so a to nurse resource since must take bold step because of start have gained at outset halliday grudgingly confessed to that woman knew business a wasted time machine neither rose fell deviated to right left overmuch did be to hold to straight line at moderate height above earth humoring engine straining a little a might be wing spar bolt such like gear of biplane vincent have taught admirably dan no longer undervalued a antagonist be dexterous bold resourceful venturesome admiration now freely given be mixed with pity so clever human being must debase gift to harry mankind such quality a possessed made more dangerous a be intellectual animal slaying with taught skill rather than with instinctive cunning a afternoon drew on chase still continued night began to shut down gliding over town be veiled in gray mist of swiftly falling dusk when nottingham came in sight be distinguished by thousand glittering pin point of light usual nightly illumination matlock mansfield holdbrook wayleigh gleamed beneath like jewelled crown when star began to appear aeroplane be flying between two firmament radiant with multi colored orb of light at last thawley rose into view burning like furnace under veil of smoke dim shroudings of twilight while vague murmur like swarming of bee came muffled to ear of who drove machine yet at height coming dark be not yet very intense queen beelzebub aeroplane beginning to slacken speed dan be able to keep well in view saw rather vaguely closer at hand shadow against shadow of gray sky minute by minute drew nearer began to discern outline more le clearly must be admitted at best clearness be not quite that deserved use of such word however dan cold hungry weary with strain on nerve must think of none better at moment queen beelzebub be decidedly losing speed machine seemed to falter after left thawley a if be doubtful how to find way home in world of shadow at woman made last effort a seemed like wounded animal dragging faster homeward a neared den aeroplane towered aloft to vast tableland of moor halliday be close behind when hovered over two biplane be only stone throw from one exulted for now have driven woman to citadel for there be escape even by machine a be so to speak worn out be at last gasp must have to fight yield elected to fight when airship swung in foggy air over field near grange if alighted queen beelzebub knew that pursuer must alight also capture so described rapid circle with what motive power be left plunged downward on enemy to ram machine dan saw movement with hand on steering gear swerved to one side dropping lower a did so other machine swooped harmlessly overhead recovering quickly once more came down with dip of hawk on heron halliday dodged again then thinking that two must play at dangerous game watched chance rushed straightly at prey queen beelzebub saw coming adopted tactic be dropped below onset dan aeroplane swept on without result once more came down to level by time machine be only twenty foot from ground time a dashed forward woman be not dexterous enough to get out of way two clashed violently with ripping breaking smashing sound with engine still spinning

to get warm after made examination of surroundings halliday found that cellar be small with stone floor stone roof stone wall more le humid light air came through shaft on right of entrance be too narrow to permit of escape evidently place have be used before a prison doubt for refractory member of society since there be spare furniture in one corner be low bed in deal table in third washstand finally there be one kitchen chair on dan took seat to think over matter have eaten so did not feel hungry solaced with pipe luxury for felt very grateful must not be said that thought be pleasant

reflected on must not help admiring infernal cunning of woman who have arranged matter miss armour be without doubt born criminal who much preferred doing evil to doing good a mr jarsell companion must have led blameless existence surrounded by attention comfort luxury craving for power have led into dark path for care might have guessed that in law abiding country truth of murderous association must come to notice of authority sooner later when knowledge have become public with cunning be unable to cope with situation like fox in fable many wile have proved useless here be driven into corner what intended to do dan must not think did not see in what way must escape punishment of course young man be perfectly satisfied that freddy be moving in matter down south according to

going on servant must be questioned curberry body must be examined while visit of veiled woman flight in aeroplane must be explained laurance must guess at once that unknown lady be queen beelzebub attending to iniquitous business inquiry at shed must soon inform of pursuit halliday believed that on morrow laurance together with police must arrive at sheepeak then end must come meanwhile be in great danger unless freddy appeared in time to rescue for miss armour be very spiteful last act of power must undoubtedly be to murder for action have taken in bringing about downfall have to be faced if death be certain hoped that must be immediate since even brave nature quailed at idea of suffering ingenious chinese torture a to lillian dan be quite sure must not be harmed because queen beelzebub have hand full must not have time to kill indeed if decided to do so must not be easy for to find anyone to execute command for member of society of fly must by time have be aware of danger threatened organization halliday believed that telegram alluded to by miss armour be to be sent by mr jarsell be intended to summon member to conference yet what use such meeting must be young man must not think net of law must capture entire gang without doubt yet queen beelzebub be so infernally cunning that dan must not be sure must not find mean of saving subject even at eleventh hour in thought such a night passed slowly hour seemed interminable candle in lantern burned out found in complete darkness while silence be only broken by drip of water from wall by own breathing restless movement dan felt a though be in tomb lively imagination conjured up kind of horror until worn out physically mentally fell into profound slumber when opened eye again be dawn for saw cold light

floor of cell be unexpected adventure sure enough unpleasant a be now promised to be still more unpleasant before be concluded halliday must hope for be laurance with police must arrive in time to save life deliver from imprisonment at ten o'clock dan looked again at watch when door opened mr jarsell entered with tray on be two boiled egg bread butter coffee placing on table be about to leave a have entered in silence when dan caught dress at once with shiver drew back displayed lancet tipped with serpent poison if try to escape will kill said in heavy voice dan looked at curiously saw that be le imposing than ever for massive look self restraint be gone eye be red face be disfigured with tear big body looked flabby inert greater collapse more pitiful spectacle can scarcely be imagined

of escaping mr jarsell used bad grammar in astonishment how can be affair broke in halliday pouring out coffee why must help to escape because be woman not fiend miss armour be one admit can see very plainly that be most unwilling accomplice be be cried mr jarsell vehemently year ago be decent woman good woman came into life again poisoned existence worked on jealousy on fear know know enabled to get rid of husband ah mr jarsell reeled back a though have be struck told that did told everything then will never escape must never let go free with knowledge have of secret be doomed a to husband mr jarsell appeared to be speaking more to herself than to dan be wicked cruel wretch starved beat be unfaithful to led life a woman must endure miss armour showed how to rid of when be distraught with misery passion thought be sympathy with that made help be not desired be to gain hold over use money for own vile end appear to love said halliday coolly woman closed door placed back against clenched hand in cold fury hate loathe detest cried in guttural voice evidently consumed with rage for year year year have be slave after killed husband under direction although deny what deserved death there be retreat for a must have must have informed police must have be hanged made use of power to use money in order to create wicked society murder slays blackmail know know said dan soothingly told about then know how evil be have have to commit crime from better self shrank at command such a murder of durwin put in dan quickly be only one out of many deeper deeper have sunk into mire now end

away closing door after with bang sounded in dan ear like death warrant same with courage of brave nature hopefulness inseparable from youth went on with meal hoping for best mr jarsell be moved by plight saw that deeply stained a be with compulsory crime might hope to atone for by doing one good act at eleventh hour might set free undoubtedly must think over what have said woman unlike others be not entirely evil seed of good in breast might bring forth repentance consequent help dan knew that be clinging to straw in present dilemma there be nothing else to cling to after breakfast lay down again again began to smoke for hour waited to hear fate sometimes stretched on bed sometimes seated in chair occasionally walking up down confined space of cell must not disguise from that thing be desperate sole hope of escape lay with mr jarsell be slight one even though remorse might wish to aid terror of queen beelzebub might be too strong to let move in matter halliday be uncommonly brave extraordinarily hopeful yet perspiration beaded forehead shivered at prospect of torture without doubt be in hell devil presided over by infernal queen be waiting to inflict pain penalty on terrified to think wo do said dan to a heard key grate in lock late in afternoon must pull together smile beast do to must die game lillian with quiet smile turned to greet mr jarsell who did not look in face did even speak with gesture be invited to come out for moment have wild idea of escape a soon a reached upper portion of wicked house sight of lancet in hand prevented from making dash for liberty knew that merest scratch must make corpse so be not worth while to risk attempt only when be at door of barbaric sitting room whispered to mr jarsell will help to escape know will even now be thinking of way mean perhaps gasped in low whisper then hastily flung open door pushed into room with word of hope ringing in ear halliday faced judge with smile on lip room be filled with people who greeted entrance with roar of anger be spat upon struck at kicked shaken by despairing creature whom have brought to book queen beelzebub seated in big chair at end of apartment smiled viciously when saw reception did not interfere for moment then waved hand let be let be said in malicious silvery voice will have revenge desire let everything be done in order left alone by fury halliday stood with

despair since people be criminal who have inflicted death sorrow on others be strange how hated dose of own medicine even in midst of fear dan found wondering at illogicality of degenerate mob who expected to do evil yet enjoy peace then remembered that cruelty always mean cowardice longer marvelled at expression of dread fear on ghastly face how propose to disband society went on queen beelzebub quite unmoved by agonized wail there be need for to know may be that will break up one will go here there other place be certain that can not keep together since have received news of police

jarsell have always be sorry for so have said girl promptly be very good to dear good be weak way of expressing what owe retorted halliday think of what saved from perhaps queen beelzebub must not have tortured after dan laughed incredulously must have cared to have trusted to mercy tell lillian a have told before already implement of torture be being made ready must have crowned with red hot circlet of steel pinched flesh with red hot pincer oh lillian turned pale be really too dreadful to think be with bolly at mr pelgrin quite ignorant of peril be in wish have be with be glad be not one

girl clinging to be so dreadful when mr laurance came day with police said be at grange thought must have died there there dan soothed a must have soothed fretful child be over done with by way how be freddy so certain that be at grange never quite explained certainty well dear said miss moon drying eye with dan handkerchief when did not hear from in london went down to blackheath with inspector tenson of hampstead saw local inspector called at lord curberry house after what mr laurance told already policeman have be summoned by servant lord curberry be dead of poison found confession saying how have taken because believed that connection with society of fly be found out then servant explained how queen beelzebub have come in aeroplane did not call queen beelzebub servant mean said dan who have heard explanation before be glad to hear again told in lillian soft voice did not know who be a be cloaked veiled told mr laurance that have declared veiled lady have murdered lord curberry be true know true enough in one sense interrupted dan quickly seeing that drove to suicide well well then mr laurance guessed that be queen beelzebub wondered where be went to shed where kept aeroplane heard that have followed at shed thought that be race be said dan grimly again won mr laurance guessed that have followed way to sheepeak although fancied indeed hoped that aeroplane have broken down dreaded lest must get into trouble at sheepeak certainly did although not quite in way freddy expected lillian laughed at memory of escape rubbed soft face on sleeve of coat mr laurance told police about matter wished to telegraph to thawley so that police there might go over to sheepeak mr laurance stopped a fancied might have be taken captive by queen beelzebub that if move be made might hurt intended to hurt very severely then freddy heard from police about numerous telegram in same word calling thirty people to sheepeak be similarity of message made telegraph authority suspicious when police came to ask knowing where queen beelzebub lived from freddy be shown telegram by time who got telegram have come north said lillian quite excited went up by early train yes police with freddy followed delaying action until such time a thought must collar whole gang by jove just came in time freddy be fool to tell be in grange be not quite certain only thought so because wrecked aeroplane be found in field near house oh dan lillian put arm round lover neck mr laurance told how thankful be when saw running along road knew that have escaped might have be thankful also that caused body of police to halt said dan quickly if have not everyone must have be blown up a be very nearly got smashed by falling stick stone what not there must have be ton of dynamite in cellar of grange who do think put there dan queen beelzebub of course said that have made everything ready against possible discovery warned poor mr jarsell that must have to commit last crime crime by jove why best day work woman ever did be to blow up gang of devil suppose mr jarsell did blow up house dan of course did heart softened for reason pushed out of danger then must have gone straight down to cellar set light to stored dynamite explosion happened so quickly after be free that be sure acted in way be certainly efficacious for not one of blackguard men woman remained alive to be hanged well be good thing said miss moon with shudder know that relative must have be disgraced dan nodded quite so name have never become public person that person other person disappeared from various neighborhood from various family circle when relative read about explosion in hillshire freddy brilliant account of infernal society made pretty good guess a to what have happened to disappearing party very few people gave information to police that relative friend have disappeared tenson be rather annoyed a wanted to make big fuss over matter see what bigger fuss must have be made dan why paper be filled with nothing else for week same tenson wanted name of who belonged to gang people declined to give name of who have disappeared from midst know that curberry belonged to gang penn also mr jarsell vincent queen beelzebub only one two other name came to light in print think said lillian thoughtfully that so many well connected people be mixed up in matter that everything be hushed up a much a be possible h be said halliday throwing away butt end of cigar be not unlikely that hint be given in high quarter more need be said than be absolutely necessary heigh ho rose stretched be weary of business come down walk on beach dear let talk about lillian be only too glad lover descended marble step led down gently to sand moon glowed pure silver in sky of darkest blue with old moon in radiant arm in dark ripple fringed with creaming white wavelet murmured on sand at side of bay great cliff bulked huge densely black be night of soft wind glorious moonshine fit for romeo juliet to converse about love yet lillian still harped on prosaic fact of danger dan have escaped perhaps be natural for have assuredly passed through most trying time why did queen beelzebub found wicked society asked lillian wanted power perverted talent to base end in order to gain dear well well have gone to account so need say more about be clever woman fiend incarnate mr jarsell poor soul be example of influence of strong mind on weak one think loathed whole business thoroughly have gone too far to retreat do think mr pelgrin nephew knew anything of matter said halliday very decidedly although tenson have suspicion of george mr jarsell who be used a blind by miss armour in turn used george a blind to say if necessary how seldom went to town forgot to tell lillian that police discovered that mr jarsell leader of society used frequently to motor for mile mile to different station further down line in order to reach london without remark being made mr jarsell only used thawley station so a to get george pelgrin evidence that scarcely ever went to town in way of course be next door to impossible to connect two harmless old lady with many dreadful murder be only cleverness about scent formed link said lillian proud of dan characteristic sharpness by using biplane to travel to blackheath when mr durwin be murdered mr jarsell be able to get mr pelgrin to prove alibi oh be chance that showed mr jarsell complicity on occasion dear said dan modestly that went into animated picture entertainment must never have known be at blackheath suppose miss armour did not feel equal to committing that particular crime so sent mr jarsell to carry out job miss armour be never really paralyzed suppose pretended to be when anyone paid visit do believe that mr jarsell be so old a pretended to be what queer thing human nature be went on dan thoughtfully here be miss armour who must have lived very pleasant comfortable life plunging miserable woman into dangerous crime just for love of power one must have thought that must have liked to show power publicly be quite content to be secret despot suppose gave certain amount of pleasure though be hard for simple person like be to see where came in power must not have be exercised amidst public applause dan seeing what meant quite so police must soon have ended career have infernal sway be known do think asked lillian after pause that member of society expected that explosion answered halliday very promptly else in spite of danger believe half if not whole of must have run out even into arm of police to be hanged in due course seemed to have enormous belief in queen beelzebub who be undoubtedly a clever a father devil member expected that in way must manage to save time a guessed although must not understand what be aiming at be preparing way of getting rid of lot included must have summoned to pretended conference so a to house under one roof then fire mine expect filled cellar of grange age ago with dynamite arranged with mr jarsell to explode mine of course where mr jarsell got better of queen beelzebub be that did not give pleasure of revenging on fired dynamite unexpectedly while miss armour demon be thinking how to torture went well wo say where went there be enough left of to form single human being there be immense hole in ground where grange stood said lillian with awe mr laurance told mildred also daresay that hole will form basis of legend in year to come be dan reply very picturesque story can be made out of material supplied by infernal woman be a wicked cruel callous a ezzelin who played dice with arch fiend by way lillian suppose mildred vincent be very much cut up over death of uncle be not of course regretted awful end that must have be so wicked be never kind to have not much love for know ended miss moon reflectively if can be sure that ever committed crime yes did declared halliday quickly single member of society have to commit crime in order to belong to gang vincent truly believe be not bad man a sole idea be craze for inventing aeroplane queen beelzebub wanting for purpose doubt inveigled into committing a criminal a inveigled mr jarsell curberry poor lord curberry sighed lillian be more to be pitied than blamed think young man who hold title now cared that died can expect to asked dan sceptically seeing have got title lot of money in clean way too for curberry consented to murder of two relative so a to secure what wanted lillian be kind heart make pity curberry be not good man decent fellow must have belonged to association of demon think have discussed subject threadbare let talk of more pleasant matter about mr laurance marriage cried lillian gaily well yes although being selfishly in love must much rather discus own freddy will be able to marry mildred now since have given enough money to start newspaper be very good of think so said miss moon a began to climb step again return to house mr laurance helped to learn who killed dear father deserved reward a did gave money gave so have be rewarded very richly well freddy will make very good proprietor editor of newspaper mildred can help to make success well that end well be quite quite happy dear quite quite only fear dan sighed that people will call fortune hunter seeing that without penny be marrying rich woman lillian stopped in path up to house took hold of lapel of dan coat to shake how can talk such nonsense said reproachfully why after portrait account of have done appearing in paper must have married dozen woman none so sweet a dear said halliday kissing for lip be temptingly near own well must not despise good fortune what can give in return miss croesus promise said lillian earnestly that will not go up more in horrid flying machine will always be afraid of losing if do know that quite well let take tiny little flight occasionally coaxed dan gaily well yes on condition that take if there be accident can be smashed up together argue placed hand on mouth be only way in will agree to flying wilful woman will do what want said halliday resignedly tucked lillian arm beneath own hello there be sir john mr bolstreath on terrace seem to be very happy together so happy whispered lillian in ear that believe pursed up lip looked unutterable thing well said dan laughing must not be at bad thing for sir john to make mr bolstreath lady moon can nurse amuse bury in due course what heap of marriage freddy mildred sir john mr bolstreath see be waving hand to let go inside a be growing trifle chilly hark said lillian raising finger dan listened to hear wild delicious strain of nightingale singing from distant thicket sings of love for whispered of love for what other than song can express feeling darling said lillian kissed fondly clever girl end
