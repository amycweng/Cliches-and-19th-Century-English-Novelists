great excitement in london seemed terrible that so old man titled man at must be murdered in own house by profligate grandson general opinion be that bernard must not only be hanged drawn quartered a crime amounted to parricide vengeful demand be made only by extreme people newspaper be on whole very fair in statement although seemed quite certain that young gore be guilty yet journal gave benefit of doubt not till after inquest did newspaper venture to state that man have really committed crime be a must be if fair play instinct of english race be to be lived up to durham attended inquest a sir simon lawyer executor miss plantagenet attended with saw solicitor only for few minute have little time to exchange opinion durham assured miss berengaria that be certain bernard be innocent upon old gentlewoman clapped on back good opinion be strengthened at inquest by sturdy way in lawyer maintained point beryl be also present with inspector groom looked pale somewhat worried when eye fell on withered resolute face of miss berengaria winced knowing be firm friend to cousin a yet body of young man have not be found durham miss plantagenet be certain that bernard be still alive general opinion be that have be drowned while escaping mr gilroy be also present with lucy sat in body of court near miss berengaria old dame knew well that housekeeper be friend to accused man be not certain a regard lucy a miss randolph be engaged to beryl whom miss berengaria disliked heartily be prepared to think badly of girl going by proverb that like draw to like therefore waited to hear lucy evidence before speaking to although be quite near never turned head to look make sign of recognition inspector groom who be called first detailed how have be summoned in to see dead body of baronet related what evidence have gathered gave also name of witness proposed to call amongst be jane cook also page for three domestic have frequently seen soldier who have courted jane who be believed to be bernard gore durham on authority of bernard did not believe waited time before contradicting evidence after groom came doctor who deposed to having examined body gave a opinion that deceased have be strangled time after ten o'clock before being strangled have be rendered unconscious by chloroform thus have fallen easy victim to assassin mention be made of bandana handkerchief with strangulation have be effected be produced in court handkerchief steeped in chloroform have be bound round mouth be missing be white one according to evidence of housekeeper have be loosened from mouth by bernard when brought up to look on victim groom expressed annoyance at a handkerchief be important piece of evidence being white must not have belonged to deceased who used only colored bandana handkerchief therefore be probable that assassin have used own name on corner must have settled question beyond doubt handkerchief be lost there be more to be said groom hoped to prove gore guilt by evidence of other witness julius beryl deposed that bernard sir simon be at variance mr gilroy gave evidence about quarrel have taken place at hall when young man have be turned away swore that bernard then made use of threatening language have hinted must throw grandfather out of window also explained cause of quarrel name of alice be mentioned much to wrath of miss plantagenet afterwards housekeeper went on to state bernard have visited in crimea square have never seen a be always smuggled out of sight by jane when be heard approaching kitchen on night of murder gore have presented at door after ten o'clock have intimated that sir simon desired to see having sent down message to kitchen to effect coroner who carried message mr gilroy page william mr gore be alarmed left house at once refusing to come up afterwards have apparently changed mind for came to door took up to sir simon left alone coroner did see meeting mr gilroy pushed mr gore into room then went down to wait think sir simon be disposed to be friendly mr gore remained upstairs for about fifteen minute then left house hurriedly saw go out of door called after did not answer then ran upstairs found sir simon dead came down again ran out in pursuit of mr gore cry out beurder ' be almost on doorstep came into house with denied that have killed grandfather loosened two handkerchief then police came escaped persisted in statement said calmly that young gore have certainly killed old man at interview at hall have heard use word strangle sir simon have be murdered in way lucy randolph also gave evidence a to quarrel bernard have fiery temper said weeping when sir simon spoke badly of miss malleson threatened to throw sir simon out of window did not hear use word strangle never saw when came to kitchen at crimea square be only two day before murder mr gilroy recognized by description given by housemaid be quite friendly with bernard evidence led to of jane housemaid be shown photograph of gore swore positively that be face of young soldier who have courted before sir simon came to crimea square have met in park be in uniform of newly formed imperial yeomanry made love to asked if might come to house also seemed to be very inquisitive about sir simon came many time be introduced to cook also william page saw called bernard nothing more did not make use of name of gore whenever mr gilroy be heard coming always hid seemed afraid to meet witness cook connived at concealment a feared rebuke of housekeeper on night of crime message came from sir simon by page william asking bernard to step upstairs displayed great alarm went away at once saying might return to see sir simon after ten witness gave other evidence important point be that identified photograph a of bernard gore also name be same cook page also identified photograph a of mr gore evidence be then given by officer of imperial yeomanry a to gore calling bernard alone be known a corporal bernard on night of murder have obtained leave of absence to dine with friend have left barrack before five be between five six according to cook bernard be in kitchen bernard added officer be not expected back till close on midnight since then nothing have be heard of durham then stepped into box stated that gore have dined with at house on camden hill there be mutual friend present bernard have arrived at seven at house have left at ten o'clock witness produced sir simon letter stating that gore be courting housemaid jane durham swore that bernard have denied said that have not be near house indeed added witness did not know whereabouts of house till told coroner then must have gone from house direct to crimea square durham ca understand why must do so have intention of going certainly have idea of killing sir simon be quite convinced that be innocent expression produced incredulous smile a by time everyone present be certain that gore be culprit thanks to durham representation dick west alias lord conniston be not called be needle to say that real name of witness be not known have be public coroner must have doubtless insisted on production if only to swell scandal of case by addition of title in summing up coroner be quite on side of prosecution public opinion be with pointed out that evidence of cook housemaid page officer showed that bernard gore corporal bernard be one same also there be evidence of mr gilroy who opened door at ten o'clock to man without doubt gore be person who have called to see grandfather a to motive for commission of crime jury must see for that there be strong one mr beryl evidence showed that bitter quarrel existed be confirmed by miss randolph mr gilroy even word strangled have be used in way sir simon have met with death without doubt gore furious at being disinherited have called to see sir simon to see if must be reinstated doubtless a have fiery temper quarrel have taken place then younger man having rendered older one unconscious by mean of chloroform have murdered be certainly inexplicable that must have returned to house then jury must take into consideration that perhaps gore thought bold course might prove innocence finally escape showed that be guilty a have be innocent man must have faced matter out must seem that criminal be dead have fallen into hand of god thus have not escaped punishment on fact before jury must have to give verdict biased by evidence by coroner speech jury brought in verdict of guilty against bernard gore durham expected verdict so did miss plantagenet of being bernard firm friend felt pang when heard thus condemned of wilful murder fool said miss berengaria a drove back in brougham with durham to office of lawyer think that expostulated durham under circumstance jury must hardly bring in different verdict know bernard be innocent snapped lady certainly on evidence before fig for evidence interrupted miss berengaria go by own knowledge of boy must kill fly ah see men on jury never met bernard finding lawyer too strong for miss berengaria changed subject being determined not to acknowledge defeat have heard from young gore asked may be drowned for know for know know nothing more be pity miss plantagenet did know anything might be able to satisfy that gore be alive of course be alive on what ground do say that asked durham surprised on ground of common sense bernard be not man to die when living be needed to prove innocence be so truly feminine argument that durham with shrug held tongue there be more to be said remarked know snapped miss berengaria in bad humor be quite upset by rubbish fool have be talking what be to be done next will go down to gore hall read will have said old lady brightly can do until be sure of death of bernard yes may be dead after be tell then be better must be thought to be so said durham giving up point in face of firm opposition why asked miss berengaria promptly because search will be made for gore must be alive in hiding yet fear beryl will search see why must oh see what mean sir simon horrid old well will say nothing about have left money to beryl after disinheriting bernard for keeping faith with poor alice not exactly that said durham hesitating ca tell content of will miss plantagenet a know snapped need tell that will come to hall hear read of course know already in case there be more to be said replied solicitor suppressing smile miss berengaria saw have said sharply pondering so bernard be not disinherited after never said so smiled be quite enough for ' nod a good a wink to blind horse ' not that be horse blind thank god have eyesight can read print with glass well keep professional secret tell will beryl deuce take hunt for bernard not if think be drowned a be probable said durham rather surprised at hearing strong language from lip of lady if think otherwise will certainly hunt replied lawyer determinedly have said miss berengaria rubbing nose so be be what do mean miss plantagenet bernard have not be disinherited that old scamp must talk better of that good old man who be dead repented left money to rightful heir what joke miss berengaria chuckled there there went on catching durham eye be all right have told nothing can guess well well must wait till will be read then will see what be to be done to prove bernard innocence will be hard task said durham with sigh then added with little hesitation miss plantagenet must beryl make advance to in way of friendship receive hum said lady detest fellow for bernard sake what plan have in head asked sharply peering into troubled face none think that after reading of will miss plantagenet chuckled after reading well beryl may make advance to will receive if think will tell where bernard be to be found be mistaken know where be if be alive said durham astonished to find how quickly fathomed thought true enough will know before many day be over head quite expect bernard will communicate with alice of course will tell a beryl will find that money be left to did not say that interrupted durham quickly a brougham stopped at office door to bernard went on miss berengaria coolly will try learn if be dead alive if dead will no ca say what will do a know if money failing bernard be left to if think bernard be alive will hunt down so a to get money durham stepped out of brougham rather afraid of old dame be so clever that seemed to read most secret thought be glad drive be at end held out hand to say good bye to surprise vexation miss berengaria stepped out at heel be coming in to talk said marched up step go down to night to hurseton want to arrange what be to be done not word young man be bernard friend so be if combine be up with poor fool durham followed energetic lady with feeling of helplessness not knowing very well how to get rid of have particular reason for not having in office conniston be coming to see meeting between aunt might be productive of trouble not that miss plantagenet be aunt a be only distant relative always styled so must answer to other term durham regretted that have accepted lady offer to be driven to office be too late by time for miss berengaria be in room in room also sat lord conniston now out of uniform looking much excited have said miss plantagenet not recognizing young man who be turned to durham who shot past making sign of silence to friend client of mine will leave for moment conniston name slipped out before be aware must have stamped with vexation to see how quickly miss berengaria grasped situation with grim smile looked at astonished young man so be dick said looking at through double eyeglass have seen since made sick in garden bernard told alice by letter that met where be staying understand stammered conniston while durham giving up miss plantagenet a impossible sat shuffling paper ought not to be dense remember boxing ear conniston burst out laughing oh by jove be cousin berengaria aunt berengaria reproved miss plantagenet giving hand like league long name come sit down tell about miss plantagenet said durham hastily lord conniston have met to talk of bernard then will form third said old lady sitting dick will call dick interpolated be bernard friend a letter to alice be about be going to desert said conniston taking entirely into confidence have chucked service to see through trouble chucked what service army be going to front will stop till prove innocence of bernard aunt berengaria know that be alive conniston said lawyer ah do replied dick here be letter from bernard be safe sound hiding at cove castle chapter viii bernard enemy deceased baronet be buried in family vault under st peter church with pomp of wealth sir simon have never be popular have be known widely a hard gripping man yet tragic fate certain pity therefore have drawn together large concourse of people distant relative who hoped to be mentioned in will be present clothed in deepest black although cared very little for dead julius who already regarded a in possession of gore hall be there with long face satisfied heart be glad that have inherited wealth after have long hungered gladder still that rival bernard be dead with stain on name in fancied security moved along not knowing what retribution be in store for even pitying angel must have laughed at complacency durham a solicitor executor of dead man be present directed operation conniston have gone to cove castle to see bernard hear story durham smiled a eye rested on smug face of presumed heir there be love lost between two men julius privately determined that when in possession of property must place legal business in hand of solicitor young lawyer guessed somewhat of smiled ironically a thought how spite must be frustrated from far near people be gathered for murder have made great stir everyone united in condemning bernard not one person in throng thought innocent lucy be weeping alone at hall with mr gilroy offering such cold comfort a must think of for girl be truly sorry for cousin although believed to be guilty theory be that bernard have be goaded into committing rash act by bitter tongue of grandfather be matter of disagreement between julius that must so mourn downfall death of bernard reprovingly advised to keep tear for sir simon from whose death be likely to derive benefit lucy in spite of beryl evil influence have rather warped better nature persisted in weeping for miserable cousin who have so suddenly be cut off in midst of wickedness at least that in face of circumstance be view took of matter alice remained at bower talking over death with miss plantagenet joy when old lady returned with good news that bernard be yet alive have be painful to witness wished to go at once to cove castle miss berengaria by durham advice must not permit suspicion might be excited so be decided that conniston must visit own castle a must seem natural thing for to do merest suspicion that bernard be alive in hiding must set bloodhound of law on trail beryl must be first to loosen therefore alice waited at home with miss berengaria until funeral be over then intended to go to hall to hear will read miss berengaria have idea of punishment awaited julius must not have be absent for half of income detested young man with virulence of honest nature insisted on alice coming also although girl be unwilling again be by durham advice wanted lady to understand exactly how matter stood must save trouble of explanation then since two lady conniston be bent upon proving bernard innocence durham wanted who must be spared did not include conniston to be present so a to daunt bernard enemy must julius lose temper over will be probable that might say something likely to afford clue to true assassin then mr gilroy be enemy also might be unguarded in speech durham have vague idea that knew more than admitted a to lucy be impossible to say whether be friendly hostile sir simon body be duly interred left wealth behind to take up abode in dark vault after service several people lingered in graveyard majority thinking spectacle be at end made haste to go julius with durham returned in carriage rest of relative followed flocking like vulture to feast while in carriage durham thought must see if julius suspected that bernard have escaped have not heard if gore body have be found asked said beryl raising pale eye looking a sad a owl fear be dead in sin ca be sure if did sin mr beryl jury thought so jury be not always infallible think case have fair hearing mr durham so far a be concerned must have be pleased have verdict be otherwise be not pleasant for to have relative accused of such crime since be dead let evil rest with will not hear say word against memory added virtuous julius perhaps will be a well replied durham dryly never be friend of bernard more praise to must not run down tell beryl do really believe committed crime answered indirectly before yes believe be guilty then be just a well be dead just a well asserted beryl quickly think can have escaped julius started what make think so demanded uneasily well see bernard be good swimmer best swimmer in world must hing against current of thames on foggy night on fine day dare say might have gained opposite bank in fog must have circled round round until be exhausted yet clothes be discovered on bank persisted durham wonder if offered reward must anything be discovered corpse might said beryl unpleasantly reward will be offered better let sleeping dog lie surely mr beryl if inherit property will seek for poor fellow dead body replied julius decisively think be best to leave thing alone bernard committed vile act if body have be swept out to sea better for memory position of family will offer reward durham seeing young man be absolutely certain of inheritance that be prepared to act in most niggardly spirit looked out of window to hide smile poor sir bernard said sir bernard questioned supposed heir raising eyebrow certainly on death of sir simon bernard took title have enjoyed long said beryl with so villainous sneer that lawyer longed to pitch out of carriage seeing be dead suppose title becomes extinct doe assented durham gravely bernard be only heir in direct line julius shrugged shoulder well will be quite content with money said here be said durham a carriage stopped by way miss plantagenet miss malleson have come to hear will read hope object yes do retorted beryl angrily a alighted must have shown better taste have remained away remember miss malleson have lost bernard better for must have have miserable life with fellow durham suppressed violent inclination to punch man head knowing what punishment awaited walked up step with contemptuous smile here be change indeed from meek julius of old day presumed heir be obnoxious insolent thinking be absolutely certain of entering into kingdom lawyer be by mean vindictive person afforded certain amount of satisfaction when thought of irony of situation however when julius reached drawing room in invited to hear will read be assembled adopted more conciliatory manner several relative be present mr gilroy headed servant at end of room miss berengaria sat beside alice in recess somewhat screened by window curtain lucy be nowhere to be seen however when durham took seat at small table opened bag entered in deep mourning julius went to meet dear lucy said have buried best friend lucy made reply drawing hand away walked to where alice be seated kissed girl whom bernard have loved in silence in silence be kiss returned even miss berengaria voluble a be on occasion held peace saw that lucy be sincerely sorry for loss of cousin from moment entertained better opinion of alice drew lucy into seat beside two girl sat side by side while julius already assuming air of master bade company welcome be glad to see said in important voice be sure that deceased relative in will have done that kind heart inspired to do mr durham will now read will when sat down of relative smiled at phrase about kind heart for late baronet have be in wise remarkable durham took notice of beryl little speech opened will began to read julius listened with complacent smile changed a reading went on legacy be left to nearly servant who have be with testator long time lucy became entitled to three hundred year mr gilroy received one hundred sum allotted to did not satisfy a frowned when be mentioned beryl name be not mentioned did not mind a be waiting for disposal of residue of estate when durham read out that estate have be left entirely to bernard gore with exception of above named legacy started to foot be not will exclaimed loudly with ghastly white face be heir by former will interposed durham rather must say by will sir simon afterwards destroyed disinherited bernard cried julius savagely will will give mr gore money be never cancelled new will be prepared leaving to read to in office in presence of sir simon quite so rejoined lawyer smoothly folding up parchment after left sir simon refusing to execute will put into fire be lie be truth said durham color rising can bring forward clerk who be to witness new will will state that be never executed sir simon changed mind estate go to sir bernard gore new baronet a executor of will will take charge of monies of property until come forward to claim know be dead said julius clenching hand know nothing of sort be supposed to be dead must have proof of death production of body will be sufficient mr beryl added durham cynically think on own account have better offer that reward spoke of have be playing fool with said julius hardly able to speak for passion advised what to do one moment said precise man who have not be mentioned in will if young gore really be dead for one hope be not case who inherits money there be codicil to effect said durham have intended to read when interrupted by mr beryl re opened parchment in sir simon leaf property to charity with exception of legacy in event of bernard gore making will property have be left unreservedly to must be alive have power to will to whomsoever wish if be dead property go to charity yes will read codicil durham did to dismay of company only miss berengaria chuckled be delighted to see that beryl have be punished smiled when thought how correct have be guess when talking to lawyer a for alice remembering that bernard be alive well found hard to contain satisfaction that have be fairly dealt with even thought of crime under ban of lay faded for moment from mind julius with certain malignancy brought back to recollection even if bernard be not dead can not inherit a felon said pardon interposed lawyer have yet to prove guilt be proved at inquest jury at inquest have not right to condemn man said durham sharply if sir bernard julius winced at title be alive come forward will do best to prove innocence in case said miss berengaria in clear tone mr beryl doe not benefit julius turned on with fury seemed on point of breaking out into wrathful speech habitual dissimulation came to aid suppressed more than that attempted to smile say that feel hurt said with desperate attempt at cheerfulness sir simon distinctly named a heir moreover asked mr durham to read new will in be named a such perfectly true said durham coldly sir simon changed mind burnt new will be never executed a say sir simon have right to do what liked with own said diplomatic beryl while miss berengaria wondering what be in mind watched with keen eye a say be hurt quite understood that sir simon have disinherited cousin be prepared to allow income have received property two hundred year said lawyer munificent offer be approved by sir simon said julius calmly however appears that sir simon rescinded new will be never executed then will say never executed money go to bernard gore so far a believe be dead hope mr durham a executor of estate will offer reward to prove if be dead alive with regard to commission of crime jury at inquest found bernard guilty without one dissenting voice however be willing to give cousin benefit of doubt must reappear hope may will do best to aid to prove innocence hope word may have escaped in heat caused by disappointment will be overlooked whether of present believed statement be impossible to say everyone looked down response be made save by miss plantagenet rose walking across room offered hand to disappointed heir be good young man said heartily hope will come see julius rather taken aback by invitation from one whom have cause to think loved little grasped hand thanked with great fervency speech be relief to sat down with calmer face when old lady returned to seat why did do aunt asked alice dismayed dear whispered miss berengaria with grim smile that young man mean mischief be taking mr durham advice making friend with may thwart plan be whispered so softly that lucy did not overhear have be spoken aloud must have attended durham have come forward be speaking earnestly to trust will stop at hall for present said until bernard come home will bernard ever come home asked lucy sighing let hope so doubt if be dead will not believe be until body be laid before a to crime believe committed however want to stay here a chatelaine of hall thing will go on a before be to stay sir asked mr gilroy coming forward yes will servant be changed of course of who wish to leave can do so will stop on in old position if miss randolph wish lucy nodded yes let thing remain a be said mr gilroy made stiff curtsey returned to other servant who then filed in orderly manner out of room relative also took leave amongst julius now smiling at door lucy said something to about bernard smiled darkly have yet to prove bernard be alive said danger thought miss berengaria will watch young man chapter ix at cove castle five mile from hurseton marsh began did not end until touched coast there be acre of mud

good friend dick said smoking luxuriously be first moment of peace have known since awful moment how did escape asked conniston lighting cigarette threw into river swam across in fog yes be guided by pier of chelsea bridge on opposite side took off coat hat left lying on bank so that might be thought be drowned be exactly what people do think said dick complacently thank heaven for well then went into public house found open be not yet midnight made up story about having be robbed thrown into river be dangerous public house people might have advised to see police think landlord have love for police said gore dryly looked like old convict displayed fellow sympathy know if believed story however for sovereign gave coat hat asked question walked across waterloo bridge in fog escaped observation for fog expect military breech legging must have betrayed provoked question managed to escape did sleep at walked whole night by dawn be out of london lost several time in fog twice have row with tramp two then took train at wayside station to gravesend crossed river to tilbury did anyone ask question bernard shook head new yeomanry uniform be known in part expect gaiter made people

then next morning wrote to what made think of place bernard must think of nowhere to hide said gore leaning back with weary sigh after added with glance round be very good cache conniston nodded be quite safe here will show way to vault must there be chance of being discovered can hide there doe victoria know about vault ca say probably juda brat have told be brought up here know nook cranny of castle now bernard must have good dinner then can tell whom suspect of committing crime chapter x statement of case bernard alias mr grant have made free with conniston clothes a mr moon have stated being much taller than friend looked rather uncomfortable indeed have hidden shortcoming of garment under gorgeous dressing gown relic of dick 'varsity day conniston have procured through durham several suit of gore clothes have be left behind at hall when be turned away by grandfather have brought with bernard be glad enough to get into comfortably fitting garment society of conniston good dinner super excellent port made feel new man after dinner two friend piled fire with great log a be freezing hard without mr moon brought up coffee hot strong when left room young men produced pipe then conniston sat on one side of fire bernard on other of prepared to go into case to see exactly how matter stood in first place said dick filling pipe carefully let consider what actually happened sir simon be alone that evening be when found dead unless call mr gilroy anyone call very important person said dick dryly tell what gore evidently know everything just tell what do know have told said bernard impatiently left durham house at ten o'clock mentioned time did responded conniston gravely mentioned also day of month be twenty third of october will ever forget date so ominous to left house small boy stopped said that lady did not mention name have told to inform to follow to red window cousin lucy knew of yes thought lady in question be lucy boy did not mention name simply said that have be spoken to by lady down kensington way now knew from durham that lucy be living with sir simon who be in crimea square kensington that knowledge coupled with mention of red window made follow boy can describe lad not very well caught glimpse of under lamp post fog be so thick that obtained only vague impression seemed to be fair innocent looking boy with fair hair kind of pure angelic creature depicted by painter a chorister by jove conniston dashed down pipe excitedly describe juda to life plot thickens plot plot be to involve in crime by jove who contrived must have hired juda to be guide be sure that be lad mr moon grandson a sure a can be from word painting jerry juda suit much better be just what say innocent butter wo melt in mouth sort of brat who look like angel act like denizen of infernal region now remember went on dick little brute spoke to after left when talked in park be then bare footed selling match boy must be same said bernard thoughtfully also have bare foot carried box of match in hand be juda sure enough muttered conniston pulling mustache staring gloomily into fire wonder what be doing in galley followed yes because mentioned red window for must have suspected something wrong care about following strange urchin only lucy knew about red window might have told beryl what do mean never mind go on with tale well followed boy kept little ahead of several time when got lost in fog reappeared juda be a clever a father accuser of brother how long be getting to crimea square allowing for stoppage three quarter of hour trouble took place about quarter to eleven did see red window saw red glare in window on first floor suppose glass be red think red material must have be placed over lamp placed close to window might have be blind mused dick yet when beryl looked friend mr webber saw red window be sure be certain responded gore emphatically when saw red window be convinced that lucy have sent for thinking that have persuaded grandfather to relent must have entered house for personal interview that mr gilroy came out must be seen from house think so fog be very thick remember be signal given bernard looked hard at friend think be trap be certain be there signal peculiar kind of whistle something like gore whistled in kind of ascending scale shrilly in particularly high key effect on conniston be strange jumped up from seat walked hurriedly to fro juda said remember when be down here that little scamp have kind of whistle like something like listen conniston whistled also bernard nodded be declared whistle be given twice then boy be juda used to signal to victoria in way when pair be up to prank wait conniston opened door whistled loudly in same way twice did shortly after second time pattering of step be heard victoria came running up stair with lighted candle in hand looked white scared did expect to see jerry asked master blandly girl stared turned even whiter than be thought be jerry sir murmured leaning against balustrade used to whistle like when came home learned from jerry said conniston mendaciously tried to see if must bring go downstairs girl there be nothing wrong victoria stared at conniston with suspicious look in hard eye then with toss of head ran down stair dick returned to room shut door what do think now be juda sure enough said bernard of course signal be given to someone in house to intimate that be outside who came out mr gilroy ah then must have be waiting for signal by way always seemed mixed over mr gilroy when first met said that did like then said be friend now do think be can hardly say always pretended to be friend be never sure of then can be sure of now be bitter enemy be afraid so sighed gore remembering accusation well said dick resuming seat what next mr gilroy came out screeching beurder ' dragged upstairs into sitting room did notice if there be red lamp in window be too horrified by sight of dead grandfather loosened handkerchief round throat be bandana sir simon own be produced at inquest what about one over mouth one steeped in chloroform know have in hand when mr gilroy accused then lost head must have dropped conniston looked disappointed that be pity said fancied might have unconsciously taken with see be white handkerchief sir simon never used one of color if there happened to be name on corner must be that of assassin be that what mean yes be what mean assassin must have used own handkerchief why do think that dick made impatient gesture why be most natural thing must do be reply enters room talk with sir simon in pocket have handkerchief steeped in chloroform us unexpectedly be a clear a day why do think assassin be man will tell that later go on there be nothing more to say mr gilroy said be assassin tried to hold policeman came arrested seeing what fix be in bolted must have stood ground insisted dick bernard rose in turn paced room man alive how must do that said irritably position be dangerous enough to appal bravest man mr gilroy accused saying that have be in kitchen have left there about six have returned after ten killed grandfather also housemaid jane recognized a soldier who have be courting not only that addressed a bernard ca see how strong circumstantial evidence be be did not get to durham before seven be by before ca prove alibi then left at ten after hour mr gilroy said have come into house in three quarter of hour there be ample time for to kill grandfather be barely quarter of hour walk from durham house on camden hill to crimea square must not prove alibi must durham have helped be at durham in evening where be before six after ten dick have stayed must have be hanged thought flashed through mind made dash for liberty so that might have time to think out position how gained refuge know here have be thinking ever since how to extricate from dilemma prove innocence ca see how to do dick ca see how to act steady old boy come sit down will thresh out matter led bernard back to chair into poor fellow threw with weary sigh conniston must not acknowledge that case against friend be very strong a must not prove alibi evidence of mr gilroy of cook page housemaid must probably hang also sufficient motive for crime might be found by jury in fact that bernard have quarrelled with grandfather have be disinherited then to perplex affair still more juda have disappeared red window on evidence of beryl mr webber be non existent certainly lady declared saw afterwards thought have be mistaken in interval someone must have removed red light be detail must be argued later in meantime be necessary to fix if possible identity of soldier who have haunted kitchen who apparently so strongly resembled bernard a to be mistaken for by jane be plot said conniston at length while bernard gazed despairingly into burning log fellow who resembled who took name be assassin how do make out why be in kitchen before six be sent for by grandfather at once left then came back after ten be admitted by mr gilroy who might have made mistake must not mistake man for know fellow evidently be double at least be made up to resemble must not be easy added conniston staring at friend for have beard mustache be difficult to make up like chap without such aid at least must think so remember lamp in hall did not give very good light so durham told housemaid saw only in light therefore might have mistaken for fellow who courted mr gilroy saw in full glare of light in sitting room recognized yes according to evidence only admitted double just after ten introduced into sitting room did not see save under hall lamp be true grandfather must soon detect imposition quite right rejoined dick smoothly did then assassin murdered after stifling with chloroform forget grandfather be passionate man might probably must have made scene mr gilroy below must have heard row must have come up may be lying when declares heard nothing admitted dick on other hand assassin may have crossed directly over to grandfather have stifled cry by placing handkerchief at once over mouth then must strangle at leisure clear out a did then mr gilroy run up find dead rush out to accuse must have be brought in nick of time said bernard ironically dick there be more in than mr gilroy be in plot contrived why beryl contrived wanted money be in house at time did commit crime if be what mean with miss randolph be at curtain theatre be near crimea square drove up in friend mr webber carriage just when row be on yes bernard passed hand across forehead must have remembered be in hall at time with hand of policeman on shoulder have grown so confused dick that be like dream nightmare rather why do think mr gilroy be be in plot because before accused said to herself loud enough for to hear be only way have ho said conniston excited can swear to of course can ca swear in dock be only place be likely to occupy must be caught be mr gilroy friend of beryl ca say that be ever anyone friend even seemed to hate grandfather although be so good to lucy be always quarrelling though behaved civilly to be a said before never sure of can certainly be sure of now ca help thinking beryl have something to do with plot have lot at stake have heard tale about gambling must open eye durham made business to find out when heard that sir simon intended to disinherit in favor of beryl durham have always be friend said bernard wearily a beryl be out of house ca have anything to do with crime be not so certain of that might have set thing in train then have arranged theatre business so a to provide with alibi think hired someone to represent do though a say must be hard for anyone to disguise like have double have not that ever heard of said gore unable to restrain smile say everyone have double well must hunt out yours if find soldier who resembled who called by name will be able to prove that committed crime how can go to work hardly know bernard must ask durham meantime can stay here there be juda will make business to hunt out daresay be employed by beryl also how harp on beryl because be sure have everything to do with matter be carefully arranged trap have fallen into mr gilroy expects to gain ca think however beryl have found mistaken over money new will so durham told to tell be burnt by old man so old one giving stand mr gilroy mr beryl be left out in cold be better for safety why asked bernard looking puzzled because person hired to do business double will expect to be paid large sum if not will round on forget if confesses put rope round own throat according to theory true enough there be juda will have pound of flesh make unholy row dick said bernard seriously be impossible that lad of thirteen can be such villain a make out to be tell that lad be born criminal if go on a be doing will come to gallows where according to grandmother forefather suffered before juda be a cunning a fox very strong a to will also be greedy of money describe man of experience know where juda got experience said conniston coolly a mr gamp said of bailly junior wickedness of world be print to ' ca believe of lad will have opportunity of testing day retorted young lord only hope victoria doe correspond with juda if doe will tell about stranger at cove castle juda having seen with in park will be quite sharp enough to put two two together then there will be trouble why must connect with crime unless unless know all doe be marked man bernard however be getting late will talk of to morrow must go see durham bring down ostensibly for shooting wish must bring alice over said bernard heart ache for sight of sweet face dearly face have cost said conniston however will ask dear aunt to come over bring alice a miss berengaria be relative will be thought nothing out of way will save yet bernard only wish have that one piece of evidence handkerchief lost when be found will know who be guilty chapter xi mr gilroy past after making lucy mistress of hall until return of legal master mark durham returned to town having regard to fact that beryl have taken up quarter at conniston arm for what purpose lawyer must not determine thought wiser not to arouse crafty young man suspicion by visit to cove castle certainly be somewhat over strained sense of caution since being conniston lawyer must easily have gone there without being thought odd durham knew that julius driven to desperation by loss of fortune must stop at nothing to accomplish wish to obtain did learn that bernard be still alive must undoubtedly blackmail in present position of case when truth must not be arrived at bernard for own safety must be obliged to make term such term a beryl must demand must not be granted durham therefore returned to business at once set to work so far have done that must to settle government of property during gore absence now remained to take such step a must unravel intricacy of what appeared to be plot to oust from right that julius be at bottom of whole affair durham be certain that julius have eye on conjectured therefore behooved to move cautiously lest beryl must counterplot a in game dealt with issue of life death durham card be on table beryl be concealed chance of victory lay with latter if julius won must certainly have mercy conniston have written letter directed to london office stating in full conversation have taken place between sir bernard durham be therefore in full possession of fact not known to julius after turning over in mind concluded that must be best to start with examination of jane riordan delinquent housemaid must not possibly be in plot a have seen how simple woman be when at inquest therefore certainly for strange reason believed bernard to be young soldier who have courted have sworn to photograph have addressed in hall of crimea square house by name apparently here durham thought with conniston person have be impersonating bernard so lawyer sent message to miss riordan asking to call then intended to question a to personality speech of double housemaid arrived dressed in best looking rather downcast be evidently nervous must not think what lawyer wanted with like class have wholesome horror of legal procedure always kept out of clutch of law appeared that for share in receiving follower have be dismissed by master mr jefferies being without situation grasped at chance afforded of seeing durham hoped by working on sympathy to secure new one for want must probably have refused invitation a be duly appeared be accommodated with seat beside durham desk then proceeded to question thinking plain straightforward examination must best get at truth now then said durham wheeling round chair so that must look in face know be solicitor of sir bernard gore who be accused of murder of grandfather in spite of evidence given believe be guilty think so sir sobbed jane who have got out handkerchief at mention of name never knew yes did courted for nearly month sweet young man be very best ever walked out with durham eyed keenly apparently be speaking a believed considered that double must resemble bernard in marvellous degree to make housemaid thus sure of identity with accused young baronet misunderstand said mildly however will come to point presently must answer a though be in witness box yes sir said miss riordan timidly please before speak must help to new situation mr jefferies dismissed because walked out with bernard received in kitchen hum said durham reflectively did not know very well what to say at outset a be by mean prepared to promise to assist off hand on consideration saw necessity of keeping so valuable witness under own eye away from beryl always supposing beryl to be mixed up in matter therefore made up mind swiftly in answer gained jane goodwill yes can help said housekeeper want housemaid will give address letter to go to camden hill if character be satisfactory will engage oh thank sir said jane effusively be sure character be can be desired save in last trouble bernard be such agreeable there there interrupted durham cutting short wo talk of just now last episode of career will not stand in way of housekeeper engaging will make clear to in letter come now will answer question yes sir like to ask said jane delighted at granting of petition privately thinking durham sweet gentleman good said lawyer in official manner what be name jane riordan durham noted other answer down be how long at mr jefferies six month sir when did first see soldier bernard sir in park about month before sir simon came how did become acquainted with jane giggled looked down well sir said blushing be not bad looking bernard called bernard yes sir said be corporal in imperial yeomanry have seen in crimea square in house sir leaving house said have come several time being taken with look that always wanted to know a be so handsome sir spoke so civil walked out treated to tea in park then asked to meet cook accepted at once sir most willingly daresay muttered durham seeing in meeting how scamp have forced company on girl so a to enter house likely to be occupied by sir simon came many time sir oh many time made so agreeable that cook be quite jealous who did say be well sir did nothing hint saying be gentleman of high rank a must be seen from manner that have enlisted because of quarrel have with grandfather never knew be sir simon grandson until lost sobbed jane oh dear to think must have be lady gore with diamond fine clothes have lived hum said durham digging point of pencil into blotting paper so practically told story of sir bernard yes sir a afterwards learned be that natural sir seeing be sir bernard be sure be jane stared why sir be always frightened when mr gilroy came down to kitchen said be enemy that if saw must never marry did know what meant at time see now must have said who be used to hide in cupboard once in coal cellar cook william never told being sympathetic like did speak in educated manner like gentleman be sir having be educated at eton when saw in grasp of policeman did recognize be same man who courted jane stared again looked puzzled there be two sir that know of said now with fresh burst of tear there be one seeing be drowned oh dear dear yes sir knew at once although light be bad when must have seen plainer mr gilroy must not let be brought under lamp oh indeed said durham making note of look here held out large portrait of bernard different to shown at inquest recognize suppose bernard sir be good likeness jane examined photograph closely not what 'd call very good one sir be other there be look wanting what sort of look well sir might call roguish look of gentleman who have seen life have be gay portrait be sad horrid looking must have be afraid to be courted by bernard if have looked like be always bright full of lark then have not got spot on chin a have here suppose cut shaving when have done durham started here be mean of identification bernard have rather large mole on left of chin did man who walked out with have spot said purposely adopting word have used no sir have chin like new born infant smooth white did ever write letter jane blushed again just short note making appointment sir said feeling in breast being early for love letter being most respectable young lady carry next heart durham took note handed without hesitation glanced through writing be not unlike of bernard saw very plainly that lacked several characteristic distinguished that of gore note simply asked jane to meet writer on sunday at marble arch be signed bernard will give sovereign for said durham quietly thank sir said jane accepting without moment hesitation of course bernard dead now so there be use keeping letter if 'd be alive 'd have kept on chance of not making lady gore did wear ring asked durham paying money putting letter away three sir two gold one silver be point of difference bernard hated ring never by chance wore not even signet ring by time jane information be exhausted durham concluded examination for moment must be able to resume later when necessary congratulated on fact that have secured jane a housemaid when brought face to face with real bernard must be able to see difference between double then might also be able to recognize double must be found just a be dismissing jane with letter to housekeeper clerk brought in name written on piece of paper mr gilroy said durham to wondering greatly tell to come in said aloud ushered jane out quickly by door must never have done to have let gilroy meet seeing that hall housekeeper be hostile to bernard so jane departed rejoicing durham went back to desk well satisfied bernard never wrote note a be different in many way to writing murmured bernard never wear ring have mole on chin double apparently lack without doubt impersonation have be very clever wonder how be to find double before must reply to perplexing question clerk showed in mr gilroy a demure sly looking a ever be richly dressed in black silk much better dressed in fact than have ever be during life of master also durham noted that there be aggressive air about have not noticed before perhaps be due to receipt of annuity be not lady yet must not be called common durham have never examined carefully before now that be dangerous to gore interest looked at carefully strange woman dangerous be verdict proceeded to feel way cautiously wondering what have come about be to see about annuity said tentatively yes replied mr gilroy coldly took seat have be vacated by jane beggarly annuity lawyer who have taken up position before fire with hand under tail of frock coat turned to look at bitterness of tone startled what do mean mean echoed mr gilroy with vindictive glitter in pale eye that sir simon promised five hundred year for life oh must be mistaken said durham quickly never said be to have more than one hundred might not to did to said housekeeper doggedly have right to five hundred think not said lawyer calmly let tell mr gilroy that sir simon did not place name at in second will have be executed must not have have even one hundred despise therefore may congratulate watched face while speaking that sir simon changed mind about disinheriting grandson woman eye glittered still more maliciously color rose in bloodless cheek oh said with icy disdain so sir simon must have deprived of right must be lucky be dead 'd find on wrong side of hedge with ah durham resumed seat waited to hear what must come forth something must come out not easily attainable at other time for mr gilroy be apparently losing temper be most extraordinary for a be usually cautious since death of master who have kept in check seemed to be much more reckless woman lawyer have always wondered what bond held sir simon housekeeper together now there seemed likelihood that must learn if held tongue allowed full play to of mr gilroy knew how must be muttered guessed must play false never be worth kekaubi be gipsy said durham looking up what make say that kekaubi be romany for kettle must use unless who be be nothing to interrupted mr gilroy sharply yet resemble romany said durham looking at drab appearance eye be pale hair let appearance be mr durham be here for justice not to hear look discussed sir simon left one hundred year want a executor of estate to make five hundred promised know that promised that sum said solicitor even if did can not give to money now belongs to sir bernard gore be supposed to be dead put rightly replied man be supposed to be dead until dead body be found will administer estate on behalf have power to help mr gilroy seemed struck by view of case suppose sir bernard be dead asked durham felt qualm suppressed start with difficulty have dangerous woman discovered fugitive at cove castle do know if be alive asked durham quietly looking at perhaps said mr gilroy who seemed to be thinking then rose know that need bother further said will tell why demand money because sir simon promised to on what ground on very good ground will tell what be will give five hundred year if do countered be out of power when sir bernard appears will speak to on subject if claim be good one claim be excellent one burst out raising to full height be claim of wronged woman paused want to ask about will said be worded that money be left 'to grandson ' to grandson bernard gore name be mentioned be money be clearly left to sir bernard sir bernard sneered why give title to have claim money may be else must not tell now do tell son be baronet son michael durham stared at quite taken aback what on earth be talking about mr gilroy demanded mr gilroy echoed with scorn will no longer use false name be mr walter gore impossible walter gore be married to bianca tolomeo be married to first said mr gilroy rapidly yes may stare be lawful wife of walter gore son michael be heir be image of father there be trickery about matter image of father cried durham sudden light breaking in upon walter gore be tall image of son bernard mr gore mr gilroy call be son who murdered grandfather woman became livid swear did be in america be in england masqueraded a bernard when courting jane housemaid said durham excitedly say resembled walter gore bernard be exactly like father so michael must resemble sufficiently to pas a be absolutely false cried mr gilroy seeing have fallen into trap of own word son be in america will not prove guilty opened door to bernard to michael perhaps mistook

hesitated wondering if must be right to tell friend that mr gilroy claimed to be first wife of walter gore on rapid reflection decided to say nothing about matter at present knowing bernard violent temper therefore confined to bare detail mr gilroy called at office said slowly to complain that one hundred year left to by sir simon be not enough oh confound mr gilroy said gore impatiently want to know about check double who presented must be fellow who masqueraded in kitchen perhaps who know may have murdered sir simon be not unlikely mr gilroy said admitted someone like a thought about ten

impetuous boy back into chair behave like civilized being mr gilroy claim to be father first wife if life if what say be true mother oh must kill woman gore said lawyer seriously talk like remember what trouble be now in owing to former rash word yes yes bernard struck forehead hard know be fool did mean mark started up despite other effort to keep down do believe said durham promptly if mr gilroy be real wife must not have kept silent so long think be deceived by pretended marriage that sir simon knowing helped always wondered what be bond between now know father deceived woman why do think have anything to do with father at mark whole story may be trumped up be quite sure that tale be true save a to marriage be durham reply say that might not have be deceived with pretended marriage that thought be right be not real wife mother born tolomeo be be legitimately sir bernard gore reason for thinking speaks truly will give one sufficient one mr gilroy declared that son michael gore so termed be heir explained that there must be deception a be image of father oh bernard started to foot seeing light be image of father a be always said man must be be be sure of michael half brother be man resembling who masqueraded probably at instance of mother daresay saw sir simon on night be admitted by mother probably insisted that be heir sir simon lost temper then killed old man mr gilroy put crime on to shoulder see said durham dryly wish did for instance see why be brought to crimea square in nick of time for mr gilroy to accuse understand about red window gore walked up down room much agitated mark cried at last must come out face ca sit still here knowing that villainy be about must insisted mark firmly remember be lawyer will look after interest to say nothing of conniston who have remained in england for sake wait bernard in good time will bring forward what will do will see mr gilroy question again declared that son be in america when accused to of having killed sir simon now michael undoubtedly presented check at beginning of october murder took place at end of month so michael be in england when place fact before mr gilroy may give in confess confess what that be innocent whether will acknowledge that michael son committed crime ca say will see to morrow left word with miss randolph to day must solution of mystery lie with mr gilroy where can son be found that must learn may be able to force to speak when find michael can reappear then matter will be threshed out jane will soon be able to distinguish between corsican brother meantime remain quietly here must must yet yet wo think be doing best for do know do mark after position be terrible make worse by acting impulsively will keep advised of go on when doe conniston return to morrow with alice miss berengaria went over to day saw there expect will stop night well while be here with miss malleson aunt will see mr gilroy if refuse to speak murmured gore anxiously have mean to make speak said durham significantly chapter xiv love in exile next day at twelve o'clock durham went back to hurseton to see mr gilroy alone must relate true story of night before left bernard related incident about have forgotten to tell on previous night did ever see uncle guiseppe tolomeo asked several time replied bernard with very pleased expression assisted with money be kind of person who will always have to be assisted be lawyer reply fear be scamp old fellow so grandfather said think be good man same be mother brother must assist will give opportunity to do so said durham dryly have visit from other day what did want errand be similar to of mr gilroy wished to know if sir simon have made provision for in will know on what ground based claim a grandfather hated evidently expected to be remembered told must get nothing then with true italian excitability began to lament that have not lived saying must have helped will certainly do that be uncle when be said done what be doing playing violin in orchestra fellow be gentleman bernard thorough scamp since can earn own bread think be wise for to let live on money there be chance at present of letting believe will allow said gore rather dolefully what else did say rather strange thing said that told sir simon that red lamp must not bring red window mean uncle knew about one at hall when mother be alive staying a did for time with sir simon used to put light in red window so a to tell tolomeo that must meet in garden on evening window be visible through long avenue can easily be seen from road run past ground poor mother used a signal to brother a lucy used a signal to believe that in day gone by in charles first day be used in like manner to warn loyal cavalier tolomeo did not say red window replied durham wrinkling brow red lamp make think must have be with sir simon on fatal evening bernard looked up alertly brow grew dark how do make out well said durham after pause questioned jane riordan again about possibility of there having be red light visible there be interrupted gore decisively saw mr webber saw although afterwards disappeared well jane told that there be lamp on table in front of window saw when went up with cook miss randolph remember be in grip of policeman then said gore well be strange seeing that apartment be lighted by electricity that lamp must have stood in front of window what do infer asked bernard doubtfully uneasily much cousin told sir simon about use made of red window cousin miss randolph mean when be at curtain theatre with beryl believe put lamp in window to attract have lamp red glass red bandana handkerchief such a sir simon used might have be stretched across window daresay did did know knew house objected gore true enough unless here durham hesitated unless be grandfather who sent jerry moon to lure to square juda a conniston call be beryl tool must rather believe that beryl placed red handkerchief across window there be handkerchief found said durham mr webber saw red light yet when beryl went out to look for must see none must what do infer from bernard that handkerchief must have be removed in meanwhile by beryl bernard recollected not by beryl mr gilroy prevented going up stair lucy cook jane riordan went up one of must have removed handkerchief tell what mark added bernard thoughtfully be lucy who placed lamp by window stretched handkerchief across know that handkerchief be so stretched said durham must have be to cause red light insisted gore lucy always have idea of red window be then friendly with beryl might have made use of jerry moon to bring to square in hope that seeing red light might venture into house interview grandfather well said durham rising will ask miss randolph also can question young juda who be now with miss plantagenet bernard did not answer with head on hand be pondering deeply one thing ca understand said after pause why do connect uncle guiseppe with red window with red lamp in especial instance for lack of red glass lamp be used be not ordinary lighting of room remember now tolomeo must have be in room must have seen lamp to make use of such expression so believe be with sir simon when lucy beryl be at theatre yes said durham looking directly at gore tolomeo be italian bernard jumped up nervously do mean to hint tolomeo may have strangled grandfather yes do tolomeo may have come to see indeed must have done so to make use of such expression a bed lamp ' two quarrelled perhaps uncle losing temper ca believe said gore walking anxiously to fro tolomeo be wild not wicked that depends on what call wicked said durham dryly preparing to take leave however can leave clue if clue be alone at present have to do be to question mr gilroy about son also may see miss randolph jerry moon of one thing be certain bernard grandfather have several visitor during evening half brother michael came also uncle one of two must rather believe mr gilroy strangled old man be quite capable of doing so said durham coolly think did death be unfortunate for scheme be of more value to alive than dead might be that michael killed sir simon that mr gilroy be using a scapegoat however learn truth from to day if theory be correct tolomeo be innocent quite so will give benefit of doubt want to know what be doing with sir simon on evening may be able to tell something if be innocent gore shuddered be most involved case said hopelessly quite agree with have long dark road to travel before come to light however durham clapped bernard on back keep up spirit if time money friendship can put right conniston will see thing through meantime a miss malleson be coming here day make happy worry might a well put kettle on fire say boil durham shrugged shoulder said more what with isolation anxiety bernard be growing morbid only cure lay in truth being discovered therefore durham set out to discover from mr gilroy left young man to by mean pleasant meditation day be fine

to lad observation that so quickly conjectured mysterious stranger at castle must be bernard jerry knew that conniston be close friend of gore saw at once bernard have sought refuge of castle where must remain undiscovered for victoria hint jerry must never have guessed be duty to communicate knowledge to beryl for reason of own connected with chance of reward bribe to hold tongue from someone who must pay better than beryl say lord conniston jerry determined to wait quietly to see how thing must turn out meanwhile strolled round to fowl where thought likely tramp if be tramp might come if not tramp might come way also a easiest to enter ground poultry yard be carved out of large meadow by side of garden ran back considerable distance from high road at far end be fenced with thin plantation of elm wire netting stout fence surrounded yard there be gate opening on to meadow aforesaid jerry hovered round precinct watching did not expect luck however boy being born bloodhound waited for sheer excitement of thing now happened that miss berengaria have left house of pair of cochin fowl unlocked must have gone out to lock that be so weary same must not delegate duty to servant a considered might not execute commission properly finally alice offered to go after putting on thick waterproof large pair of rubber boot belonged to miss plantagenet ventured out thus be that paddled round to yard with lantern came into neighborhood of jerry suspicious young man immediately thought have heard of bernard coming have come out to meet snuggled into corner near gate watched a best must in darkness be pouring rain sky be black with swiftly moving cloud streamed across face of haggard looking moon in flaw of wind down came rain in perfect drench alice with dress drawn up lantern in one hand umbrella of gamp specie extended above head ventured into yard locked up precious fowl then came back round by gate to see if be barred to surprise be open rather annoyed closed again put up bar then took way round by side of house to enter by front door jerry followed with step of red indian be rewarded just a alice turned corner of house heard groan almost stumbled over body lying on flower bed under wall of house at first gave slight shriek before must step back man clutched foot alice alice moaned man save be bernard bernard here said alice with shudder wondered how have come from castle turned light on to face then started back be not bernard in circle of light saw jerry slinking along side of fence saw also pale thin face with wild look on hair be long matted there be scrubby growth on chin eye be sunken for want of food still be bernard face that have seen on very afternoon must have be deceived until have made closer acquaintance with tramp alice having heard story of mr gilroy son knew at once that miserable creature be michael be representing to a bernard mindful of durham advice after first start of alarm determined to treat a though believed be lover can get to foot said touching although soul shuddered within when thought what man have done yes said michael hoarsely tried to rise assisted to foot weight almost made sink must get servant said trying to disengage said man in voice of hoarse terror will give up remember what have done alice did remember indeed shuddered again be needful for clearing of bernard that must carry on comedy so a to detain man word from that knew who really be must fly at once when chance of saving gore must be at end therefore half led half dragged round corner of house in driving rain jerry waited two disappeared last gleam of lantern vanished then went back to kitchen unconcernedly where have be asked james sternly looking to see if poultry gate be right said jerry see mr james tramp might come in there be duty to shut have shut said jerry with assumed sulkiness now give lip young sir will knock head off do hear tramp about said jerry mendaciously safe with wonderful sense in lad of age said more then sat down to card with cook never made solitary mention of what be going on in front of house a quite expected miss plantagenet never sent for of servant will manage job thought jerry playing cheerfully when retired to bed have wonderful lot to think about more than ever determined to watch way wind blew so a to make a much money out of knowledge a possible jerry be marvellously precocious criminal knew much more than be good for miss berengaria must have fainted unaccustomed a be to indulge in such weakness have known kind of youth sheltered under roof poor miss berengaria have hand full left front door open for return of alice heard close with bang at once started from seat before fire in drawing room to rebuke girl for such carelessness anger changed to astonishment when alice appeared at door streaming with wet supporting man aunt cried alice dropping man in heap eagerly closing door here be bernard bernard exclaimed miss plantagenet staring yes yes said alice passing over pinching aunt arm see how pale be hungry escaped have come for to save if police man on floor who be in half stupor half rose police police said thickly wild eye glared will confess everything alice be be dropped again by time miss plantagenet accepting hint of alice pinch be beginning to grasp situation scarcely relished having murderer under roof for sake of bernard felt that also must aid in deception must not conceive how michael must have audacity to pas off a bernard to one who knew so intimately a alice at same time saw wonderful likeness to gore michael might have be twin michael have not mole be brother distinguishing mark still unless michael knew about bernard life unless be educated like unless knew way trick manner be impossible that must hope to deceive alice even miss berengaria also there be thing to be considered how came man in plight have received one thousand pound from sir simon in beginning of october therefore must have plenty of money yet here be thin haggard in squalid rag evidently hunted fugitive be not comedy got up to deceive for woman saw that man really be suffering be now lying in stupor for that might have sense enough to know what said so both be cautious after glance exchanged between must take bernard up to turret room said miss berengaria promptly will be all right to night then can send for payne to morrow help with alice aunt servant will hold tongue will see to bless murmured half stupefied man ca thank for oh if only knew want to tell something never mind just now said old lady sharply try get up stair supported by alice then will put to bed give something to eat will be safe asked man looking round anxiously quite safe do think must let be taken bernard said alice although soul sickened in at deception trust said michael with strange look at be ill dirty know be bernard burst out in pitiful kind of way yes of course be anyone can see said miss berengaria a alice did answer help up alice two dragged man up stair painfully striving best to make weight light miss berengaria approved of be got good stuff in said when led into small room took up whole of second floor of turret always have said alice warmly for sake of comedy miss berengaria frowned applied what said to michael then miss berengaria sent alice downstairs to heat wine made michael go to bed be a weak a child simply let do what liked with difficulty managed to put between sheet then washed face hand finally on alice returning with wine bread fed with sop of latter dipped into former after a michael displayed symptom of drowsiness prepared to leave to sound sleep payne will see to morrow will be safe safe said sick man half starting up of course lie down sleep michael strove to say something then sank back on pillow two hurried out of room down stair feeling like conspirator not until be safe in drawing room with door closed did venture to speak then only did so in whisper alice be first to make remark if have seen bernard very day must have be deceived aunt did ever see so wonderful likeness never admitted miss berengaria how deuce be always lady given to strong expression doe man expect to pas off to a bernard there be lot of thing bernard have said about must know nothing ca understand perhaps came to tell truth humph miss berengaria rubbed nose think man who must commit murder must tell truth flesh creeped when touched same there be pluck in fellow pity be such scamp something might be made of do think have got up like to snapped miss plantagenet man illness be genuine can see for be only skin bone wonder how came to be in such plight perhaps will tell will tell lie said old lady grimly for sake of bernard will pretend to believe wait till get durham on to wo lie then main point be to keep be only person who can get bernard out of trouble what will do aunt nurse up in room telling servant that have guest need not see payne can cure when be cured will see what durham say that young man clever will know how to deal with matter be beyond now must go to bed head be in whirl with excitement of day chapter xvii diary before miss berengaria must communicate with durham have left castle for town on hearing from bernard old lady at once sent up to full report of arrival of michael at bower under name of gore be now trifle better wrote miss berengaria having suffered from great privation be still ill so far a can see be likely to keep to bed for time payne be attending to say need careful nursing tonic be so weak a to be scarcely able to talk be perhaps better a alice might arouse suspicion have accepted a bernard when come down can question either in character a michael to tell truth be sorry for boy be only twenty one thereabouts think have be misguided after even may not have committed crime although be certainly with sir simon on fatal night servant with exception of own especial maid maria tait know nothing of man presence in turret chamber may be sure that be taking care jerry moon learns nothing will be glad when can come down to take matter out of hand be much worried over conniston come over daily to see lucy randolph at hall be so feather brained creature care about entrusting secret to do wish bernard to know with impetuosity must probably come over at once run chance of arrest whole matter be in hand durham so write tell what be to do at event have fast hold of bernard double may be sure will not allow to go until mystery be cleared up in reply to pressing epistle durham wrote telling miss berengaria to wait for three four day be advertising for tolomeo hoped to see at office if a durham thought italian have be with sir simon on night something might be learned from likely to prove presence of michael in room examination of michael durham proposed to make must then be rendered much easier lawyer in conclusion quite agreed with miss plantagenet that conniston bernard must not be told hope to be with by end of week finished deuce take man said miss berengaria rubbing nose doe think can wait time see what else can do aunt said alice when letter be read poor creature be so weak that think will be able to speak much for few day have to do be to nurse ask question to let think believe to be bernard oh be quite convinced of said alice quickly suppose hoped must think altered look might induce to overlook lack of resemblance to bernard yes must guess when talk will find out seeing know much of bernard that can not know perhaps be why hold tongue said alice rising must wait aunt suppose must said miss berengaria dolefully drat whole business be there ever coil well then aunt will leave alone certainly not intend to see thing through owing to reticence to sir simon about parent alice be really responsible for whole business so will keep working at until bernard be out of danger married to ah sighed miss malleson when will be sooner than think perhaps day brings surprise one day certainly brought surprise to lucy randolph learned that conniston loved though to be sure frequent visit might have shown how be losing heart be glad of a admired conniston exceedingly moreover wished to escape from awkward position at hall when bernard came back married alice must have to leave hall live on small income allotted to by generosity of dead man must be much better a truly thought to marry conniston even though be poorest of peer one can do lot with title even without money lucy be wise in generation moreover be truly in love with young man thought very rightly that must make good

have said italian with great earnestness must have be well do know if sir simon sent boy to bring bernard know sir simon said nothing of that only put lamp behind handkerchief in hope that bernard might come to house for knew bernard might have learned where be staying think old man be sorry quarrelled with poor nephew said tolomeo with earnestness well after arranging left sir simon not immediately mr gilroy came in said that someone wanted to see sir simon heard whisper to said must go away telling mr gilroy to send up stranger went away followed opened door front door yes when be going out heard sir simon call over stair asked to return closed door did so ah said durham making note mr gilroy thought have left house said so in diary then came upstairs said tolomeo did not went back to room sir simon said wanted to be present a have disagreeable interview made hide behind curtain did so then door opened bernard entered what durham started from seat be impossible of course be rejoined italian smiling assure signor man who entered took to be bernard be michael son of mr gilroy know that ah how asked tolomeo surprised rather vexed hoped to astonish by well be long story will tell after tell yours michael entered dressed a soldier yes said tolomeo more more surprised by extent of lawyer knowledge thought be nephew until conversation then knew that be mr gilroy son that have be deceived by walter gore in false marriage sir simon told michael that be tired of assisting accused of making love to housemaid boy be boy signor acknowledged then sir simon said that michael have forged name for one thousand pound durham started up again what ah said so that be forgery thought sir simon gave check be honored yes sir simon said knew be forgery for bank sent check to said nothing about so a to spare michael said also that if michael did not leave country must prosecute michael retorted there be quarrel thought must have struck old man so came out when michael saw grew pale opening door ran downstairs out into fog followed to bring back a sir simon said 'follow ' why did michael run away know did went into fog followed to high street then lost a turned out of square brushed past man be under lamp post saw face be in evening dress be walking quickly entered house by door have left open who be that asked durham curiously julius beryl impossible be at theatre be came back said tolomeo putting hand in pocket listen ran up to high street must see nothing of michael walked about for long then came back before eleven found door open saw bernard in hall heard that be accused thought be michael returned escaped be by railing on opposite side of street a ran dropped handkerchief see tolomeo produced be marked ' j b ' durham snatched handkerchief faint smell of chloroform lingered about still beryl initial be in corner durham looked up very pale yes said tolomeo that man killed sir simon chapter xix plot counterplot on hearing from tolomeo that beryl be guilty person durham be not so surprised a might have be have always suspected that julius be in way connected with crime although have not thought personally guilty story of guiseppe production of handkerchief marked with beryl name seemed to put matter beyond doubt durham remembered how conniston have always said that when lost handkerchief be found assassin must be identified apparently prophecy have come true here be handkerchief so fortunately picked up by tolomeo belonged to julius also julius according to italian have entered house in crimea square about time murder be supposed to have be committed there be doubt that beryl sent jerry for bernard so that might be brought to spot for accusation thought lawyer when tolomeo have gone whole thing be plant expect arranged to go to curtain theatre so a to have alibi theatre be near crimea square must be easy for beryl to slip round between act humph evidently did kill old man handkerchief be proof enough to say nothing of tolomeo evidence what be to be done next question be answered next day while durham be still puzzling over matter julius made appearance a meek looking mild a ever lawyer received coldly be on guard be difficult to know why beryl must pay visit to avowed enemy julius soon explained reason for call have something extremely private to say to mr durham remarked in confidential way after assuring ostentatiously that door be closed be not legal adviser said durham quickly be bernard be bernard mean doe that intimate that have quarrelled with bernard forget said solicitor looking at sharply bernard be supposed to be dead think ever believed said beryl smiling have nothing to do with oh yes have see here durham wrote to miss malleson time ago stating have seen bernard in london so understand said durham calmly why did not stop be not quick enough walked on other side of street before must cross over be difficult on account of traffic bernard disappeared then be not quite sure if really be alive now be indeed said durham with qualm for fancied julius might have learned of gore whereabouts yes that young moon wrote letter to saying that bernard have come to bower starving in rag be on tip of durham tongue to say that doubt jerry have be placed a spy at bower suppressed remark firmly believed that julius be murderer a yet saw difficulty in bringing crime home to thought must be best to give man rope enough to hang in other word to listen quietly to what have to say act accordingly durham did not like having anything to do with scoundrel in interest of gore have to smother feeling save strictly professional one therefore confined to silence to looking inquiringly at beryl seem surprised said julius annoyed because can hardy believe statement jerry may be making mistake oh went down on receipt of letter insisted on seeing cousin miss plantagenet a knew must denied that be there afterwards when threatened to bring police on to scene gave way let see bernard be sure then that bernard committed crime wait one moment mr durham said beryl wagging finger in most irritating way let understand one clearly know have known for time that bernard be at bower be not bound to answer question said lawyer stiffly bernard answered for told have be to see that in spite of change in look knew who be durham drew figure on blotting paper wondered if julius really believed man at bower to be bernard gore if be trying to learn what durham thought after reflection lawyer resolved to accept michael a man in question julius must not possibly know that real bernard be alive therefore must be a wise to keep knowledge from until such time a light must come to show durham how to move yes said at length throwing down pen taking up position on hearth rug be informed by miss plantagenet bernard have sought refuge with went down to see why did not tell asked julius sharply durham shrugged shoulder by own showing seeing wished to call in police be not friend to bernard said why must have summoned to assist to arrest wish to be arrested said julius mildly on contrary wish poor fellow to die in peace to die what do mean what say mr durham payne tell that bernard have be so exhausted by wandering when in hiding that can not recover death be only question of day mind julius wagged finger again really believe killed sir simon a be dying why will hing be not vindictive man besides added julius looking sideways at lawyer bernard be friend now be also friendly with miss malleson indeed how did bring about by acting straightforward honorably a always do said meek julius miss malleson acknowledged to that bernard be sadly changed by hardship have undergone same recognized unfortunately poor fellow be too feeble to tell of peril underwent so have not have opportunity of talking much to struck durham from speech that julius be doubtful of identity of bernard with man at bower else why must make remark about alice not having have time to question sick man seeing that alice alone must prove if be bernard not durham be perplexed wondered what julius be driving at how much knew clue came with next word being friend with bernard went on beryl be sorry that quarrelled feeling that be not long for world want to make will in favor durham nearly uttered exclamation for of sudden whole rascally business became clear julius knew that man at bower be michael be prepared to extract from forged will in hope that real bernard be dead having made use of michael to bring about accusation of gore now used to very last to get money however durham kept temper under pretended to believe that julius be speaking in good faith simply bowed head word that julius said be weaving rope for own neck be surprised then at calling said julius anxiously said durham returning to seat if gore wish to make will suppose be man to draw up must go down receive instruction have with said julius bringing out sealed letter durham inwardly boiling at rascality outwardly calm opened letter while julius kept sharp look out on found long letter written in same style a bernard gore usually wrote setting forth direction for will included income of five hundred year to alice malleson extra allowance of four hundred to mr gilroy making income five hundred in rest of estate real personal went to julius beryl durham smiled inwardly a read document be exactly kind of will julius wanted michael be simply instrument durham shrewdly suspected that from knowledge of forged check beryl have obtained extraordinary influence well seems clear enough said lawyer laying down letter think miss malleson seeing what loses must have more think have quite enough said julius tartly then mr gilroy said durham pretending ignorance why must bernard leave extra money ca say bernard will probably tell will please draw out will mr durham bring down to bower for gore to sign for sake of appearance durham went on making objection be met by julius with infernal cleverness until lawyer on face of have not leg to stand on a saying go finally consented to draw up will a instructed by letter agreed to meet julius next day at liverpool street station to go down with to hall julius drew long breath of relief when lawyer so agreed apparently have idea that be being tricked time be much obliged to mr durham said holding out hand when come into possession of estate will find good client durham for sake of keeping up deception have to shake hand although loathed for doing so when door closed on arch plotter solicitor went at once to wash hand what complete scoundrel said durham to how confoundedly clever of course if real bernard be dead will might stand at event even if miss malleson must prove that michael be not lover new will might lead to litigation however a bernard be alive well can produce at eleventh hour to frighten beryl be afraid that young man will be hanged after though be unwilling for sake of family thing must come to pas however durham true to appointment arrived at station next day have will in pocket julius read in train going down expressed approval of be now durham cue to behave politely to julius a though truly believed in in false bernard gore on previous night have written long letter to miss berengaria be to be read to alice in durham told whole of beryl scheme to get possession of property for obvious reason said nothing of tolomeo story beryl real guilt thought very truly that even miss berengaria nerve must not stand being brought into such close relationship with proven murderer let alone alice might reveal truth out of sheer disgust letter prepared mind of lady for execution of will on arriving at bower two men be met by jerry looking more innocent child like than ever please missus say will go into drawing room said infant casting down eye durham looked hard at young scoundrel who be worthy instrument of beryl must have liked to examine then there touching luring of bernard to crimea square present moment be not propitious so passed on julius however in most benevolent way spoke to boy hope be giving good mistress satisfaction oh yes sir be angry at writing telling about poor sick gentleman by way jerry how did find out about asked durham saw arrive said jerry ingenuously be in garden when came must have written sir if have known that dear missus wanted kept dark mr beryl be so anxious about sir bernard thought must be glad to know be alive how did know gentleman be sir bernard heard james coachman describe then knew same jerry said julius benevolently if miss berengaria wished fact of sir bernard being here kept quiet must not have disclosed even to wished to set mind at rest murmured jerry looking up with dove like eye owe so much sir julius smiled patting head walked on to drawing room be very pretty comedy durham be not to be taken in knew well enough that boy be mere tool dangerous one a matter of fact did not know until later how dangerous lad really must be miss berengaria alice be in drawing room smiled welcome when two men entered alice darted look of terror repulsion at beryl a be shaking hand with old lady did not see else might have suspected durham guessed touched hand nodded when julius shook hand with welcomed again with smile although very flesh crept when touched a for miss berengaria indomitable old lady never turned hair smiled chatted be bland to julius might have be dearest friend from amount of attention bestowed on so poor bernard be going to make will said briskly hope have left alice something five hundred year like amount to mr gilroy indeed mr durham why to mr gilroy bernard look upon a second mother said julius hastily at least told so of course know nothing about hope however will reappear to claim legacy there may be chance for anyone to claim legacy for long time said miss berengaria tartly hope bernard will not die hope so also said alice fervently really meant even though be thinking of young scamp upstairs julius shook head dr payne assures can not live be glad have decided to make will yes must be said miss berengaria ironically might have be rash enough to say more that durham intervened hope none of servant know bernard be here know by time said miss berengaria calmly kept matter from a long a possible with alice waited on bernard jerry told servant a well a mr beryl will knowledge go further said lawyer keeping up comedy want bernard arrested servant will not speak under pain of dismissal if be what mean said miss plantagenet sharply a to jerry be one of servant also said beryl softly have influence over jerry

here be then going to hide in london after must have sent for victoria when mr beryl paid must have gone to america why did carry out clever plan asked gore jerry turned still more sulky because saw

tell till have seen beryl be must get out of in spite of threat of further whipping cajolings so jerry be taken back to room bernard arranged with conniston that boy must be taken to london very day then when durham let know will surrender wonder who killed grandfather after julius beryl said conniston hum know boy seems to have idea tell what dick must be surprised if boy did chapter xxii truth arrest of sir bernard gore made great sensation be generally supposed that be dead unexpected appearance surprised one also a be believed to be guilty public be amazed that must thus thrust into jeopardy more thoughtful people saw in gore surrender proof of innocence argued very rightly that be guilty of murder of sir simon must not come forward a have done to stand trial additional surprise came in arrest of michael who be said to be half brother of gore to resemble very closely rumor got about one knew how that resemblance between two must be made basis of defence also boy jerry moon who be implicated in matter be in charge of police be expected that must make startling revelation on whole there be chance that forthcoming trial must be extremely interesting one looked forward with great expectation to time when sir bernard must be placed in dock inspector groom formerly in charge of case be now attending to matter again said very little although reporter tried to make give opinion from few word let drop must seem that believed firmly in innocence of accused man see anything about beryl in paper said conniston when at durham office there be nothing to say about at present replied lawyer have not caught yet perhaps never may victoria warned then yes that imp of boy wrote letter stating that bernard be at cove castle advising flight victoria caught train shortly before eleven came straight to beryl room address of received from jerry beryl a jerry have done saw that game be up realized that knowing gore to be alive have be simply playing with imposture of michael bolted that same night managed to cross to continent at least suppose so a trace of can be found what will do about then durham shrugged shoulder there be nothing can be done answered with evidence of michael jerry miss randolph tolomeo will be able to prove bernard innocence cousin guilt bernard will be set free without stain on character a to how beryl will be arrested whether will ever be punished be unable to give opinion what about mr gilroy ah want can not find out where be even son doe know must speak out if did know a fancy be sincerely repentant for trouble new edition of corsican brother have caused have not plan to lure mr gilroy out of hiding durham searched amongst paper produced journal read said pointing to column be article dealing with case in writer hinted that michael be guilty bernard innocent be also stated that michael must certainly be put in dock sufficient evidence be in power of prosecution to procure condemnation whole article be written strongly after reading conniston have not known true fact of case must have fancied michael guilty said a much durham smiled be exactly feeling wish to convey to mr gilroy declared taking back paper if one can prove guilt of beryl for reason perhaps for money be hiding if read that paragraph will at once come forward to save son then will be able to prove beryl guilt beyond doubt may not take in particular journal said conniston oh be only one paper within next few day that article will be copied in newspaper in london mr gilroy be bound wherever be to hear of arrest of son of bernard giving up to learn what be taking place will read paper can get hold of then will see that article if doe bring forward to save michael condemn beryl be very much mistaken sound rather like contempt of court said dick gravely durham laughed be in way man have right to be considered innocent in english law until guilt be proved arranged with scotland yard that article must appear in hope that mr gilroy important witness mind must be brought forward ca exactly tell detail may be sure that thing have be done legally besides argued durham calmly seeing have strong proof of beryl guilt there be doubt that michael will have fair trial say said conniston rising to take leave do know be bernard idea that jerry might have committed crime seems to that beryl be too great coward to do stuff said durham quite in style of miss berengaria boy must not have possibly strangled old man be leading bernard to square to within few minute of time when mr gilroy came out shouting murder conniston beryl be man a be proved by handkerchief came to house immediately tolomeo left since passed that man in square boy saw departing after bernard be lured to be on spot beryl be hurrying back to theatre to arrange for alibi everything be beautifully arranged for discovery of michael might have learned nothing also tolomeo evidence be valuable mr gilroy having be in house at time be woman who know doubtless beryl threatened to denounce son be why accused bernard counting on resemblance to carry matter through what infernally wicked woman said dick angrily oh not at mr gilroy be mother naturally must sacrifice whole world to save son besides may have acted on spur of moment then have to go on with matter well said conniston putting on hat sincerely hope net will capture be sure to woman who must try save son by accusing innocent man must not remain quiet to see hanged by way miss berengaria be in town believe yes with miss randolph alice be stopping at waterloo hotel guelph street believe
