penny what be wrong penny be about to break forth into denunciation of huxham wickedness timely recollection of captain last word that story must not be believed made pause after huxham be well known a decent man open handed friend to one so there be nothing to be gained by telling truth must certainly be scoffed at preacher changed mind in one swift instant replied nervously to mr coppersley

sup of rum strong drink lead into desperate way protested preacher mr coppersley be gone have returned before must make up mind to fly temptation silas be not used to alcohol shock have sustained in learning so much of huxham true nature prevented exercising usual self control with highly strung nerve be half hysterical so when forced by kindly mr coppersley readily drank tumbler of rum slightly diluted with water drink there be good soul entreated housekeeper forcing glass to lip pushed away feel better already did for strong spirit brought colour to cheek new strength to limb stood up in

be going to marry look after so there mr coppersley placing hand akimbo defied pastor henry have money said penny finding objection a to remarked mr coppersley indifferently when brother dy will have money for house into bargain will have nothing of sort said silas surprised into saying more than be wise brother daughter will inherit oh will cried mr coppersley violently much know about mr penny when late husband who be ship steward saving died ten year ago lent brother money to add to own so that might buy bleacres agreed that if did so must inherit house land promised to look after bella until got married mr coppersley said penny with effort at firmness brother told only lately that if married bella must give farm house when died so ho indeed interrupted mr coppersley wrathfully pretty going on be sure call pastor mr penny come plotting to rob of what be mine take everything bella nothing so can put in pipe smoke though ai man enough to smoke even penny cigar marry bella why be a good a engaged to young lister who have got more gumption about than have advise said penny voice sounded strangely in own ear not to tell brother that daughter be engaged to mr lister never said that be there be mere mention of such engagement must send captain huxham crazy in heaven name why gasped mr coppersley looking picture of stout amazement sitting down heavily because for reason hate mr lister must kill rather than accept a son in law mr coppersley florid face turned quite pale evidently knew what brother be like when roused why must jabez hate mr lister asked have better ask said penny opening hall door then to soften abruptness added will tell henry vand that will see after departed leaving mr coppersley still pale still gasping after there be reason why ship steward widow must not marry young man vand be handsome in refined way very clever a musician be only slightly crippled too must get about with aid of stick same needed someone to look after a own mother did not do so a be notorious why must not become mr coppersley husband disparity in age did not matter a vand in spite of good look be club footed poor penny doubted if mr coppersley must inherit bleacres after captain huxham death in spite of arrangement between unless here be chance for housekeeper unless bella married lister notwithstanding father opposition in event huxham must assuredly disinherit will point out to said preacher a left manor house urge suit common sense will make yield to prayer moreover can plead here smiled complacently a thought of pulpit eloquence besides unaccustomed spirit of rum be still keeping brave penny sauntered in glowing sunshine down narrow path ran between standing corn path be not straight wound deviously a though huxham wished to make approach to abode a difficult a possible indeed be strange that must sow corn at since corn at time be not remunerative year since have entered into possession of bleacres owner have sown corn year there have only be one meandering path through same very path penny be now taking there be evidently purpose in sowing in fact that only one pathway be left whereby to approach mansion what that purpose might be penny indeed anyone else must guess not that gave thought huxham be presumed to be very wealthy farming be looked upon more a hobby than necessity preacher brushed between breast high corn walked over two three narrow plank laid across two three narrow ditch where corn ended be wide channel at least ten foot broad stretched whole length of estate passed beyond on way under railway line to distant river water way ran straightly for distance then curved down into marsh at own will to spread into swamp on one side sprang thick green corn on other stretched waste land up to outskirt of village one mile distant there be fence round bleacres at point apparently huxham deemed wide channel sufficient protection to corn assuredly be a tramp ever trespassed on land then marshely be not tramp village inhabitant be poor have nothing to give in way of charity loafer of road avoided locality for very obvious reason before crossing plank be laid on mid channel supporting tressels over water way penny looked from right to left evening be so very beautiful that thought must prolong walk until sundown wanted time to hour be still indignant with captain huxham for base offer came to conclusion that ex mariner be mad when made penny in simplicity must not think that man must ask to kill third in cold blood same offer have be made silas found asking why huxham must desire death of stranger with whom so far a preacher knew be not even acquainted huxham have always refused to permit bella to bring lister to bleacres indeed have forbidden even to speak to young man therefore must not be cognisant of fact stated by mr coppersley that lister girl be on eve of engagement thus thinking penny mechanically wandered along left bank of boundary water way found near small hut inhabited by sole labourer whom huxham habitually employed engaged others of course when field be ploughed sown reaped tunks such be euphonious name of handy man be in demand year round resided in somewhat lonely hut along with grandmother weird old gipsy reputed to be witch be reputation set mr penny thinking remembering that mr tunks be of romany thought blushed a thought that must be worth while to expend shilling in order to learn if suit with bella must really prosper temple of fate be before sibyl be probably within since smoke of cooking evening meal curled from chimney be only necessary to lift latch lay down shilling inquire even a temptation drew be seized with feeling of shame that preacher of gospel approved foe thereby of witch must think for one moment of encouraging such traffic with evil one penny blushing a red a now setting sun turned away hastily found face to face with very girl who be causing such torment how be mr penny said bella huxham lightly lovely evening be tried to pas on narrow path probably be going to see witch of endor preacher placed directly before wait for one moment girl did not reply immediately looked at earnestly trying to guess what usually nervous preacher have to say bella looked more lovely than ever in penny eye a stood before in white dress bathed in rosy glory of sunset did not in least resemble father aunt of whom be stout uncomely folk of true plebeian type bella be aristocratic in look a tall slim willowy a young sapling hair eye be dark face be perfect oval of ivory white delicately flushed with red like sweet pea if chin be trifle resolute hard mouth be perfect carried in haughty way have habit of bending dark brow so imperiously that reminded penny of judith who killed holofernes judith jael deborah must have be just such woman well asked bella bending brow like empress what be love miss huxham must not be angry at so naive declaration one coming from man whom knew to be a timid a hare be somewhat surprised mr penny replied demurely be not making mistake no stuttered flushing with eagerness for amorous passion make most timid bold have loved for month for year want to be wife to share with glorious privilege of leading flock to land of beulah stop stop flung up hand assure mr penny that be impossible forget that ever said anything can not forget why must forget must not ask woman for reason mr penny answered drily for woman never give true one bella miss huxham to mr penny spoke in chilly manner no cried wildly to be bella think of by sweet name day night come between work when console afflicted feel that be talking to when read bible face come between sacred page to be hephzibah yes shulamite angel of covenant joy of heart oh bella love very ground that tread on can refuse see threw on path heedless of fact that mr tunks might be at not far distant window be at foot bella bella girl be distressed by earnestness rise mr penny someone will see must not behave like can not be wife why not oh why not because be not fit to be minister wife young man sprang to foot glowing with passion let teach bella avoided extended arm insisted must take answer once for mr penny can not marry why urged despairingly have reason replied formally ask for have need to know reason bella flushed overlooked bitterness of tone because guessed what suffered in case need not explain said coldly again tried to pas again prevented love that man lister said between teeth be business mr penny mine also cried undaunted by haughtiness father business too mr coppersley said that be almost engaged to man lister will not marry will not even be engaged to who will prevent asked bella angrily father hate man lister how can father hate man have never even seen demanded be talking rubbish miss huxham penny detained by laying thin finger on arm if marry man lister kept to sentence a though be charm will be pauper flashed up into royal rage stamped how dare say that dare tell truth be not truth how can tell if father told insisted preacher hotly bella withdrew step so eye growing round with surprise father said that yes yes yes cried silas feverishly went to very afternoon to ask permission to present to a suitor consented only when heard that loved man who told that demanded bella breath coming quick short yes said penny trying to be courageous be true who say that be everyone in village village have nothing to do with business declared imperiously even if do love let pas told that father said must be pauper if married man lister reminded yes did say so declared also that must give manor house farm when died if made wife bella shrugged shoulder father doe not mean what say remarked disbelievingly a be only child solitary farm a call come to in case see reason why must discus father business with stand aside let pas silas be wonderfully brave for one of timid soul will not pas until learn truth think that be fool weak be not feel wise strong be strong strong enough to withstand temptation even when be offered a bribe bella grew somewhat alarmed did not like glittering of willow grey eye be mad be sane know that be sane think to put off by saying that be crazy have have enough to make so father here voice took on sing song pulpit style father took up to exceedingly high mountain showed kingdom of world of offered together with if murdered lister what bella voice leaped octave murder cyril yes cyril man love if dared mr penny bella saw necessity of keeping well in hand with hysterical youth for be nothing else spoke in calm kind voice father have not seen mr lister can not hate go ask what think said penny fiercely tell that to day be offered everything if must kill man lister be talking at random said soothingly go home lie down be talking of what may come to pas father wish so why not when love so deeply offer heart of honest man yet must throw that aside for profligate cyril be not profligate interrupted bella must have bitten out tongue for hasty speech be come from london city of evil that will yet fall like babylon great soul will not be lost will not marry will cried bella indignantly becoming rash again in anger what be more be engaged to now so there let pas slipped deftly past walked swiftly homeward silas penny stood where be staring after unable to speak move to follow then sun sank leaving in twilight of sorrow chapter iii tardy lover miss huxham did not credit for one moment story penny have told be ridiculous to think that father must even hint at murder of unoffending man whom have never seen to hesitating timid silas of people bella remembered that month previously when have mentioned chance meeting with lister then stranger at cottage of marshely school mistress captain huxham have not only forbidden to bring to bleacres young man desired to see have ordered to discontinue acquaintance evidently retired mariner deemed prohibition sufficient for made further mention of matter that gave reason for tyrannical edict did not trouble because of very omission daughter took own way by stealth be true lest huxham must exhibit annoyance for annoyance with meant wild beast rage now girl felt puzzled according to silas father knew that have disobeyed returned to manor in somewhat nervous state of mind quite prepared to do battle for lover to surprise captain huxham made remark behaved much same a usual save at odd time be more observant of coming going in face of newly acquired knowledge very unusual demeanour must have made bella more circumspect being high spirited did not change life in way also believed that silas have greatly exaggerated captain anger argued from quietness that cared very little what did have reason to take view for huxham be not affectionate parent save when thing interfered with own comfort usually ignored daughter on side bella must not subscribe to fifth commandment be impossible to honour king log who have unpleasant way of becoming king henry viii when contradicted several time bella needing sympathy be on point of reporting penny conversation to mr coppersley so a to learn opinion a to truth of preacher preposterous statement buxom widow be too much taken up with own love affair to trouble about of niece for whom displayed great affection attended to house keeping cajoled brother into good humour when necessary nearly evening slipped out to meet henry vand who usually awaited arrival on hither side of boundary channel did not dare to venture nearer to lion den a captain huxham aware of sister desire to contract second marriage discouraged idea captain being aggressively selfish did not intend to lose mr coppersley whose service be necessary to comfort besides a managed everything connected with domestic arrangement of bleacres assisted by bella huxham be spared necessity of paying servant be better from captain point of view to have two slave who asked for wage who must be bullied when felt like playing tyrant to young girl in first strong flush of womanhood life at solitary farm be extremely dreary captain huxham rose early strolled round wealthy acre until breakfast for be gargantuan meal then shut for whole morning in den where laboured at account with locked door in afternoon ordinarily walked to marshely conversed over strong drink with crony at village public house returned to walk around farm again after supper again sought room to smoke drink rum until bedtime at ten o'clock routine of captain life never varied in particular even to seeking quarter deck once day for purpose apparently of viewing result of life work also from eyrie captain armed with long telescope must gaze at outward homeward bound ship so enjoy vicariously sea life have abandoned ten year of bella took scarcely notice be indeed dull life especially a bella be intellectual felt that required food for active brain for odd reason did not suit with rough nature huxham have given neglected daughter first class education only within last two year have returned from fashionable hampstead school to live uneventful unintellectual life on essex farm possessed few book read over over again huxham be not actively unkind gave plenty of frock ribbon hat glove such like thing presumed be what ordinary girl wanted overlooked fact that bella be not ordinary girl that hungered for more moving life at least for one must afford opportunity of displaying social ability bella sang excellently played piano unusually well uncouth father did not care for music mr coppersley scorned also girl therefore allowed talent to lie dormant became silent handsome image of woman moving ghost like through dreary mansion chance meeting with clever young man aroused disused capability aroused also womanly coquetry stimulated into exhibiting really fascinating nature warned that father must have stranger coming to manor by own lip kept secret delightful meeting with lister only when two met at cottage of miss ankers must speak freely bella thought that secret attachment be unknown whereas everyone in village watched progress of lister wooing came a have be seen to penny jealous ear reported same to captain huxham knowing bella be more perplexed than ever that a time went on huxham did nothing said nothing at one time have be peremptory now appeared inclined to let act a chose mere fact that did so made bella feel more than ever what indifferent father possessed for quite week after interview with captain futile wooing of bella lovesick preacher kept away from farm attended sedulously to clerical duty in connection with little bethel truth be that felt afraid of huxham now knowing what use captain desired to make of for reason also silas did not report that bella be engaged to lister feared lest huxham in rage at such disregard of wish must slay young journalist perhaps might in infernal cunning lay blame on silas at event penny be wise enough to avoid danger zone of farm although after reflection aided by jealousy be not quite so shocked at idea of thrusting lister to muddy death yet thought more judicious to keep out of huxham way old mariner a penny knew possessed strong will

lister suddenly losing temper at insult to girl loved oh will y huxham passed tongue over coarse lip rubbed big hand slowly apparently nothing must have given greater pleasure than to pitch man who

conclusion of sheer brute force captain therefore being coward at heart a bully be weakened retreated y ' git off m ' land be that must find to say ' y ' git home bella e m daughter will deal with y ' be quite ready to go home said bella boldly be not going to behave a though be one of sailor father will do wot please growled huxham looking white wicked bella laughed somewhat artificially for

be killed first retorted lister be surprised at effect threat idle one have on ex sailor huxham turned pale under bronze hastily cast look over left shoulder why do hate so asked young man sharply never met before have never set eye on why do hate ef 'd dog called lister 'd shoot if 'd cat called lister 'd drown if 'd parrot named lister 'd twist blamed neck same e must yours ef must bella come home casting venomous look on astonished cyril captain moved away be useless to prolong unpleasant scene since huxham declined to explain objection to young man name again a took few step to accompany father bella noticed that cyril winced paled at coarse taunt of antagonist what be matter with name asked sharply lister strode forward caught in arm will explain when next meet whispered kissed good bye while huxham grated strong white teeth at sight indeed so angry be captain that might again have assaulted daughter lover cyril walked rapidly away without even backward glance bella watched with heavy heart there seemed to be something sinister about mystery of name huxham inexplicable hatred appeared to be foolish lister undoubtedly took seriously kim home breathed captain furiously in ear ' he t ' hev talk will be last talk if behave properly retorted bella walking proudly by side even though have misfortune to be daughter doe not give right to treat so rudely will treat y e blamed well like y ' hussy y will go t ' yer room eat bread ' drink water t ' cool yer hot blood bella laughed derisively there be law in country father said quietly will go to room certainly a have wish to

have disobeyed in seein ' blamed lister father bella stopped directly before front door of manor house why do hate cyril what have against name captain quivered blinked eye cast usual look over left shoulder then scowled shut yer mouth growled ' go t ' yer room cuss y ' house be mine be master here rolled into doorway suddenly turned on threshold 'd ruther see y dead buried than merried t ' man of t name of lister snarled before bella must recover from astonishment plunged into den shut door with noisy bang girl passed hand across forehead in bewildered way mystery be becoming deeper saw way of solving must not explain cyril evaded subject then bella remembered that lover have promised explanation when next met remembrance of aided to posse in patience tried to put matter out of head be impossible for to meet father at supper forbear asking question so decided to obey ostensibly retire to bedroom next day must have interview with lover then must learn why captain stormed cyril winced when name be mentioned bella room be on first floor in front of mansion so that have extended view of corn field of mr tunks hut near boundary channel of pathway through wheat leading deviously from front door of bleacres across channel to distant village of marshely standing at window must see red roofed house gathered round square tower of church uncultivated field green moist spreading on side sun be setting landscape be bathed in rosy hue everything be peaceful restful outside under manor roof be discord dread huxham in den paced up down like caged bear angered exceedingly by daughter obstinacy a termed bella in seclusion of own room be trying to quieten fear hitherto have lived what termed vegetable life in ominous hint seemed a though must very shortly have more than enough to occupy mind a twilight darkened bella still continued to sit at window vainly endeavouring to forecast doubtful future be certain that huxham must never agree to marriage with lister must probably insist that must become wife of penny a bella have money expectation of save by obeying father did not know what to do unless captain ceased to persecute must possibly turn out of door if persisted in thwarting will in event must either have to earn bread a governess must be forced to ask lister to marry direct question maidenly pride shrank from putting moreover a recollected cyril have plainly told only few hour previously that must not marry unless obtained one thousand pound within week be now tuesday be not easy to raise large sum within next few day of course bella did not know what resource cyril have to draw upon might be that must gain what wanted then must take away marry until unexpected happened did not know what to say how to act seemed to that have come to cross road of life that future depended upon path now chose yet there be nothing to show how to select direction idle eye caught at vivid spot of scarlet came from red coat of martial scarecrow there stood bound stiffly to tall pole in midst of corn sentinel of prosperous acre bella wondered that father having be sailor have not arrayed figure in nautical dress a be red hue annoyed for red be colour of blood there lingered in mind ominous speech have be made by father lister when quarrelling will kill y said captain take care cyril have replied that be killed first also there be wild tale of penny regarding offer made by huxham to compass death of lister thing flashed into bella uncomfortable mind a looked at red ominous figure of scarecrow then with shudder rose dismissed evil fancy be growing morbid thought looking at anxious face in glass to morrow when see cyril oh come in said aloud broke off to give invitation a sharp knock came to door opened almost immediately to admit plump figure of mr coppersley carrying tray here be dry toast cup of tea said widow severely father say be not to come to supper must come if wanted to retorted bella a mr coppersley set down burden if think to punish in way be very much mistaken doe think that be child to submit to tyranny think that be disobedient daughter said mr coppersley drily what do think aunt older woman coughed thought that niece be much too pretty much too independent have ill feeling toward save natural petty feminine jealousy know what to think said sitting down to gossip of course father be impossible always want own way see why folk must not be allowed to choose husband for jabez be huxham christian name object to marrying henry to becoming wife of lister person speak of cyril in way said bella with impatience be gentleman man love by way aunt might have brought up teapot dislike anyone else to pour out tea father poured out while went to kitchen for toast snapped mr coppersley said be to have only one cup what petty tyrant be sighed bella pushing cup away aunt what do think of cyril be very handsome rejoined mr coppersley cautiously know anything about position disposition know be dearest fellow in world aunt like position be unknown to mr coppersley rose aghast do mean to say that must marry man about whom know nothing demanded know sufficient to choose for husband retorted bella spiritedly intend to marry in spite of father bullying then father will not give single penny cried mr coppersley approve of doing so ca marry man oh said bella bitterly thought agreed that woman must choose own husband woman like who know life bella not chit of girl like be twenty year of age flashed out niece have sense of babe of three scoffed mr coppersley moving towards door perhaps night of loneliness will bring to sens dear passed through door closed be locking in by father wish said mr coppersley from other side bella white with rage at indignity sprang to wrench open door almost before reached key clicked in lock knew that be prisoner door be so stout strong that there be chance of frail girl such a be breaking down bella be in royal rage be in mind to scramble out of window escape what be use thought eye filling with impotent tear have money friend other home what shame be for to be at mercy of father in way will have to submit to insult there be nothing else can do oh oh clenched hand a again returned to window looked out into rapidly darkening night will insist upon cyril marrying at once if love surely will not stand by idly when be treated in way trying to calm walked up down room one slice of toast one cup of tea be on table anger have taken appetite inexperienced in trouble of life be like newly captured bird dashing against wire of hateful cage to fro girl walked revolving plan of escape from father tyranny in direction want of money proved obstacle impossible to surmount nothing remained for to wait patiently until must see cyril next day then exhaustive talk might lead to formation of plan whereby future must be arranged for faint far heard clock in marshely church tower strike hour of eight began to think of retiring to bed night be hot so flung up window permitted fresh air to circulate in close room atmosphere be luminous with starlight although there be moon visible gentle wind bent rustling stalk of vast corn field shimmering green be agitated like wave of sea white mist rose ghost like on verge of farm into ocean of grain melted faintly what with mist luminous night spreading wheat field phantom like in obscurity bella felt a though be in world of vague dream looking down narrow path showed mere thread in semi gloom beheld tall dark figure advancing towards house be that of man by way in walked bella felt sure that be lover heart beat wildly perhaps cyril have come rather be coming to see captain to plead suit once more greatly agitated by unforeseen visit leaned out of window a man came almost directly under be cyril felt certain from carriage from fact that vaguely saw grey suit wore during afternoon lister have be thus dressed cyril cyril called out cautiously man looked up in faint light saw that be indeed cyril for eye of love be keen enough to pierce obscurity also window be great height from ground man looked up making sign of recognition stepped into house without knocking at door bella started back in surprise knew that front door be always unlocked until ten when father usually retired to bed seemed strange that cyril who have quarrelled with captain very day must choose to risk further wrath by entering house uninvited also be stranger still that cyril must have looked up without making sign must have known who be for failing sight have hearing to recognise voice be very strange bella twisted up hair have let down walked to table to take up now cold cup of tea throat be parched with thirst by reason of nerve wished to refresh so that might think of what be best to be done cyril father have quarrelled again remembered ominous threat have used to one be inconceivable madness for lister to to beard captain in den knowing what vile temper old man possessed be not at impossible even improbable what afternoon quarrel might be renewed then heaven only knew what might happen drinking cup of tea hastily bella thought over thing resolved if must not escape by door to scramble out of window then must enter house appear in captain den to be present at what must probably be stormy interview already be straining ear to catch faintest sound of quarrelling a yet must hear nothing certainly cyril have closed front door for immediately have entered have heard do so again wall of old mansion be so thick that be impossible must hear when shut up in bedroom what be taking place below anxiously tried door in spite of effort failed to open wild with alarm a to what might be happening crossed to bed intending to twist sheet into rope for descent from window a caught at linen felt drumming in ear spark seemed to dance before eye apparently strain on nerve be making ill also felt unaccountably drowsy in spite of effort to keep awake sank beside bed with sheet still grasped in hand in two three minute be fast asleep window be still open bat swept into room flitted round motionless figure uttering thin cry again passed out into starry night silvery voice of nightingale in copse round marshely village came faintly across meadow mingled with cry of mouse hunting screech owl still bella slept on hour after hour passed night grew darker wind died away corn field ceased to rustle nightingale to sing became colder too a though breath of winter be freezing now moist air star yet glittered faintly high pitched whistle of steamer must be heard from distant river on whole earth be silent weirdly gloomy for summer time during small hour there came ominous hush of expectant dread lasted until twittering bird brought in dawn bella opened eye to find room radiant with royal red light felt sick dizzy for over stood mr coppersley shaking vigorously by shoulder bella bella father be dead murder murder oh come to study see murder chapter v mysterious crime murder ominous word struck at bella heart in spite of fact that dazed brain must scarcely grasp significance with unseeing eye stared at terrified aunt mr coppersley in usual morning dress simply made for domestic purpose fell back from motionless girl gripped table in centre of room face be white figure limp almost crazy with alarm looked twice age did sight of niece bewildered gaze reassure with quick indrawn breath of fear lurched forward again shook girl bella bella what be come to hear understand bella jabez be dead father have be murdered be lying corpse in study oh oh oh mr coppersley reeled against table again showed sign of violent hysteria spectacle brought back bella with rush to necessity of moment sprang to foot with sense alert ready to be used seizing ewer from wash stand dashed water over sobbing terrified woman then braced to consider situation bella thought reverted to event of previous night remembered that cyril have come to house without sign of recognition have entered have not seen depart because because oh yes have fallen unaccountably asleep slumber have overtaken at very moment when be preparing to descend from window in order to to to bella uttered wild cry ebbing blood left face pearly white interview between father cyril have taken place have not be there now now what do say asked aunt in hard unemotional voice mr coppersley quite unnerved drying scared face with towel gasped stared did hear what be come to bella father have be murdered got up morning a usual went into study be lying there covered with blood oh who can have killed how must know cried bella harshly be locked up in room by aunt rosamund fell asleep after after stopped aware that might say something dangerous after what asked mr coppersley curiously after left after drank tea oh how must fall asleep when when ah bella made bound for table took up empty cup dreg of tea remained tasted have bitter flavour thought flashed into mind drugged tea cried mr coppersley flapped plump hand feebly gasped again never very strong minded woman be now reduced to markedly idiotic condition under strain of tragic circumstance drug tea save bella what do mean drank tea fell asleep said girl sharply although before drinking did not feel at sleepy now have disagreeable taste in mouth head ache there be queer flavour about what be left in cup be sure tea be drugged by good lord cried mr coppersley indignantly why must drug tea bella father poured out in study when be getting toast in kitchen told so last night yes yes remember bella passed hand across forehead father evidently drugged tea to keep quiet so have met with death by violence bella mr coppersley screamed made for door what do mean again girl felt that be talking too freely if cyril be implicated in crime reported by mr coppersley must save cyril at least must hold peace until heard from lover what have taken place during fatal interview be just possible that cyril have slain captain in self defence knowing father violent character girl must scarcely blame young man expected that must happen so have be anxious to intervene a peacemaker drugged tea felt certain that have be drugged by father have prevented doing what wished now huxham be dead lister whether in self defence not be murderer thought be agony yet in midst of terror engendered by surmise bella found blaming father if have not drugged tea in order to keep in room tragedy must not have happened captain huxham have paved way to own death after there might be extenuating circumstance perhaps cyril must be able to explain meantime must hold tongue a to having seen enter house if anyone else have seen turned to mr coppersley where be last night demanded suspiciously be with henry vand from seven until after ten said woman meekly evidently unaware why leading question have be put left father in study when returned let in by back door went to bed quietly know jabez always objected to seeing henry so wished to avoid trouble morning when went into ugh ugh come see for mr coppersley gripped bella wrist to draw towards door be murder robbery bella released wrist with sudden jerk followed elder woman down stair robbery what do mean come see said mr coppersley hysterically must send for police suppose oh poor nerve never never will get over shock disagreeable a jabez always be to be ready for heaven though perhaps did send for mr penny to talk religion to did father send for mr penny yes asked to go to village with note for mr penny must not find mr penny at home so left note for then met henry returned a told after ten o'clock did mr penny come to see father asked bella anxiously be wondering if preacher have by chance seen cyril enter house know ca say oh dear how dreadful be maundered mr coppersley opening door of study just look for bella father lie dead in blood oh how hope that villain who killed robbed will be hanged drawn quartered do wretch viper beast must get rum ca stay in room without rum will faint know will what be time seven o'clock oh dear so late must send tunks for police have to be here to see father oh dear ca see father unless go to heaven where be sure hope jabez have gone one never know certainly be most disagreeable to oh how ill be oh how very very bad feel thus lamenting mr coppersley drifted out of room towards back part of premise leaving bella alone with dead man captain huxham be dead stone dead body lay on floor between desk chair have be sitting on from position of corpse bella judged that father have suddenly risen to meet descending weapon have pierced heart not being able to defend have fallen dead at murderer foot with cautious remembrance that must not remove anything until police came bella knelt examined body carefully without laying finger on same clothes over heart have be pierced by extremely sharp instrument have penetrated even through thick pea jacket worn by dead man there be blood on cloth on floor although ignorant of medical knowledge bella judged that death must have be almost instantaneous otherwise there must have be sign of struggle a captain huxham must not have submitted tamely to death casement be fast closed furniture be quite orderly at least bella judged so when first looked round for chair be upset on second glance became aware that drawer of desk be open that flexible lid of desk be up that pigeon hole have be emptied of paper also be startled most green painted safe be unlocked through door stood ajar must see that paper therein be likewise in disorder in fact of be lying on floor strongly agitated bella constructed theory of murder saw a in vision perhaps wrongfully what have taken place captain have come to desk for purpose hearing noise perhaps suspecting that there be danger have unexpectedly turned only to be stabbed when fell dead criminal took key of safe from dead man pocket committed robbery then examined pigeon hole of desk afterwards departed probably by front door since casement be closed robbery undoubtedly be motive for commission of crime girl rose to foot drawing long breath of relief cyril certainly must not have slain father since cyril must not have robbed young man assuredly have come to house must swear to herself if have quarrelled with huxham might have struck in moment of anger there be reason to believe that cyril must rob safe hence there must be person who have committed murder robbery who be that person mr coppersley have stated plainly that huxham have sent message to penny asking to call perhaps have obeyed summons after cyril left then have murdered captain there be motive for so timid good living man a preacher to slay rob so far a bella knew penny did not want money since wished to make wife be imperative that huxham must live in order to forward aim be at point that girl recalled with shudder fact that cyril have confessed need for one thousand pound must lister be culprit after cried bella aloud in agony of shame man love must not be guilty of so vile act so tried to comfort fact of cyril visit to house still lingered in mind shortly mr coppersley returned with tunks at heel handy man of bleacres be medium sized individual with swarthy skin beady black eye peering from under tangled black hair lean lithe quick in movement betrayed gypsy blood immediately to most unobservant for there be something oriental in appearance just now looked considerably scared came further than door of room there be master said mr coppersley pointing to dead so just go to village tell policeman to come here bella have not touched anything have bella shook head have not even touched body confessed with shudder tunks be about house last night miss said man looking more scared than ever went home nigh on seven o'clock be with granny evening know nothing about miss suppose do rejoined girl tartly thought might have seen father later than mr coppersley here left house last night at same time a ma'be said tunks addressing to housekeeper locked back door after yes acknowledged mr coppersley promptly so did must be at seven a came up saw bella few minute before with tea toast did come back tunks did retorted gypsy sullenly went on to marshely got back home never came near house again until morning can ask granny if be in bed early last night when did see master last questioned bella tunks removed dingy cap to scratch untidy lock must be about six just before have tea wanted to reduce wage too said 'd give notice if did suppose growled tunks with eye on remains be notice in case now never mind bothering about cried mr coppersley sharply go to marshely tell policeman to come here bella moved to door let leave room lock door nothing must be touched until truth be known will truth ever be known asked girl drearily a went into hall watched aunt lock door of death room of course retorted elder woman one person can not murder person without being seen know so much about aunt rosamund tunks be away be locked in room so anyone must enter glanced towards study door shuddered did see anyone asked mr coppersley quickly bella started replied with unnecessary loudness how must see anyone when be drugged drugged miss cried tunks pricking up ear mr coppersley turned on handy man stamped how dare linger here cried must be half way to village by time miss bella be having wakeful night father gave sleeping draught off with drove tunks out of front door why did tell lie asked bella when man be hurrying down path eager like tribe to carry bad news lie lie mr coppersley placed arm akimbo looked defiant why do call lie did complain of sleepless night did say that tea poured out by jabez be drugged be true enough admitted girl quietly merely slept badly because of hot weather never asked father for sleeping oh interrupted mr coppersley tossing head what doe matter ca even say if tea be drugged will learn soon replied bella drily for have locked up cup containing dreg of tea father doubt feared lest must run away with cyril so drugged least said soonest mended bella say nothing of drugging at inquest a there be need to blacken father character see that anything must say must blacken father character aunt rosamund of course have business to drug if be asked at inquest will tell truth so connection with lister person will come out bella turned on aunt in fury what do care cried stamping have right to marry if choose care if world know how love in fact whole world soon will know well said mr coppersley with air of washing hand of entire affair say what like blame if find in unpleasant position bella who be ascending stair turned to answer last remark promptly why must find in unpleasant position demanded do accuse of murdering father god forbid god forbid cried mr coppersley piously with shudder can not deny that be alone in house locked in bedroom a can testify oh will say that willingly 'd better wash out that cup of dreg say nothing more have already mentioned matter in tunks hearing so must explain further if necessary will say why believe father acted so story of sleepless night will not do for will blacken memory of dead groaned mr coppersley dismally ah never loved poor father did asked bella suddenly in way did in way did said aunt evasively jabez never be brother must have be to daughter nearer than sister must have loved to distraction in spite of way behaved to have to keep firm hand over high spirit aunt rosamund burst out bella at white heat why do talk in silly way know that to to father acted like cruel tyrant that while be alive must hing to please want to speak ill of dead know what say be true be none of perfect snuffled mr coppersley wiping eye daresay jabez be worse than many others be good sister to in spite of horrid way be sure life be spent in looking after other people first mother then husband afterwards jabez now will marry henry vand be happy talk of happiness with bella pointed downward to study in house go make tidy aunt will do same have very trying day before so like jabez so very like jabez wailed mr coppersley while bella fled up stair always brought trouble on everyone even a little boy behaved like pirate be oh dear how ill feel bella bella come down see faint bella bella girl did not answer a knew that mr coppersley only wished to gossip going to own room again examined cup with dreg have not locked up in spite of saying so to mr coppersley undoubtedly tea tasted bitter resolved to have analysed so a to prove to herself fact of drugging knew perfectly well that father have attended to tea evidently to render helpless in case meditated flight with cyril in dong so have indirectly brought about own death for have be awake must have descended from window to be present at interview have ended so fatally at point while be locking up cup in convenient cupboard bella became aware that be thinking a though lover be actually guilty of deed of course must not be decided desperately even though thing looked black against lister honest frank must not murder old man in so treacherous manner however might be goaded into doing so yet have assuredly seen enter house if must only have seen depart drug have prevented that welcome sight penny might have struck blow penny have reason to do so in fact have inducement to keep huxham alive bella must not read riddle of murder knew be that must be necessary for to hold tongue about lister unexpected visit to solitary farm will never be able to marry after wailed chapter vi inquest tunks lost time in delivering gruesome message in spreading news of death while village policeman telegraphed to superior officer at pierside handy man of late captain huxham adopted public house a kind of st paul cross whence to promulgate grim intelligence here passed happy exciting hour detailing have happened to awe stricken crowd member of supplied with free drink marsh folk be dull peaceful law abiding people be rarely that crime be committed in district hence news of murder caused tremendous sensation captain jabez huxham be well known eccentricity in matter of planting bleacres with yearly corn have be much commented upon in napoleonic time fertile marsh farm have be golden with grain of late year owing to russian american competition little have be sown huxham a rustic argued must not have got even moderate price for crop so puzzled one why persisted in unprofitable venture there must be no more sowing at bleacres now for captain be about to be put under earth grand funeral will have said rustic morbidly alive to importance of grim event for thirty year crime of magnitude have be committed in neighbourhood violent death of huxham provided bovine creature with new thrill meanwhile policeman dutton by name have proceeded to bleacres followed when news became more widely known by large curious throng for day for following day until huxham body be buried bleacres must no longer be called solitary farm in one sense of word inherent respect of agriculturist for growing crop kept individual member of crowd male female to narrow path led from boundary channel to front door of manor house when inspector inglis arrived with three four policeman from pierside excluded public from ground curious still hovered in distance beyond jordan a be with inquisitive eye fastened on quaint old mansion to one now assumed portentous proportion a abode of terror inspector inglis be very quiet man who said little who kept eye on alert inspected body of dead man then sent for doctor who delivered report in due course study be examined thoroughly entire house be searched from cellar to garret then bella aunt be questioned tunks be also put in witness box in spite of official curiosity backed by official power on part of inglis convened jury of inquest a ignorant of truth a when have begun search certainly found blood stained dagger behind massive mahogany desk with undoubtedly crime have be committed must discover trace of assassin three four day later when inquest took place in manor house mystery of murder be still unsolved on evidence procurable did there seem to be chance of solution during early part of inquiry mr coppersley have told inglis how late brother have sent with note to marshely asking silas penny to call when questioned preacher not without agitation dismay stated that have be absent from lodging until eleven o'clock on fatal evening have not obeyed summons of deceased certainly on return have found read note asking to call a hour be late have deferred visit until next morning then of course news of murder have be made public penny have said nothing until questioned by inspector be quite frank open in reply inglis be satisfied that young preacher knew nothing about matter from moment when informed by mr coppersley of crime until inquest bella suffered greatly at request dr ward medical man who have reported on time manner of huxham death have examined dreg of tea cup beyond doubt a discovered laudanum have be poured into tea so largely that be little wonder have slept so soundly even have there be struggle a ward assured must not have heard commotion a state of study showed that murderer have taken victim unawares be little to be wondered at bella woke in ignorance of what have taken place during night be thankful to have testimony of young physician a to drugging since thereby be entirely exonerated from complicity in crime for dreadful a may seem there be evil seeker who hinted that huxham daughter having be alone in house must be aware of truth if not actually guilty bella knew that evidence of dr ward mr coppersley a to drugging locking of bedroom door must clear character be therefore not on account that suffered because of inexplicable absence of cyril lister since have seen enter house shortly after eight o'clock on fatal night have not set eye on have received communication at time when needed so greatly seemed strange that lover must be absent since fact of murder now being known over england appeared incredible that alone must be ignorant in spite of desire to believe guiltless conduct looked decidedly suspicious if nothing serious have taken place between cyril father on night in question why have lister gone away at least surmised that have gone away a did not appear to be in village heard mention of name from many people who haunted house try a might bella dearly a loved young man must not rid herself of frightful belief that have struck blow considering circumstance alone knew fully have reason to commit crime yet in face of strongest circumstantial evidence bella must not bring to credit cyril guilt day after day like sister anne climbed to quarter deck to see if be coming day of inquest came in due course even then have not put in appearance coroner be grim snappy old doctor who set forth object of inquest gruffly tersely jury under direction inspected body then gathered in large stately dining room of manor house to consider evidence inspector inglis confessed that have few witness that there be nothing in evidence likely to lead to arrest of murderer robbery said officer be undoubtedly cause of crime since desk have be rifled safe have be forced open mr coppersley sister of deceased went on to say must state that knew brother kept at least one hundred pound in gold in safe be missing so probably will take thing in order if please snapped gruff coroner at point of inspector speech call witness inglis be only too willing dr ward gave evidence proved that in opinion after examination of body deceased have be stabbed to heart between hour of eight eleven on night in question witness must not be more precise said confession brought grunt from coroner old doctor lifted eye brow to intimate that young doctor did not know business over well else must have be more explicit dr ward avoided argument by hurriedly stating that according to opinion grunt from snappy coroner wound have be inflicted with dagger found behind mahogany desk remark led to production of dagger foot long steel broad towards hilt tapering to sharp point be set in handle of jet black wood carved into semblance of ugly negro odd part about blade be that middle portion of steel be perforated with queer letter of cuneiform type filled in with copper coroner frowned when examined strange weapon looked inquiringly at mr coppersley doe belong to late brother asked jerkily mr coppersley looked at knife jabez being sailor have manner of queer thing said hesitatingly never set eye on that be one to show what have sir be brother ever in africa on west coast be over world ca rightly say where sir why gruff coroner shook weapon be african sacrificial knife in use on west coast from way in copper be welded into steel fancy nigerian tribe possessed member of tribe thereabouts be clever metal worker handle lettering also remind of something mused doctor for be long time out in senegal sierra leone saw saw be matter how come african sacrificial knife here be sure know sir said mr coppersley promptly jabez a say have manner of queer thing did show ca say if knife belonged to sir ca murderer may have brought be not here to give opinion growled doctor throwing ugly looking weapon on table be sure added to ward that wound be made with knife yes be sure replied young practitioner tartly for coroner attitude annoyed weapon be sharp pointed fit wound also deceased wore thick pea jacket only such knife must have penetrated cloth if blow be struck with sufficient force snapped coroner be rejoined witness have more question to ask coroner nodded ward gave surgical detail to prove death must have taken place almost instantaneously since huxham have be stabbed to heart apparently deceased noise rose suddenly from chair at desk to face round in self defence assassin be too quick for struck knife to deceased heart with great force a be apparent from be supposition contradicted coroner rudely stick to fact boiling with rage young doctor confined forthwith to bald statement of what have discovered then be curtly dismissed to give place to mr coppersley that lady be voluble sharp tongued so that coroner quite met with match much to delight of dr ward smarting under much discourtesy mr coppersley deposed that have left house at seven o'clock by back door with note for mr silas penny from brother asking to call at manor house left note at mr penny lodging then went on to grocery shop to make purchase to see mr vand son henry there remained until quarter to ten o'clock afterwards returned to manor house mr vand saw a far a boundary channel then went home what time be that asked coroner making note just at

did assassin escape must have gone by front door after committing crime since key be in inside locked back door coming going mr coppersley murdering beast said witness melodramatically might have got out of study window then must be very small man retorted coroner for only small man must scramble through window examined hour ago please said mr coppersley with air of indifference know be that be glad did discover jabez in gore on night at hour if have 'd be holding inquest on possibly if assassin be in study when passed through hall mr coppersley ugh shivered witness be just where be depend upon sir getting through window when 'd dropped knife behind desk oh what escape have have wept mr coppersley there there bellow said coroner testily get down let witness luke tunks be called bleacres

in bed until morning then came a usual to manor house found that master be dead admitted that have quarrelled with master over possible curtailment of wage have not parted in very friendly spirit ca say a did for ended witness defiantly one suggests thing snapped coroner have reason to believe that deceased expected to be murdered tunks scratched head have have said at length master did seem afraid of someone a be always looking over shoulder said that planted corn so that there must be only one path up to house then rigged up that out look round chimney there witness jerked head towards ceiling be got search light there also turned on at time coroner nodded late captain search light be well known be only put down a freak on part of freakish man remark of witness about corn be new do

get down silas penny young preacher examination occupied only few minute said that be absent from lodging until eleven then returned to find note a be late did not call went to bed a landlady must prove have reason to believe captain huxham expected to be murdered considered that old sailor be more than capable of looking after witness be very friendly with captain wished to marry miss huxham arrangement to captain be quite agreeable witness presumed that huxham wished to see about projected marriage when wrote note asking witness to call next morning when about to pay visit witness heard of murder bella be final witness stepped before coroner inquisitive juryman looking pale composed gave evidence carefully a made up mind to say nothing about cyril visit on fatal night also be grateful that in statement penny have said nothing of lister rivalry noted also that penny have kept quiet about offer of hand a reward for death of cyril made by father to preacher more than ever believed wild declaration to be due to imagination on young man part what have to say about matter miss huxham asked coroner in usual gruff way nothing at replied nothing at echoed juryman looked at one have quarrelled with father on afternoon of night when met with terrible death refused to let come to supper so retired to room mr coppersley brought up tea toast then locked in room by father order cried mr coppersley rising silence said coroner scowling surely miss huxham must have heard if heard nothing interrupted bella straightening slim figure for be drugged h be coroner looked at shrewdly mr coppersley said something of why be drugged who drugged father drugged cup of tea brought by aunt with laudanum said bella bravely determined to speak out yet conscious of curious face yes did cried mr coppersley brought tea to study then went to get toast jabez have poured out tea when came back giving cup told to take to bella never knew that be drugged can state that be said dr ward rising miss huxham gave dreg to examine can prove coroner intervened testily be very much out of order said let proceed with caution miss huxham tell story then can hear dr ward mr coppersley have scarcely story to tell said bella still apprehensive yet still brave discreet be engaged to be married father did not approve of choice interrupted meeting with future husband who be if may ask mr lister be gentleman who have be stopping here yes yes know coroner did know for wife be great gossip collected scandal for mile around in fact have heard something of philandering of lister after miss huxham go on bella proceeded father must not allow to come to supper sent up aunt with tea toast to lock in room did so did not eat toast drank tea then fell asleep half on floor half on bed aunt awoke in morning with news of what have happened heard nothing how must growled ward when be drugged silence there said coroner sharply what time did fall under influence of opiate miss huxham shortly after eight so far a can recollect did know that tea be drugged if have must not have drunk retorted witness be only next morning guessed truth then kept dreg for dr ward to examine say can give evidence interrupted coroner why did father drug ca say sir unless feared lest must elope with mr lister have such intention have not coroner looked at earnestly pinched lip apparently nonplussed whole affair struck a strange cross examined girl carefully when examined mr coppersley ward of bore out improbable story in coroner opinion told by girl finally old doctor accepted testimony dismissed witness ca compliment on conduct of case inspector inglis said when informed that more witness be forthcoming have collected nothing likely to solve mystery can not manufacture evidence sir said inglis stiffly coroner grunted made acid speech in pointed out that evidence laid before jury amounted to absolutely nothing only one verdict must be brought in wilful murder against person person unknown be accordingly done assembly dispersed only coroner remained to state sourly to inglis that considered police in general to be fool pierside inspector to be king of chapter vii cyril bella captain huxham death having be legally relegated to list of undiscovered crime gnarled old body be committed to damp grave in marshely cemetery there be vast concourse of people from far near to assist at funeral of one who have be so mysteriously murdered so greatly have strangeness of deed appealed to imagination of metropolitan reader that many london reporter came down to see last of case if possible to begin again by making enquiry ask a might must learn nothing be therefore compelled to content with picturesque description of ancient manor house amidst corn field with inaccurately lurid account of late owner career a sailor mr coppersley went to funeral a chief mourner a bella resolutely declined to do so be sorry for tyrannical father violent death being very human found difficult to forgive for way in have behaved have bullied shut in room finally have drugged by stealth a turned out be just a well that have done so a thereby be able to prove that knew nothing of crime even though be alone in house then again there be other side of question to take that if huxham have not administered laudanum might have be alive well at moment seemed to bella overstrung with nerve that higher power have dealt out punishment to captain for crime committed undiscovered certainly agreed with tunks that father have dark secret in mind led to isolate in midst of corn however be dead buried so all debt be paid bella sitting in vast drawing room of manor house with church service open on lap tried hard to forget huxham bad trait of character to remember good one be somewhat difficult a captain have few engaging quality bella recalled that have be kind in gruff sort of way have never grudged best of food gaudiest of frock huxham have be one of so called good people who be amiable so long a everything be done according to liking who display tyrant when crossed on whole might have be worse after a anxiously kept in mind be father room wherein sat with blind down be opposite study be large apartment sparsely furnished huxham did not care for drawing room a preferred den mr coppersley have bothered incessantly until provided with furniture for place selected furniture what with brother stinginess own bad taste result be woefully bad room spacious lofty stately be decorated a beautifully a be study required most exquisite furniture to enhance faded splendour mr coppersley have bought magenta hued sofa many magenta covered chair together with cheap sideboard so sticky a to look like fly catcher two arm chair of emerald green inlaid floor have covered with lineoleum diapered white black artistic taste have led to paint mellow oak panelling with pink aspinall enamel a curtain of many window be yellow blind blue effect be disastrous suggestive of paint box artist must have died of confusion of tint barbarism of destroying oak panel mr coppersley be more than satisfied with result when seated in drawing room on sunday felt to be quite lady at present moment bella nerve be le troubled than usual blind be down in sympathy with funeral dim twilight pervaded room hiding more le atrocious grandeur sat in one of green arm chair near fire place reading burial service listening to solemn tolling of bell after time dropped book on lap leaned back to close eye reflect on grave position if only have not seen cyril on night must have married in ignorance that have anything to do with death of father enlightened a be appeared impossible that must become wife have said nothing of visit at inquest hideous doubt remained in mind although strove to banish by assuring over over again that lister must have have hand in matter how must prove innocence be alone in sinister house although be bright sunshine out of door felt scared cool dim room dreary booming of distant bell impressive word of burial service have just be reading thing united in weird appeal to psychic instinct to mysterious sens deal with unseen in arm chair sat with closed eye strung up to breaking point felt that if psychic influence seemed to control became more insistent must scream thought flashed across mind that father be walking that dim chill apartment trying to communicate truth in nervous excitement must almost have sworn that heard heavy tread of foot thus when really did hear light footstep in entrance hall without uttered piercing scream staggered to foot hall door knew have be left open since coffin have be carried down path between standing corn so that anyone must enter perhaps assassin have come back to review scene of crime to commit white faced panic stricken by power of own emotion engendered by circumstance clung to back of arm chair straining eye towards door at sound of thin high pitched scream footstep have ceased for moment a though intruder be listening now recommenced drew near outside of door unable to utter sound bella stared through dim light saw door open cautiously face looked in eye set in face blinked in semi gloom then door opened widely cyril lister stepped in oh darling with sudden rush of relief bella ran rapidly towards door to throw into lover arm then gruesome memory of sinister visit made falter pause half way cyril closed door stood where be holding out hungry arm dearest said softly oh poor girl bella did not move stood looking at a though fascinated wore white drill suit made tropic fashion high at neck with white shoe panama hat white clothed figure accentuated twilight of room now looked brown grim considering that father be dead even now be being laid in untimely grave cyril might have come to dressed in mourning unless ah unless oh stretched out arm a advanced slowly come near come near bella stopped in sheer surprise bella darling know ah yes know gasped retreating towards chair perhaps know too well because have not be to see before asked surprised bella dearest must have come have be abroad during week have to go to paris to see friend of mine noted hesitation shivered when did go cyril came near again shrank away on afternoon when father found in corn field be not true be not true how can lie to bella cyril stopped short again in faint light must see that looked thoroughly puzzled amazed what do mean girl leg refused to support longer sank into chair father be being buried gasped know know replied sympathetically went to funeral finding be not present came here to comfort went to funeral eye dilated why must not go after even though quarrelled be father last tribute of respect oh stop stop can say to to of people lister frowned pinched lip lonely house cold dull room have unnerved said after pause make allowance for what have gone through know understand know what understand what inquired sharply said nothing at inquest held tongue never bella cyril now thoroughly roused advanced seized wrist in gentle grasp be crazy talking in way have have enough to make crazy said bitterly let go not till explain mysterious behaviour no grasped wrist tighter a strove to release not till explain ah cried out shrilly will murder also lister suddenly released wrist fell back pace murder also repeated be then in habit of murdering people father well go on said a word stuck in throat oh wrung hand helplessly saw saw saw what voice became impatient almost fierce saw enter house house saw enter house when on night father be murdered at eight o'clock what devil be talking about cried cyril roughly be in london at eight o'clock on night went to paris next morning never heard of murder a saw newspaper when returned last night read account of inquest in evening paper came down morning to comfort really think trouble have turned head bella girl stared at in astonishment even though have spoken so very plainly cyril did not seem to comprehend that be accusing of having committed dastardly crime heart suddenly grew light perhaps after be mistaken can prove innocence innocence of what in heaven name cried angrily of of murder faltered lister stared scarcely must believe ear be not serious oh dear sobbed wish be not accuse of murdering father really accuse of actually be of really saw enter house at eight o'clock little after on night intended to come down thinking father might quarrel drank tea must have seen about tea at inquest be in report given in paper then fell asleep woke to hear that father be dead never betrayed cyril god be witness have held tongue lister passed hand across forehead fell helplessly into near chair accuse of murdering father said again repeated feverishly saw looked up wore grey clothes a have done in afternoon when father interrupted bella bella must have be dreaming drug be not dreaming interrupted vehemently saw before drank drugged tea called to looked up entered house without making sign of recognition then fell asleep oh dear flung down at foot seized hand what took place between father be sure did not kill be quite sure of remember held tongue yes held oh groaned young man looking down into agitated face be losing reason will shortly persuade that killed did not did not ah never say that did said lister shortly rose so suddenly a to let fall if believe to be murderer have better part wailed stretching out hand a strode towards door oh cyril leave be have lister be in white heat with rage stood fumbling at door backward glance at pale face cooled somewhat recognised that be in presence of mystery that be necessary for own peace of mind a for bella to probe mystery to bottom on impulse of moment walked back lifting placed again in arm chair then knelt beside took hand darling said softly firmly swear to what must not swear to living creature be innocent if anyone have accused must have cyril cyril wreathed arm round neck only fancied really did not think that removed arm must believe in innocence in face of evidence said sternly own eye faltered frowned that certainly be puzzling still drug saw enter house before drunk tea protested told that before sens be quite clear perfectly clear thought that have come to try induce father to consent to marriage strange muttered young man be not near house be sure be sure oh lister tone be highly exasperated will drive mad talking in way hearken added speaking calmer when left captain huxham in corn field went straight back to lodging there found letter referring to thousand pound wished to borrow have to see friend who be willing to lend to on night therefore went to london by six o'clock train landlady can prove left house flyman can prove drove to local station ticket office there that bought ticket guard of train shut in first class compartment be evidence enough fancy yes yes for might have sneaked back suppose mean said bitterly rising to walk floor can prove alibi easily at eight o'clock be at friend room in duke street st james a man can swear have gone to paris arranged to follow went to theatre to dinner with two friend of mine did not leave until one in morning when returned to hotel murder took place at eleven between eight eleven so can easily prove be not here next morning went to paris got money from friend lingered there with only returned yesterday to learn that father be dead then came down here morning to meet with reception cyril cyril be hard on be not hard retorted how can love woman who doubt besides robbery be motive for commission of crime be likely to stab old man then rob never believed yet yet what asked curtly wanted thousand pound oh lip curled believed that robbed father safe to get unfortunately understood from aunt evidence at inquest that only one hundred pound in gold be in safe so must have committed brutal murder needlessly never said that murdered father cried bella despairingly inferred a much retorted cuttingly also that robbed cried vehemently now thoroughly believing to be completely innocent trying woman like to recover position cyril listen to will see that a thing look be justified nothing can justify believing to be guilty of double crime bella bowed proud head can see now said humbly must have seen before replied harshly raised head looked at indignantly bringing into play powerful weapon of sex give opportunity of defending said in offended tone of woman wronged ask pardon give opportunity now replied coldly saw enter house repeated somewhat weakly be impossible rejoined briefly oh clasped hand together what be use of saying that be not since firmly believe what tell same cyril sprang forward seized hand looked deep into eye believe then yes do if man be not must have be double be so like then exactly like tell cyril leaned out of window spoke to man called by name what did do looked up making sign of recognition stepped into house a door be not locked never believed for one moment that be not resolved to clamber out of window to be present at interview then drank drugged tea made gesture of despair know rest how be man dressed in grey suit just a wore in afternoon saw face saw very plainly although twilight be growing darker at time must have sworn be face must have spoken to man have not believed to be yet cyril stopped tugged at moustache face have grown pale looked decidedly worried man be of height be like in respect perhaps if have seen in broad daylight might have recognised mistake unless oh cyril must have be ghost said lister in strangled voice be absurd have idea that made for door there be nothing more to say cyril will leave wo kiss there be nothing more to say said lister now deadly pale walked abruptly out of dim room bella fell back in chair wept be over chapter viii witch wife interview between engaged lover have be strange one not least strange part be termination apparently after hearing description of mysterious double given by bella lover must have explained much at least gathered from hint broken conversation gave after departure sat weeping until struck sensible nature how very foolish be to waste time in idle regret whether cyril felt so mortally offended by doubt a to regard engagement at end must not say after thought believed that remark have given clue have left thus abruptly to follow up sooner later must return to explain then must be well between in spite of odd behaviour have one great consolation in knowing that be innocent denial of guilt have be so strong alibi set forth be so easy of proof so impossible of invention that blamed sincerely for ever having doubted young man nevertheless considering weird circumstance fact of likeness of double whomsoever might be to lover must scarcely regard a having be foolish nine people out of ten must have made same mistake must have harboured similar doubt certainly seeing that loved cyril devotedly must have be tenth in hour of trial faith have proved very weak tried to remind that have never really believed to be guilty same recalling late conversation have to recognise that word must have left very little doubt in lister mind a to fact that believed to be robber assassin well if have surely have be severely punished a be only fair mr coppersley returned from funeral in very chastened frame of mind in company of henry vand whom have bidden to tea table be furnished forth with funeral baked meat after fashion of hamlet mother wedding mr vand did full justice to wonderful justice considering apparently delicate constitution be not very tall remarkably handsome with young clean shaven face large blue eye curly golden hair body be well shaped save right foot be twisted leg of be shorter than other like talleyrand lord byron young man be club footed otherwise have very attractive personality from delicate finger must be seen that be musician have air of refinement astonishing in one of breeding birth bella did not like much not that have fault to find with eye be willow like of bird conversation be dull to say least of sole way in must converse be through violin a have not that with on occasion bella preferred to remain absent from lavish tea table mr coppersley did not object a wanted darling to herself however mr coppersley be very severe on niece for not attending funeral have many sweet thing to say regarding virtue of deceased have just discovered after death meant well did poor dear jabez sighed mr coppersley over cup of tea if did swear be calling that made profane bella niece be standing at door a spoke to morrow be going up to see lawyer about property oh trouble about said bella wearily thank mr vand care to eat feel too miserable not trouble about property cried mr coppersley paying attention to latter part of speech do care thing must be settled somehow must arrange future life cast tender glance on handsome musician future must be settled also will look after said bella not liking aunt tone have better be sharp then said mr coppersley in dictatorial manner for sooner thing be settled better be not young cast second tender glance on swain who be eating largely ah well useless to talk of wedding when funeral be in air to morrow evening bella after have seen lawyer life in cade lane london will tell have arranged bella looked in astonishment at aunt who suddenly seemed to have acquired late captain tyrannical manner apparently mr coppersley forgot a bella thought that must not inherit solitary farm needed to be reminded of fact that niece be mistress of bleacres in fact bella be on point of saying a much when remembered that vand be present not being anxious to discus family matter in presence even though be about to enter family a mr coppersley husband abruptly left room mr coppersley poured out second cup of tea remarked in high tone of satisfaction that people nose be about to be brought to grindstone bella heard remark a put on hat walked out of front door accentuated lonely feeling for saw plainly now what have long guessed that aunt rosamund have very little affection for late captain also have never cared much for daughter now that cyril have vanished in enigmatic manner poor girl felt more wretched than ever listlessly walked down narrow path a far a boundary channel wondered how must all end have be religious girl might have sought comfort in prayer knew very little about true religion did not care for sort preached by mr silas penny in little bethel at marshely a name flashed into mind looked up saw standing on opposite side of channel so be apparent although knew nothing about such thing that telepathic communication have made think of preacher be in usual dismal garb have accentuated same by wearing black glove black tie in place of usual white one patience on monument might have be taken a type of mr penny on occasion be not smiling on grief in person of miss huxham in fact did not smile at being shocked to see out of door why be not weeping in chamber reproved silas in most clerical manner loss of so good father have doubtless said have to say on subject at funeral mr penny retorted bella whose nerve be worn thin with worry spare repetition of such stale remark be horribly rude speech a well knew penny have way of irritating beyond endurance mere sight of be sufficient to set teeth on edge for day be intolerable that must intrude on privacy now when particularly wished to be alone intimated a much by turning away with displeased air walked for short distance along bank path leading to mr tunks hut silas absolutely ignorant of feminine nature entirely devoid of diplomacy persisted in thrusting company upon bella turned sharply when heard silas breathing hard behind spoke with marked indignation wish to be alone if please declared flushing ah ah remonstrated penny stupidly allow to comfort can not retorted marvelling at density allow to try be on point of calling at house to bella interrupted cruelly can call there still mr penny aunt will be glad to see have mr vand to tea so will find in congenial company company be congenial enough for be very flattering prefer to be alone silas however declined to be shaken off reproachful look so exasperated bella that felt inclined to thrust into water speech be even more irritating than manner let soothe dear broken hearted sister pleaded in sheep like bleat want soothing be not broken hearted be not sister penny sighed be very very painful be bella admitted readily to surely be man enough mr penny to take plain telling if wo accept hint want to leave at once a be not disposed to talk if have way must never never leave again perhaps so far a be concerned will not get way why do dislike miss huxham like dislike retorted suppressing violent inclination to scream so annoying be persecution be nothing to want to be something wish to be sealed fountain late lamented father desired to be spouse be aware of mr penny perhaps will remember refused to marry other day broke heart then go mend then cried bella furiously angry only too anxious to drive away by behaving with aggressive rudeness alone can mend penny dropped on knee oh implore to mend hephzibah be to rose of sharon lily of vale get up sir make fool of oh angel of life listen to lately be poor in world good now have gold marry let fly to far land thought be desperately poor said bella suspiciously where did get money aged god fearing christian aunt left to said penny dropping eye be small sum one hundred pound in gold perhaps penny rose a though moved by spring thin white cheek flushed deep scarlet what do mean bella must not have told what meant at moment have suddenly occurred to to try rid herself of burr by hinting that have something to do with robbery if not with murder under ordinary circumstance must never have ventured to do being kind hearted girl penny exasperated so greatly that be on impulse of moment prepared to go to length to see last of mean said in reply to last question that father have one hundred pound in gold in safe accuse of accuse of nothing cried bella cutting short flaming up into royal rage be tired of company of silly talk only wish that mr lister must come along throw into channel red faded from penny face looked wickedly white eye flashed with sinister light dare say do said venomously mr lister have better keep out of way out of way of police girl felt heart almost stop beating now be turn to ask what mean said slowly preserving coolness preacher saw that be shaken followed up advantage think have better make term with accept a husband what will tell police what saw finished spitefully what did see asked in shaking voice on evening of murder came here at quarter to eight said silas slowly glittering eye on pale face wished to adore shrine wherein be jewel be desired to gaze on house beneath whose roof slept oh stop talking like speak plainly interrupted wearily will speak plainly enough now said young man calmly while watching by entrance through bush on other side of channel be suddenly brushed aside by lister person be growing dark recognised figure insolent face lordly air of prosperity walked up to house turned away sick at heart knowing that have gone to see when looked again on way back to marshely have disappeared so see paused see what questioned nervously that lister person must know somewhat of crime if indeed did not strike blow how can say that when lately intimated that mr lister if be mr lister doubt have come to see remember evidence given by aunt at inquest retorted penny sharply be locked in room be in drugged sleep mr coppersley have gone to lodging to deliver note from late father found on return that lister person must have seen father a be not on good term how do know that be not because late father hated very name of lister said that must rather see dead than married to also in note left at lodging father said that have quarrelled seriously with lister person have locked in room now if showed that note to police related how lister person have brushed aside so that must cross channel must be arrested must not

scarcely breathe so moved to side window drew up blind lifted lower sash outside brilliance of sunshine be almost blinding through quivering head across still stiff stalk of corn for there be wind must see gaudy red of scarecrow coat mere glint of violent hue made head ache returned to middle of room to walk up down wearily thinking of what be best to be done in circumstance in found photograph of cyril in silver frame replaced on table much loved face smiled encouragingly on at least in over wrought state thought so thought aided to beat down many fear assailed while musingly walking room became aware of slight noise turned abruptly towards window to see black face grinning at with very white teeth at once thought reverted to prophecy of granny tunks felt sudden thrill of dread a saw that black man actually have come to manor house for one moment negro fair young girl looked steadfastly at one filled with nervous fear curiously observant after almost imperceptible pause seemed hour to bella man leaped through window before must regain voice to forbid entrance where be master asked in guttural tone in fairly good english bella did not immediately reply a nerve fairly thrilled with weird realisation of what witch wife have seen in crystal even now have not voice under command negro be tall bulky powerfully framed coal black from head to foot with tightly curled hair sharp white teeth like of dog bella have never seen so huge strong man in spite of formidable appearance dark eye have kindly look in depth movement be extremely gentle apparently bark be worse

of tweed coat be here will find remarked did master see captain huxham yes replied mechanically did master captain huxham quarrel yes replied again still mechanically did master get what wanted demanded negro rolling eye know what mr lister wanted said bella faintly must explain explain nothing until see master be durgo reply perhaps captain huxham know where master be captain huxham be dead gasped durgo shut strong white teeth with click dead repeated ah aha aha captain huxham be dead then master cried bella covering eye believe that cyril killed father believe cyril father repeated durgo looking at curiously must learn if broke off suddenly moved noiselessly to window bella stretched helpless hand to stay lightly vaulting out of door disappeared in moment rushed to window saw running down path towards boundary channel there be chance of catching up a saw well therefore drew back crystal crystal muttered to herself shivering granny must know what mean must see granny ask about crystal chapter x lover meeting having made up mind to seek explanation from mr tunks regarding vision of negro in crystal be if old woman really have beheld same bella lost time in executing purpose in two three minute hastily reassumed hat cloak glove have removed while conversing with mr coppersley then taking sunshade left manor house by front door in dining room must hear refined tone of vand coarse voice of mr coppersley a laughed chattered in most amiable manner evidently pair have quite forgotten recent tragedy have invested bleacres with so sinister reputation with nervous shiver for merriment seemed to be singularly ill timed bella closed door softly walked down corn path glancing right left straight ahead must see nothing of black man who have appeared disappeared so mysteriously like witch in macbeth have made into thin air have vanished bella felt remarkably uneasy on face of have great cause to be so apparently have not least doubt of durgo be cyril servant who came in search of rather wondered that lover must have so uncivilised attendant resolved that if married must endeavour to get to dispense with service of man what struck most be question of durgo evidently expected cyril to meet huxham to have quarrel also stated time of two week day corresponded with midnight visit of cyril to manor house recollected then that visit be paid not at midnight about eight o'clock saw in mistake have made perplexity of bewildered brain with groan tried to clear understanding by swift movement for felt unable to follow regular train of thought nevertheless durgo innocent speech re awakened old suspicion though dreaded to recall what if after cyril have be visitor of fortnight since in case since huxham have be found dead cyril must have struck blow horror of mere idea placed barrier between made turn cold resolutely put from cyril be man loved man in whom have reason to believe have solemnly sworn that be innocent of father blood if entertained grain of affection for be bound to believe word even in face of strong evidence to contrary must be guiltless be guiltless a assured look word bearing convinced of guiltlessness in one way promised explanation must solve difficult problem when must explanation be made then again mr tunks must know somewhat of truth since have so truly foretold coming of negro bella entirely lacking mystical sense have belief in vision assumed that old woman for own end have played comedy based upon actual fact taking view girl walked towards hut of witch wife resolute to learn how much mr tunks knew concerning cyril past life something must know else must not have hinted at appearance of negro bella be ignorant that lover have so sinister servant seemed that mr tunks be better informed since old hag knew so much must know more few question must doubtless bring forth information then bella felt that must know how to act position be extremely difficult skein of life very tangled thinking in desultory way reached end of corn field be about to turn along pathway leading to hut when heard name called anxiously looking up saw dora ankers on hither side of boundary channel oh bella be so glad to see sang out marshely school mistress volubly really did want to go to manor meet that horrid aunt of yours come with dear be waiting at cottage who be waiting demanded bella greatly surprised by

hurriedly be yes be wo come to manor ca very well see in own room a nasty minded mr block might say thing be such gossip know in despair came to poor dear so asked to wait in sitting room while came for bella drew up stiffly did not desire to appear too willing to obey summons of lover womanlike wished to say that be in wrong so that pride might be saved be going to mr tunks what for asked dora bluntly never mind replied miss huxham unwilling to confess that be dealing with uncanny thing beyond veil must go dora tripped lightly across narrow plank slipped arm within of friend will hing of sort cold thing declared poor mr lister be quite broken hearted by way in have treated oh bella became stiffer than ever have said have said nothing be too much man to say anything saw poor pale peaked face doe look ill bella be seized with sudden qualm ill miss ankers gesture look became eloquent dear be dying oh dora miss huxham kilted up skirt fairly ran across plank why did come for

difficulty in keeping up a be slim small dainty woman more like fairy than mere flesh blood in spite of age confessed to thirty five have pink white skin golden hair clear blue eye dressed a be in pale blue with many ribbon ornament looked like well arrayed doll just out of satin lined box for innocent look miss ankers be stern school mistress during business hour behaved with great severity out of however presented to village world in true colour a sentimental airy sweet tempered little creature who be everybody friend nobody enemy bella be always fond of at moment felt more attached to than ever a have reason to be seeing that miss ankers have given up snug sitting room for lover meeting have actually brought that meeting about be good angel dora said bella kissing friend a drew near cottage on outskirt of marshely oh what waste remonstrated dora opening china blue eye to widest what will mr lister say to throwing away kiss on bella laughed for heart have grown unexpectedly light have firm belief that misunderstanding be about to be cleared up between lover herself also acknowledged to herself with great thankful joy cyril in spite of misgiving have returned to seeing how have doubted accused might have departed for ever with reason for course apparently loved so devotedly that be willing to remain explain be wonder that bella heart leaped for joy since cloud have for so long overshadowed sunshine of love be about to be dissipated almost danced into ankers small garden mr lister be in sitting room dear said that arch plotter pushing companion into cottage will find there have to go to church to run over evening hymn miss huxham knew that be mere excuse loved dora more for making miss ankers be much too romantic to mar meeting by presenting a inconvenient third therefore turned away laughing bella anxious to lose moment of joy entered small sitting room with bright expectant smile died away at sight of lister sombre face young man be seated in arm chair with newspaper lying on knee be not reading a eye be fixed darkly on door through bella have just entered for instant did not appear to be aware of presence then rose gravely bowed even in midst of dismay at reception bella be woman enough to note how spruce trim singularly handsome looked certainly face be grave pale beyond must not see dying look dora have so eloquently described when came face to face embarrassing silence ensued bella be first to speak be not pleased to see cyril faltered be very pleased returned gravely pushed forward chair will not be seated not until explain why receive in way declared indignantly send for come at once only to find displeased look last interview explains look bella doe cried up in arm at once admitted fault in suspecting then asked pardon left without kiss stopped with angry gesture seems to that be one who have right to be displeased said lister decidedly love very dearly a know how can tell that love dearly desire to meet again show that do many man must have left for ever on learning a did cruel suspicion have right to be displeased a said moment since be wronged person for if really loved must believe nothing against did only for single moment oh bella uttered cry of despair be only human being saw a thought entering house knew that on account have quarrelled with father so what must think that have killed pretend to be angel broke off sat down pressing hand hard together then looked up with feigned self control discussed before said coldly did invite here to ask to defend again asked here to learn from own lip that believe to be guiltless do swear do bella rose in excitement ask pardon for wicked suspicion bella sprang forward caught hand within own then really truly love if have gone away breathed faintly in ear must have died cyril drew closely to breast darling whispered smoothing hair love too dearly to leave ask pardon for harsh word on face of see what must do suspect be unreasonable for to ask to do otherwise that believe mere word in spite of strong evidence against show that love a dearly strongly a love so far be right trust one wholly entirely to death trust one be well cyril sat down in arm chair drew bella on to knee unity be strength with by side be not afraid then have be afraid asked softly of losing love yes now be satisfied on point there be thing make afraid what be may be accused of murder other people may have seen a saw dear then be gasped have explained if necessary can put forward alibi who be man then ca tell that cyril pushed away rose much agitated then know bella stood back from doubtfully ca be sure think be fancy bella ask anything just now later may be able to explain will explain if be possible remember said that might be able to explain of can not be certain understand sighed girl seating again cyril have matter anything to do with matter of murder yes mean to ask if be guilty a know be not be connected in way with matter no rejoined promptly if be must be accomplice after fact same paused looking paler than ever face became peaked haggard ask anything yet murmured be willing to trust dear said bella quietly a remarked time ago other people interrupted other people yes one else did see on evening person saw double corrected cyril be in london a told a can prove who be person silas penny ah lister hand clenched hate because be to be wife will go to police think so said bella slowly threatened to go a yet have held tongue why when hate so think think said bella slowly that mr penny know more about matter than chooses to admit cyril uttered exclamation do suspect not of murder replied promptly be too weak timid creature to commit crime know that be poor now be unexpectedly rich be aware added with emphasis one hundred pound be stolen from father safe on night of murder surely connect harmless man like penny with crime say nothing because know nothing cyril if mr penny be entirely innocent why doe not accuse whom hate have ground to go upon dear bella shook head think that have answered a believed be saw when met double at boundary channel since must like to see in trouble very fact that delay telling police show that own conscience be not easy be strange assented lister however if doe accuse can prove alibi what about double young man turned away abruptly to window can say nothing on point at present when will explain ca say sooner later lister with hand in pocket looked out of window a though to avoid further questioning behaviour puzzled bella a felt sure that cyril must tell much if inclined to do so be odd that must so decline abruptly reverted to earlier thought in mind did not tell that have negro servant called durgo lister wheeled sharply have servant negro otherwise said in decisive tone why do say that bella wondering still more gave detail cyril heard with perplexed frown made comment until have finished say that man recognised portrait in case can guess did not finish sentence became paler than ever chapter xi recognition bella found interview with cyril eminently unsatisfactory be perfectly plain that entertained strong suspicion regarding unknown person whom termed double even when questioned point blank declined to explain yet if lister knew of someone who resembled more le closely surely must place hand on someone when did so assassin of captain huxham must speedily be found being case be strange that cyril must hesitate again again bella questioned bluntly only to find more determined than ever to keep own counsel under circumstance be useless to prolong conversation girl left cottage feeling extremely despondent seemed to that problem must never be solved in spite of certainty entertained that cyril must solve if so wished did bella feel brighter when returned to manor for mr coppersley chose to take umbrage at niece absence bella declined to say where have be dismissed matter in few cold word not feeling sure of ground mr coppersley retreated for time being next day returned to attack with evident object of making manor house too hot for girl bella be strong enough to quell open mutiny on part of aunt must not defend against incessant nagging since death of brother mr coppersley have become a bold a hitherto have be meek in many skilful way contrived to make niece feel thoroughly uncomfortable a bella have quite enough to bear without being taxed further with petty worry became restive on third day of hostility demanded what aunt meant by behaving so aggressively mr coppersley better at ambush than in open warfare must have shirked battle bella forced quarrel since be absolutely necessary to bring matter to head never leave alone aunt rosamund complained wearily because be drone retorted mr coppersley eat yet work a st paul say wish to hear what st paul say thank must be better if did have good at heart nothing of sort merely wish to get rid of mr coppersley grew vividly red did not make denial why must not cried loudly treat a though be dirt under foot miss who be to behave like must like to know be father daughter said bella very distinctly who have be cheated out of inheritance will make prove word said mr

disliked cripple must not help admiring skilful way in mastered aunt perhaps magnetised with large blue eye calmness of manner may have have soothing effect be cause mr vand winced under silent gaze lowered voice a consented unexpectedly to do what suggested will give bella cheque for one hundred pound on condition that doe not trouble again grumbled going to desk with affectation of generosity

laughed ironically bella looked pained cyril cyril own father quite so dear be father can say more le a to what know relative to mystery will hear sky have clouded over sun no longer shone lark be silent chill wind seemed to breathe over golden broom yellow blossom of gorze bella shivered a change of temperature seemed to suit with cruel exactitude cynical tone of lover have never heard talk in way before then knew very little about absolutely nothing of past life now be about to hear from hard expression of face judged that story have to tell be not pleasant one a for durgo waited silently nothing must be read of feeling from dark mask of face edwin lister have saved life matter what be said durgo did not intend to change opinion of master a finest man in wide world mother died when be young said cyril after pause be brought up by maiden aunt father rarely saw a be always travelling round world in search of fortune never seemed to find sometimes returned to england treated with careless affection saw very little of for aunt must have be utterly neglected bless be dead raised hat poor cyril murmured bella affected by picture of dull childhood thank dear said taking hand aunt did everything for out of small income think father gave one penny towards education surely dear said cyril interrupting aunt told on death bed that have done everything so can see that father be only one to in name be working to make fortune in nigeria said durgo quickly so said when came home have not seen that fortune yet well to continue aunt sent to public school afterwards to oxford then became journalist aunt died leaving trifle of money on to live father came to london borrowed money principal of small income for one of wild scheme be left without one penny be duty to assist father said durgo uneasily 'out of mouth of babe suckling quoted cyril with side glance missionary have taught well durgo be christian said negro proudly so be in way however must get on with confession saw father at various interval meanwhile earned bread by reporting writing article rest of father appeared at interval like rolling stone gather moss always borrowed did not grudge money always said that be about to make fortune never did will make time said durgo vigorously treasure be certainly hidden in hinterland of nigeria when reach yes when scoffed cyril believe in father scheme tell last time came home be five month ago with said durgo gravely remained near dock master edwin lister went to grand part of town coming down to see when required service cyril nodded that sound like father said with shrug however on occasion told that intended to hunt for buried treasure in nigeria wanted money did not mention captain huxham so expect that intended to keep that part of business secret cyril hesitated well father be never mind broke off abruptly ca tell just now wanted sum of one thousand pound tried to get for oh cyril be that money mentioned asked bella in dismay yes sum for thought have killed father said cyril nodding then seeing that looked pained hastily added never mind dear be over understand one thoroughly went to paris a know to get money when returned heard of murder when called at father lodging in west end must learn nothing of whereabouts when mentioned double bella be forced on mind that father must have be that person a must see connection between father captain huxham refused to believe however from what durgo say there seems to be doubt that father did come by stealth to manor on night with idea of getting loan of money perhaps captain huxham quarreled seems clear that father did commit murder with sacrificial knife since came a did from nigeria never saw that knife said durgo abruptly did not see many thing said cyril rising for felt somewhat cramped father be probably a secretive with a be with be well educated durgo have wit about ask if be possible for two men to have come on particular occasion from nigeria two did come interrupted negro master quite so if be innocent father must be guilty durgo shrugged great shoulder for think very little of killing anyone said gruffly white men think differently so must not believe father guilty unless oh cyril clenched hand grew pale do not think must give world to believe innocent love miss huxham murder by father place barrier between if knew here cyril broke off hastily a remembered that be speaking to black man already regretted that have said so much have be carried away by tide of emotion matter stand like said abruptly changing subject father have killed captain huxham have disappeared with one hundred pound thought that mr penny began bella only to be interrupted be innocent said cyril hastily on face of be innocent go by evidence of knife from nigeria where penny have never be by fact that saw father whom mistook for enter manor about time crime be committed dare say be right said bella vaguely regretted that have so hastily condemned preacher after truth of legacy left by aunt be not fiction what will do now ask same question remarked durgo sharply be nearer truth than have be cyril looked in astonishment at negro who spoke such excellent english so much to point durgo undoubtedly in intellect be equal to if not superior to many englishman lister saw in helpful coadjutor in solving mystery must work together to learn whereabouts of father said wearily passing hand across forehead will be necessary to get out of country if what believe be correct may be that father have crossed channel if be so will write to commented negro paused then asked abruptly if learn that father be guilty will do best to get away from england why do ask durgo turned away after piercing glance thought from what hinted that must not be sorry to see father hanged talk rubbish man said lister sharply father be father when be said done only trust that be mistaken that be not guilty of brutal crime durgo shrugged massive shoulder a to care very little from what have heard of captain huxham in own country be not good man be better out of world than in bella grew crimson speak of father said angrily man bowed politely ask pardon missy then turned to cyril ceremoniously be stopping at 'the chequer inn ' at marshely informed so if will call there can speak about matter woman must have nothing to do with such affair be for men lister frowned a did not approve of superior way in negro talked however durgo gave chance of making remark swung off with noiseless jungle step cyril watched pas out of sight confessed that man puzzled in spite of barbaric origin black skin rough dress durgo spoke acted like gentleman though certainly have be somewhat rude regarding feminine sex yet like commented cyril half to seems to be square chap to have brain be not usual christy minstrel of africa humph after dare say that if scratched must find savage devotion to father doe credit wonder here be interrupted by low sob at elbow turned to find bella in tear dearest what be matter asked in dismay can ask moaned despairingly if what think be true must part for ever look at worst hope for best entreated ca be sure that father be guilty contradict said wiping eye wish must be trying to think that father be innocent know father have be evil genius life thought occurred to bella why did father require one thousand pound cyril looked at sideways did not like to speak out before durgo said hesitatingly fact be father forged cheque for sum chapter xiii mr tunks discovery so far appeared extremely probable that edwin lister be assassin of captain huxham from evidence of own eye bella knew that cyril father have called to see old sailor that have not seen depart be owing to fact of drugging by putting laudanum in girl tea huxham have precipitated own death since bella with wit about might have made third at interview so blow must not have be struck bella cyril thought edwin lister have come to manor intending to murder huxham although certainly seemed strange that former must have carried with nigerian knife with crime have be committed particular point might be explained be probable that tragedy be outcome of sudden quarrel edwin lister have profited little by crime since sum of one hundred pound be that have be able to find in safe certainly many paper have be carried away there be nothing to show that be of value save fact that have be thieved if edwin lister must only be found explanation might be forthcoming seemed to have vanished completely be not improbable that have walked to tarhaven mile away to escape on steamer to continent if be case be strange that have not communicated with savage friend durgo be man upon whom edwin lister must rely entirely setting aside fact that durgo be needed to guide expedition into hinterland of nigeria where treasure be concealed be now week since death burial of skipper a yet edwin lister have given sign of existence until did so there be chance of solving mystery true to promise cyril called at chequer inn to see durgo found that negro be looked upon a royal guest lean landlady believed to be african prince on secret mission to england concerning missionary question be right in one way for durgo undoubtedly be chief son of chief be questionable if be friend of missionary however a cyril found made excuse for presence in marshely mr

good english adornment of room present dress did not look for such thing in cyril hesitated in african negro finished durgo sitting down with grave smile well yes people of colour added cyril with covert insolence of white towards black usually durgo raised one large hand know proceed said with suppressed anger think be barbarian well be a rule be exception to rule durgo paused eye wandered to photograph over mantel piece told that missionary educated continued if look at photograph might learn who be real alma mater alma mater repeated cyril rising to approach mantel piece why be university photograph oxford be at oxford year ago cyril looked at group of boating men cricketer football player wondered wondered still more at portrait of durgo in master of art gown said cyril completely surprised yes why not father be great chief king a might say be edwin lister who first fired ambition to learn lore of white men so that might civilise tribe induced father to give much money took to england many year ago be at school at oxford until took degree then returned to tribe in nigeria in southern nigeria a father be dead attempted to teach countryman subject what have

of mine a chief drove father away only escaped death by accident managed to bring treasure with came with father to england now suppose want to find treasure spoke of regain chiefdom said cyril interested in strange story durgo fingered cigarette carefully lighted same there be treasure remarked quietly said know did when miss huxham be present woman a say must know nothing hear nothing of

government quite so government must not approve so for reason remained in rough clothes in rough lodging near dock while edwin lister went to live in west end interested several adventurous spirit in proposed expedition money be sadly needed have not enough thus father came down to see captain huxham get be required captain huxham whom father have met in nigeria owed father lot of money did not pay be only employing edwin lister to get back own see how did father learn whereabouts of captain huxham told be negro unexpected reply told recollect perhaps not a spoke hurriedly remember that when father one day asked for money said that wished to save must a desired to marry miss huxham father questioned learned that be daughter of old sailor be therefore easy for to guess that have found man for whom be seeking did not tell father where captain huxham lived durgo waved hand a mr giles brought in coffee be easy remarked when left room be followed here by father now that understand position will work with will work with to learn truth about murder understand said durgo shrewdly so that may prove edwin lister innocence yes said cyril accepting cup of black coffee host passed to be hoping to see father to learn that did not kill captain huxham if did there be chance of happiness for a can not then marry miss huxham durgo stirred coffee calmly be true be sorry for if such be case marriage be impossibility why not come with on expedition to hinterland of nigeria if win back chiefdom can do much for want to go with father said cyril turning pale especially if have a suspect

sympathy of entire neighbourhood be with disinherited girl mr vand a everyone said must have be ashamed of herself in spite of indecent way in thrust good fortune on everyone notice one be bold enough to tell be general opinion of conduct a for bella sat in corner feeling ill miserable have right to be so considering position in lover be placed be to ween thought from dismal state of affair that kind hearted school mistress have induced to come to concert hitherto cure have not worked programme be usual village one there be several sentimental ballad of purely english drawing room type two three recitation violin solo of henry vand who really played with rare skill reading by silas penny who be chairman penny looked leaner more delicate than ever read dream of eugene aram a cheerful contribution to evening entertainment sepulchral tone dismal appearance cast quite gloom over close of evening be only dispelled by singing of glee by marshely choral society time before point be reached bella have slipped out of room have taken way back to cottage went early a aunt have noticed be just possible that mr vand who dearly loved to make trouble might start quarrel if came to conversation between two mr vand have not forgiven enforced payment of one hundred pound bella did not enter cottage a be very hot within night be simply glorious took off hat veil seated in tiny garden to enjoy soft breeze there be not cloud in darkly blue sky serene moon moved majestically across starry heaven cottage with lamp light shining behind pink blind looked pretty picturesque so bella resolved to wait for dora return in open air have ample to think about for concert have failed to inspire with cheerful thought how must when cloud environed be so densely black poor bella be not religious have small faith in goodness of god be natural a god name have rarely be mentioned by captain huxham sister who be perfect heathen of animal sort so bella having hope to cling to seeing ray of light piercing darkness around began to conceive cheerless future in figure of cyril did not appear fact that father have murdered hers ended chance of marriage once for must doubtless go abroad try to forget while bereft of love home money father must seek humble situation a nursery governess must be confessed that a thing be bella huxham have good reason to despair chance of happiness seemed to be a far removed from a be moon in heaven above seat upon be resting stood close to white paling of garden under leafy chestnut now in full glory of summer foliage occasionally person must pas child singing must run home for most part road be deserted nearly village people be at concert must not end for at least half hour only then must roadway be full in meantime save for occasional interruption bella have solitude peace be therefore extremely ill pleased when dark figure halted at paling leaning over removed hat to reveal delicate feature of silas penny give good evening miss huxham said preacher in refined somewhat shrill voice good evening said bella coldly have not better return to concert mr penny a chairman can not leave platform have presided most of evening have recited piece said penny eagerly now on plea of feeling faint have left that hot room be here to commune with in glory of night be not beautiful miss huxham recited well known line of addison soon a shade of night prevail moon take up wondrous tale nightly to listening earth repeat story of birth did come here to recite mr penny said bella disagreeably if so must go indoors have be entertained enough evening must not have be at concert at said preacher rebukingly seeing that dear father be scarcely cold in grave be business mr penny said bella in icy tone if rebuke one must be aunt who be flaunting property of robbed in face of everyone will rebuke sister vand at proper time said silas authoritatively in meantime rebuke said bella who have risen to foot weary of conversation decline to permit interference want to rebuke cried penny eagerly wish to make smile on become spouse fair lily of valley will have always at foot have told before mr penny can not marry then still intend to wed that son of belial overflowing with insolence wine questioned preacher bitterly father murderer mr lister be perfectly innocent a happen to know can prove innocence can prove guilt retorted girl spiritedly saw enter manor on night saw man who resembled mr lister be in london can prove that be there be useless using threat mr penny for have be able to carry out must long since have seen police penny frowned who be other man asked can find out said bella impatiently be going indoors there be other man cried penny angrily why saw mr lister quite clearly must not mistake did however police will decide go to police threatened to do so before why do what say instead of trying to frighten with stage thunder silas stamped raged will find thunder real enough before have done with lister man be guilty will hang will become wife never never never bella stamped in turn will a have name of own must be glad to take of honest man girl started stared name be huxham said angrily be nothing of sort when wished to marry captain huxham supposed father told that be nameless waif whom have adopted out of charity be wholly false be true be true penny leaped fence before knew what be intention caught in arm must become wife beast villain cried girl struggling how dare got further even while word be on lip pair of very strong hand caught penny by shoulder wrenching from girl flung over fence next moment cyril held bella in arm oh dear dear sobbed utterly broken down how glad be that arrived to punish will punish more cried cyril striding towards gate said bella stopping think of good name be useless making scandal ask if what say be true what doe say questioned cyril with note of savagery in voice oh hush hush implored bella clinging to speak lower wish everyone to hear what mr penny declares what be what be ask after may be wrong still holding girl lister mindful of wish spoke in loud whisper to dusty figure on other side of fence penny have just risen sorely bruised unable to leave rival with girl loved yet lingered in roadway here said lister sharply what have be saying to miss huxham speak out dog will thrash thoroughly let go bella let go say must avoid scandal think of what might be be gasped without ending sentence fell half fainting into cyril arm then came penny chance to discharge vial of wrath for saw that lister hampered by fainting girl must not touch stepping up to paling with face distorted with anger spoke in low tone of hate say now to what will soon say to captain huxham adopted girl whom falsely say that love have position name money so if marry stop said cyril imperiously can swear to truth of wild statement miss huxham always passed a captain daughter be not miss huxham said silas insistently be miss know what can prove what say if necessary will unless unless what unless renounce so that can become wife bella heard word stood unexpectedly erect with fresh energy wrathful at penny persistency nothing will ever induce to become wife if what say be true aunt must have told mr vand be not aunt captain huxham be not father said preacher sullenly if need be can prove then do so cried cyril quickly for by doing so will remove sole barrier to marriage what do mean asked silas recoiling in sheer surprise let speak said bella guessing what lover meant mean that have held tongue cyril might have be forced to part now that know be not captain huxham daughter can marry penny looked from one face to other in chill moonlight drew own conclusion with swift intuition sharpened by hate then lister man be murderer of huxham have to prove said cyril cheerfully be not bound to incriminate know silas raised hand to heaven in mute appeal for saw that in way not entirely clear to have brought about very thing have be trying to avert enraged at blunder despairing of gaining end man timid a usually be must have sprung over fence to renew struggle with rival that many dark figure be seen coming along road apparently concert be over in spite of anger penny retained sufficient sense to decide immediately on sensible course mechanically brushed clothes bent over paling to speak with cyril to morrow said in tense whisper will be arrested on evidence pointed trembling finger at bella will be known a nameless outcast girl uttered faint cry at insult cyril must have struck man who spoke penny be prepared swerved away from fence with taunting laugh to retreat rapidly down road towards advancing throng come inside come inside said bella plucking at cyril sleeve must not be seen here with at hour mr penny will say nothing for own sake come inside until dora return be wise counsel so pair hastily retreated closed door before must be seen by sharp eye of village gossip bella ran into dining room where supper be laid sinking into chair mutely pointed to water jug lister seeing how pale be poured out glass held to lip shortly be more old self a colour returned to cheek brightness to eye be then that asked leading question do think that what mr penny say be true hope so fervently hope so replied cyril sitting down to discus matter for then can marry started stopped occurred to that penny statement might be cause of granny tunks queer remark explanation of have be prevented by durgo then again from negro action from fact mr tunks have seen so said coming in crystal obeyed so implicitly might be that durgo knew much that must only disclose at proper time of one thing cyril be certain namely that durgo be friend must do best to put thing right if lister assisted to recover trace of father jewel edwin lister be supposed to posse must wonder if penny statement be true said cyril musingly a reflected on present position of affair did seem strange to that rough sea dog a huxham undoubtedly be must have so refined daughter a thought be education said cyril looking at searchingly in light of small lamp foot hand be too delicate feature too clearly cut whole bearing too well bred to be child of such man huxham sister be plebeian be aristocrat be quite sure bella coloured at praise of beauty perhaps what mr penny say may explain why money be not left to cyril nodded if be not be daughter of course must not leave money be strange that must tell penny why what be matter bella have started to foot be looking at strangely be unwilling to suspect mr penny seeing that seems almost certain father be guilty believe that father mean captain huxham told why not be not captain huxham way to confide in anyone if have kept silent for so long certainly must not have told anyone later especially silas penny if anyone knew truth must be aunt mean mr vand hated quite sufficiently to tell be kith kin of hers did not do well what do make of business said bella slowly believe that mr penny doe know something of murder although may not have struck blow father may have be disturbed by mr penny may have taken hundred pound be certain that mr penny found paper telling be not captain huxham daughter have in possession now cyril shook head have proof of wild charge have not same believe belief be one thing certainty said lister decisively again must tell that father if indeed be guilty got much more than one hundred pound related have taken place in durgo room bella listened in silence be particularly struck with use made by negro of mr tunks believe that granny black man be in league declared know foretold coming by crystal be rubbish in instance foretold truly said cyril drily because knew beforehand simply made use of crystal to impress retorted girl do think durgo be guilty replied cyril very decidedly bewailed fact that father have not asked to get huxham out of way bella in way father managed matter might have killed old sailor during quarrel have secured jewel have gone into hiding here on continent can only wait until hear from then mystery may be solved be not so sure that father got jewel said bella after pause after be in chest in attic by durgo showing paper be durgo be not certain if huxham left jewel there dear see old skipper might probably did keep jewel in study for safety jewel be in house be sure for huxham feared lest must be stolen so planted corn used search light by way saw that used other night henry vand know how to use said bella indifferently father showed how to work on one occasion what be to be done must wait see what durgo intends to do know much that be ignorant of for father sake think will help mr penny statement cyril took in arm believe said kissing fondly so barrier between be removed thank god for said bella reverently being unstrung wept bitterly chapter xv durgo detective a have be seen durgo be ordinary man even have be white instead of black must have passed for clever member of aryan race undoubtedly strain of arab blood in sharpened intellectual faculty made ambitious to play leading part in history of tribe that member of be savage mattered very little since have be educated in lore of ruling race must raise sooner later almost to own level almost be not quite for durgo have notion that individual of tribe must be a clever a wished to be despot rule from autocratic throne one weak point in character if gratitude can be called weakness be adoration of edwin lister gentleman have undoubtedly saved life assuredly have aided to attain to present position of culture by inducing old chief to send clever son to england cyril knew what durgo in blind idolatry did not that edwin lister be not man to work for nothing wanted much more than ever gave there be chance that must abuse gratitude of durgo when negro ambition be achieved if protege revolted from complying with exorbitant demand must surely be made on generosity must speedily be reminded of what have be done for with ordinary man must have mattered little a such one must decline unreasonable exaction durgo strongest trait be gratitude be probable that in spite of clever brain european education must become mere puppet of benefactor thus very nobility of durgo nature must reduce to slavery must be ruined because possessed rarest of virtue little a cyril have seen of father knew character thoroughly being able to read by intuition a well a by observation edwin have only one god to worship be deity so congenial that egotist be most devout in religion of course durgo enslavement edwin lister tyranny have nothing to do with cyril a father son have long since gone on several way cyril liked negro swore to that if durgo aided to marry bella must stand by when edwin lister played tyrant a yet so much cyril gathered trader have not shown cloven foot must do so sooner later then cyril hoped to open durgo eye to fact that gratitude be being abused there be much to be done before affair arrived at point first necessary step to take be to discover whereabouts of edwin lister durgo have learned much from cyril something from granny tunks now be necessary that must be informed by bella of accusation of penny of doubt about preacher resolved to see durgo for herself when dora be at school watched at window of cottage for coming of negro did not even tell cyril of intention a disbelieved statement that penny have stolen certain paper be connected in way with murder that have absolutely ground for belief troubled bella very little since be very much woman knew be that penny must not have heard truth about not being be daughter from huxham be necessary to find out how came to know let alone necessity of making certain of truth cyril must have scruple in assaulting penny learning truth at sword point a be durgo being uncivilised for education must have such scruple therefore be best person to apply to must undoubtedly twist penny slender neck a must that of rabbit if must force from information likely to forward aim unless such brutal course be taken bella felt sure that penny must hold tongue in exasperation against troublesome preacher girl worst trait came uppermost durgo did not pas along road in morning bella almost despaired of seeing nearly decided to go to chequer inn memory of mr giles gossiping tongue prevented risking so much in afternoon however durgo lounged along road in lazy heavy massive fashion arrayed in rough tweed clothes looking very much like burly prize fighter luckily there be one in sight a miss ankers cottage be in solitary corner on outskirt of marshely so bella ran hatless into garden to beckon negro into cottage come in come in wish to speak to said hurriedly when stepped up to white paling glanced right left to be sure that curious eye be on durgo stared frowned a education in world famous university have not quite eradicated contempt for woman however when bella ran inside again stood beckoning in passage resolved to enter if only to learn why acted in bold way so tall be durgo so low door that have to stoop considerably to enter when in little drawing room bulked hugely a gulliver in lilliputian temple what be missy asked durgo roughly for be not inclined to waste time in saying pretty nothing to englishwoman when so much be at stake can not stay here be busy wish to help said bella going straight to point in what way durgo stared at peremptory tone wish to help on condition that help in what way asked again sat down on chair creaked under mighty weight listen said bella speaking very slowly with eye on strong black face be not of colour race yet be going to trust a cyril told about besides be working for same end be wish to find edwin lister cyril told what mr tunks discovered have right frowned durgo want woman despise woman said bella drily for may need help of one woman be own self know that be supposed to be captain huxham daughter supposed to be durgo noted way placed word at once said much for power of observation quick working of brain yes silas penny preacher know missy go on love continued bella with blush to marry must stop at nothing last night declared be not daughter of captain huxham captain huxham have told a much do believe that yes be believe be not captain huxham daughter since money be not left to believe that captain huxham told to silas penny believe bella bent forward mr penny be concerned in murder stole certain paper revealed truth durgo eye flashed saw at once value of such information can prove asked in throaty tone be just where be answered quickly wish to prove how can do question mr penny make answer force in way like to show how actually obtained information if stole paper stating fact believe must have be in room where murder be committed hour during night if so must have seen edwin lister must know where be hai durgo leaped to foot be true be probable perhaps can say if master got jewel perhaps can be certain that will not oh think will think will said durgo significantly hurt cried bella alarmed for much a disliked preacher did not wish to come to harm at hand of african semi savage a matter of fact be sorry to enlist durgo service at under circumstance there seemed to be help for will not hurt more than be necessary said durgo catching up bowler hat placing on woolly head if speaks plainly wo hurt at have helped missy will find be not ungrateful when marry son of master will be rich durgo king will make rich ended arrogantly one moment said bella detaining jewel belong to captain huxham have right to take right since never belonged to captain huxham said negro decisively father great chief kawal gave to maxwell faith from maxwell faith be stolen by huxham if faith be alive must return jewel to ask to help with expedition be dead huxham murdered stole jewel edwin lister came to get back what belongs to think have supposing find mr lister learn that have not jewel durgo rolled eye ferociously will then enter manor house by force learn where be hidden must only be handed over to police by mr vand husband henry will be better for to search how can since be not friendly with mr vand bella laughed know much more about manor house than mr vand doe assure said significantly there be manner of secret passage unknown chamber in ancient mansion if desired to enter must do so in night time by secret door hidden behind ivy at back of house then do so said durgo eagerly search for jewel not yet wait until see edwin lister learn if procured jewel by way where did father get durgo reflected for few minute have heard much talk of father treasure of jewel be part know how rich northern part of africa be in time of roman yes cyril made read gibbon history well when arab swept across northern africa looted roman city then possessed more le by goth vandal many of arab came south to nigeria brought plunder with think that jewel father gave to maxwell faith came into possession from remote ancestor who so brought can not say still be opinion be feasible idea certainly said bella musingly astonished at knowledge of negro quite forgetting that have be educated at oxford where jewel came from matter little what have to find out be where be mr penny will see man interrupted durgo quietly may lie to others will tell truth to violence warned bella anxiously durgo nodded fear police too much said with ironical grin strode out of house looking more burly defiant than ever bella have regretted employment of service what else must do when so much be at stake bella wished to marry cyril to do so desired to be certain that be not captain huxham daughter paper if wild surmise be correct must prove if what penny said be true then since cyril father have not murdered father put in confused way must be able to marry lover with clear conscience that might be son of assassin troubled very little to get way after manner of woman deeply in love must have set world on fire must have wrecked solar system in placing safety of penny in hand of semi civilised negro undoubtedly be risking life did not care so long a attained to knowledge be confident possessed will be seen that bella huxham be sunday school angel even amiable heroine of family herald novelette who never by chance doe wrong be simply average girl with good instinct brought up so far a school training be concerned in conventional way at home one have taught to discern right from wrong like ordinary healthy young animal of human race have not passed through sufficient sorrow to make inquire into truth of religion bella needed trouble to train into good brave woman be certainly getting training now made mistake a be natural considering inexperience that same evening mr silas penny be seated in shabby sitting room making note for next sunday sermon occupied lodging in lonely cottage on verge of common did so because landlady be member of little bethel congregation who boarded lodged cheaply in order to

be fence round front of cottage although there be garden of vegetable at back so sitting room window looked straight out on to purple heather golden gorse of waste land artist must have delighted in view silas have eye for anything beautiful in nature paid very little attention to changing glory of year lodging be cheap situation healthy so be perfectly satisfied on especial evening young preacher sat at red repp covered table reading bible making note be after ten o'clock landlady be asleep a be two son agricultural labourer worn out with heavy toil of day sitting room window be wide open blind be up so that cool night breeze be wafted faintly into somewhat stuffy room be crowded with unnecessary furniture silas made few note then threw down pencil sighed resting weary head on hand penny be by mean bad man be weak excitable pursuit of bella aroused worst part of nature made think say do much condemned better part of objected to great deal did tide of passion hurried away must not be checked by dyke of common sense at time be one of bitterly blamed for giving way to desire for hepzibah a called bella huxham in own weak mind sane in other way be insane on one point felt that must jeopardise chance of salvation to call wife nevertheless be sane enough to know insanity must have given much to root out fierce love be destroying life insane passion cherished for woman who must have nothing to do with led deeper deeper into mire of sin in spite of prayer cry for help unseen must hing to extricate from morass of difficulty into have plunged at time silas even doubted if god existed so futile be attempt to gain comfort guidance much a loved bella desired to win clear of unwilling influence exercised on nature vainly prayed for light whereby to know necessary mean to get rid of tormenting demon answer came relapsed into despair wondering what congregation must say if member knew unmastered temptation of inner life struggle made weak ill thin nervous deep in heart knew vaguely that god be watching over must aid at proper time must have taken own miserable life with head buried in hand silas thought thus with many groan with many bitter tear shedding of made eye burn occupied with misery did not see dark massive form glide towards open window did hear sound for durgo stepped a light footed a cat sill of window be great distance from ground big negro flung leg over sill into room in getting hastily through be so large window so small that made sliding noise a window slipped still further up silas started to foot only to see durgo completely in room facing with grim smile have come to speak with sir said negro silas turned white being haunted by fear known only to read in eye of black burglar rather guessed by wonderful intuition that fear cause of fear be known to man durgo saw look in preacher eye read thought in turn negro be not boasting when hinted that possessed certain psychic power yes said keeping burning gaze directly on miserable white man stole paper from captain huxham room did not interrupted penny wildly making clutch at breast coat pocket how dare paper be in pocket interrupted durgo advancing a noted unconscious action guessed significance give paper have paper will alarm house do so will be arrested what do mean saw master edwin lister enter manor house thought that be son cyril lister told a much from what said to miss huxham about not being daughter of sailor believe that followed master into house what took place nothing nothing swear that did not paper said durgo pointing to white hand still clutched feebly at breast pocket say that girl be not captain huxham daughter want to know whose daughter be be talking rubbish have paper be making guess believe guess be true one will give up paper must wring neck with widely open eye preacher flung against mantel piece clutched at handbell just a managed to ring feebly for hand be shaking be utterly unnerved durgo seeing that there be time to be lost sprang forward laid heavy grasp on miserable man throat ripping open jacket with other hand in le than minute have paper in hand no shouted silas made clutch at durgo thrust paper into pocket raising penny up shoulder high dashed down furiously head struck edge of fender lay unconscious durgo did not wait to see further glided out of window like snake swift silent stealthy dangerous chapter xvi paper next morning news be over village silas penny have be seized with epilepsy in falling have cut head open against old fashioned fender have just time said gossip to ring bell before catastrophe landlady being fortunately awake have rushed into room to assistance in hour have become conscious have be put to bed after giving explanation of how came by wound in head a silas be fairly popular everyone be more le sorry many be caller at cottage on common dora heard news from one of scholar retailed to friend when came home to luncheon bella turned pale when heard of affair guessed that be work of durgo reproached for having enlisted service then argued that if durgo really be responsible for preacher sickness must have appeared in miss ankers cottage in morning to explain what have taken place possibly supposing have be successful to show paper then again if be durgo work bella wondered why preacher have not denounced seemed to on assumption that penny feared to say too much lest must be questioned too closely dora certainly have more suspicion than have anyone else what story of young man be absolutely true never did look healthy said dora when meal be ended so be not surprised to hear that have epileptic fit perhaps will get over hinted bella feebly not looking at friend lest must betray dear people with epilepsy never recover rebuked dora seriously wonder that man dared to ask to marry seeing what suffered from what terrible thing to have husband with fit be sure that be fit asked bella trying to salve conscience with idea durgo have nothing to do with matter vain attempt dear be sure that hair grows on head of course be sure man explained how fell just a clutched at bell hit poor head against iron fender know dear one of old fashioned kitchen fender now out of date be mercy there be fire in grate must have be burnt to death why cousin of mine once dora went off into long wearisome tale of member of family who have suffered in same way when little old school mistress returned to duty bella sat down to consider thing on face of durgo have done nothing silas really might suffer from fit a have never fallen before a bella knew that durgo must stop at nothing to get paper believed existed began to believe that fall be by design not by accident belief taking full possession of longed feverishly to see negro to ask question although watched for quite two hour at window never appeared then a nerve be strung up nearly to snapping pitch determined to call round at cyril lodging tell of interview with black man for moment be unwilling to do a guessed that cyril must be angry still a be more le certain that durgo must tell lover always supposing paper existed have be obtained bella thought must be wiser to be first in field with story besides in case must have to confess to cyril so why not now only chance of getting at truth of matter of murder lay in herself durgo cyril working amicably together in keeping nothing back from one there be certain amount of risk in going to cyril lodging a landlady mr block be one of most notorious gossip in village must be certain to talk of visit to make unkind comment on fact of young lady choosing to visit bachelor without chaperon chaperon bella must not have since wished one else to be present during conversation with cyril third party must mean that must be unable to speak plainly knowledge of case inner knowledge be must be confined to herself lover to negro must never do to let outside world know of mean be taking to arrive at truth chaperon might easily play part of juda after a bella reflected when hurrying along road have one to consider since mattered very little what be said about so long a cyril be true be at war with aunt if indeed mr vand be aunt have friend dora there be really person whom desired to conciliate under circumstance took courage in hand with calm face with heart in mouth rapped at door of lister lodging luckily have observed from window opened door be so glad to see bella said shaking hand in conventional manner a stout form of mr block appeared at end of passage for be just coming round to propose walk on common be beautiful day said bella likewise conventional very wait until get hat stick mr block if anyone call be going to common with miss huxham very lovely sweet walk be said mr block coming nearer to see if bella be dressed in sufficiently deep mourning for presumed father a said to block if 'd only make money man like ought to make 'd be strolling on that there common dressed up a fine a nine penny there never get what want in world ai dreadful miss huxham about poor mr penny very dreadful assented bella politely then a cyril be ready went with out of gate leaving mr block looking after luckily for couple mr block have nothing to say against visit indeed be in heavy mind that cyril having failed to take bella out a promised have be called upon by young lady weary of waiting so like man soliloquised mr block standing on door step broom in hand never think never never if mr lister commences neglect afore marriage what will be when honeymoon over ah poor miss huxham what with pa dying aunt robbing a must love neglecting be miserable life will have ah well there be always grave to look forward to ending soliloquy thus cheerfully mr block entered house shut door with bang meanwhile lover quite ignorant of mr block opinion walked along village street soon emerged on to common passed cottage wherein silas penny lodged recalled episode of so called fit to cyril a have heard particular from garrulous landlady be sorry for penny said cyril glancing at cottage why asked bella nervously be such awful thing for person to have fit if 'd known must not have pitched over

edwin lister master will restore jewel expedition asked bella in surprise negro looked at lover humorously fear that there will be expedition said seriously can not rob of fortune miss faith marry friend here be happy what will do asked cyril touched by self abnegation durgo shrugged shoulder again will search out edwin lister return to africa in one way daresay can manage to get back to tribe then will measure strength education against cousin who be wrongfully chief for rest there be more to be said paper have miss faith will prove birth reveal doings of huxham there be more for to do so

white heart oh bella how strange be take home said girl faintly with white cheek can bear more at present isabella faith be name now until change to of isabella lister said cyril kissing only wept more broken down by unexpected revelation chapter xvii confession on way home from common cyril bella agreed that must be wise to say nothing about true parentage in first place must benefit one to be thus candid in second such statement must lead to question being asked might get durgo into trouble after lover argued since penny a chief party did not move in matter be useless for to fight battle more particularly when durgo have acted so generously in surrendering jewel black man have behaved in way for cyril must not have given credit few member of boasting white race must have done a much according to arrangement lover came to bella be to remain miss huxham to world until such time a edwin lister must be found truth of huxham death became known of course with jewel valued at forty thousand pound girl be quite heiress proceeded to build castle in air for advancement of cyril when became husband young man did not say much a did not wish to damp ardour privately thought that if father be in possession of jewel must not surrender easily if durgo be generous edwin lister a son knew be not since have risked neck to get treasure must certainly not hand over to girl whom did not know for mere sentimental whim that girl be to be son wife that son must benefit by sale of jewel must make difference on way back to cottage bella recovered self control spirit be wonderful relief to to learn that be not daughter of gruff old mariner whom have never liked looking back on life at bleacres bella no longer wondered that supposed father have never shown affection shuddered when recalled terrible fact that hand be red with blood on consideration however gave full credit for way in have acted towards have come to england thief murderer be true must easily have left in care of people who looked after in little croydon house bella must scarcely remember house woman who stood to in place of mother own being dead almost earliest recollection be being taken from croydon by captain huxham placed with friend of at shepherd bush until be nine year old then lived with huxham for few year ultimately be sent to hampstead boarding school whence returned to bleacres at age of twenty thus captain have educated have looked after in own coarse way have proved to be generous to certain extent badly a have acted in robbing of heritage might have behaved infinitely worse by heritage bella meant jewel with property income left to mr coppersley now mr vand have nothing to do no longer grudged woman what have schemed to get be probable that have mr vand not so schemed huxham for very shame might have given adopted daughter nefarious earnings must not be hard on captain huxham said bella when cyril brought to gate for in own strange way acted kindly be glad that did not leave anything a be certain earned money in shady manner kind of captain kidd assented lister gravely agree with old ruffian have soft spot in heart for dear said bella shaking head must not say that exactly suffered from remorse therefore looked out when came to england did not find affectionate father by mean be just in grim way even generous grudged nothing save ready money wonder if mr vand know truth said that did not replied lister quietly be inclined to think so too tyrant like mr vand must have be only too glad to tell unpleasant truth unpleasant why be delightful truth unpleasant from mr vand point of view since have known that be not brother daughter in way must claim money bella shrugged shoulder be very very glad that have got money much good may do be thankful that captain huxham did not reveal truth about to now need never know matter very little whether know not retorted cyril can not gain possession of jewel be clearly yours how be going to gain possession of asked bella lingering cyril looked hopelessly up to blue sky heaven only know first thing to be done be to find father see if be in possession now that be parting bella feel better mind telling that think father will give up if indeed have to son future wife father be quite unbiassed by sentimental consideration said cyril very dryly what hold keep however there be plenty of time to talk of matter when meet father meanwhile what will do bella shook bundle of paper carried be going to bedroom to read said seriously wish to learn everything that concern true parentage may have relative know if have said lister emphatically only trust that will leave severely alone care for relative ask everything give nothing well said bella smiling for have quite recovered spirit so long a have need sister cousin aunt good bye dear kiss someone may be looking on of everyone know that be engaged doe do to emphasise engagement in public said girl seriously ran into cottage at door turned will tell read in paper called out vanished while cyril returned home to think over strange turn event have taken thing be strange for in striving to solve one mystery have solved in seeking for huxham assassin have found true father of bella dora have not yet returned so bella in seclusion of bedroom felt relieved did not wish a yet to share secret even with little school mistress good friend a amiable woman have proved to be locking door sat down unrolled bundle consisted of many sheet of foolscap appeared to be kind of rough diary kept by jabez huxham when be in africa script be in crooked painful writing be legible enough after practice bella managed to read fairly easily seated on bed perused what be set down found reading extremely interesting sheet seemed to have be torn from manuscript book for diary commenced ended abruptly dealt entirely with maxwell faith doings old pirate have evidently ripped page from diary kept have placed in carved chest mr tunks have found in attic there also according to durgo story jewel have be stored so apparently huxham have used chest have belonged to faith a repository for concerned dead trader edwin lister must scarcely have gone to garret to seek chest get jewel since did not know way about old mansion be therefore evident that huxham have kept jewel in study safe have removed chest containing torn out leaf to attic afterwards have apparently placed paper in safe also where penny have probably found bella did not pause to think out matter be to much interested in story be set down huxham stated abruptly that met maxwell faith at calabar have be engaged by to transport certain good up cross river nigeria a far a ogrude when be to be taken in canoe up to yahe on stream of name good be for kawal durgo father with whom faith appeared to have have many dealing faith huxham so writer said got on very well former told latter much about past trader declared that be son of wealthy huntingdon quaker have be disowned by family by society of friend because have married lady who be roman catholic there be one daughter who have be born in london have cost mother life faith said that have placed daughter isabella with friend of at croydon have come to nigeria to make money for from what bella must gather father appeared to have be desperately fond of afterwards huxham faith parted met again in hinterland at chief town of kawal again became friendly then trader told huxham that because have supplied chief with gun ammunition have proved friendship in many way have received ancient jewel to amount of forty thousand pound be going home to daughter with money at part of diary portion of manuscript be torn away apparently that dealt with murder of faith by story commenced abruptly again with statement that writer be going to england with earnings with jewel intending to seek out faith little daughter adopt huxham gave reason for doing so in diary bella reading between line guessed that man be overcome with remorse strange thing for so hardened sinner a huxham undoubtedly be then came hasty note of huxham fear lest must be robbed for sake of jewel reference to unknown man who be dogging step ogrude afikpa obubra calabar be town mentioned a having be scene of adventure with man whose name be not given afterwards hasty note detailed finding of faith little daughter at croydon adoption by writer removal to shepherd bush few remark be made relative to fear of huxham of determination to find place in country where must be safe from pursuit final page be torn off in middle bella must read more putting away bundle in box reflected on what have read be easy for to find quaker relative a name address of family be given evidently same relative be rich very stiff necked in quaker tradition bella however thought very little of at moment brain be employed in wondering if huxham have met with death at hand of unknown man who have dogged footstep in nigeria without doubt man knew of existence of jewel huxham have murdered faith to get might be that determined to get jewel having traced huxham to england after long year have killed so gained end man bella asked question earnestly be man edwin lister resolved to tell cyril to give paper to read must decide better than probably durgo must throw much light on subject there be doubt that huxham have bought solitary farm have planted corn thickly have mounted search light on roof of bleacres so that might defend from robbery possibly from death precaution have be in vain have be struck down at last in very fortress by edwin lister bella felt certain that a edwin lister have be many year in nigeria have be close friend of kawal must be unknown man to whom huxham have so often referred lister be assassin there must be doubt on point very thoughtfully girl locked up paper descended to drawing room to wait for return of dora greatly wished to speak to friend about what have discovered such confidence be not to be thought of a many thing have to be done first until edwin lister be discovered bella felt that must have to be silent thought on subject be brought to abrupt conclusion when

difficult in way now be gone be gone assure be gone what be gone love for desire mad infatuation like a friend miss faith will always like a friend can never never worship again in way did thank heaven for said bella fervently knew more than did silas how change have come about be evident that blow on head have suddenly rearranged idea up to ten o'clock last night loved madly despairingly must have risked soul to gain hand since fell passed hand across forehead in bewildered manner everything have changed for better bella assured come think anything more about matter have rung bell for tea rung bell also last night brought in mr queen very fortunately might have bled to death miss faith why do call miss faith asked bella abruptly because be miss faith said preacher lifting haggard face to own in surprise did not black man tell how do know have anything to do with black man have seen mr lister with saw three talking on common oh miss faith know how have followed spied on man flushed with shame dismay did listen asked bella abruptly did not fall so low a followed watched why because loved be over now will never follow watch again be glad that black man threw down last

considered to be considerably worse than jezebel in stoutness be compared to late mr manning notable murderess to face many be agreeable usually be not received with best grace finally towards evening returned to manor house to report on triumph crossing boundary channel saw boat husband have lately bought be narrow comfortable craft of light build water way be quite broad enough to permit of being

stained figure of murdered brother appear like banquo spectre outside twilight gradually deepened to luminous darkness although have finished tea did not feel inclined to move about gloomy passage again again wished that henry must return at nine o'clock nerve be still shaky felt that must not stand dining room longer ringing bell took lamp in hand told sarah who entered speedily to take other two woman proceeded to drawing room mr vand having pulled down blind ordered sarah to bring work sit beside servant be only too pleased to obey for next half hour two sat in pleasant gossiping confabulation mr vand knitting silk tie for husband sarah trimming wonderful hat with aggressively brilliant flower there be noise a wind have dropped everything be intensely still mr vand sarah

on ground floor at one part there be shaft leading to passage on first floor up be possible to scramble by notch cut in wall bella have mind to ascend to upper story linger for chance of escape a cyril waited at boundary channel be possible that might come into contact with mr vand who must be furiously hunting therefore judged best to leave house gain corn path before mr vand must intercept with scheme in mind bella ran along passage until came to door turned on central pivot twisted slipped like eel through opening to find in kind of tiny chamber groping round soon discovered hasp of closed door skilfully manipulated door narrow one somewhat high swung open girl be outside in quiet corner at back of house hidden fairly well by projecting buttress screen of ivy clothed manor wall at point door be concealed behind screen so that existence have never be suspected bella have discovered exit from inside have cut round ivy masked door so that must get open of course cut ivy have more le withered even so no one guessed that there be door behind brownish oblong night be dark warm silent bella stole along footpath ran between house tall rustling stalk of corn several time paused thinking heard noise everything be still speedily turned corner of mansion apparently mr vand be not on hunt yet perhaps be busy with search light have asked husband to use however might be bella saw that course be clear stealing round to front door found to be closed sped like antelope down winding corn path led to boundary channel just a reached top of be prepared to start down beam of electric light struck into dark sky huxham have rigged up light on flat roof between sloping tile vand have transferred to quarter deck be slung round chimney thus be enabled to sweep whole horizon without being interrupted by tall roof of manor beam swung round here there pointing like great finger finally settled on corn path on bella dark figure running for dear life from mansion girl heard vand shout a espied heard also front door opening a mr vand rushed in pursuit mr vand like hamlet be stout scant of breath with will in world urged by venomous hatred must not gain on detested niece who ran like atlanta search beam revealed path plainly showing flying figure of bella with mr vand panting in vindictive pursuit towards end of path near boundary channel bella called softly breathlessly cyril cyril mr vand be following hide hide at moment beam struck boundary channel revealed white clothed figure of young lister rested for moment there then dropped back to aid step of mr vand cyril seized chance of friendly darkness a bella ran into arm dragged into standing corn in le than moment be lying distance from path amongst crushed stalk while mr vand blundered past running unsteadily if vand have kept beam on bella lover must not have be able to hide having be forced to give light to stout wife two be enabled to escape must hear mr vand puffing panting like grampus a searched round round in cyril arm on cyril breast bella felt perfectly safe in spite of position of near presence of enemy be bubbling over with laughter mr vand crossed boundary channel finding one on hither side concluded that bella have escaped returned slowly a vand have now shut off beam for also have seen that search be vain stumbled up path in very bad temper a sigh groan died away darkness gathered around cyril bella rose gliding back to verge of boundary channel crossed rapidly in few minute be on way to marshely what doe mean dear asked cyril when be quite safe bella told about adventure chapter xx master magician next morning dora being at school a usual bella received cyril durgo in miss ankers tiny drawing room to discus position of affair with regard to huxham mystery in negro opinion be no longer mystery for after hearing bella account of granny tunks utterance while in trance unhesitatingly pronounced henry vand guilty on what evidence asked cyril who like bella have small belief in manifestation of unseen evidence that granny said that did say returned durgo quietly that evidence must not be accepted in court of law remarked bella be aware of have not be to oxford for nothing missy give clue will follow up afternoon will see mr tunks question if really know anything said cyril after pause will prove that trance statement be by design from practical knowledge be sure be said bella emphatically fancied that a granny did not see second set of paper durgo got from mr penny that did not know name of maxwell faith father now remember that in first set found delivered to durgo father name be also mentioned also number value of jewel talk be of jewel of murder of real father by huxham said durgo drily be not in first set of paper be only lightly referred to in second set be strange said cyril reflectively doubt think so said negro calmly a disbelieve that ca see prove know otherwise durgo argued cyril surprised at assumption have be to oxford surely must have rid yourself of barbarous african superstition call superstition because know esoteric meaning there be such thing a magic white black magic pshaw durgo shrugged shoulder of course never argue with unbeliever cyril lister said indifferently wise men came from east remember europe be indebted to east for most of civilisation not to africa africa have have ancient civilisation also in time of atlanteans be useless talking of such matter say be that there be certain natural law when known can enable anyone to part what call spirit from body when spiritual eye be open much can be seen that be difficult to prove on physical plane understand what mean by plane grumbled lister quite so must be useless for to explain fact beyond imagining exist have time must prove much to mr tunks be what call clairvoyant when in trance state can see well heard say what saw miss huxham bella be also sceptical must have read first set of paper probably did since woman be animal filled with curiosity said durgo good humouredly mean to say that granny tunks be entirely genuine there be good deal of humbug about a there be about romany tribe may have known about jewel even real father name did not know about murder mr tunks have small portion of clairvoyant power doe not act at time when fails resort to trickery like spiritualist suggested cyril exactly assented negro with decision in phenomenon connected with unseen there be great measure of truth charlatan spoil whole business by resorting to trickery when power fail may say that spiritual power act always since in great measure be ignorant of law govern enough of discussion seek to convince will see mr tunks afternoon gain from actual proof of vand guilt fancied that believed father to be guilty said cyril so did if be must not mind since huxham be rogue from what miss faith miss huxham interposed bella hastily until mystery be cleared up very good well from what miss huxham overheard be inclined to think that vand murdered old sailor aided by wife for what reason supplied miss huxham so that might get money what about penny confession said cyril might have committed deed no have reason to kill old man who be on side in matter of marriage with miss huxham here besides if penny be guilty certainly must not have composed what did assuredly must not have produced one hundred pound stole now that madness for miss huxham be past penny have behaved like rational being will do best to assist in solving mystery durgo paused then turned to white man cyril lister put advertisement into several london paper week ago yes did so without telling a hoped to surprise with letter from father telling of whereabouts how do know saw telegraph yesterday also daily mail said durgo nodding approvingly did well have have answer if have must have seen said cyril wrinkling brow a always did when be perplexed what can have become of durgo struck large hand together in despair fear master edwin lister be dead said mournfully why asked bella lover simultaneously miss huxham repeated to that granny tunks in trance said that knife lying on floor when cripple entered to kill huxham be already bloody ca see see what that if knife be already bloody huxham must have killed master edwin lister then be killed in turn by vand cripple cyril looked impatient be black magic rubbish talk of well then if master father be alive have jewel why doe not write to to know can trust even advertisement have failed durgo looked gloomy heart misgives sadly arose abruptly meet at 'chequers cyril lister will tell learn from mr tunks ca come also to see yes if like perhaps will be able to dispel disbelief regarding occult power posse be that why mr tunks call master yes recognised that have higher power than when first met so be enabled to make get paper do think must have done so unless have controlled not even for fifty pound be taking to to day can make better market out of vand wife know guilt can not prove guilt perhaps said negro indifferently good day departed in usual abrupt style after bidding cyril meet at three o'clock at hut of so called witch lover looked at one do think of cyril asked bella timidly really know seem to be involved in web through can not break durgo certainly seems to be very strange being in spite of disbelief in existence of occult power be inclined to think that know strange thing look like negro talk act like white man indeed white man must be so unselfish a to surrender jewel to a durgo have done puzzle said bella thoughtfully also however best thing to be done will be to leave matter in hand in one way will learn truth then can get back jewel marry do think father have jewel cyril dear said frowning ca be sure now that father be alive begin to believe that there may be something in granny trance after since hinted at father death at huxham hand terrible a may seem added lister turning slightly pale with emotion must rather think that be dead than live to be called murderer of jabez huxham must like to come to said folding bella in strong young arm a son of man whose hand be free from blood better for father to be dead than criminal two talked on matter for time until confidence be ended by entrance of dora hungry for dinner then cyril took leave promising to return tell bella took place in mr tunks hut being anxious girl made very poor meal be scolded by dora who little knew what be at stake dora supplied one unconscious piece of information surprised friend think mr mr vand be going away for trip said carelessly what do mean asked bella

wife might be at event be stronger rosamund vand be mere tool in hand be on point of going to cyril lodging to warn durgo of projected departure of manor house inhabitant on reflection concluded to wait until returned from mr tunks hut after vands must not leave marshely before night fall must have to pas through village on way to far distant railway station if necessary must thus be intercepted

much of durgo power over granny that sending spirit to manor be strange believe that did must have done so insisted cyril a durgo did not know that vands be leaving granny distinctly stated that be in hearing also if find that jewel be in small portmanteau marked with initial m f can be certain that spirit really did travel be f repeated bella dreamily be father initial maxwell faith so be humph there be something in business after bella do really think anyone can separate spirit from body lister reflected see why not after a st paul say be composed of spirit soul body so in certain case one may become detached from other remember looked thoughtfully up to cloudy sky remember reading in magazine of boat load of people being saved owing to one of transferring spirit to passing ship leaving written instruction in cabin where ship be to steer to oh cyril be impossible dear said drily can see log of very ship containing account of incident at somerset house however have time to discus

lover yes edwin lister master have disappeared be dead old sailor certainly may have killed master on other hand a believe vand murdered huxham probably murdered edwin lister also howsoever may be can prove murder so be not advisable to bring police into matter must be safer said cyril uneasily feared lest durgo barbaric instinct must be aroused against couple at manor house must not be safer retorted negro while police be debating searching vands must be getting out of kingdom must not stop besides have jewel be certain of from what granny tunks saw when loosened spirit once vands got news of police being on track must hide jewel must never find want jewel for miss huxham a before leave england wish to see happily married to cyril lister here be least can do for father son if

objected to cyril ordering about have granny really possessed power laid claim to must have blighted fresh youth on spot a be simply muttered curse on what regarded a impertinence went indoors cyril lighted pipe kept eye on distant mass of manor house be revealed blackly when lightning flashed across ocean of grain tore furious wind making rock like unquiet sea flash after flash darted across livid sky now then came sudden boom of thunder hour upon hour passed until watcher almost lost count of time within cottage be quiet although at interval must hear querulous voice of mr tunks shrilly scolding romany girl lister began to grow impatient a dreaded lest bella must have fallen into clutch of vands who must certainly show mercy be in mind to leave post see for have occurred suddenly long clear beam smote through darkness of night sprang to foot have left house muttered cyril thrusting pipe into pocket what be to be done now lightning be not quite so frequent so vivid beam of search light have full fair play a lightning ceased thunder became silent deluge of rain descended on thirsty earth on strong wing wind brought rain tropical down pour almost blotted out haggard moon now showed between driving cloud through steady beam of search light must be seen straight arrow of rain vast corn field hissed a heavy drop descended here there swung ray of light evidently looking for fugitive a did not come to rest cyril guessed that bella have not yet descried flying couple rain be so incessant wind so strong that be angered to think how bella on high altitude of quarter deck be exposed to fury suddenly a sometimes happens in furious storm there came lull in wind rain perfect silence ensued cyril straining ear heard soft dip of oar a peered towards black gulf of water way running past hut ray from manor house became steady finger of light pointed straight to boundary channel cyril heard wild shriek ran down to bank coming along stream saw light boat in mr vand huddled up at end in shawl vand be rowing with great care when beam revealed doings lost caution rowed with desperation again came drench of rain almost blotting out landscape ray of light still picked out guilty couple following course of boat steadily like avenging angel sword row henry row hard shrieked mr vand crouching in stern of boat steering down narrow channel a best must will soon be safe row hard dear row hard stop cried cyril from bank mr vand must wait here until police come police yelled terrified woman face be pearly white in brilliant search light row henry stop lister whipped out revolver with have be careful to provide if stop vand will shoot levelled cripple be too desperate to obey bent again to oar brought willop sweeping right under cyril foot then before young man must conjecture what intended to do stood up in rocking boat swung up oar with evident intention of striking man with revolver into water lister dodged skilfully a oar came crashing viciously past ear fired at random mr vand shrieked husband cursed a shot rang out there came answering cry from near distance into glare of search light bounded durgo naked save for loin cloth black a pit furious a devil who life therein showing white teeth like of wild animal raced up to boat without moment hesitation flung on figure of vand a stood up next moment light craft be overturned durgo with vands be struggling in water at same moment beam of search light suddenly vanished leaving everyone in complete darkness rain driven by triumphant wind deluged field chapter xxii mr vand repentance afterwards cyril when questioned must never clearly recollect what took place vand oar have missed head have struck right shoulder with considerable force so that revolver shot have gone wide of intended mark when bella shut off beam cyril wondered at time why did so everything be dark confused what with gloom rain curse from vand durgo who be struggling in water shriek of mr tunks added to of half drowned woman cyril felt head whirl also blow from oar have confused became sick faint for moment granny tunks with commendable forethought have brought out bullseye lantern must have stolen from policeman

wretched woman out thinking be about to be arrested fought like wild cat must have forced half dazed young man into water again that mr tunks brought chunk of wood with considerable force down on head what devil did do for gasped cyril furiously have killed old fool what do care deary cried granny shrilly 'd kill if must for master want killed curse tottered down to boundary channel while cyril carried inanimate form of mr vand into hut here laid on floor hastily bidding romany girl attend hurried out again be dead of oh master dead yelled granny tunks with lantern raised stood on bank peering into water there be scarcely enough light to see what be taking place sound have ceased however only drench of rain must be heard even a granny spoke romany girl anxious to see what be taking place darted out of cottage with kind of torch consisting of tow at end of stick steeped in kerosene flared redly flung crimson glare on water way flung also scarlet light on body of durgo cripple lay half in half out of water fast locked together in death grip there be wound apparent on body so cyril conjectured that in struggle have be drowned durgo mighty arm be clasped tightly around slender body of cripple vand lean hand be clutching negro throat with fierce resolution be quite dead even in death cyril although tried must not drag apart that so delicate man a vand must have contrived to drown powerful negro seemed incredible to cyril soon saw that to kill durgo cripple have be willing to sacrifice probably have dragged durgo under water having grip on man throat have squeezed life out of with madman despairing force weak have confounded strong on occasion in most pronounced manner meanwhile granny tunks be bewailing loss of master sharp featured romany girl echoed cry scream of brought out luke who appeared at fire lighted door of hut looking much better than cyril expected to be seeing how severe have be last illness have something in hand in flaring light of torch lister

examine tunks in fact when door opened young constable appeared in mighty state of excitement sir cried to superior officer mr vand have escaped escaped cried inspector in voice of thunder yes sir dutton be lying drugged in hut old woman have be stunned mr vand gipsy girl be gone chapter xxiv remarkable discovery next morning there be great sensation in village of marshely a in way event of previous night leaked out certainly account of be more le garbled one appeared to know who be responsible for much of truth became public property that vand negro prince who have be stopping at chequer be dead that mr vand have fled to escape arrest that police be in possession of bleacres later in afternoon became known that vand have killed captain huxham for sake of certain jewel villager be greatly astonished when heard from what source be not known that man have be killed one save silas penny have seen edwin lister enter manor penny have presumed until informed that man be cyril so one knew that person be missing now appeared that man who be murdered by vand have committed crime previous to own death what have done with body one knew police must find trace of same in spite of effort inspector inglis called at miss anker cottage in morning interviewed bella lover from heard whole tale be greatly astonished by recital under circumstance be inclined to take jewel into official custody bella refused to give up undoubtedly be property left to by father maxwell faith inglis admitted so did not press point afterwards inspector examined silas penny heard from much same story a have told bella preacher be lying on bed of sickness a blow on head many worry have be through of late nearly gave brain fever of course inglis told a much must have reported at once death of huxham a have seen body a penny have not beheld blow struck police must hing admonish silas stated that in one point of story when confessed to bella have be wrong be after seeing edwin lister enter manor a thought then cyril have rushed away in direction of common in vain attempt to rid of troublesome thought when returned mr mr vand be in kitchen a luke proved penny be thus enabled to enter house undoubtedly guilty pair have left front door open so blame might be cast upon outsider on possible burglar for instance when heard noise of penny flight found money gone be quite determined to place blame on robber mr vand confessed later although at time of robbery have not dreamed burglar be talented young preacher whom so greatly admired guilty woman be missing for day on inquiry being made appeared that romany girl bribed by mr vand to assist flight have made cup of tea for constable a dutton be wet cold drank tea only too willingly never suspecting that be drugged turned out to be dosed with laudanum fell into deep sleep granny tunks a stated on reviving have attempted to stay flight of mr vand romany girl latter have promptly knocked down with very chunk of wood with mr tunks have struck half drowned woman in way granny sin came home to inglis found on detail of motor car being reported by cyril who have heard from mr vand use have be made of same advertised for car in neighbourhood speedily be called upon by public chauffeur who drove for hire man confessed very frankly that vand have engaged car to wait for wife on high road to pierside that thinking that nothing be wrong have done so vand have paid well driver merely thought be eccentric whim of rich man vand appeared have engaged car in london from stand in trafalgar square when mr vand left hut romany girl have rowed to swamp in boat have brought for removal of luke to caravan woman have then crossed marshy ground to high road making excuse for non appearance of husband have be driven to london driver who have already received money dropped in piccadilly that a confessed be last saw of inspector inglis be very angry with man pointed out that must have suspected that couple be flying from justice from fact of large sum of money paid on account of strange place where be arranged that car must wait man exonerated completely in end be permitted to go free a police must not do anything after chauffeur who did not look particularly intelligent might have acted in good faith however point be that mr vand dropped in piccadilly have vanished entirely have ample money a be proved that have drawn fifty pound in gold from bank although have fled from hut with only dripping dress wore there must be difficulty in obtaining fresh disguise police advertised in paper with handbill nothing must be heard of woman have vanished a completely a though earth have opened swallowed strangely enough be from mr vand solicitor that first news came of doings timson be lawyer name came down to pierside to see inspector inglis on being shown into inspector office broke out abruptly sir said timson who be mild faced spectacled yellow haired man have communication to make to about respected client mr rosamund vand if will hear respectable eh questioned officer ironically perhaps know mr mr referred to card mr timson that respectable client be wanted for complicity in murder of brother sir said mr timson again firmly client respected client added with emphasis assured that have nothing to do with commission of crime be in dead faint in kitchen when husband in moment of passion struck down captain huxham so say because be to benefit to say so mr timson man who saw murder committed swears that be most deliberate affair be only done for sake of certain jewel deliberate not mr inspector interrupted meek little man respected client have nothing to do with afterwards held tongue for sake of husband for sake also paid blackmail to man who saw crime committed can argue point said inglis drily when see mr vand be doubtless aware of whereabouts said timson coolly be not said have seen after murder be committed fancy hinted saw said timson quite calmly on day following flight from hut on marsh alighted in piccadilly walked about street for rest of night afterwards went to quiet hotel have brush wash up then called on did not detain when knew knew nothing have known that be flying from justice certainly must have urged to surrender news of terrible doings in marshely have not reached london be not in paper until following day grant that yes yes 'buts at mr inspector said timson who seemed firm enough in spite of meek aspect client confessed to that husband have be drowned that have murdered brother in fit of passion because captain huxham intended to turn sister out of door alter will on account of secret marriage that motive may have have weight said inglis quietly fancy sight of jewel made vand murder brother in law did mr vand call to tell snapped timson whose meekness be giving way called to make will make will in whose favour see reason why must not tell said lawyer although never reveal professional secret will tell so that may see how have misjudged client made will in favour of miss isabella faith faith ah knew then that girl be not niece yes did not tell that did inquire did be to make rather instruct to draw up will leaving bleacres property five hundred year inherited from late captain huxham to miss faith a token of repentance for having misjudged now cried timson rising wrathfully respected client be misjudged come to clear character see how will clear character said inglis coolly from mere fact that made daresay have committed suicide impossible impossible think be very probable indeed mr timson mr vand can not get out of england a port railway station be watched there be full description of appearance posted everywhere unless want to get long sentence for complicity in most brutal murder will have to commit suicide tell be innocent can tell that be not accomplice after fact wife be not bound to give evidence against husband inspector inglis rose with fatigued air be not here to argue on point of law with mr timson ask be if know where respected client be laid sneering emphasis on last word said timson taking up hat bid good day what lawyer said be evidently correct for although office be watched by police must not be proved that be in communication with missing woman whereabouts of mr vand became more of mystery than ever inglis told bella of good fortune of course until mr vand be dead must not benefit there seemed to be chance of proving woman death even though inspector firmly held to opinion that have committed suicide meantime timson went on to marshely to look after client property seeing that corn be ripe arranged with number of labourer under overseer whom must trust that must be reaped immediately thus happened that four day after mr vand disappearance when cyril came to tell bella about inquest be able to inform that solitary farm land be about to be reaped might go there in evening to look said bella dear must think that manor be hateful to well be even if do inherit from mr vand can never live there cyril want to come with evening a have kind of idea that body of mr vand grew pale shuddered may be found amidst corn cyril started back astonished dear girl must be mad be not cyril think of how be being hunted how person be described everywhere while port station be watched believe that poor woman went to see lawyer so a to prove sorrow for having misjudged by making heiress that then returned to die corn do think be dead there perhaps yes perhaps granny tunks be still in hut be very avaricious mr vand have money may have bribed granny to bring food while lay hid among corn hiding place said lister who nevertheless be much struck with what bella be saying very good one place where one must think of looking think how thick corn be growing one ever enters that scarlet coated scarecrow stand sentinel over believe cyril mr vand have be hiding there wish to come with evening have started to reap corn by order of mr timson if mr vand be there will in end be discovered let find save get out of kingdom will bring within reach of law care said bella quite recklessly after have nothing to do with crime only kept silent to shield husband want to help poor thing must aid to do so bella never liked what have got to do with cried girl passionately nature did not suit one perhaps behaved rather harshly towards meant well remember cyril have made amends by leaving must have be mine have really be captain huxham daughter cyril nodded admit that have done best to repent said after pause must not judge too harshly will come help to escape yes wo be easy will do best be own dear boy said girl kissing now what about inquest verdict of death by drowning have be brought in said cyril quickly think if can get mr vand away everything concerning huxham mystery will be at end wo put whole story in paper cyril inglis will edit be to be given to reporter journalist will say a little a possible about matter be known that huxham be murdered by vand in absence of father body cognisance can be taken of alleged murder believe that father have be murdered know ca tell tunks say so suppose must tell such story against unless be true body have be found until body of missing man be found be presumed in law that be alive cyril shrugged shoulder who can tell truth will be made manifest in time said bella firmly father father body will be found where be durgo henry to be buried in marshely churchyard to morrow will go to funeral be sorry for durgo in spite of skin be real white man when be under earth bella think have better sell jewel marry take trip round world in order to forget terrible business be quite glad be over be not over yet insisted bella father have to be found mr vand must be discovered body said cyril significantly turned away must not be thought that young lister be callous father have never be one to moreover son have seen so little of that be a strange to young man a have be to boy cyril deeply regretted gulf be between a be of truly affectionate nature father always have repelled least sign of tenderness only looked on cyril a one to be made use of borrowed from on occasion have succeeded in getting jewel have aided durgo to regain chiefdom must have remained in nigeria a kind of savage prime minister without casting thought to son whether father be dead alive cyril knew that must have to repay one thousand pound have borrowed to cover father delinquency in respect of forged cheque how must such son a cyril lister respect love such parent a edwin of same name nevertheless cyril although said little to bella be very anxious to ascertain fate of father seemed very certain that tunks have seen murdered by evil hearted old sailor what that scoundrel have done with body must not be discovered in vain police dug in cellar of manor house tapped wall ripped up floor dragged boundary channel body of edwin lister must not be found a one have seen save tunks penny bella who have mistaken for cyril police began to believe that edwin father be myth cyril must not make inglis see otherwise for urging confession if man be alive why doe turn up asked inglis if dead why ca find body there be answer to cyril gave up father fate a riddle when walked in cool of evening towards solitary farm immediate object of visit be to find if mr vand dead alive be concealed in thickly standing corn bella strolled by side lover have taken no one into particular confidence not even dora walked towards well known house up corn path anxiously looking right left then cyril uttered exclamation of annoyance what bother said much
